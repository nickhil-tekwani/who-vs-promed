The Santa Fe Ministry of Health said it has detected 32 cases of
leptospirosis so far this year [2010] and that there were 6 deaths
reported from this disease. The Directorate of Promotion and Health
Prevention reported that since [3 Jan 2010], "32 people were reported
with positive [laboratory tests for] leptospirosis and 34 were
diagnosed as probable cases of the disease." Also, "there were
reports of 6 deaths with a clinical diagnosis compatible with
leptospirosis and 29 [suspected] cases were ruled out," the agency reported.

The director of the Provincial Promotion and Health Prevention
Department, Andrea Uboldi, said that "in the Santa Fe region, 18
positive cases, 16 probable cases, 4 deaths with clinically
compatible illness were reported, and 17 [suspected] cases were
discarded, while in Venado Tuerto there was one positive case, one
probable, and another [suspected case] was ruled out."

"The situation is somewhat calm," she said, and emphasized that
"these cases are not presently occurring but rather they are cases
that emerged in mid-January [2010], when heavy rains and flooding
occurred with the cresting of the Parana River."

Uboldi recommended to the population "the importance of avoiding
contact with stagnant water, that it is not recommended to bathe or
swim in [stagnant water], and to use boots and gloves when working in
regions of high risk." She also advised "to keep yards and gardens
clean and remove garbage and place it in containers with tight fitting lids."

[Leptospirosis is a spirochetal infection that is distributed widely
throughout the world in warm climates. It is caused by exposure to
_Leptospira_ bacteria, in fresh (not salty) water, wet soil, or
vegetation that has been contaminated by the urine of chronically
infected animals. Leptospirosis affects humans and a variety of
animals including dogs, cattle, pigs, and rodents.

_Leptospira_ enter the body through open sores or wounds in the skin,
or through mucous membranes. People can also contract leptospirosis
by drinking water that has been contaminated by the urine of an
infected animal. Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls,
flooding with fresh water, and rodent infestation.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors
or with animals, for example, workers in wet agricultural settings
(such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers,
trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fish workers, dairy
farmers, or military personnel. Also leptospirosis is a risk during
recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming,
canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve
exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine
from leptospire-infected animals, as well as household exposure to
infected pet animals or rodents
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/leptospirosis_g.htm>) in
rural and urban settings
(<http://www.annals.org/content/125/10/794.full> and
<http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/9/1227>).

Leptospirosis has been reported in Santa Fe province before,
associated with flooding after heavy rains
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12415894>) and infestation with
infected rodents (<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12038040> and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12900160>). The numbers of cases
of leptospirosis in Santa Fe reported currently in the 1st paragraph
of the news release above differs from the numbers reported in the
2nd paragraph. Perhaps one paragraph is referring to the province and
the other to the city of Santa Fe, or perhaps to different periods of time.

Santa Fe City is the capital of province of Santa Fe, Argentina, in
northeastern Argentina
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_Argentina>). It is the 9th
largest city in Argentina and lies near the junction of the Parana
and Salado rivers. Santa Fe City (and its suburban area) has a
population of about half million inhabitants (2001), a significant
proportion of whom occupy the floodplains of the Salado and the
Parana rivers. Historically, intense rainfall and the rise of the
Parana River periodically produce severe flooding, affecting the city
of Santa Fe
(<http://www.disasterscharter.org/web/charter/activation_details?p_r_p_1415474252_assetId=ACT-150>).

Venado Tuerto is a city in the southwest of the province of Santa Fe,
322 km (200 mi) from Santa Fe city. It has about 70 000 inhabitants
(2001) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venado_Tuerto>).
