In Overijssel [province, Netherlands], 2 Municipal Healthcare Services (GGD) in the region of Twente have reported a rise in cases of whooping cough. Nurses are warning those vaccinated that their cough might not be a nasty cold after all, RTV Oost reports.

The GGD Twente speaks of a steep rise in the number of reports. In 2013, there were a total of 175 cases. Halfway through [2014], the numbers are already at 275.

The GGD in IJsselland is also seeing explosive numbers. Over the whole of last year [2013], there were just more than 100. In 2014, there have been 125 cases of whooping cough already.

Whooping cough is caused by a bacterium [_Bordetella pertussis_], and is very contagious. People showing symptoms of whooping cough can transfer the sickness to others for up to 4 weeks.

In adults, the sickness resembles a nasty cold. Young children who have not yet been vaccinated are much more vulnerable to the sickness, however. Their sinuses can be blocked to the point of respiratory arrest. [This last sentence makes no sense. It may refer to apnea (respiratory arrest) that can occur following a paroxysm of coughing in very young children with pertussis, which has been attributed to "failure of self-rescue breathing at the end of a paroxysm of coughing or to profound vagal stimulation even before a clinical cough episode" (http://www.jhasim.com/files/articlefiles/pdf/ASIM_Issue_5_5A_p444_449.pdf). - Mod.ML]

This outbreak of whooping cough has no clear cause. "There just has to be a primary school with one sick parent or child, and it breaks out in the entire village," infectious disease control nurse Judith Keizers of GGD Twente tells RTV Oost.

Keizers wants to call attention to the fact that people who have been vaccinated are not necessarily immune to the sickness, and that it is not simply a harmless cough. "For adults, whooping cough is only very irritating, [but] young children and infants can be seriously affected by this bacteria. By asking for attention, we hope to protect these children."

[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination.
