Unknown Illness Hits Special Olympics
---------------------------------------------
Several athletes, fans and family members attending the Special
Olympics National Games have been hit with flu-like symptoms [viral
gastroenteritis]. Iowa Department of Public Health Director Mary
Hansen said that at about 11 a.m., Story County Public Health
officials notified the state health department saying that people
from the games were experiencing nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and
they asked for the state health department's help. The state health
department sent a team to Story County Public Health to see what they
could learn about the outbreak.
Hansen said the health department does not know how many people have
been affected. "At this point in time, we don't know. We've been
talking with Mary Greeley Hospital and to Story County Public Health,
and we do not have exact numbers at this time," Hansen said.
Hansen said they don't have any idea what the ailment could be. "What
we've done so far is we've also worked with Department Inspection
Appeals, and they are the ones who look at restaurants to make sure
that food is safe. So, we've sent a team there, and so far, they have
found that the food is safe," Hansen said. Samples have been taken to
the University Hygienic Laboratory in Iowa City for testing. Hansen
said they expect the results after midnight.
Hansen said that, in case many have already left the games to return
to home to other parts of the country, other states have been
alerted. "We have notified other epidemiologists around the country.
We have a system where we let them know. ... What we're trying to do
is let other public health departments around the country know that
may be an issue," she said. Hansen said they are also working with
Special Olympics to get messages out to participants, coaches and
families notifying them of what the state health department finds.
Story County Emergency Management officials have set up a mass
treatment center at the Lied Recreation Center at the Iowa State
University campus as a precaution. The Lied Recreation Center has
signs posted on it that say it is closed because of a medical
quarantine. Doctors and members from the American Red Cross are in
the building. It's supposed to work as a staging area for an overflow
health facility for the Mary Greeley Medical Center.
The Iowa Department of Public Health is helping to screen sick
individuals, and it has deployed a mobile health care unit to the
area. Health officials said that the games' closing ceremonies are
still on for 7:30 p.m.

Norovirus Infection Caused Outbreak at Special Olympics
-----------------------------------------------
Samples from individuals who became ill during the Special Olympics
USA National Games in Ames [Iowa] have tested positive for norovirus.
At least 30 people were treated yesterday [7 Jul 2006] for vomiting,
nausea and diarrhea. The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) says
noroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis, also known
as the stomach flu. Outbreaks are normally [often, not invariably -
Mod.CP] associated with food and water.
The Special Olympics held its closing ceremonies last night [7 Jul
2006]. Officials are concerned that people heading home this weekend
will bring the sickness with them. More than 30 000 people from
across the country attended the 6-day event in central Iowa.
IDPH Director Mary Mincer Hansen says that norovirus can be spread
from person to person, especially among family members. At least 10
people have been hospitalized. Others are being held in a recreation
center at Iowa State University as a precaution.

[Norovirus infection may be transmitted via contamination of food or
water. More usually, as in this situation, it occurs where large
groups of people from heterogeneous backgrounds congregate together.
The virus exhibits a degree of antigenic variability, and the US CDC
has ranked norovirus infection as the most common virus infection
after the common cold (see: Viral gastroenteritis, cruise ships - UK,
USA (03) 20060610.1623). The illness, though acute in a proportion of
people, resolves within 24 to 48 hours with few serious consequences.
The most common manifestation of norovirus infection is the
sudden-onset viral gastroenteritis known as "Winter vomiting disease"
common in the northern hemisphere. - Mod.CP]
