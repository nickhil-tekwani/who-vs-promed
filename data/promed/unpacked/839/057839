The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting [see prior ProMED-mail: Poliomyelitis update (39): Pakistan, Syria 20171206.5487696 for details available from a media report. - Mod.MPP].

Afghanistan
- One new WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported this week, collected from Kandahar district in Kandahar province on [4 Nov 2017].
- No new cases of WPV1 have been reported. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2017 remains 11.
- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for the 2nd half of December 2017.

Pakistan
- Two new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week, 1 collected from Peshawar district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on [10 Nov 2017], and 1 collected from Jacobabad district, in Sindh province on [9 Nov 2017].
- No new WPV1 cases have been officially reported this week. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 5.
- An advance notification was received this week of a WPV1 case in Karachi Gadap district, Sindh province, with onset [9 Nov 2017]. The case will be officially reflected in next week's global data reporting.
- At the conclusion of last week's Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting, the TAG praised the progress made in Pakistan over the past 9 months on the way to achieving polio eradication, and offered recommendations to improve surveillance, immunization and monitoring.
- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for the 2nd half of December 2017.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4, and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- The recent Lake Chad Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting underlined the importance of improving access to trapped populations in Borno, Nigeria as well as extending surveillance and vaccination to the 178 Nigeria-governed islands within Lake Chad.
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Phase 3 of outbreak response is going ahead in January [2018], taking into account many of the recommendations made at the recent Outbreak Response Assessment and Technical Advisory Group meetings. The objective is to maintain and improve the multi-national, regional outbreak response across the Lake Chad region.

Central Africa
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year is 10.
- Most cases this year are linked to an outbreak in Haut Lomami province, where the onset of paralysis of the most recent case was [27 Jul 2017].
- A separate outbreak occurred in Maniema province earlier this year, consisting of 2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on [2 May 2017].
- Outbreak response continues to take place across the country, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Immunization activities scheduled this month intend to vaccinate over 10 million children with bOPV vaccine.
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week. The most recent case (by date of onset) is [9 Sep 2017] from Mayadeen district.
- The total number of confirmed cVDPV2 cases remains 70.
- Planning continues for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response. The Syrian Ministry of Health has requested additional doses of mOPV2 and IPV for 2 further immunization rounds.
- Training of health staff for the assessment of cold chain capacity across the country is ongoing in Damascus. Health staff have been trained on mobile data collection. All accessible health facilities will be assessed starting [10 Dec 2017].

[The environmental surveillance activities ongoing in Pakistan and Afghanistan are helpful as they serve as indicators that the WPV1 is still circulating in these countries. The most recent date of onset of a case of WPV1 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan was a child from Shawalikot district who had a reported date of onset of paralysis on 17 Oct 2017, the isolation of the WPV1 in an environmental sample from 4 Nov 2017 in Kandahar district of Kandahar province most likely represents continued circulation of the WPV1 in the Kandahar province. A similar assessment of the environmental isolates from Pakistan are suggestive of continued circulation of the WPV1 in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and Jacobabad district of Sindh province, as the advance notice case was reported from Karachi in Sindh province.

Given the apparent 5 year silent circulation of WPV1 in northern Borno state, Nigeria, one can't help but wonder if there is ongoing environmental sampling in Nigeria, and if so, what results of these surveillance activities might be. And similarly, what other countries are conducting environmental sampling? "Seek and ye shall find" or its corollary, "don't look and it ain't there"...
