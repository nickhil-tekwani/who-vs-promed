Background Information on Rotaviral Diarrhea in Australia
---------------------------------------------------------
Rotavirus is responsible for approximately 50% of hospital admissions for
gastroenteritis among children below age 5 years.
Disease activity peaks between May and September. Activity appears earlier
in Perth (Western Australia) than in the eastern states, and is
unpredictable in the Northern Territory.
In total, 1720 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported in 2000.
Approximately 3700 children under age 5 are hospitalized annually for the
disease in New South Wales; and 12 000 nationwide.
