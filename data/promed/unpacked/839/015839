Avian influenza in France: follow-up report No. 2 (final report - continuation)
-----------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 19 Jun 2006 from Dr Monique
Eloit, deputy director general, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris:
Evolution of the epidemiological situation
On 25 Feb 2006, the French veterinary authorities notified the
European Commission and the OIE of an outbreak of highly pathogenic
avian influenza in a turkey farm in the municipality of Versailleux,
in the Ain department.
All the measures required by European regulations were implemented
and successfully prevented the spread of the virus.
All investigations carried out in compliance with European
regulations and with the provisions of appendix 3.8.9 of the OIE
Terrestrial Animal Health Code were favorable. As a result, the
restriction measures set up on 23 Feb 2006 in relation to the farm
case were lifted on 27 Mar 2006.
No other outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in domestic
poultry farms have been discovered in France.
Conclusion
Article 2.7.12.4. of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code states
that a country may regain its status as an avian influenza-free
country 3 months after a stamping-out policy (including disinfection
of all affected establishments) is applied, providing that
surveillance in accordance with Appendix 3.8.9. has been carried out
during that 3-month period.
Culling operations were completed on 23 Feb 2006. The final cleaning
and disinfection operations of the establishment were completed on 18
Mar 2006. Surveillance practiced around the area of the outbreak
since February 2006 has shown no other outbreak of highly pathogenic
avian influenza.
France, therefore, regains its status as a highly pathogenic avian
influenza-free country on 18 Jun 2006.

Avian influenza in Malaysia: follow-up report No. 3 (final report)
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 18 Jun 2006 from Dr Hawari Bin Hussein,
director general, Department of Veterinary Service, Ministry of
Agriculture, Kuala Lumpur: end of this report period: 19 Jun 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 6 Feb 2006.
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was confirmed
in Wilayah Persekutuan State in Peninsular Malaysia on 19 Feb 2006
(Disease Information 2006; 19[9]: 164, 2 Mar). Subsequently, 4 more
outbreaks were confirmed in the states of Perak and Pulau Pinang (see
Disease Information2006; 19[13]: 279, 30 Mar). A policy of
stamping-out with full compensation was adopted and implemented
immediately to eradicate the disease.
The last culling and disinfection were completed on 22 Mar 2006.
Since then, clinical and virological surveillance, conducted
intensively within a 10 km radius around the outbreaks as well as
nationwide, have found no positive cases. Therefore, 90 days have
elapsed without any evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1 infection being detected.
In accordance with Article 2.7.12.4. of the Terrestrial Animal Health
Code <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.7.12.htm>,
Wilayah Persekutuan, Perak, and Penang States in Peninsular Malaysia
are no longer considered highly pathogenic avian influenza-infected
zones. Malaysia declares that it has regained its highly pathogenic
avian influenza-free country status.

[In the "we also report good news" category, we are happy to report
that 2 countries are now free of avian influenza in their commercial
poultry sectors. It reminds us of the tremendous economic
consequences that avian influenza poses for the industry. It also
highlights that we have the technical expertise and disease control
tactics to clean up avian influenza, as has been done many times in
different localities in the past. - Mod.PC]
