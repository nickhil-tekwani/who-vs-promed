A suspected outbreak of a rare fungal infection has hospitalized six
Mountain Iron residents with severe pneumonia, triggering an investigation
by the county and state health departments.
By Wednesday, two of the victims had been treated and released. Four
patients remained hospitalized at Virginia Regional Medical Center,
Virginia, and St. Mary's Medical Center, Duluth.
The illness, called blastomycosis, cannot be passed from one person to
another. The infection is caused by breathing in spores from a fungus --
_Blastomyces dermatitidis_ -- which is found in wood and soil.
Both humans and animals can be infected by the fungus, which can trigger a
range of symptoms. Blastomycosis infections commonly cause colds, fevers or
pneumonia. More severe cases can result in skin or bone infections. The
infections can be fatal if untreated.
Health officials suspect the recent wave of infections are the result of
mid-August construction in Mountain Iron, which unearthed the fungus and
released spores into the wind, said St. Louis County epidemiologist Larry
Sundberg.
Health officials believe residents were exposed to the spores for a few
days last month. The infections take an average of 45 days to show symptoms.
The county began its investigation Tuesday. State and county health
officials will travel to Mountain Iron this week to test soil samples and
search for other cases.
Sundberg stressed that the illness cannot be transmitted from one person to
another, or from a pet to its owner. Residents needn't panic, Sundberg
added. In many cases, a blastomycosis infection will naturally run its
course as a cold or fever, he said.
