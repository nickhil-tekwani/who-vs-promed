One more person has been confirmed dead and 4 others hospitalized as
yellow fever continues to spread in Northern Uganda. The Ministry of
Health last week [week of 20 Dec 2010] put out an alert on yellow
fever following a strange disease that had hit the 10 districts in the
region last month [November 2010]. The latest report put the death
toll at 49 while 191 are hospitalized. The director general of Health
Services, Dr Nathan Kenya-Mugisha, revealed that the death was
registered in Kaabong district. Dr Mugisha says 2 victims infected
with the viral disease are from Kaabong and the other 2 from Agago
district.

He reveals that the ministry is working around the clock to mobilize
resources internally to enable mass vaccination kick off as soon as
possible before the disease spreads to neighboring districts. Dr
Mugisha further says the ministry will hold another meeting with the
development partners next week on Tuesday [4 Jan 2011] to discuss,
among other things, financial support for the vaccination exercise.

Other districts affected by the disease include Gulu, Lira, Abim, and Pader.

[Initiating the vaccination campaign is urgent. Each passing day means
more cases and the risk of spread to new geographic areas. Since
Uganda has had no reported yellow fever cases for some 40 years,
pressure to maintain good herd immunity through ongoing YF vaccination
doubtless has been low, especially in more remote areas.
