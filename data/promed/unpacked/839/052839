Cuba has reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) 2
outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is an extremely contagious and fatal
viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits belonging to the
_Oryctolagus cuniculus_ species, according to OIE. Outbreaks have
been reported at farms in Baragua and Venezuela. Both municipalities
are located in Cuba's Ciego de Avila province.

In Baragua, Cuba's ministry of agriculture reported 2345 rabbits as
susceptible, 945 cases, 945 deaths, and 1400 rabbits as destroyed. In
Venezuela municipality, the ministry reported 140 rabbits as
susceptible, 41 cases, 41 deaths, and 99 destroyed.

The 1st confirmation of the disease occurred on 18 May 2010. The
outbreaks are still recorded as unresolved, according to OIE. Weekly
follow-up reports will be submitted.

The last outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease reported in Cuba was
in August 2005. According to OIE, the disease has always been
confined to Cuba's western provinces, but the recent occurrence has
taken place in a province in the central-eastern region of the
country.

A disease emergency has been declared in the region and the
neighboring areas. A disease alert has been declared for the entire
country. The use of vaccines for protecting populations at risk is
not to be precluded.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is an extremely contagious and often
fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. This disease
affects only rabbits of the species _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. Severe
losses are common in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all
of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic
declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is
first introduced. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease spreads very readily.
The causative virus is very resistant to inactivation if it is
protected by organic material; it may persist in chilled or frozen
rabbit meat, as well as in decomposing carcasses in the environment,
for months.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease was first seen in the 1980s, but its
origins are not completely understood. It may have emerged from
avirulent caliciviruses circulating asymptomatically in European
rabbit populations. The 1st known outbreak occurred in China in 1984,
spread by angora rabbits that had been imported from Europe. Within 9
months, this disease had killed 14 million domesticated rabbits in
China. By the late 1990s, outbreaks had been reported from 40
countries, and rabbit hemorrhagic disease had become endemic in wild
rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Other parts
of the world including the Americas have experienced periodic
outbreaks in domesticated rabbits. However, the species of wild
rabbits found in North America are not susceptible to rabbit
hemorrhagic disease, and this disease has been eradicated from
domesticated rabbits each time.

Uninfected countries may place restrictions on the importation of
rabbits, meat, and angora wool from endemic areas. In an outbreak,
strict quarantine is necessary. RHDV is extremely contagious; it can
be transmitted on fomites and by insects, birds, and scavenging
mammals. Eradication can be accomplished by depopulation,
disinfection, surveillance, and quarantines. RHDV can be inactivated
with 10 percent sodium hydroxide or 1-2 percent formalin. Other
suggested disinfectants include 2 percent One-stroke Environ(R)
(Vestal Lab Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.5 percent sodium
hypochlorite (10 percent household bleach). This virus resists
degradation by ether or chloroform. Carcasses must be removed
immediately and disposed of safely. Infected farms should not be
restocked immediately, as RHDV can persist for a time in the
environment, particularly when it is protected in tissues. Sentinel
rabbits can be used to monitor premises for persistent viruses.

In regions where RHDV circulates in wild rabbits, eradication is not
feasible. Instead, this disease is controlled in domesticated rabbits
with biosecurity measures including sanitation and disinfection, the
maintenance of closed colonies, and vaccination. Vaccination may be
limited to breeding animals if rabbit hemorrhagic disease has not
been reported on a farm, but all animals should be vaccinated if an
outbreak has occurred. Even with strict sanitation and other control
measures, the likelihood of reinfection is high after an outbreak.
Vaccination can interfere with eradication by masking infections.
Sentinel animals can be used to monitor for the persistent viruses on
vaccinated farms. Immune serum has also been used to provide
short-term protection in an outbreak.
