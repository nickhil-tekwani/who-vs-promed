[1] High incidence of cereal disease in Russia (Rostov region)

55 percent of grain crops are affected with fungus in the Rostov
region, which is more than 1.2 million hectares. According to the
veterinary and phyto-sanitary surveillance center, Septoriosis and
powdery mildew are the most prevalent among all other fungal
diseases. The local government is having difficulty as a result of
the disease in crops, and if crop fields are not treated [with
fungicide - Mod.JAD], the disease can affect at least 15 percent of
each field, which can lead to a loss of more than
800 000 rubles [USD 30 000] .

[2] Septoriosis - Kazakhstan (Kostanay)

300 000 to 600 000 grain fields are affected with Septoriosis in the
Kostanay region. According to local experts, who studied less than 50
percent of fields, this is getting to be a big problem. In the
beginning of the season the spread of Septoriosis was 455 000
hectares; now it affects about 150 000 hectares more, says the
director of the methodical plant center, Vasiliy Bochekno. The main
cause of Septoriosis [fungal] is sustained by rainy weather.
Increased humidity and lack of chemical treatment [fungicide
Mod.JAD] is affecting the crops. According to further evaluation,
Kostanay peasants need about 300 million tenge [USD 2 447 000] in
local currency to organize measures for special chemical treatment of
grain crops.

[The cereal crop plant wheat (bread wheat,_Triticum aestivum_ and
durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_) develops symptoms of Septoriosis
when infected with the fungus _Stagonospora nodorum_ (the cause of
spike/glume blotch and leaf blotch), _Septoria tritici_ (the cause of
leaf blotch), and _Stagonospora avenae triticea_.
The 2 reports in this posting point out the severe losses cereal
crops like wheat, barley and rye can sustain in Russia and Kazakhstan
from fungal diseases, especially those caused by species of
_Septoria_ and _Stagonospora_. These pathogens cause diseases of
cereals worldwide in what is sometimes referred to as the _Septoria_
complex. An article by Sanina, Paholkova & Chen described _Septoria_
diseases in Russia as follows:
"Among important fungal diseases on wheat in Russia, _Septoria_
diseases have been dominant. Crop losses from _Septoria_ diseases
were up to 30-40 percent. Epidemics have occurred in 4-5 out of 10
years. Species causing _Septoria_ diseases identified on wheat in
Russia were _Stagonospora nodorum_, _Septoria tritici_, and
_Stagonospora avenae triticea_. The distributions and epidemic
frequencies of the species were different in various regions. _S.
nodorum_ prevailed in the northern oblasts. _S. nodorum_ and _S.
tritici_ were approximately in equal proportions in the middle
oblasts. _S. tritici_ was predominant in the southern oblasts. _S.
avenae triticea_ was found almost in all studied areas and was
gradually increasing in proportion. _S. tritici_ prevailed at the
early growth stage, while _S. nodorum_ increased as the season
progressed. Both species were about equal in frequency by the soft
dough stage."
The Kazakh Research Institute of Plant Protection is studying the
populations of pathogens responsible for disease and working towards
the development of resistant varieties.
The current impact of leaf rust in Irkutsk, Russia was reported in a
companion posting (20060815.2287).
