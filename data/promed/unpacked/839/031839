Livestock owners in the UAE's Central Region fear the outbreak of an unknown virus, following the death of dozens of camels, the Arabic daily 'Emarat Al Youm' has reported.

According to Musapah Bel Ajeed Al Ketbi, member of the National Council for the Central Region, about 200 camels had died in the past few weeks.

[MR], owner of a farm of racing camels in the Central Region, confirmed the spread of high fever among his animals, especially racing camels, since the beginning of March [2014]. He added that the problem continues, resulting in the death of a large number of expensive racing camels.

He said 5 racing camels on his farm had been hit by fever. One of them, treated with traditional medicine, survived while the other 4 perished in spite of veterinary drugs.

[MR] added that the 1st symptoms appear in the form of high fever after which the camels don't eat any food. Then they suffer from severe diarrhea and die in 3 or 4 days.

[MSAK], a camel breeder, said most camel breeders take precautionary measures by isolating infected animals, though this did not always prove helpful. [MSAK] urged the Ministry of Environment and Water to arrange a medical team to treat the fever that has spread among camels and take preventive measures to protect non-infected animals.

[MOAK] stressed the need for good veterinary services. He noted that the fever had forced the breeders to pay a lot of money to transport camels to places outside the infected places in an attempt to control the situation.

[SNAK], a farm owner, stressed the need for a team of government veterinarians and specialists in the treatment of fever. The services of Ministry of Environment vets are limited at present, he added. Many camel owners resort to alternative medicine to reduce their losses, he added.

[The information on the alleged "outbreak of an unknown virus" in camels in UAE, continues to be confusing. This includes the attribution of the undiagnosed camel morbidity and death to a virus; evidence for such statement is required.

According to a previous media report (see archive no 20140616.2543729):
1. The event in the UAE started about 2 years ago.
2. Initially is was sporadic, recently the incidence increased.
3. Clinical signs, as mentioned by a practitioner said to had treated 50 sick camels, include "rapid breathing, cold, flu, coughing and fever."
4. According to the said source, in the absence of diagnosis, symptomatic treatment was applied, eventual mortality becoming 5 percent.
5. Another source claimed that early diagnosis and (very expensive) treatment helped save camels' lives.
6. As source of infection, 2 scenarios were mentioned:
i. imported race camels
ii. returning race camels
7. According to one source, the local authorities ruled out MERS-CoV as possible diagnosis (no details provided on the tests applied).

The current media report adds 2 pieces of information, similarly anecdotal:
1. "The 1st symptoms appear in the form of high fever after which the camels don't eat any food. Then they suffer from severe diarrhea and die in 3 or 4 days."
If the above is accurate and representative, it may justify adding enteropathogenic agents (bacterial, viral, or otherwise), to the differential diagnosis list.
2. "The fever had forced the breeders to pay a lot of money to transport camels to places outside the infected places in an attempt to control the situation."
This means that no animal movements restrictions are being required nor enforced, allowing further spread of the disease (in case it is indeed infectious).

An OIE list of infectious diseases of interest for camelids, published in 2010, includes the following viral diseases in dromedary camels:
Group I: known to produce significant diseases in dromedaries: camelpox, contagious ecthyma, papillomatosis, rabies, Rift Valley fever (RVF).
Group II: diseases for which dromedaries are potential pathogen carriers: African horse sickness (AHS), bluetongue (BT), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR); [MERS-CoV may now be considered for inclusion].
Group III: minor diseases: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), herpesvirus infections, West Nile fever.

For further details (such as diagnosis) as well as for the lists of bacterial, parasitic, and fungal diseases in dromedary camels, please refer to http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Diseases_Camelids_May10.pdf.

Any additional information on tests/investigations into the etiology(ies) of the undiagnosed camel health event(s) in UAE, particularly from professional sources (such as the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory-CVRL, Dubai) will be highly appreciated. - Mod.AS
