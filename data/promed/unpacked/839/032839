The United Nations mission in Mali has canceled plans to renew a contract with a private clinic providing care to its peacekeepers after a case of Ebola was missed and spread from there... The UN mission in Mali, whose peacekeepers are helping to protect the nation against Islamist rebels, reversed on Sat [15 Nov 2014] a decision taken earlier in the week to renew the contract with the Pasteur Clinic in Bamako to care for sick or injured troops. A UN spokesman said the decision was taken "due to prevailing circumstances," but gave no further details.

["The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) was established by Security Council resolution 2100 of 25 Apr 2013. Under the terms of the resolution, the mission would support the political process and carry out a number of security-related stabilization tasks, with a focus on major population centres and lines of communication, protecting civilians, human rights monitoring, the creation of conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance and the return of displaced persons, the extension of State authority and the preparation of free, inclusive and peaceful elections." http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/minusma/background.shtml. - Mod.JW]

[2] Guinea-Bissau reopens borders with Ebola-stricken Guinea

Guinea Bissau's general director of prevention and health promotion Nicholas Almeida announced on Sat [15 Nov 2014] the reopening of borders with Ebola-hit Guinea to facilitate trade between the 2 countries.

"We will continue to reinforce the preventive measures against the deadly Ebola virus," Mr Almeida said, pointing out that the emergency plan would be still in force despite the lack of means to fully put it in place. Guinea Bissau is currently unable to afford an epidemiological monitoring, he said, recalling a summit which brought together heads of states and governments from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which recommended the reopening of the borders. The health expert said that some 40 entry points have been identified as requiring great attention.

"Screening units are set up in the hospital Simoes Mendes in Bissau and across the region," Almeida said, while pointing to the already launched emergency plans, including radio sensitization campaigns and training sessions for health workers.

[3] Liberia: Chinese team lands to fight Ebola

About 160 Chinese health workers have arrived in Liberia, where they are due to staff a new USD 41 million Ebola clinic that, unlike most other foreign interventions, is being built and fully run by Chinese personnel.

China, Africa's biggest trade partner, had come under fire for the level of its response to the Ebola crisis. But it said this week it would send a team comprising 1000 personnel to help fight an outbreak that has killed over 5000 people in West Africa. "Up to now in Liberia, China is the only country providing not only the construction of an ETU (Ebola treatment unit), but also the running and operation and the staffing of an ETU," Zhang Yue, the Chinese ambassador to Liberia, told the Reuters news agency.

Yue said the new team in Liberia included a mix of doctors, nurses, technicians and engineers. "They experienced SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). They are very knowledgeable in this area," he said, referring to the contagious illness that was 1st identified in China in 2002 and killed several hundred people across the world. On arrival, the Chinese health workers had their temperatures taken and were made to wash their hands, a ritual adopted across the region as part of efforts to stem the disease. Yue said the establishment of the clinic in Liberia brought China's contribution to the anti-Ebola effort in the country to USD 122 million.

[4] Liberia: Firestone control strategy
Date: 15 Nov 2014

Various unique and robust Ebola control measures implemented by a Liberian rubber tree plantation restricted the spread of the disease within that community, according to a recent MMWR. The success of this program may serve as a model for containing the disease in other areas of Liberia, CDC researchers wrote. In the report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed the response efforts made at Firestone Liberia, a rubber tree plantation company affiliated with Bridgestone Americas.

After the report of the 1st diagnosed Ebola case at the plantation in March 2014, the company implemented a management strategy using the company's existing organizational structure. The response plan included case identification and management services, as well as re-assimilation of recuperating patients into the community. This "survivor reintegration program" included community education about the survivor's disease- and contagion-free status and also featured a ceremony attended by local officials, clergy and Firestone staff. Ongoing community meetings and radio updates were used to provide important information about Ebola risks, prevention and social mobilization within the community.

Control efforts also included offering voluntary quarantine to high-risk, asymptomatic individuals who were in contact with Ebola patients for up to 21 days after exposure. Quarantine facilities offered education, personal protective equipment, sanitary supplies and meals. All patient contacts who developed Ebola were among the voluntary quarantines. In addition, personal protective and waste disposal equipment were given to family members of individuals with suspected Ebola infection.

Between August 2014 and 23 Sep 2014, 71 Ebola cases were reported in 39 families within Firestone's catchment area; 57 of these were confirmed cases; 53 patients died, and 39 of these were confirmed cases (68 percent mortality rate among confirmed cases). There were 27 deaths in the Ebola treatment unit, 6 in the main hospital, and 6 in the community. Since Firestone introduced its Ebola response program, 18 disease survivors have been discharged from the Ebola treatment unit and reintroduced into the community. According to the CDC report, the success of Firestone's response strategy hinged on community cooperation and the support of company leadership.

"An important result of Firestone's response is the success with which community members identified suspected Ebola cases, agreed to voluntary quarantine in dedicated facilities, and minimized stigmatization of Ebola survivors," the researchers wrote. "The education, social mobilization, and reintegration programs, as well as the visibility of supervisors and leaders in the community likely contributed to these successes."
