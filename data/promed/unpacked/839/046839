Health officials say a 37-year-old Sandoval County woman is hospitalized with [a] hantavirus [infection], making New Mexico's 1st case this year [2016].

The state Department of Health says an environmental investigation will be done at the woman's home to help reduce the risk of others contracting the deadly disease.

Hantavirus[es are] transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. People also can breathe in the virus [in dust that has been contaminated with excreta from the infected rodents. - Mod.TY]. Health officials say people should seal up cracks in their homes to prevent mice from entering.

New Mexico had 1 case of [a] hantavirus [infection] during 2015. The 53-year-old Taos County woman survived.

The state had 6 cases in 2014, 3 of which were fatal.

New Mexico has had the most hantavirus cases of any state in the country since the virus was discovered in 1993.

[The hantavirus responsible for this case was not specified but undoubtedly is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in New Mexico. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as the 4 HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] deaths in Colorado last year (2015) and 3 New Mexico fatalities in 2014 indicate. The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts. Previous posts this year indicate that increased precipitation due to El Nino climate effects may have an effect on mouse habitat, with increased exposure of humans in the region due to related increases in populations of Sin Nombre hantavirus-infected mice (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572).
