The number of people who have had dengue in Bahia this year [2009]
has reached 40 000 with 32 deaths. Most fatal victims were children.
Changes in weather, with rain and heat, have caused an increase in
breeding of the transmitter mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_. The main
obstacle in the fight against the disease may be inside the houses
[where the mosquito breeds].

In Itabuna, one of the hardest hit cities in the south of the state,
6900 cases of the disease and 8 deaths were recorded. Doctors and
nurses of the Armed Forces are reinforcing care of the population. In
addition to 3 hydration centers, 2 health units with 70 beds were
opened.

In Salvador, the increase in the number of cases is of concern in the
health area. The city has faced a lot of rain and then hot weather,
and these conditions favor the proliferation of the mosquito. In the
capital, there have been 352 confirmed cases of dengue and more than
1700 reported [cases].

The fight against breeding of the mosquito that transmits dengue has
also been intensified in areas with the highest levels of
infestation. Despite all the warnings and all the recommendations of
health authorities, 40 percent of breeding sites in Salvador are
found in barrels and open tanks and in vases and dishes of plants.

Health Minister Graciela Ocana said Wednesday [8 Apr 2009] that a
dengue outbreak in the country has worsened to an epidemic, as nearly
8000 people are officially reported to be infected with the disease.
"Dengue is here to stay," Ocana said.

While the Health Ministry says the northern province of Chaco, one of
the worst hit, has registered 3590 cases, Amalsi Ruiz, a spokesman
for the provincial town of Charata, said nearly 4 times as many
people are infected, based on house-to-house surveys and hospital
visits. In total, 6 people have died, including 3 infected with the
severe hemorrhagic variant, which accounts for a fraction of dengue
cases.

The Health Ministry has launched a national campaign to educate
people on dengue prevention, including wearing insect repellant and
covering exposed body parts with thick clothing.

Authorities say Argentina's worst outbreak since the disease
reappeared in the country in 1997 is linked to an epidemic in
neighboring Bolivia, which has registered 51 000 cases.

[Dengue is spreading in Argentina. La Nacion in its 11 Apr 2009
edition (in Spanish)
<http://www.lanacion.com.py/noticias-239891-2009-04-11.htm>
indicated that unofficial numbers place dengue-related deaths at 10
since the outbreak began in January 2009. The 1st locally acquired
dengue case has been reported in the populous Buenos Aires province.
Salta, Chaco and Catamarca are the most affected provinces, with 3506
cases confirmed by laboratory tests or epidemiological relationship.
Of these, 42 percent are from Charata city.

Telam, in its 7 Apr 2009 edition (in Spanish)
<http://www.telam.com.ar/vernota.php?tipo=N&idPub=141063&id=285185&dis=1&sec=1>,
reported 69 dengue cases, with an additional 64 under investigation,
in the city of Buenos Aires. The number of cases has doubled in a
week, but all were acquired outside the city. Also, there have been
43 locally acquired dengue cases in Corrientes, as well as new cases
in Santiago del Estero and in Santa Fe provinces.

Clarin.com reported on 7 Apr 2009 (in Spanish)
<http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/04/07/sociedad/s-01892767.htm>
that there were 238 dengue cases in Buenos Aires city, all imported
from northern Argentina.

It is not clear why there have been consistent discrepancies in the
numbers of dengue cases reported in Argentina during this outbreak.
There appears to be significant under reporting in the official data,
as local health officials contend.

[There have been] 2 dengue fever deaths at the King Faisal Hospital
in Makkah. Authorities have become increasingly concerned at an
apparent rise in the cases of dengue fever, with the National Society
for Human Rights noting last week some 139 cases receiving treatment
at a Makkah hospital in the last 3 months alone. The Minister of
Agriculture made a tour of sites in Jeddah last week to oversee
efforts to combat the virus.

newspaper report [edited]
<http://english.vietnamnet.vn/Health/2009/04/840388/>


Since the beginning of the year [2009], Can Tho City Children's
Hospital has treated over 310 cases of dengue fever, with 96 at the
serious levels III and IV. Most patients are from Can Tho City, Hau
Giang, Soc Trang, Vinh Long, and Dong Thap provinces.

The epidemic has come in the dry season instead of the rainy season
as is typical, Le Hoang Son, director of the hospital said.

The country does not have dengue vaccines; as such, the main
prevention plans are to reduce the chances of disease by killing
mosquitoes and cleaning accommodations, he added [Currently, there
are no licensed dengue vaccines, so the country is not alone in not
having vaccines. - Mod.MPP].

A 10-year-old girl from Vinh Long Province has level III dengue and
has been treated at the Can Tho City Children's Hospital. Her mother
said that she was very busy, so she could not clean her house and
garden, this has led to a lot of mosquitoes around the house.

The mother of a 9-year-old patient said: "My child is at school all
the day, thus I could not know when she was bitten by mosquitoes."

The weather has been changeable this year [2009]. The increase of
unseasonable rains has created advantageous conditions for
mosquitoes, director of the Can Tho City Preventive Health Center
Nguyen Trung Nghia said.

If we do not have effective solutions, the dengue epidemic will
easily spread, Mr Nghia said.

Can Tho City authorities have deployed solutions to prevent the
dengue epidemic. They have organized training courses on dengue
prevention for teachers so that they can teach their students. The
city has also provided schools with equipment to help families breed
fish in places with mosquito larvae. This April [2009], Can Tho's
Health Department will conduct a campaign to destroy mosquito larvae
in 11 wards where dengue fever may break out.

Bac Lieu Province currently has 239 cases. The provincial preventive
Health Center has coordinated with authorities to prevent the
epidemic, such as mobilizing people to kill mosquitoes in their homes.

All districts in Hau Giang Province have reported cases of dengue.
The numbers of patients from Vi Thuy and Chau Thanh A districts and
Vi Thanh town have strongly increased over the same period from last
year [2008].

The Hau Giang Health Department said that unseasonable rains have
helped to increase the numbers of mosquitoes, leading to a dengue
epidemic in the coming rainy season.

Authorities in the province have increased awareness programs to
reduce the possibility of an epidemic.

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the clinical
features of dengue fever (DF) include either a mild fever or the
classical incapacitating disease with abrupt onset and high fever,
severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and
rash.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is classified into 4 grades of
severity, where grades III and IV are considered to be dengue shock
syndrome (DSS). Grade I is fever accompanied by non-specific
constitutional symptoms, positive tourniquet test and/or easy
bruising. Grade II is spontaneous bleeding in addition to the
manifestations of Grade I. Grade III is circulatory failure
manifested by a rapid, weak pulse and narrowing of pulse pressure or
hypotension, with the presence of cold, clammy skin and restlessness.
Grade IV is profound shock with undetectable blood pressure or pulse.

Although dengue fever cases and dengue shock syndrome cases are
reported in the provinces of the Mekong Delta region in Viet Nam, the
newswire above reports no fatalities associated with dengue
infection. The provinces mentioned in the above newswire are all in
the southern region of the country.

Recently, 2250 cases and one death of dengue fever were recorded in
Ho Chi Minh City during 2009 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Viet Nam (02): Ho Chi Minh City 20090402.1267).

[6] Australia (Queensland)
Date: Thu 9 Apr 2009

Almost 1000 people have been infected with dengue fever in north
Queensland, officially making it the worst outbreak in almost 20
years. But there is some good news, with experts saying the rate of
infection is slowing.

The count late today [9 Apr 2009] was 935 cases, mostly in Cairns.
That tops the previous worst outbreak of 1992-93 when about 900
people were infected with the mosquito-borne virus in Townsville and
Charters Towers.

The latest outbreak started on 1 Dec [2008], and Queensland Health
officials say it's been particularly virulent, leaving people "sicker
than we have previously seen" and claiming one life. A frail
82-year-old Manoora woman died on 1 Mar [2009] at Cairns Base
Hospital. Although she had other health problems, she tested positive
to dengue, and the disease probably contributed to her death.

"The current epidemic is the largest dengue outbreak on recent record
in Cairns in terms of case numbers, and is certainly one of the most
severe we have seen in recent times," Public Health Medical Officer
Margaret Young said. "The good news is that over the recent weeks,
we've seen a steady decline in the number of new cases. However,
there is an ongoing risk to the community, and we want people to
remain aware that dengue is still circulating."

Dr Young said the latest epidemic was also "fast." A less severe
outbreak in 2003 and 2004 took more than a year to get to 536 cases.
This outbreak took just 14 weeks to reach the same figure.

"The epidemic has also left people sicker than we have previously
seen, with approximately one in 4 dengue cases requiring some form of
hospital care," Dr Young said.

She said a recent bout of dry, cooler temperatures in north
Queensland had helped to slow the spread of the virus, as had efforts
to clear mosquito breeding sites. Northern Queensland residents going
away for the Easter long weekend have been urged to remain vigilant
and not leave out any buckets or other items where water can pool.

Authorities fear that if the virus continues to spread in low numbers
during the winter, it could spark a fresh wave of infections when the
weather warms up again. "The last time a dengue outbreak continued
through the winter in Cairns was in 1998," Dr Young said. "There is a
long term risk that dengue could become endemic in North Queensland,
so it's important that local residents continue to clear their yards
of breeding sites throughout the winter."

Dengue is not currently endemic in Australia. Outbreaks begin when a
traveler picks up the virus overseas and returns home while infected.
While the current outbreak is the worst in recent decades, Dr Young
said there were reports of dengue outbreaks in the early to middle of
last century that "affected many thousands of people, including in
Brisbane."

More than 60 people have contracted dengue [virus] type 1 in
Rarotonga in the Cook Islands since late February [2009].

The Cook Islands secretary for health, Dr Roro Daniel, says the 9
people that have been hospitalized are all in a stable condition. "It
has been traced back to somebody who has come from outside the
country. The number of cases is slow; we see around 2 cases a day;
some of them are admitted, but some of them are sent home on oral
treatment."

Dr Roro Daniel says health officials are running awareness campaigns
and are encouraging people to destroy all mosquito breeding sites,
such as water containers.

Bureau for Public Health Surveillance, including 27 cases of dengue
[virus type] 4, 3 cases of dengue [virus type] 1 and 14 cases not
serotyped to date. As of yet, no severe form [of dengue; DHF] has
been reported. Among the 27 new confirmed cases of dengue 4, 11 were
residents of Tahiti, 4 of Bora Bora, 4 of Tahaa, 4 of Raiatea, 2 of
Ua-Pou and one of Moorea. Half of confirmed cases of dengue [virus
type] 4 [infection] are aged 5-19 years (46 percent) and 2 cases less
than 5 years.

As of 8 Apr [2009], at the beginning of EW 15, 7 new cases of dengue
have been laboratory confirmed, of which one was dengue [virus
serotype] 4. The weekly number of confirmed dengue cases remains
stable in Bora Bora, Tahaa, Ua-Pou and Raiatea and Tahiti. A new case
was confirmed in Moorea, although no cases had been confirmed after
EW 11 previously.
