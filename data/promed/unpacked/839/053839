[The following information addresses main new events related to the ASF situation in Asia & Pacific, which have occurred since the publication of the previous FAO biweekly update of 6 Jan 2022. Omitted references are available at the source URL.]

1. Thailand reported ASF outbreak for the first time.

The Department of Livestock Development (DLD) announced on 11 Jan 2022 the confirmation of ASF in Thailand. In Bangkok, 3 pet pigs kept by one owner developed clinical signs on 25 Nov 2021 and died in Dec 2021; a carcass tested positive for ASF virus.

Actions taken:
On 8 Jan 2022, DLD held a press conference regarding suspected ASF in the country and soaring pork price, and announced that a task force was formed to carry out investigation and intensive disease control measures. A 24-hour hotline was made available to report sick pigs. DLD asked people to purchase animals from reputable sources and keep an eye on their health, to apply frequent disinfection, self-quarantine of new animals. It was ensured that DLD is monitoring pigs, pork products, pig feed, and movement of pigs and that compensation will be paid if pigs were to be destroyed for ASF.

The Ministry of Commerce suspended pork exports for about 3 months in order to cope with high pork prices in the domestic market, which came into effect on 6 Jan 2022.

On 11 Jan 2022, the confirmation of ASF virus and allocation of THB 574.11 million (USD 17.3 million) were announced at a press conference by the government spokesperson and DLD director general. Following a nationwide emergency meeting with relevant departments, all provinces and districts have established war-rooms to coordinate and report daily, register pig farmers and number of pigs, perform a risk assessment, share accurate information, guide farmers on improvement of biosafety, and promote good farming management (GFM). Transparency and implementation of biosecurity measures regardless of the farming size have been emphasized.

2. Malaysia reported the first detection of ASF in Sarawak State in January 2022, affecting 3 backyard farms in Durin, Sibu.

The earliest ASF outbreaks in Malaysia had been confirmed in February 2021 in Sabah State (on Borneo Island) in both wild boars and domestic pigs.

On the Malay Peninsula, ASF was confirmed since October 2021 in domestic pigs in Malacca State (11 farms) and in wild boar carcasses in Pahang State (3 localities), as well as in Perak State (6 localities).

In January 2022, ASF was also confirmed in 16 commercial pig farms in Paya Mengkuang Masjid Tanah, Malacca State; 1864 pigs have been destroyed.
