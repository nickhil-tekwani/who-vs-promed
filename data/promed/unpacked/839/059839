[1] FMD-infected livestock allowed for ritual slaughter

The Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has allowed livestock infected with the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and exhibiting mild symptoms to be used for the Islamic ritual Qurbani (animal sacrifice) during Eid al-Adha.

The approval was set with the issuance of MUI Fatwa Number 32 of 2022 concerning the regulation and guideline for the implementation of Qurbani worship during the FMD outbreak.

Chairman of MUI for Fatwa Asrorun Ni'am Soleh stated here on Friday [10 Jun 2022] that Qurbani with an animal infected with FMD is declared valid if symptoms in the animal are mild.

"In my opinion, this (the fatwa) is essential to be used as a guide for the community, including those who perform Qurbani and health workers, (to provide clarity) that not all types of animals affected by FMD do not meet the requirements," he explained.

Mild symptoms of FMD include lethargy, no appetite, fever, blisters around the nails and in the mouth, though not causing limping and significant weight loss. The blisters can also be treated to prevent secondary infection.

Meanwhile, livestock not valid for sacrifice are those with severe symptoms, such as blisters on the nails that cause them to fall off, due to which they are unable to walk or leads to limping.

If the FMD-infected livestock that experienced severe symptoms have recovered during the Qurbani period, specifically 10-13 Dhul Hijjah, before the Magrib azan (Islamic call to prayer), then they can be used for Qurbani.

However, if the livestock recovered after the Qurbani period, then the sacrifice will be considered sedekah (alms).

He explained that one of the requirements for Qurbani is that the animal must be in a healthy condition and not disabled. Nevertheless, he further explained that there are provisions that define the type of illness and the type of disability that is permissible and what is not.

Soleh highlighted that livestock, with mild illness and mild disabilities, may meet the requirements if the illness does not affect the livestock's physical appearance and meat quality.

[FMD circulation and animal movements are a challenging combination. The trade in unvaccinated ruminants for the Qurbani, in FMD-affected regions, may turn Indonesia's efforts to control the spread of the FMD epizootic into a difficult, if not impossible, mission. - Mod.AS]

[2] Setting up an FMD task force

An official from the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs has confirmed that the authorities will set up foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) task forces as the disease has spread to several regions in Indonesia.

"We will enforce FMD handling measures up to the micro-scale, akin to the (COVID-19-related) public activities restriction enforcement (PPKM); hence, there will be FMD task forces down to the sub-district and village levels," the coordinating ministry's secretary, Susiwijomo Moegiarso, said at the Global Crisis Response Group's (GCRG's) media briefing here on Friday [10 Jun 2022].

He informed that the virus has spread to 18 provinces and 163 cities and districts nationwide.

The 1st batch of FMD cases was reported from East Java's Gresik, Sidoarjo, Lamongan, and Mojokerto districts on 5 May 2022, the official noted. The 2nd batch of FMD cases was reported from Aceh Tamiang District, Aceh, he added.

FMD could potentially affect the national economy, as restrictions that might be enforced against cattle exported from Indonesia could create a domino effect on other economic sectors, he opined.

"We will be serious in handling (this issue), as well as other priority issues that we need to handle," Moegiarso said.

Besides setting up an FMD task force, the authority will also set aside a portion of the National Economic Recovery (PEN) fund for FMD handling, the secretary added.

He expressed the hope that government efforts will help address various domestic issues in the food sector that could possibly affect public needs.

"The foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Aceh has (infected) 19 830 cattle", the head of Aceh Animal Health and Livestock Office, Rahmandi, said in Banda Aceh on Thursday [9 June 2022].

Rahmandi said that of the 19 830 infected cattle, 108 have died, 20 had to be slaughtered, and 7675 made full recoveries from the clinical symptoms of the disease. Most of the infected animals were in Aceh Tamiang District, with 8463 infected cattle; 70 of them died, 2 were slaughtered, and 4641 have recovered.

There were also infected cattle in other districts and cities, such as Langsa City with 1645, East Aceh with 720, Bireuen with 1628, Aceh Besar with 2218, and North Aceh with 3956.

There were 42 infected cattle in Pidie Jaya District, 241 in Lhokseumawe City, 27 in Pidie, 644 in West Aceh, 102 in Aceh Jaya, 11 in Sabang City, 36 in Banda Aceh City, 6 in Gayo Lues, and 91 in Aceh Barat Daya.

On the other hand, cattle in Bener Meriah District, Central Aceh, Southeast Aceh, Nagan Raya, South Aceh, Subulussalam, Aceh Singkil, and Simeulue have not been (infected).

Measures taken to control the disease include establishing a post, dispatching task forces in each district and city, opening crisis centers, and conducting coordination meetings.

The authorities also imposed restrictions on livestock distribution, working with the food task force and with other stakeholders, such as transportation to portmasters, as well as the closing of animal markets in areas where the virus is rampant.

In addition, the government was also distributing antipyretic drugs, analgesics, vitamins, and other medications in stages. They have completed the 1st phase in aid allocation.

https://en.antaranews.com/news/233237/ministry-to-import-3-million-foot-and-mouth-disease-vaccine-dosesMinistry to import 3 million foot-and-mouth disease vaccine doses


The Ministry of Agriculture will import 3 million vaccine doses for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which are expected to arrive in the 2nd week of June 2022, according to a ministry official.

"For the emergency vaccines of 3 million doses sourced from the directorate general of Livestock and Animal Health's state budget (allocation), the vaccines come from France and are estimated to arrive in the 2nd week of June 2022," director general of Livestock and Animal Health at the Ministry of Agriculture Nasrullah said during a meeting with Commission IV of the House of Representatives (DPR) at the Parliamentary Complex here on Wednesday [8 Jun 2022].

Aside from the procurement of FMD vaccine doses from France, Indonesia will also receive a vaccine supply from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which is expected to arrive on 12 Jun [2022].

Then, the country will also receive vaccines, in cooperation with Australia, for some 500 000 to 1 million vaccine doses, on 1 Jul [2022], imports of vaccines from Brazil of 100 000 doses, and from New Zealand, with 100 000 doses.

Nasrullah explained that those vaccines are emergency vaccines, and the ministry's Veterinary Pharmacy Center is currently preparing for the development of the locally made FMD vaccine, [the application of which is] estimated to begin in August or September [2022].

The Ministry of Agriculture predicted that 17 million livestock would receive the vaccine, or around 80% of the livestock population of provinces affected by the disease. The livestock will be inoculated 3 times: 2 injections in 2022 and one injection in 2023.

"Thus, the vaccine needed in 2022 is around 27.2 million doses," he said.

According to the Agriculture Ministry's data, as of 6 Jun 2022, as many as 81 800 heads of livestock have been infected with FMD, spread in 163 districts and cities in 18 provinces.

Of the total, 28 528 heads have recovered, 607 cattle were slaughtered, and 524 cattle were reported to be dead. Meanwhile, the number of livestock that has not recovered yet stood at 52 211 heads.

[It is suspected that FMD could have been spreading in cattle on Java since mid-April 2022. The diagnosis was reported to the OIE on 9 May [2022]. FMD viral sequence data has been exchanged with the OIE and FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease in the United Kingdom (WRLFMD, Pirbright Institute), confirming the presence of serotype O (O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e lineage). The WRLFMD has performed, during recent years, vaccine-matching tests with strains of this topotype/lineage from several countries in the region. For example, see the results of matching with a S. Korea (2019) isolate, at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00008-SKR-VMR-O-O_001.pdf. The virus was matched against 4 commercially available FMD-O vaccine strains. - Mod.AS
