The number of dengue cases reported so far this year [2008] is 3
times more than those reported during the same period last year
[2007], said MCD officials on Tuesday.

Until 19 Aug 2007, only 10 cases of dengue were reported. Even during
the 2006 dengue outbreak, MCD reported just 24 cases and in 2005, 22
cases were reported in August.

A total of 35 cases were reported up until Tuesday [19 Aug 2008], of
which 32 are from MCD area, 2 from NDMC [New Delhi Municipal Council],
and one from Delhi Cantt [Cantonment]. "In the last 4 years, this is
the 1st time we have so many cases in the month of August," said a
senior MCD official.

The civic agency said that this year [2008], due to early monsoon and
infrequent rains, the number of cases has risen. "People have stopped
using air-coolers, but have not got them cleaned or have kept them
so that rainwater can collect in them. We are taking all measures
to keep breeding under check. But this year [2008] the number of cases
are more than those reported during the last few years," said Dr N.K.
Yadav, MHO [municipal health officer], MCD.

[It is unfortunate that the help of the public in eliminating _Aedes_
mosquito breeding sites has not been successful, and an earlier report
suggests that penalties are being considered. It would be interesting
to know what public education initiatives have been taken, and an
assessment of why they have not succeeded.

With 2 dead out of the 150 confirmed dengue cases reported at Gurgaon
hospitals, an alarmed district administration is taking immediate
steps to arrange special facilities at its civil hospital.

The local civil hospital has started a separate ward for dengue
patients. According to sources, 278 suspected dengue patients came to
light in the district, but [only] 150 tested positive and the rest
were diagnosed with viral fever. He said out of the patients suffering
from dengue, 2 had died. The rest of the patients are out of danger
and the majority of them have been discharged after being cured. He
said most of the dengue patients are from Gurgaon city and adjoining
areas.

The administration has advised the people to clean their desert
coolers at least once a week and keep their overhead water tanks
properly covered as the standing water is the breeding ground for the
female mosquitoes responsible for spreading dengue [virus].

He also advised people to wear full-sleeved clothes while sleeping and
check for accumulation of water near their houses. If waterlogging is
unavoidable then they should spray kerosene, diesel, or black oil [on
standing water]. [Kerosene, diesel, or black oil should *not* be used
in storage containers for drinking or washing water; they should be
covered with a lid or a cloth. - Mod.TY/JW]

The mosquito-carried virus [that causes] dengue fever, is raging with
massive force in Thailand and Southeast Asia. Thailand, especially
Koh Samet, Koh Mun, and Koh Kodi devastated by dengue fever, has been
written up by several Scandinavian newspapers in nearly identical
articles. This article from [Ekstra Bladet, Denmark] gives a general
understanding of the issues of dengue fever.

The latest official figures from the Thai authorities show that so
far 41 307 persons have been infected with dengue fever [viruses]
this year alone [2008]. When the authorities report on 41 307 cases,
it means the actual figure is at least 10 times higher, as the vast
majority will never be registered.

There are 48 reported deaths so far in 2008, compared to 29 deaths
throughout the whole year 2007, according to the Thai newspaper The
Nation.

Health authorities on Wednesday [20 Aug 2008] declared a dengue
outbreak in Calasiao, Pangasinan after the number of suspected dengue
cases in the town went up to more than 100 since the start of the
year [2008].

Local health officials said they recorded 134 suspected dengue cases
in Calasiao from January to August this year [2008].

Results of tests conducted by the Department of Health showed that 2
out of 5 sampled patients have been afflicted with dengue-3 virus.

The DOH said it recorded a total of 720 suspected dengue cases in
Pangasinan this year [2008].

Mayor Roy Macanlalay and other local officials said parts of the
calamity fund would be used to step up the municipality's anti-
dengue campaign drive.

The local health office is also conducting cleaning operations of
mosquito breeding grounds in every village.

The Department of Health [DOH] in Negros Oriental has noted an
increase in the number of dengue cases recorded in the province this
year [2008].

Dr Socrates Villamor, Jr, provincial DOH chief, disclosed that 567
dengue cases were reported from January to 10 Aug [2008].

Of the total, Dumaguete City had the highest number of cases with
172, followed by Bais City with 71; Tanjay City, 58; Sibulan town,
56; and Mabinay town with 32 cases.

Villamor said the total number of dengue cases this year [2008] is
already about 16 percent above those of last year's [2007], based on
reports reaching his office.

He said that, due to climate change, the occurrence of dengue cases
has become unpredictable unlike in the past years. Back then, the
majority of cases were reported during the rainy season, sometime
between June-September, but that is no longer true today, he said.

He also noted that the dengue vector mosquitoes have evolved to a new
breed [found] not only in clean and stagnant water, but also even in
dirty waters such as those found in canals. [It is unlikely that
_Aedes_ dengue vectors are breeding in dirty water in canals. -

The Taipei City Government urged residents yesterday [19 Aug 2008] to
cooperate with its disinfection measures against dengue fever after
declaring an epidemic red alert.

Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin called on residents to clean up their
surroundings and report any cases to the City's Health Department
after the confirmation of 3 recent indigenous cases in Shezidao of
Shilin District last week [week of 10 Aug 2008] in addition to 8
patients testing positive over the weekend [16-17 Aug 2008].

Seeking to control the spread of the disease, the department set up a
blood testing station in Shezidao, testing 230 residents in the area
on Saturday and Sunday [16-17 Aug 2008]. Commissioner of the
department, Allen Chiu, said 8 people tested positive for the disease.

Positive tests are counted as confirmed cases, the Centers for
Disease Control said.

The result of the test shows that dengue fever is still threatening
the district. The city will not lift the alert until September
[2008], Chiu said after a municipal meeting at Taipei City Hall.

To reduce the number of mosquitoes in the district, the city
government has dispatched staff to spray insecticide indoors and
outdoors in areas within 200m of buildings with confirmed dengue
fever cases, while conducting additional outdoor spraying in 10
boroughs near infected areas, Chiu said.

Chiu said that a total of 13 households refused to allow department
staff to spray insecticide in their houses, but the department later
gave them spray and instructions.

The department will check the households and give them fines ranging
from [TWD] 60 000 to 300 000 [USD 1900 to 9500] if they fail to
follow the department's instructions, he said.

The city government is still inspecting patients who reportedly had
fevers in municipal hospitals from 18 Jul-20 Aug [2008]. It is also
planning sterilizations [clean up] in other areas.

Dengue fever is tran
smitted to humans by infected _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito larvae [no,
adults; larvae don't bite. - Mod.JW], which mainly breed in containers
holding stagnant water. [_Aedes aegypti_ is likely the more abundant
vector. - Mod.TY]

Chiu also reminded those who develop early symptoms of dengue fever
such as a fever, joint pain, or a skin rash to immediately seek
medical treatment.

later (25 Aug 2008) article in the Taiwan Times
(<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/08/25/2003421386>)
indicated that Kaohsiung has had 53 dengue cases this year (2008).

Insecticide spraying will not provide long-term population reduction
of dengue virus vector mosquitoes. Elimination of breeding sites or
their treatment with larvicides provides better long-term vector
control.

Dengue fever has struck Tanjungbalai city [residents] from early
January [2008] until the present and continues to increase. Until
now, the count of the number of victims reached 165 and 44 people are
still under intensive care according to Dr T Mansyur Siagian.

This August [2008], there have been 70 cases and over the last 3 days
there have been 6 new patients as of 18 Aug 2008.

To prevent the [spread of dengue], said Dr Siagian, the residents must
continue to maintain the cleanliness of their environment and carry
out the "3 Ms", [closing, draining, and burying in the local language]
the mosquito breeding places in order to interrupt the dengue
epidemic. This method is one that was most effective in preventing the
spread of dengue fever, indicated Dr Siagian.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued a dengue fever warning
for Fiji following the recent outbreak in neighbouring Pacific Island
countries.

In the past 6 months, Tonga, New Caledonia, and Kiribati have
reported outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease.

Samoa and American Samoa are currently experiencing outbreaks of
severe haemorrhagic fever.

WHO representative in the South Pacific, doctor Chen Ken, says while
dengue fever is usually not present in Fiji, there have been major
outbreaks in the past, the last significant one being in 1998.

With Fiji's position at the centre of regional travel, Dr Ken said
the multiple outbreaks in the region meant the country is at serious
risk.

"Dengue is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito and when a person
with dengue arrives in another country, local mosquitoes that bite
him or her can transmit the illness to others," Dr Ken said.

"Several travellers from Samoa have been diagnosed with dengue after
arriving in New Zealand."

Dr Ken said they received indication from the Health Ministry that a
task force is monitoring the potentially fatal illness and ensuring
preventative measures are taken to reduce the chances of an outbreak.
He said the measures include issuing new guidelines to clinicians and
providing mosquito control at airports.

Dr Ken is advising people to be alert for symptoms and seek medical
treatment if they come down with fever.

The WHO has stressed the importance of community responsibility as
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito responsible for spreading the disease
breeds in small water containers near human dwellings.

The mosquitoes do not fly more than about 100 metres from where they
are born [hatched].

There are at least 3 confirmed cases of dengue being treated at the
San Fernando General Hospital (SFGH). Also, an 8-year-old girl died
over the weekend [9-10 Aug 2008] of the mosquito-borne disease, after
being hospitalised at the SFGH for 5 days. Earlier this year [2008],
another girl, of Tabaquite also succumbed to the disease.

According to hospital sources, several persons from Hindustan and
Princes Town are reported to be suffering from symptoms synonymous
with dengue.

One of the persons confirmed with the disease includes a fireman from
the Princes Town Fire Station, who was hospitalised for more than 15
days. He was discharged last week [week of 3 Aug 2008].

A hospital official noted that the number of dengue cases was nothing
out of the ordinary for this time of the year. He assured [the
public] that the patients were being treated accordingly.
