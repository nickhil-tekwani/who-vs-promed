[2] Bulgaria, ovine, mortality

"The official information that is released says that 6000 animals have died of the bluetongue disease in Bulgaria, while according to our information, the number is of around 15 000," said Dr Petar Doychinov, deputy chairperson of the Bulgarian Veterinary Union, speaking for FOCUS News Agency. In his words, the official information released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food [6000 dead sheep] concerns only animals that have ear marks or that are identified, because these animals are compensated for. "The animals that do not have ear marks are not mentioned in the figures, which explains the difference," Dr Doychev remarked.

[The spread of bluetongue virus type 4 (BTV-4) to Serbia is not surprising; Kosovo, where the 2 reported outbreaks are located, neighbours the infected province Skopje in Macedonia (see interactive OIE map at http://tinyurl.com/o9hon45; zoom in, click to centre). The map shows how widely the virus has already spread by the windborne culicoides vectors in Greece, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Thrace (Turkey) and now Serbia. Its further spread to other parts of the region (such as Albania) will not surprise.

Turkey is the only country which has already applied BTV-4 mass vaccination of sheep in the affected province, minimizing the losses. In the susceptible sheep populations of the EU members, where BT vaccination may be applied only after discussions/approval at EU headquarters, the losses might be considerable, both by mortalities (case fatality rates as high as 30 to 50 per cent have been recorded in the past) and by protracting clinical impact in surviving animals, including reduced fertility and milk/meat production during the coming seasons. Farmers' demands to urgently vaccinate their sheep have recently been published in Greek and Bulgarian press. The disease season may continue throughout September.

Of the 3 mortality figures available from Bulgaria (OIE reports: 422; Ministry of Agriculture: 6000; veterinary union: 15 000), that of the veterinary union may be not far from accuracy.

The dense, active vector (Culicoides) populations which are responsible for the spread of the virus, are potential vectors of other orbiviruses, such as other BTV serotypes and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. It is thus of importance to continue the sampling of affected animals, submitting samples to laboratory tests. - Mod.AS
