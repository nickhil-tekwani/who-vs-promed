[Anonymous member: A media news article* on 1 Jul 2021 reported that] 3 people in Armenia's Gegharkunik [Gelark'unik'] region have been confirmed to have contracted anthrax, the Ministry of Health reported.

It said the anthrax was found in livestock in the communities of Vanevan and Torfavan by the specialists of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, who had been dispatched to the region to take samples from 7 local residents.

Three of them were diagnosed with anthrax. Two are the owners of the infected animals; another one is their relative. All of them are hospitalized: the condition of 2 is moderate, the 3rd is mild.

Research was also carried out on 4 samples of land from the village of Vanevan and nearby pastures, and no causative agents of this disease were found. The specialists go from home to home to examine all the animals, the ministry said.

Seven citizens with symptoms of anthrax were hospitalized in Armenia's northwestern province of Shirak [Sirak], Armenpress News Agency reported. Earlier this week, 3 residents in eastern province of Gegharkunik were confirmed to have contracted anthrax. All 3 were hospitalized.

According to the news agency, suspicions about the symptoms of anthrax appeared on 30 Jun [2021] in the village of Isahakyan in the Shirak province after the death of 6 cows and as many sheep, according to the head of the village administration Artavazd Arsenyan.

"Seven residents of the village have been hospitalized. The whole herd has been vaccinated again against anthrax. At the moment there are no new cases," Arsenyan said. At the same time, he noted that there is no official conclusion that the animals really had anthrax, but the symptoms in humans and the death of livestock testify to this.

All the hospitalized are in stable condition. They were engaged in the processing of skin and meat of the fallen cattle.

[Gegharkunik Province is located at the eastern part of Armenia, bordering Azerbaijan (map: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gegharkunik_Province#/media/File:Gegharkunik_in_Armenia_(non-controlled_hatched).svg).

Shirak Province is located in northwest Armenia and borders Turkey in the west and Georgia in the north (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirak_Province).

This appears to be a repeat of the mid-August 2019 outbreak with similar numbers of animals and humans affected. Anthrax is sporadic in Armenia, so when outbreaks occur, there is not always clarity as to cause. Initial soil samples did not reveal any _Bacillus anthracis_. The initial 3 human cases have been confirmed, but confirmation is pending for the subsequent 7 human cases. Veterinary confirmation has not been reported yet, but the pattern of human and livestock cases is typical of anthrax. Laboratory confirmation of human cases is sometimes difficult, and then "confirmation" is clinically based: acute skin inflation with vesicles and ulcer formation and itching but no pain.

The village administrator said that the animals had been revaccinated as a result of this outbreak, which indicates that a vaccination programme was in place. The protection from livestock vaccination is not permanent, usually only some 9 months. So maybe vaccination this spring was intended but overlooked, or not all animals in the community were vaccinated. It is a fact of agricultural life that if you forget to vaccinate, _B. anthracis_ will remind you expensively.
