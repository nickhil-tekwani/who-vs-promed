The Venezuelan government has taken steps to fight the dengue
epidemic with 35 744 cases in the country.

In 2008 there were 35 546 cases, pointed out Indira Corado, deputy
minister of health.

There is an Administration Plan to control and prevent dengue with
some projects, among them a communication strategy, declared Corado
to Venezuelan TV. Using billboards installed in the main traffic
lights in some cities of the country, the communities are informed
about the elimination and identification of the foci of _Aedes
aegypti_. Fumigating without an environmental clean up and
eliminating foci does not have an impact on the illness and it is a
waste of time, warned Corado.

According to the official, the priority states due to the number of
cases with dengue are Aragua, Apure, Lara, Monagas, Carabobo, and
Barinas.

The Venezuelan government, as part of this plan, has opened some free
services, such as 6700 modules of first aid assistance, 499
diagnostic centers, 555 rehabilitation centers, and 27 centers with
advanced technology equipment.

[The dengue epidemic continues in Venezuela, with an increase of
nearly 2000 cases since 26 Sep 2009. One hopes that the public
information campaign for vector mosquito control will be successful
in reducing virus transmission.

The country is facing a dengue epidemic which this year [2009] has
affected 3788 people and caused the deaths of 27 patients, mainly
children, announced the undersecretary of Community Health, Nelson
Rodriguez Monegro, yesterday [20 Oct 2009]. He explained that the
number of cases exceeded by more than 1000 the [dengue cases]
registered last year [2008], and that DHF cases, 238 as of yesterday
(20 Oct 2009], have duplicated those of 2008.

Rodriguez Monegro stated that in 70 percent of the Dominican homes,
there are breeding sites of the mosquito that is the vector of the
disease [virus].

He attributed the mortality [rate] as due to the failure of hospital
and clinic physicians to provide [adequate] attention to patients,
who require surveillance 24 hours [a day], and weakness in the
management of health centers.

He called on families, communities, neighborhood associations, local
governments, and the other organized sectors of the country to come
together to eliminate mosquito breeding sites. He complained that
some politicians are offering spraying in neighborhoods and
communities without taking into account the technical criteria that
must prevail at the time of spraying, which, he pointed out, is not
the ideal solution against dengue.

Dengue is a febrile illness [caused by a virus] spread by the bite of
a mosquito that breeds in clean water. It is recommended to clean the
surroundings of the homes and adequately cover [containers for] water
stored for domestic consumption. The undersecretary said that
wherever cases have been identified there has been intervention in
the community to eliminate all vector mosquito breeding sites. He
cited the case of San Cristobal, which had house-to-house action
because the neighborhood had 6 children from the Moscu neighborhood
admitted in the Robert Reid Cabral Children's Hospital. In the home
of one these children, 8 mosquito breeding sites were found and in
another one, 20 automobile tires were found, which are real [vector
mosquito] breeding sites. He explained that a 55 gallon [208 liter]
water storage tank is able to produce 80-120 mosquitoes daily, which
is why they must be well covered. "If families dedicate themselves to
cleaning up their homes, roofs, patios, change water in flower vases
on alternate days, and the community is vigilant and removes trash,
they will not have dengue," he said.

He reminded everyone that dengue is a disease that exceeds the
boundaries of health, because of the influence of the environment,
the work of municipalities, water service, and supervision of
families.

The president of the Dominican Association of Physicians, Waldo Ariel
Suero, indicated that in the country there is considerable
underreporting of dengue cases and that the real numbers are 4-5
times higher than those registered by the epidemiological
surveillance system. He said that this underreporting is large
because private clinics and hospitals do not notify [authorities of]
the surveillance system of those ambulatory cases that they see,
which are 4-5 times more than those [cases] reported to Public
Health. He explained that the cases that are captured by the
surveillance system are those of seriously ill patients that have to
be admitted [to hospitals or clinics]. In his opinion, the increase
in dengue cases are due to the lack of planning by the Secretariat of
Public Health, which cyclically abandons preventive work.

[The Dominican health authorities have now acknowledged that the
country is facing a dengue epidemic. Controlling it will be a
challenge. It is easy to make the case for mounting household and
community programs to reduce or eliminate _Aedes aegypti_ breeding
sites in and around houses and other buildings. However,
accomplishing and sustaining that task has proved enormously
difficult. Only 2 countries, Singapore and Cuba, were successful, and
even they were unable to maintain the effort and suffered dengue
outbreaks after several years without cases. Clearly, an
environmentally friendly, low cost, less labor intensive approach to
vector control is needed until such time that a safe, effective,
inexpensive vaccine becomes available.

The Bolivian President, Evo Morales, today [22 Oct 2009] urged that
citizens and regional authorities adopt measures to avoid a new
dengue epidemic in the country. "The best approach to human health
care is prevention," said the head of state in a public event in
Santa Cruz department [state or province equivalent], where he
delivered ambulances, medicines, and fumigation equipment as part of
a national campaign against this disease.

Up to now, 4 confirmed cases of classical dengue have been confirmed
in Santa Cruz and Beni departments. The arrival of the rainy season
in Bolivia is worrying health officials facing the risk of
reappearance of this disease, including its more lethal form, DHF.

Among the preventive measures adopted, underlining its importance, is
eradication of conditions for reproduction of the vector, the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, and fumigation, tasks provided with the
help of the armed forces.

Last year [2008], Bolivia suffered the worst dengue epidemic in the
past 20 years in the country, which caused the deaths of 22 people.

The Municipal Committee to Combat Dengue on Wednesday (21 [Oct 2009])
announced a work strategy for 14 Nov [2009], "D-day against dengue"
as defined by the state Secretariat of Health. "One day is just a
little and every sector involved in the committee should begin its
preparation for the week to discard trash that we will promote in the
1st half of November [2009], "said secretary of health, Antonio
Carlos Nardi.

With 56 confirmed [dengue] cases this year [2009], the same number as
in 2008, the proposal is to mobilize all sectors of the Committee
members' [areas] for a functional result. The intent, says Nardi, is
to mobilize between 700 and 1000 people, inform the communities to be
worked with, and remove as much trash that accumulates water from
homes and land as possible.

The coordinator of Environmental Surveillance of the Secretariat of
Health, Mariangela Felix Vecchi, added that the trash collection will
be concentrated in areas having the greatest mosquito index according
to the latest survey. The residents should put on the sidewalks all
the material that can accumulate water and must be discarded.

The secretary Antonio Carlos Nardi points out that the rains of
recent weeks and hot weather are factors that can lead to rapid
proliferation of the mosquito, and an increasing number of cases.
"From now until May [2010] all of Brazil is at risk of a dengue
epidemic, with serious consequences, and Maringa also runs this
risk," he said. "So everyone should adopt the habit of eliminating
standing water."

In 7 days, Mato Grosso had 69 new notifications of dengue, and only 1
[case] of the serious form of the disease. The bulletin released by
the state Secretariat of Health pointed out that now there are 38 726
reported [cases], with 1107 cases of [dengue] with complications.
There were also 38 cases of deaths due to dengue, of which 32 were
confirmed cases and 6 cases are under investigation. The state had an
increase of 265 percent of reported dengue [cases] compared the same
period of 2008.

Given the situation faced by public health of the state in relation
to dengue this year [2009], the government has mobilized to try to
prevent a new outbreak of the disease, which struck mainly the city
of Cuiaba with 11 118 dengue patients, of which 311 were serious
cases. There have been 13 deaths registered (8 confirmed [as dengue]
and 5 under investigation). Other municipalities that have confirmed
deaths due to this disease up to now are Curvelandia (1 [death]),
Diamantino (1), Jaciara (1), Juara (1), Nova Mutum (1), Rondonopolis
(2), Rosario Oeste (2), Sinop (5), Tangara da Serra (2), Tapurah (1),
and Varzea Grande (7).

Next week [week of 26 Oct 2009], the state and the municipalities of
Cuiaba and Varzea Grande will start a campaign for cleanliness in the
backyards of the houses.

The increase in the frequency of rains during the months of August
and September this year [2009] was the factor noted for the increase
in the household infestation indices of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_
and the confirmed dengue cases in Uberlandia. From January to
September 2008, 271 cases of classical dengue were confirmed. Up to
September this year [2009], 292 people have had this disease, which
represents 8 percent more cases in relation to the same period last
year [2008].

Already the rapid [house] infestation indexes for _Aedes aegypti_
have reached 1.2 percent in October of this year [2009], surpassing
the 0.8 percent from October 2008. According to the coordinator of
the dengue control program in Uberlandia, Jose Humberto Arruda, the
difference in the numbers was because it rained more in recent months
than it did in the same seasonal period in 2008. "This indicates
that, for every 100 buildings in the city, 1.2 have the vector
mosquito that transmits the disease [virus]. This does not indicate a
disequilibrium or epidemic, but the rainy months require more
precautions," said Arruda.

Today [22 Oct 2009], 352 agents of zoonosis control are working to
visit 243 000 buildings in Uberlandia. The average is one visit to
each property within 2 months. "The frequency of inspection cannot be
greater than the replacement of foci of the mosquito [breeding
sites]. Therefore, it is vital to have a partnership with every
citizen for the constant elimination of standing water," said the
coordinator for Control of Dengue. Both the poor and the wealthy
neighborhoods of Uberlandia have foci of the mosquito that transmits
dengue [virus].

[This report provides January-September data for dengue cases in
Uberlandia for 2007, 2008, and 2009, household infestation rates of

campaign plans. - Mod.TY]

Cape Verde confirms dengue cases
---------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Cape Verde received on Thursday [22 Oct
2009], test results of samples sent to the Pasteur Institute in
Dakar, Senegal, that confirmed that type 3 dengue virus is the
etiological agent of the viral disease that has been affecting the
populations of the Praia and Maio municipalities since the end of
September, PANA was told by official sources in the Cape Verdean
capital.

The test results confirmed the suspicions of the health authorities
that the disease transmitter would be one of the mosquitoes that
exist in Cape Verde, namely _Aedes aegypti_.

By confirming the presence of the dengue virus in Cape Verde, the
minister of health, Basilio Ramos, reinforced the conviction that the
fight against mosquitoes is the main way to combat the disease, which
so far has not caused any fatalities. "Therefore it is essential that
the different social players, especially the Government, the
Municipal Councils, the Community Associations, the family, and
finally society, engage vigorously in the elimination of the mosquito
breeding sites," said the minister.

Basilio Ramos assured that the Ministry of Health has met all
conditions to care for the people affected by the disease.

The government created an Inter-Ministerial Committee to Fight
Disease Vectors, with the aim of providing greater consistency and
efficiency of anti-vector action to prevent the spread of dengue
fever and more serious conditions that could result from the spread
of the epidemic to other islands and municipalities in the
archipelago.

The disease caused by dengue viruses can present in different forms,
ranging from an inapparent infection, where a person may be infected
but not have any symptoms, to severe hemorrhaging, which may lead to
death.

Dengue is suspected when a patient has an acute fever lasting up to 7
days, accompanied by headaches, eye, muscles, joints, prostration,
and a rash on the body.

The Ministry of Health said on [24 Oct 2009] that within the last
month 55 out of 63 provinces in Viet Nam recorded 17 140 cases of
dengue fever with 14 deaths.

Since the beginning of the year [2009], Viet Nam has seen over 74 242
dengue cases, an increase of 16.8 percent over the same period last
year [2008]. Of the total, 58 have died, 6 less compared to last year
[2008].

Hanoi has seen the highest increase of people infected in the
country, with 8000 patients so far this year [2009], 15 times higher
than last year [2008]. It is also the capital city's worst dengue
outbreak in the past 10 years.
