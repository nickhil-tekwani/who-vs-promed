Second anthrax case in Kidder County
-------------------------------------
I would like to share what I know in reference to this incident.

One cow was found dead in a 300 ft x 400 ft pen. There were only 2 cows and 2 calves in the pen. The rest of his cows are still out on pasture, and will be vaccinated and boostered, before returning to the homestead.

The affected area has been used many times with no history of anthrax and the veterinarian was very astute to pick up on the diagnosis prior to the lab results. The carcass was burned and buried before I even knew it happened.

The location was Steele, ND, right on the home place. If anyone would like any additional information, I will be happy to call him back. Now, back to humane complaints. Going to be a rough fall, I am afraid.

[Thanks to Ethan for this informed update which is very much appreciated.

If this ranch is virgin for anthrax and as it is summer, not winter when livestock gets fed purchased hay &/or silage, this is probably the result of a tabanid female fly with bloody mouthparts from feeding on an animal dying of anthrax. Normally they fly less than 1 km but we have seen distant singular cases of over 15 km from the nearest infected livestock -- a wandering fly. So, ask around to find anyone else with unexpected deaths whether of cattle or deer. You might want to bleed the partner cow to see if she has any antibodies typical of a subclinical anthrax infection. Subclinical infections are more common than people realize. Of course, if she has been vaccinated it is too late, though her titer would be significantly higher than we normally see with vaccinates.

For just 2 cows and their calves, this paddock should have had sufficient grazing. If they were receiving supplement feed -- hay or silage for example -- it would be worth checking for any contaminants.

And get the neighbors to vaccinate their cattle as soon as possible.
