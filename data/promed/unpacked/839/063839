For the 1st time, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus was found in Zhambyl district of the Zhambyl region. As of 21 May [2015] CCHF had been diagnosed in 2 inhabitants, one in the village of Koktobe of Talas district and one in the village of Kapal of Zhambyl district. Patients were hospitalized in the regional hospital. Both patients are in stable condition due to timely diagnosis of the disease and treatment.

According to the Department of Consumer Protection, the [Moiynkum district of Zhambyl region] is a natural focus of CCHF. It includes 49 human settlements of the Sarysu, Moiynkum, and Talas districts with more than 70 000 inhabitants. The main vectors of CCHF virus are _Ixodes_ ticks [_Dermacentor niveus_].

Gulfayra Mirzabekova, deputy head of the Department of Consumer Protection, commented that the identification of the dangerous virus in Zhambyl district could be explained by the migration of livestock and inappropriate control of their condition. In addition, distant villages and pastures are out the range of sanitary services, and the areas of concern are located far from human habitation and lack appropriate facilities, such as tanks and running water suitable for treating cattle.

According to Dr Mirzabekova, since March 2015, more than 32 000 ticks were gathered in the endemic areas. Out of 25 600 tested samples, CCHF virus was found in 71.

This year [2015] anti-tick measures have been implemented in the 49 human settlements in the Talas, Sarysu, and Moiynkum districts. A 300-metre [984 m] protective zone totaling 6200 ha [15 320 acres] was created.

In order to ensure timely and high-quality diagnosis of CCHF during the epidemic season, a mobile diagnostic laboratory center with sanitary-epidemiological expertise was organized in the village of Saydkent in Sarysu district and an anti-plague department in Moiynkum area.

According to the Department [of Consumer Protection] since the 1st report of a CCHF case in 1982, there has been a 136-fold increase in the size of the natural CCHF focus area -- from 200 sq km to 27 100 sq km [77 sq mi to 10 460 sq mi].

[CCHF cases have been reported with some frequency in Kazakhstan in past years. Apparently, the cases in the report above were infected via tick bite. _Hyalomma_ ticks are the main vectors of CCHF virus (The main vector of CCHF virus in Central Asia are ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, and in Kazakhstan the vectors of this virus also included Ixodid ticks _Dermacentor niveus_ (http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/15773396). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ)

Although CCHF virus infection can be acquired by contact with viremic blood of humans or of animals, or tissues of animals immediately after slaughter, infection via tick bite is more common. CCHF virus is in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
