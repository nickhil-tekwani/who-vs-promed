1st Report of Tomato chlorosis virus in Israel.
L. Segev, Department of Virology, Volcani, P.O. Box 6, Bet Dagan 50250,
Israel; W. M. Wintermantel, USDA-ARS, 1636 E. Alisal St., Salinas, CA
93905; J. E. Polston, Department of Plant Pathology, University of Florida,
Gainesville 32607; and M. Lapidot, Department of Virology, Volcani, P.O.
Box 6, Bet Dagan 50250, Israel. Plant Dis. 88:1160, 2004; published on-line
as D-2004-0801-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 7 Jul 2004.
During December 2003, symptoms were observed in greenhouse tomato plants in
Bet Dagan, Israel that resembled those of Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), a
crinivirus common in the southeastern United States and southern Europe
(2,3). Middle-aged leaves showed interveinal chlorosis, while more mature
leaves showed more intense interveinal chlorosis with some interveinal
bronzing. Symptoms were associated with the presence of _Bemisia tabaci_,
an efficient vector of ToCV.
Total nucleic acids were extracted (1) from middle-aged and mature leaves
from 2 symptomatic plants, as well as from healthy tomato, _Physalis
wrightii_ infected with ToCV, and _Nicotiana benthamiana_ infected with
Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV), another crinivirus that produces
identical symptoms on tomato.
Extracts were tested using hybridization with probes specific to the coat
protein (CP) gene of ToCV and the HSP70h gene of TICV. Hybridization
results identified the presence of ToCV in all samples from symptomatic
tomato plants and ToCV-infected _P. wrightii_, but not in those from
healthy tomato or TICV-infected _Nicotiana benthamiana. TICV was detected
only in TICV-infected _Nicotiana benthamiana.
Extracts were also subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction using primers specific to the CP gene of ToCV (GenBank Accession
No. AY444872; Forward primer: 5(prime) ATGGAGAACAGTGCCGTTGC 3(prime);
Reverse Primer: 5(prime) TTAGCAACCAGTTATCGATGC 3(prime).
All samples from symptomatic tomato and ToCV-infected _P. wrightii_
produced amplicons of the expected size, but no amplicons were produced
from extracts of healthy tomato. Laboratory results and observed symptoms
confirm the presence of ToCV in symptomatic tomatoes.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of ToCV in Israel.

[ToCV is transmitted by several insect vectors, including the greenhouse
whitefly, _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_, the banded-wing whitefly (_T.
abutilonea_), _Bemisia tabaci_ (biotype A), and _B. argentifolii_ (biotype
B). The virus is a nasty pest, especially in glasshouse operations.
Although it can cause severe crop losses in fresh market and
glasshouse-produced tomatoes, damage is generally minor. It also infects
several other food crops monitored by ProMED-Plant such as lettuce
(_Lactuca sativa_) and potato (_Solanum tuberosum_). The fact that ToCV and
TICV induce identical symptoms in tomato requires careful diagnosis to
distinguish between the 2 viruses. Disease management depends upon use of
virus-free transplants, control of susceptible weed species, roguing of
infected plants, and control of insects by chemical insecticides.
