Chicago suburb deals with deadly deer disease
---------------------------------------------
A deadly deer disease is causing problems in Chicago's south suburbs
where residents are finding dead or dying deer in their backyards and
in nearby forest preserves.

Officials with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources say more
than 30 deer have been discovered to be dying from an insect-born
virus known as EHD, or epizootic hemorrhagic disease. The department
began monitoring the situation near Crete late last month [July 2010].

Some residents have found deer frothing at the mouth, approaching
homes and humans, and dying near creeks. Those are all signs of EHD.
A Crete resident calls the situation "scary" and describes the smell
as "horrendous."

The last major outbreak of EHD in Illinois in 2007 killed 1900 deer
in 57 counties.

[Although the article doesn't specify, the likely deer is a white-tailed deer.

Since 1890, deer die-offs from diseases, which might have been EHD,
have occurred in various parts of North America. These early die-offs
were variously diagnosed as blackleg, blacktongue, bluetongue,
mycotic stomatitis, or hemorrhagic septicemia, or they were
undetermined. The causative agents were never confirmed. A review of
the case histories, signs and lesions, seasonal occurrence, and lack
of a bacterial agent suggests that they might have been EHD.

The 1st occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in
1955 when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus
virginianus_) succumbed in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was
considered a new disease of deer and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic
disease" was suggested to describe its main clinical and pathological features.

Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics
have occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota,
Wyoming [US], and Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have
occurred in Missouri, Washington, Nebraska, Iowa [US], and British
Columbia [Canada]. South Dakota, Missouri, and Nebraska have
experienced periodic outbreaks of EHD and the disease might be
considered enzootic in these areas.

Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily
among white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O.
hemionus_) and pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have succumbed.

The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ sp.
biting fly or midge. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly
incriminated vector in North America. A common observation in
outbreaks involving large numbers of deer is that they are single
epizootics, which do not usually recur. Die-offs involving small
numbers of deer occur almost annually, and the disease appears to be
enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of EHD have
occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October, being
somewhat location dependant) and have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.

Experimentally, the disease can be transmitted to susceptible deer by
the inoculation of virus-laden material from infected deer by
subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, or oral routes.

Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although
molecularly they are not the same disease.

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after
exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden
onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of man, grow
progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid
pulse and respiration rate, and fever (affected animals frequent
bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature), and
finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the
blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name
'bluetongue'. 8 to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs,
deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.

A combination of case history, characteristic signs and lesions, and
the isolation of the virus are necessary for a diagnosis of EHD.
Useful aids in obtaining a diagnosis are the epizootic nature of the
disease, its seasonal occurrence, and its spectacular hemorrhagic
lesions. Because of the similarity of its symptoms to other diseases,
such as bluetongue and malignant catarrhal fever, the isolation and
identification of the virus are essential.

There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD.
Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration
through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently
improbable as some areas with winter feeding are viewed as one
mechanism of spreading tuberculosis. Additionally, vaccine companies
have not been forthcoming with a willingness to develop a vaccine
that could be used for mass vaccination. With more people adopting
alternative livestock, such as various species of cervids, the
opportunity for vaccine companies is increasing. It may be that
lobbyists with the alternative livestock will need to be active in
Congress to secure minor use, minor species (MUMS) dollars to be an
incentive for the vaccine companies.

Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant
effect upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers
drastically. Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild
ruminants. The EHD virus can infect domestic animals.
