Abstract
--------
Anthrax is a serious biological threat caused by pulmonary exposure to aerosolized spores of _Bacillus anthracis_. BiothraxÂ® (anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA)) is the only Food and Drug Administration-licensed vaccine and requires 5 administrations over 12 months with annual boosting to maintain pre-exposure prophylaxis. Here we report the evaluation of a single intramuscular injection of recombinant _B. anthracis_-protective antigen (rPA) formulated in the DPX delivery platform. Immune responses were compared to an alum-based formulation in mice and rabbits. Serological analysis of anti-rPA immunoglobulin G and toxin neutralization activity demonstrated higher responses induced by DPX-rPA when compared to rPA in alum. DPX-rPA was compared to AVA in rabbits and non-human primates (NHPs). In both species, DPX-rPA generated responses after a single immunization, whereas AVA required two immunizations. In rabbits, single injection of DPX-rPA or two injections of AVA conferred 100% protection from anthrax challenge. In NHPs, single-dose DPX-rPA was 100% protective against challenge, whereas one animal in the 2-dose AVA group and all saline administered animals succumbed to infection. DPX-rPA was minimally reactogenic in all species tested. These data indicate that DPX-rPA may offer improvement over AVA by reducing the doses needed for protective immune responses and is a promising candidate as a new-generation anthrax vaccine.

Discussion (final paragraphs)
----------

Our study did not evaluate the duration of survival with DPX-rPA beyond 2 weeks after challenge in rabbits and 4 weeks in NHPs. Data in rhesus macaques suggest that 3 intramuscular injections of AVA may confer protection from lethal anthrax for up to 4 years (24). In human survivors of inhalational anthrax, anti-PA IgG were identified 8 to 16 months after onset of clinical symptoms. In the same study, peak anti-PA IgG levels correlated strongly with PA-specific IgG memory B cell frequency, which persisted in patient sera for at least 1 year after infection (25). Future studies aim to assess the long-term protective immunity of DPX-rPA against inhalational anthrax exposure. [see URL for references]

This study demonstrates that DPX-rPA generates neutralizing antibody titers towards anthrax PA toxin in multiple animal models. After only a single injection, DPX-rPA increased survival in rabbits and NHP challenged with _B. anthracis_. Overall, our findings demonstrate that DPX-rPA is well tolerated and may offer an improved efficacy profile in comparison to AVA, warranting further study.

[It is early days, and experience teaches us that what works in the laboratory just might work in the field in the real world. But we have long lacked a single shot vaccine for humans, a species reluctant to be vaccinated even on a good day. So I am optimistic that this team may be on the right track and in due course we will all benefit.
