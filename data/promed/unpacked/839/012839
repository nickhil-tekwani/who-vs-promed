Possible new type of bluetongue in the Netherlands
--------------------------------------------------
A bluetongue virus (BTV) which clearly differs from the bluetongue
virus present in the Netherlands since August 2006, has been detected
on 4 cattle holdings. This has been reported by the Central
Veterinary Institute (CVI) of the Wageningen University. Whether it
is an introduction of another bluetongue virus or that it is a
significantly distinctive variant of BTV-8, is being investigated.

"It is in any case a virus clearly different from the bluetongue
virus serotype 8 that we are familiar with in the Netherlands. In
addition, we know that it is not the bluetongue virus serotype 1,
"said Piet van Rijn, a virologist of the CVI.

The virus has been found on 3 holdings in the same region, where the
animals showed clinical symptoms of bluetongue. 2 of the said
holdings had been vaccinated against the disease in the spring. The
vaccination was completed well before the animals began to exhibit
symptoms. The 4th infection came to light because the animal was
tested for export.

"The bluetongue virus has a genetic code of some 20 000 positions. A
very small piece of approximately 250 positions is used in the PCR
test to identify all sorts of the bluetongue virus. In all samples
examined so far, the maximal number of different positions was 3.
This virus has 11 different positions, making it suspected of being a
new variant, "explains Van Rijn. "The piece of the divergent virus
includes at least 5 positions which are different from all other
known bluetongue viruses."

The CVI is engaged with further investigation of the virus. So far,
no extra preventive measures have been undertaken by the Ministry of
Agriculture.

[The above article includes some popularised terms, such as
"positions" (probably referring to nucleotides). A firsthand,
professional report will be welcomed.

The possibility of the circulation of a new BTV strain in the
Netherlands, in particular if the strain is suspected to be
refractory to the BTV-8 vaccine, is of high epidemiological impact
and deserves to be sorted out at the earliest. CDI may consider
involving OIE's BT reference laboratories in this important
investigation. - Mod.AS]
