Veterinarians are investigating what may be a 3rd case of bird flu in the Czech Republic, after a poultry breeder near Ivančice in South Moravia [Jihomoravský] discovered 2 dead specimens at his farm, spokesman of the State Veterinary Service Petr Pejchal told the Czech News Agency on [Thu 5 Jan 2017]. Minister of Agriculture on [Wed 4 Jan 2017] confirmed the outbreak of avian influenza in the Czech Republic. Tests have shown that it is the H5 strain, which doesn't pose threat to people.

[According to a later report from the Czech media, the 3rd outbreak has been confirmed as avian influenza (https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/425536-veterinari-potvrdili-dalsi-ohnisko-ptaci-chripky.html in Czech). It may be assumed that the causative agent is HPAI H5N8; final serotyping pending. OIE confirmation and epidemiological details cannot be obtained at present due to WAHID website's inactivity. - Mod.AS

[2] UK: prevention measures, Wales

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/04/avian-flu-defra-tells-owners-keep-poultry-indoors-until-spring


Poultry owners across Britain have been told they must keep their chickens, ducks, and geese away from wild birds until the start of spring [2017] to counter the threat of avian influenza.

Keepers, including people with just a few backyard hens, must place poultry indoors or take other measures to reduce the chances of them coming into contact with wild birds.

The prevention measures were initially imposed on 6 Dec 2016 but keepers had been hoping that birds used to roaming free would be allowed out this month [January 2017].

On [Wed 4 Jan 2017], the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced that the restrictions would be maintained in England until 28 Feb 2017. Similar moves were made in Scotland and Wales and there is a Britain-wide ban on poultry shows and gatherings.

It comes a day after the Welsh government said a backyard flock in south-west Wales had been slaughtered after catching avian flu [see comment].

The H5N8 strain of avian influenza has been circulating in Europe for several weeks. An outbreak was confirmed in turkeys at a farm in Lincolnshire [England] on [16 Dec 2016]. The disease has also been found in wild birds in Wales, England, and Scotland.

Public Health England advises that the risk to public health remains very low and the Food Standards Agency is clear that bird flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers.

England's chief veterinary officer, Nigel Gibbens, said: "Anyone who keeps poultry such as chickens, ducks, and geese, even as pets, must take action to stop them coming into contact with wild birds to protect them from avian flu.

"Birds should be moved into a suitable building, or if that isn't possible owners must take sensible precautions to keep them away from wild birds, like putting up netting to create a temporary enclosure and keeping food and water supplies inside where they cannot be contaminated by wild birds.

"Even when birds are kept indoors a risk of infection remains so keepers must also practice good biosecurity, for example by disinfecting footwear and equipment and washing clothing after contact with birds."

The chief veterinary officer in Wales, Christianne Glossop, said: "Even when birds are housed, there remains a risk of infection and keepers of poultry and other captive birds should ensure that every effort is made to prevent contact with wild birds."

[The event in Wales involved chickens and ducks which have been culled in a backyard in Pontyberem, the Gwendraeth Valley. The chief veterinary officer for Wales eventually confirmed the H5N8 infection. It is the same strain of the virus found in an infected wild duck in Llanelli (Wales) and turkeys in Lincolnshire.

A 3 km (2 mi) protection zone and 10 km (6 mi) surveillance zone have been put in place around the premises. For additional information see http://www.southwalesguardian.co.uk/news/15001557.Garden_poultry_culled_after_discovery_of_bird_flu_in_the_Gwendraeth_Valley/. - Mod.AS

A massive cull of ducks has been ordered in 3 French regions most affected by a severe episode of bird flu as it tries to contain the virus, which has been spreading quickly over the past month, the agriculture ministry has said.

All free range ducks, as well as geese, will be slaughtered between 5 Jan and approximately 20 Jan 2017 in an area in southwestern France comprising parts of the Gers, Landes, and Hautes-Pyrenees administrative departments, it said in a statement.

"The principle is to quickly kill the species most affected to date by the virus," the ministry said in a statement.

Some 800 000 birds, mainly ducks, out of a total population of around 18 million in the southwest, will be culled in the coming week, Marie-Pierre Pe from foie gras makers group CIFOG told Reuters.

It [the number] could rise further if the virus cannot be maintained, she said, stressing that there are 1.3 million birds in the area.

Some farms will be exempted, however, including those which confine birds and those that perform full production cycles, from ducklings to transformation into end-products, the ministry said.

The ministry could also stop preventive culling before the 20 Jan 2017 deadline if bird flu was to stabilise before, a ministry official said.

Southwestern France, home to most producers of foie gras -- which is made of duck and geese liver -- had already been the centre of a severe episode of bird flu last year [2016], although outbreaks involved other strains.

[5] Israel (Tel Aviv): wild birds, park
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2017

http://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/441691


Bird flu was discovered this morning [Thu 5 Jan 2017] in the Ramat-Gan National Park following the deaths of 2 ducks and a goose in the park. Professional consultation held between the relevant bodies in the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Health, the NPA [National reserves and parks Authority], the Ramat Gan National Park, and the Ramat Gan municipality, it was agreed that the type being diagnosed is not dangerous to humans.

The dead birds were sent to the diagnostic laboratory at the Veterinary Institute in Beit Dagan and policy coordinated with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture. Park operations will continue as usual, while also continuing to follow the birds in the park. The public can continue to visit the national park as usual.

[Most likely the event above is caused by HPAI H5N8, becoming Israel's outbreak no. 20, since the start of the event in November 2016. All 20 outbreaks are presented on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/z8zzdcg (for the details of each outbreak, left-click on its sign).

HPAI H5N8 virus detection continues to be reported in previously affected countries in Europe, in Israel, and possibly in India. In particular, outbreaks in poultry have been reported in Germany, Sweden, Romania, Poland, Hungary, France, Bulgaria, and Israel.

Since its detection in early June 2016 in wild birds in Tyva (Russian Federation/RUS), H5N8 HPAI has been spreading globally probably mainly along wild birds' migratory routes. Since mid-October [2016] it was reported in several species of wild or domestic birds in India, in 18 countries in Europe (Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, RUS, Finland, Romania, France, Serbia, Ukraine, UK, Bulgaria, and Greece) and most probably also the Czech Republic, in 3 countries in Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria), and in Iran and Israel. Its circulation in the Middle and Near East may not be limited to the latter 2 countries; surveillance deserves to be intensified in other countries situated along the Eurasian-African migratory birds flyways. - Mod.AS
