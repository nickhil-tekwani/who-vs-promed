A total of 100 000 ducks were culled at a poultry farm in Fuzesgyarmat, a town in south eastern Hungary, after bird flu was discovered there, MTI reported on Monday [2 Mar 2015]. This flu, type H5N8, is not known to have infected humans. National chief veterinarian Lajos Bognar told MTI that bird flu was found on only a single farm in Bekes County, albeit at all 4 of its sites. All birds on the farm, more than 100 000 ducks, were culled over the weekend and disinfection will take most of the week.

A 3-km protected area and a 10-sq km area of observation have been set up around the farm. Animals on all farms within 3 km are undergoing thorough and repeated testing, and all poultry shipments from a 10-km area have been restricted.

It is believed that migrating birds coming north in the spring are responsible for spreading the virus.

The national bureau for Food Chain Safety reported that Japan, Singapore and South Korea have halted imports of poultry and eggs from Hungary, and South Africa and Hong Kong have introduced restrictions.

Hungarian officials have asked that the restrictions be limited to poultry and poultry products from Bekes County, which, said Bognar, has been put under a European Union duck-shipment quarantine by the Hungarian authorities. No ducks will be shipped from Bekes County for 30 days following complete disinfection of the area where the virus was found, Bognar said.

[Hungary reported to the OIE on 25 Feb 2015 its first outbreak of HPAI H5N8, on a duck farm at Fuzesgyarmat, Bekes (south eastern Hungary). The initial notification, covered in ProMED-mail posting 20150226.3192301, included the following information on the affected population: "On 23 Feb 2015, a suspicion of avian influenza was reported to the National Food Chain Safety Office. The local authority immediately visited the affected holding, which is located in Fuzesgyarmat, in Bekes County. 22 000 fattening ducks are kept in the holding. Neurological signs, nasal discharge, and increased mortality were observed. Official samples were taken on the same day. On 24 Feb 2015, the National Reference Laboratory confirmed avian influenza H5N8 strain. In the neighborhood of the affected holding, there are 3 contact holdings. All the birds kept in the affected and in the contact holdings will be killed and destroyed."

It appears that the current media report addresses the accomplished culling of the affected holding (reportedly, including 22 000 fattening ducks) as well as the ducks on the 3 contact holdings, a total of about 100 000 culled animals. - Mod.AS
