An Egyptian woman died on [Wed 17 Dec 2014] of bird flu [avian influenza] bringing the number of deaths of bird flu to 9 cases since the beginning of the year [2014], Al-Masry Al-Youm [the Arabic version of the newspaper Egypt Independent] reports.

A statement published on the Health Ministry's official website said 190 Egyptians have been infected with the virus since 2006. The statement added 72 cases have died and 2 patients are still receiving treatment at hospital.

The infected human cases which emerged during the year 2014 were exposed to infected dead birds, according to the statement.

The woman who died of bird flu [Wed 17 Dec 2014] was a 20-year-old student from al-Ghanayem City, Assiut, Al-Masry Al-Youm reported. Assiut University Hospital received the woman 3 days ago but her condition deteriorated. She was placed on a ventilator before she caught pneumonia and died.

The death rate of bird flu in Egypt is 37.4 percent compared to 55 percent on the international level, mostly in China. Around 2 million workers involved in the poultry industry and 8 million people of their relatives have been harmed since the emergence of bird flu in Egypt, according to the State Information Service.

The World Health Organization published a report in 2014 on influenza A (H5) activity from 18 Feb to 23 Sep 2014 (http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201409_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf). The report mentioned that the infections by the A(H5) [virus] reported to the WHO by Egypt included poultry and humans.

WHO advised that travelers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from poultry or other animals. Travelers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travelers should follow standard food safety and hygiene practices.

[Human cases of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection first appeared in 2003, affecting 16 countries in middle Asia and the Far East. Although there has been a gradual decline in the number of cases overall, Egypt and Indonesia still predominate.

There has been little evidence of direct transmission of H5N1 virus from person to person, and case numbers have correlated with the habit of rearing various species of poultry in homes and allotments. In Egypt the positive cases have been widely distributed among the governorates. See the most recent WHO table of cumulative cases at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20141002CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf.

An epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset produced by WHO, summarises the available information and can be accessed at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_04December2014.pdf. - Mod.CP
