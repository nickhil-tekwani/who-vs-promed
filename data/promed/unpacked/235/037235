China and Vietnam reported major bird flu outbreaks in poultry on
Friday [4 Nov 2005], days before global health experts meet to refine
plans to control the virus that has killed more than 60 people in
Asia and spread to Europe.

Experts say the virus must be stopped in poultry to prevent more
people catching it, and nowhere is that fight more crucial than in
densely populated Asia, where farmers live side-by-side with poultry
and other livestock. In China, the world's most populous nation,
officials are struggling to control the spread of bird flu in poultry.

In the 4th outbreak in a month, nearly 9000 chickens had died and 369
000 domestic birds were culled within a 3-km radius in Liaoning
province, an official at the Agriculture Ministry said. The outbreak
was detected last week.

"370 000 in one outbreak to be destroyed is really, really big. This
is not a good signal," said Noureddin Mona, China representative for
the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.

Authorities in Japan ordered the culling of 180 000 chickens at a
poultry farm after avian flu antibodies were found in the birds. In
Vietnam, where 41 people are known to have died of avian flu, a
24-year-old pregnant woman with a fever and respiratory problems is
the latest suspected case in Asia after Indonesia said on Thursday 3
children were being tested for bird flu. Results were expected in a few days.

State media said the woman came from Bac Giang province where bird
flu has infected poultry in 3 communes, killing more than 3000
chickens, ducks and geese.

Joint News Release WHO/FAO/OIE/World Bank/ GLOBAL MEETING TO DEVELOP
COMMON APPROACH ON AVIAN INFLUENZA AND HUMAN PANDEMIC
------------------------------
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is firmly established among animals in
Asia and has begun to extend its reach into Europe. From 7-9 Nov
2005, more than 400 animal and human health experts, senior policy
makers, economists and industry representatives will gather in Geneva
to work towards a strategy to control the virus in domestic animals
and prepare for a potential human influenza pandemic.

The disease in animals caused by the H5N1 influenza virus has
resulted in the culling of at least 150 million birds in the last 2
years. H5N1 remains for the moment an animal disease, but the World
Health Organization (WHO) has warned that H5N1 is a virus that has
the potential to ignite a human influenza pandemic.

While no one can predict the timing or severity of the next influenza
pandemic, governments around the world are taking the threat
seriously. A series of international meetings held over the last 10
weeks will culminate in the Geneva meeting. The meeting is
co-organized by WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the World Bank. The
goal of the meeting is to work towards a strategy for controlling the
disease in animals while simultaneously preparing for a potential
human pandemic.

Because influenza pandemics have typically caused enormous social and
economic disruption, WHO is advising its member states to develop
national strategies to cope with such a public health emergency, as
well as coordinating with international partners to develop a
comprehensive response.

The Geneva meeting will first consider how to contain the H5N1 virus
in birds. "There is still a window of opportunity for substantially
reducing the risk of a human pandemic evolving from H5N1 by
controlling the virus at its source, in animals," says Joseph
Domenech, FAO Chief Veterinary Officer. As the FAO expects avian
influenza to reach the Middle East and Africa in the near future, it
is essential that the global community and affected countries
mobilize more resources to combat the virus, which is thought to be
spread in part by migratory birds, before it becomes embedded in new regions.

Strengthening disease surveillance systems worldwide will also be
high on the agenda at the Geneva meeting. Early detection and rapid
response mechanisms are essential to tracking the evolution of the
H5N1 virus. Therefore, delegates will also discuss ways to strengthen
veterinary and human health services so that any H5N1 cases -- in
animals or humans -- will be identified quickly. "This is crucial for
the prevention of any future global crisis associated with emerging
animal diseases potentially transmissible to humans," says Dr Bernard
Vallat, Director-General of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

At the same time that animal control efforts are to be intensified,
several critical issues related to potential human disease remain to
be addressed. Meetings in the last several months have identified
several key pandemic preparedness issues. For example, many countries
are concerned about the lack of access to antiviral medicines and the
antiquated production methods for human influenza vaccines.
Communication with the public is also a critical issue. These and
other topics will be on the agenda for the Geneva meeting.

The meeting comes after a recent gathering of experts in Geneva (2-3
Nov 2005) to discuss the development of pandemic influenza vaccines.
At present, at least 10 vaccine developers in about as many countries
are carrying out demonstration projects to develop and evaluate
vaccines primarily against the H5N1 subtype. Participants expressed
the need for continued sharing of technical information, strengthened
international coordination of work related to pandemic influenza
vaccines so as to avoid duplication of efforts, support to vaccine
research initiatives in developing countries and integrating the
science into the public health context.

"It's impossible to exaggerate how important pandemic preparedness
is, and how dire the consequences would be for the entire world if
some of the worst-case scenarios for a human influenza pandemic were
to unfold," says James Adams, the World Bank's Vice-President for
Operations Policy and Country Services, and head of the Bank's avian
flu taskforce. The Geneva meeting will provide an opportunity for all
international partners to mobilize the country commitment and
financial resources needed to manage this global threat.

"For the first time in human history, we have a chance to prepare
ourselves for a pandemic before it arrives," says Dr Margaret Chan,
Representative of the WHO Director-General for Pandemic Influenza.
"It is incumbent upon the global community to act now."
