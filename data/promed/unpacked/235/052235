A total of 18 poisoned horses are being treated to spa days in their Florida stables, with their young riders brushing their manes and tails, painting their hooves, feeding them hay, and petting their noses.

There's nothing else anyone can do for the doomed horses at Masterpiece Equestrian Center in Davie who ate a batch of feed tainted by additives safe for other livestock but toxic to horses.

The feed arrived at the center in September [2014], and all 22 horses there ate the feed for a month before anyone realized something was wrong. 3 horses died in October, and a 4th was euthanized [Mon 15 Dec 2014]. The rest will die, some possibly as soon as this week.

'There's very little to do other than keep them hydrated, giving them lots of hay, giving them lots of comfort, brushing them, giving them attention and love and baths -- it makes the horses happy to be attended to,' said [a woman] from Weston, whose 2 horses are among the afflicted. [Her] 2 teenage daughters, one of whom wears her horse's nickname on a necklace, have aspirations to be elite equestrians. 'It's really quite hopeless, to be honest with you,' [the woman] said [Tue 16 Dec 2014]. 'It is hopeless and there are no words.'

The 1st horse died [15 Oct 2014], dragging its back feet and collapsing as it tried to stand. Everyone thought it was colic, a relatively common disorder of a horse's digestive system, [she] said. Then a 2nd horse suffered similar signs and died 2 days later, and a 3rd horse quickly followed.

Necropsies and testing of the horses' feed confirmed monensin poisoning.

Monensin is an antibiotic added to feed for cattle and some poultry to help with growth, but it's toxic to horses' muscles, particularly their hearts, said Serena Craft of the University of Florida Veterinary Diagnostic Lab.

Since October [2014], the horses' owners have sought to keep their animals comfortable and prepare for the inevitable.

All riding lessons have been replaced by vigils kept over weakening horses.

Some parents of young riders tried to shield their children from the tragedy slowly unfolding, telling them that the horses were getting ready to retire, [the woman] said.

But the death [Mon 15 Dec 2014] of a pony used for riding lessons for many children, was a reminder that more losses are coming.

The Lakeland-based company that sold the feed to Masterpiece has recalled the product, stopped producing equine feeds and acknowledged that feed delivered to the center contained monensin and lasalocid, another anti-bacterial additive toxic to horses.

Lakeland Animal Nutrition believes the contamination was limited to the feed at Masterpiece, and no other horses elsewhere have been reported ill, general manager Jonathan Lang said in an email.

"Care of the animal and our customers' trust are paramount to us, and we are committed to working with the Masterpiece Equestrian family to bring restoration in the midst of their tragic losses," Lang wrote.

Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is investigating.

The company has been urged to compensate the owners before Christmas, as Masterpiece and the owners of 20 horses consider filing a lawsuit, said the attorney representing them, Andy Yaffa.

The horses ranged from ponies worth USD 25 000 to USD 50 000 to elite competitors worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, Yaffa said.
Some of the owners have life insurance policies on their horses.

'This has completely stopped my life and my business, and I just want them to make it right so I can move forward,' said Danica Pryce, whose parents own the center.

[Monensin is an ionophore. Ionophores modify the movement of ions across the membranes of rumen microbes. While there are many biological responses reported in the literature for monensin, they can be consolidated into 7 categories or system modes of action. The modification of volatile fatty acid production is one widely recognized category of great importance. This shift in volatile fatty acids results in improved feed efficiency. Some ionophores also function as a coccidiostat.

However, ionophores are toxic to the heart of equines. There are a number of different ionophores and they vary in the their toxicity to the horse. Sadly monensin is one of the more toxic ionophores.

While this type of toxicity does not occur often, it does occasionally occur and is sometimes the result of such a feed mixing error.

All in all, a very tragic event and we are sorry for all involved.
