Ah, now that I know there are so many infection control experts on the list ...
I am aware that guidelines published in the AJIC suggest that, for
nursing homes where MRSA is already present, there should be no rationale
for barring hospitals from sending them cases colonized by MRSA.
Nevertheless, we have a problem here, where hospitals have to accept
patients from nursing homes harbouring MRSA, yet are unable to discharge
them to nursing homes because of the requirement for MRSA clearance, which
is often not possible. I should like to find out if my colleaugues in the
USA and elsewhere face this problem and how it is tackled.
