While I empathize that the major obstacle to international reporting is
laboratory-based diagnosis (Int. J. Epidemiol.), I wonder if this solution
will achieve its desired ends. We have experience with three syndromic
definitions; Polio, Smallpox and HIV. The two targeted for eradication
worked well, the HIV definitions (Bangui, Caracas and Atlanta) were uneven
at best.
To make a wholescale commitment to syndromic experience at this point begs
further operations research, and I trust the IHR revisions committee will
commit to carrying out such important studies to determine the positive
predictive value, true and false positives of such reporting.
