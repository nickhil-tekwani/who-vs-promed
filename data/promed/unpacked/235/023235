2000/179 Studies on fungi associated with root rot and vine decline of
melons in California (USA). [edited
--------------------------------------
Melons (_Cucumis melo_) are important crops in California [USA. In 1999
they were planted on approximately 37 500 ha (68% of the US production).
The occurrence of fungi associated with root rot and vine decline has been
[demonstrated by surveys in commercial melon fields from 1995 to 1997.
The most commonly found fungi species, isolated from diseased roots, were
the following: _Acremonium cucurbitacearum_ (EPPO Alert list - recovered
from plants in 32 % of surveyed fields), _Rhizopycnis vagum_ (a recently
described species, implicated in vine decline in Rio Grande Valley in Texas
- 31%), _Pythium_ spp. (23 %), _Macrophomina phaseolina_ (23 %),
_Verticillium dahliae_ (25 %), _Fusarium solani_ (21 %), _Monosporascus
cannonballus_ (EPPO Alert list - 15 %) and _Rhizoctonia solani_ (7 %).
Symptomatology varied according to the species found, but with some overlap
of symptoms. [Often 2 or more species were isolated. For example, _A.
cucurbitacearum_ and _R. vagum_ often occurred together. The frequency of
isolation of a given fungus also varied with geographical location. _M.
cannonballus_ was only present in the southern production areas, whereas
_A. cucurbitacearum_ and _R. vagum_ were most common in the northern
production areas.
Pathogenicity tests in field microplots and glasshouses gave conflicting
results. _M. cannonballus_ caused vine collapse and severe root rot of
melon in field microplot tests. _R. vagum_ and _A. cucurbitacearum_ were
weakly pathogenic in field microplots, but caused root discoloration and
reduced vine growth in glasshouse tests. Colonization of melon roots by
_A. cucurbitacearum_, _R. vagum_ and _M. cannonballus_ may contribute to
plant decline, but other environmental factors are likely to be involved in
the disease and need to be determined.

[According to the authors, _A. cucurbitacearum_ has been reported in
California, but this is the first report of its widespread and frequent
occurrence throughout the state. Summer squash (_C. melo_) was found to be
resistant to the pathogen. This work is the first report of the presence
of _R. vagum_ in California. - Mod.DH
