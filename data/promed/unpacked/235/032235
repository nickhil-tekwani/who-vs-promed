EBOLA RESTON - PHILIPPINES (5)
==========================

Date: Mon, 17 June 1996
Last Monday, 10 June, according to news wire reports not subsequently seen
published in newspapers, the Philippines lifted its ban on monkey exports from
four breeding farms which showed no infection with Ebola Reston. Ferlite was
the only facility still kept under the ban. Monkeys there were found with
the virus.
Although the ban is lifted, monkey exports must still be approved by the
departments of health and agriculture.
