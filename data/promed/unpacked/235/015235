Below is the information I received by phone from Novosibirsk SanEpi Center.
According to the data of laboratory investigation, the preliminary clinical
diagnosis of anthrax has not been confirmed (this information had been
firstly told me last week but I awaited final results). _S. aureus_ and _S.
epidermidis_ were found at the ulcer content. I would like to remind
[everyone that immediately after finding this suspicious case (almost 2
weeks ago) the SanEpi people stopped the production at the plant, made a
full investigation of procedures there, found violations of sanitary rules
and ordered them corrected before starting the production again. As I was
told, the plant administration allowed them to make all the needed procedures.
The patient became healthy and left hospital.
So, according to this information, the incident is over. The case seems to
be non-usual [unusualand therefore we in Vector will try to find the
opportunity to make an additional investigation using modern diagnostic
methods. We will also pay special attention to similar cases in the future.

[It is worth noting that the isolation of _S. aureus_ and _S. epidermidis_
from a cutaneous ulcer does not indicate that either of these bacteria were
the cause of this patient's illness. There is a significant difference
between bacterial infection and bacterial colonization, and the mere
presence of these bacteria does not rule out other causes of infection. -
