The Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHDA), Dr Aliyu Yabagi Shehu on [Wed 4 Nov 2015] said that 109 cases of measles including 5 deaths have been recorded in Niger State in the past 10 months.

These cases were due to the refusal of parents to vaccinate their wards during measles vaccination days as most of the affected cases were of children between 9 months to 5 years.

Shehu confirmed that 109 cases of measles including 5 deaths that have been recorded in the State in the past 10 months was as a result of non adherence of parents to vaccination.

He however disclosed that 4392 cases of measles were reported in 296 local government areas in 32 states of the nation in 2014.

The Executive Director, further said that the agency intends to carry out a one week vaccination campaign during which 907 367 children will be vaccinated.

He therefore called for the mobilization of people in the forthcoming vaccination campaign against measles adding that measles vaccination have prevented an estimated death of 15.6 million and have reduced global measles death by 75 per cent.

The State Immunization Officer (SIO), Dr Samuel Jiya said that the agency is working hard to reduce the annual measles incidence and achieve 95 per cent coverage during vaccination campaigns.

Jiya expressed optimism that measles can be fought and that by 2020, the nation intends to reduce the measles mortality rate by 95 per cent.

He called on mothers, traditional, and religious leaders to mobilize their people and ensure that they come out to vaccinate their wards.

[This report highlights low compliance to measles vaccination in Niger state, Nigeria, resulting in 4392 measles cases in 2014 alone. During the 1st 10 months of 2015, 109 cases of measles including 5 deaths have been recorded in Niger State, with children aged 9 months to 5 years being the most affected. This highlights the accumulation of unvaccinated cohorts from the recent years resulting from low routine immunization coverage for measles. Regular follow up measles campaigns targeting children 9 to 59 months with an effective communication and social mobilization strategy to ensure good coverage would be required to reverse the current trend.

[A lack of measles vaccination and of other childhood preventable illness vaccination campaigns in this area due to the ongoing conflict may have contributed to the spread of measles, possibly through the arrival of an unvaccinated child population.

This complex emergency setting involving malnutrition, overcrowded internally displaced refugee camps, and a lack of childhood vaccination services has created a situation in which measles has become endemic in this area, which has not been free of outbreaks for a long time.

Additional information from knowledgeable sources with regard to ongoing measles cases and clinical and epidemiological data would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MM

The Health Ministry vaccinated 14.9 million children against measles during the 1st week of a national campaign taking place across governorates, according to a Saturday [7 Nov 2015] ministry statement.

The campaign kicked off [31 Oct 2015] and is expected to last until [21 Nov 2015]. It targets to inoculate 24 million children from 9 months to 10 years old against measles and rubella (also known as German measles.)

Some 82 000 trained medical crew members are partaking in the campaign, the cost of which is estimated at 165 million EGP (USD 20 million.)

The ministry has also stated it is using MMR, a "safe vaccine" against measles, [mumps], and rubella.

Approximately 5000 children have been infected with the disease [measles] since January 2015, according to Youm7.

In 2014, the rate of infection among children reached some 1740 cases, according to press statements by former Minister of Health Adel el-Adawy. Deaths cases of at least 6 were reported last year [2014].

Measles is among the most contagious viral diseases, and its symptoms include fever, conjunctivitis, runny nose, cough and skin rash, which is often the 1st sign of illness.

At least 2 minors reportedly died of measles in Ambar tehsil of Mohmand Agency [Federally Administered Tribal Areas, FATA] on [Tue 10 Nov 2015]. An official privy to the development told The Express Tribune the deceased have been identified as the children of a resident of the area. "The children were of aged 2 and 4, respectively," he added.

According to the official, there is a dearth of suitable health facilities in Mohmand Agency to tackle such medical emergencies. "More often than not, patients are treated by unqualified doctors," he said. [Even with adequate medical care, measles may result in death in approximately 1 per 1000 cases. Vitamin A deficiency has been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. - Mod.LM]

However, health officials in Mohmand Agency have not confirmed the deaths. Many of them have also denied there is a measles outbreak in the agency. "We have reason to believe the minors contracted a cold which eventually led to their death," a health official said.
