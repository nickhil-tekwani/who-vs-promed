["Bovine babesiosis is a tickborne, parasitic infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in cattle. It is the most important arthropodborne disease of cattle worldwide. The most prevalent species, _Babesia bovis_ and _B. bigemina_, are found throughout most tropical and subtropical regions. The economic losses from these 2 organisms can be considerable, particularly in developing countries.

"Bovine babesiosis can be found wherever the tick vectors exist, but it is most common in tropical and subtropical areas. _B. bovis_ and _B. bigemina_ are particularly important in Asia, Africa, Central and South America, parts of southern Europe, and Australia. Although _B. bovis_ is usually found in the same general geographic area as _B. bigemina_, slightly different groups of ticks spread these 2 species, and some differences in their distribution can be seen." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bovine_babesiosis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
