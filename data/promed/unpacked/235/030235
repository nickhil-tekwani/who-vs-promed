ANTHRAX, CATTLE - USA (MINNESOTA)

I have been informed by Bill Hartmann, Minnesota Board of Animal Health, of
an outbreak of anthrax affecting cattle near Hawley in western Minnesota.
Four animals on one farm are dead. Neil Dwyer, at the North Dakota
Diagnostic Laboratory, tells me that it has been confirmed in two --
presumably those were just the samples he was sent. Apparently the county
has not seen this disease in some time. It is not regarded historically as
an "anthrax" county.
There was a little excitement involved in that the renderer had collected
the carcasses before the diagnosis was made. The carcasses will be/are
being burnt and the cattle-truck should have been disinfected and cleaned
by now.
