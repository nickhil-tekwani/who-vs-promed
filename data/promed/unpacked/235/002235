[1] Netherlands, 54th mink farm infected
Date: Fri 18 Sep 2020
Source: News, Dutch government's website [in Dutch, trans. Mod.AS, edited]

At a mink farm in Meijel (municipality of Peel en Maas) with approximately 6500 mother animals, contamination with SARS-CoV-2 has been established. The infection came to light from the 'early warning', the monitoring system in which animals are tested for the virus every week. The holding will be cleared as early as possible.

A total of 54 mink farms in the Netherlands have now been declared infected.

For more information, see the last letter to the House of Representatives about SARS-CoV-2 in mink (https://tinyurl.com/y3j5rm4o) [see comment].

[The spread of SARS-CoV-2 into Netherland's mink farms continues with unchanged pace, in spite of the tightening of control measures as described in ProMED post 20200902.7740793 (addressing the experts' publication "Jumping back and forth: anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms"). Out of Netherlands' (about) 120 mink farms, 54 have already been found infected. The mechanism of the continued circulation of the virus in mink is yet to be explained. - Mod.AS]

[Denmark is the world's largest producer of mink skins. Since July 2020, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DVFA) has monitored Denmark's 1136 mink farms for the presence of the coronavirus (COVID-19). With a monitoring strategy and the stricter restrictions for infected mink farms, the DVFA and the Danish health authorities assessed that it is justifiable to let infected herds live because the risk of spreading infection to humans is minimal. Since 16 Sep 2020, the DVFA no longer issues press releases on individual findings of COVID-19 on Danish mink farms. Instead, herds with confirmed infections are identified on the DVFA's website in a continuously updated map and table. - Mod.AS
