Kenya Wildlife Service probes anthrax as 100 buffaloes die
----------------------------------------------------------
The Kenya Wildlife Service [KWS] has sent a team of experts to Lake Nakuru National Park following an outbreak of anthrax, which has killed 100 buffalos and 2 rhinos. KWS senior veterinary officer Dominic Mijele said samples taken from the animals confirmed they died of anthrax. "We have embarked on a decontamination exercise that will see all the endangered animals vaccinated," he said.

Dr Mijele said the investigation seeks to find the origin of the disease in order to come up with mitigative measures.

Announcing the outbreak, County Executive for Agriculture Stanley Chepkwony said the county government had imposed a quarantine in Rongai, Nakuru West, and Nakuru East following the outbreak, which was reported 5 days ago. Through a statement sent to the newsrooms, Dr Chepkwony said meat would not be allowed in and out of the quarantined areas. "We are also warning people not to come into contact with these animals or their meat. People should also make sure they consume inspected meat," he said.

He said free anthrax vaccination would begin today [22 Jul 2015] in all the affected areas to prevent further spread. "We will also be giving free anti-rabies vaccination for dogs because sometimes they spread anthrax by eating infected carcass," said Dr Chepkwony. He urged residents to report any symptoms of anthrax among domestic animals. The symptoms include fever, shivering, twitching, harsh dry coat, blood in the dung and nostrils, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms are dejection and reduced or complete loss of milk production.

Present during the ceremony was the park's Senior Warden Dickson Ritan.

[However, a subsequent report published in The Star on 23 Jul 2015 (http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/kws-denies-anthrax-killed-100-buffaloes) indicates that the Park senior warden Dickson Ritan said he, however, cannot comment much on the matter as KWS veterinarians are still carrying out tests. "At the moment no buffaloes have died of anthrax and our KWS veterinaries are still conducting tests." An open sewer near the park is causing concerns. Clarification of this situation by our Kenyan colleagues would be appreciated.

The last record I have of an anthrax case in the Lake Nakuru National Park involved a rhinoceros in 2001. For a description of the park in the Rift Valley, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nakuru. - Mod.MHJ]

[Perhaps the rhino that died in 2001 contaminated the soil with its blood. It would be ineteresting to know if the rhinos that have just died frequented the same spot. - Mod.JW
