[1] case update
- Sat 29 Sep 2018 Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 28 Sep 2018:
- A total of 157 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 126 confirmed and 31 probable.
- Of the 126 confirmed, 71 died and 45 are cured.
- 23 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo [North Kivu].
- No new deaths.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- The last confirmed case reported to Butembo [North Kivu] is a woman who started the symptoms around 20 Sep 2018. At first, family members, who are supporters of national deputy Crispin Mbindule Mitono, refused to transfer her to the Ebola treatment center (ETC) and hid her. The family refused to see the teams of the response in the absence of the members of the "Standing Parliament", a pressure group of the Furu district in Butembo.

- When the condition of the patient deteriorated, the pressure group, which was in negotiation with Butembo's sub-coordination, finally called on the emergency team to transfer the patient to the ETC. Upon their arrival at ETC, samples were taken and they were positive. Thus, all of the patient's family members, members of the lobby group, and the member of Parliament herself were registered as at-risk contacts. This Sat 29 Sep 2018, all those at risk have agreed to be vaccinated in the health zone of Katwa [North Kivu].

- As a reminder, last August 2018, the MP said in the media that the Ebola virus disease was created in laboratories and was moved from the province of Equateur to Beni to exterminate the population. He also advised against his supporters to accept the vaccination. Thus, the involvement of the MP and the pressure group is a major step forward in social mobilization and the lifting of the last Butembo resistance wall.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 12 614 people have been vaccinated , including 4152 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3829 in Beni [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [North Kivu], 1043 in Katwa [North Kivu], 944 in Butembo [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 224 in Tchomia [Ituri], 170 in Bunia [Ituri], 164 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has partnered with survivors of Ebola virus disease [EVD] to help prevent transmission, combat stigma, and stop the spread of the epidemic.

"Survivors share their experiences with affected communities through public presentations and radio testimony," the Fund said in a statement released on Fri 28 Sep 2018.

According to the latest statement from the Ministry of Health, 43 people have survived the disease since the beginning of the epidemic in August 2018. These survivors are "living proof that it is possible to defeat EVD, especially if it is detected and treated quickly," said Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano, UNICEF representative in the DRC.

"Testimonials from these Ebola survivors help us reduce fear in communities and encourage people with Ebola-like symptoms to get to an Ebola treatment center quickly, avoiding the risk of transmission," adds the humanitarian officer.

Ignorance of the population's prevention and treatment measures increases the risk of its spread.

The UN agency announces that it has set up intervention teams in the localities of Mangina, Beni, Butembo (North Kivu) and in the locality of Tchomia, on Lake Albert, in the province of Ituri.

Survivors' testimonies in Mangina, the health zone most affected by the epidemic, "have already proven their effectiveness," says UNICEF.

The Minister of Health announced in early September 2018 that the epidemic was "under control " in Mangina.

"Giving Ebola survivors the opportunity to publicly share their experiences helps reduce stigma, giving survivors a positive role in their communities, and helping them recover from the Ebola virus experience", adds Dr Rotigliano.

This declared outbreak in an area of armed conflict affects northern North Kivu province and 2 localities in Ituri province. ["It has killed 71 people of the 126 confirmed cases, according to the Congolese health authority update of 28 Sep 2018 -- see [1] above]

The UN remains pessimistic about the outcome of this epidemic. Its health agency (WHO) on Tue 25 Sep 2018 expressed its fear of seeing "a potentially disastrous situation" in the coming weeks in Ebola-affected areas.

[Having survivors provide testimonials to the community should help reincorporate the survivors into the community at the same time as educate the community on prevention and recognition of Ebola. It is a good approach all around. - Mod.LK

[3] Uganda (Bundibugyo): media reports of suspect cases as yet unconfirmed
Date: Sat 29 Sep 2018

Two people who presented what looked like signs and symptoms of Ebola have been transferred to an Isolation Unit at Bundibugyo [Uganda] Heath Centre IV.

"Blood samples have been taken to Kampala awaiting results," Bundibugyo District Health Officer, Mr Majidu Bagonza told the District Ebola Preparedness Team during a meeting at the district headquarters on [Fri 29 Sep 2018].

Mr Bagonza said they are still looking for 2 Congolese who are said to have attended the burial of an Ebola patient who died at Kasenyi on the shores of Lake Albert in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and are said to have crossed to Ngamba sub-county in Bundibugyo district.

"We received information from our colleagues in Ntoroko district on [Wed 26 Sep 2018] that 2 Congolese have entered Bundibugyo. We are still following up on them such that they don't infect our people," Mr Bagonza said.

Bundibugyo district being at the Uganda-DR Congo border, is among the districts on high alert following the outbreak of the disease in the neighbouring country because of its porous borders.

The District Health Inspector, Mr Ismail Mbakania said the district Ebola Preparedness Team is mobilising and sensitising the community on the preventive measures of the deadly disease.

The district authorities have resolved to establish a toll free line at the district headquarters and an emergency line at the district's main hospital. The district authorities have also set up hand-washing facilities at the screening centres along the border points of Busunga and Butogo.

Recent outbreak
---------------
In 2007, an Ebola outbreak struck Bundibugyo district affecting over 176 people, killing 36 people including 5 health workers.
