"HEALTHY CUP" app is part of an innovative project to improve public health surveillance in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), named participatory surveillance. It is a free Web application, designed for use on mobile devices and web browsers.

It's a simple process that relies on voluntary participation by visitors or residents in Brazil, reporting their health status through information on 10 signs/symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, joint pain, headache, bleeding, and exanthema [rash]) during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil. "HEALTHY CUP" was developed in Portuguese, English, and Spanish to be a complementary channel for health information and services to users, enabling the participation of all.

This project is an initiative of the Surveillance Department of the Ministry of Health in partnership with the Departments of Health of the venues of the matches and other national and international institutions such as the Skoll Global Threats Fund, TEPHINET, HealthMap, and ProMED-mail.

[The 2014 FIFA World Cup, as with other mass gathering events, poses a significant challenge to the host country as well as member countries with respect to disease surveillance. Surely this presents a unique opportunity to improve on disease surveillance activities in terms of flow of information in existing surveillance systems, procedures, and operational plans for contingencies and emergency plans. Moreover, this has provided the opportunity for the design of new strategies and technologies to be introduced, tested, and validated as a contribution to the continued improvement in public health disease surveillance. In this context, "HEALTHY CUP" app, a project of participatory surveillance, should be seen as a legacy of the 2014 FIFA World Cup for the future. ProMED-mail is greatly satisfied in being able to contribute to the project and inviting its subscribers to participate, as well as promoting the use of this innovative tool by the general public, travellers, and health professionals working in the areas of healthcare and disease surveillance. - Mod.RNA]
