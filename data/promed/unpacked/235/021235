A potentially dangerous species of mosquito not found before in Ventura County has emerged in Simi Valley with more people reporting bites every day.

"We are being flooded with calls," said Ron Ventura, supervisor with the Ventura County Environmental Health Division. "We're getting a dozen calls a day at least."

The small black mosquito with white stripes on its back and legs is called _Aedes aegypti_, or yellow fever mosquito. Found in Kern and Los Angeles counties and long suspected of having crossed into Ventura County, the aggressive day-biting insect was found in Simi Valley on 9 Sep [2020] after a resident reported being bitten.

The mosquitoes generate concern because they have the potential to transmit dangerous viruses including Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.

Though the invasive _Aedes_ have been found in rising numbers across California, state public health officials say there have been no known cases of mosquito transmission of Zika or the other illnesses.

Officials are concerned the mosquitoes could become carriers by biting returning travelers who were infected in other parts of the world where the viruses are more common including Central America, Mexico, and Asia.

The 1st _Ae. aegypti_ in Simi Valley was found south of Sycamore Drive and Fitzgerald Road. The mosquitoes have also been discovered in eastern regions of the city. As of Monday morning [21 Sep 2020], 15 of the insects had been trapped, all in Simi.

"We want to identify as many neighborhoods in Simi Valley to figure out the extent of the infestation," he said, noting the species is unusual because it often bites during the day. "This is a very aggressive mosquito," Ventura said. "A female would bite about 30 times looking for a blood meal."

Environmental health workers are inspecting sites in the vicinity of where the mosquitoes have been reported in a process complicated by COVID-19 and involving masks and social distancing.

Emphasizing there has been no known mosquito transmissions in California of Zika or the other viruses linked to the invasive _Aedes_, Ventura said people should contact their doctors if they become sick or have adverse reactions to bites.

They should also protect themselves by eliminating any standing water that could serve as a breeding ground. The mosquitoes lay their eggs just above the water in containers like dishes under potted [plants], bird baths, tires, ornamental fountains, and children's toys. The invasive _Aedes_ can breed in very small places like water that is cupped by certain plants or in open lids and caps. Dump out any water and get rid of the containers that held it, Ventura said.

The mosquitoes can be found indoors too. "This mosquito has an affinity for humans. They'll establish and breed in their homes," he said, emphasizing the importance of repellent, tight-fitting screens and snug doors.

Eliminating the water is a primary purpose of the site inspections. Ventura said sites may also be treated with pesticides.

Another mosquito species found in California and linked to Zika and other viruses is _Ae. albopictus_, known as the Asian tiger mosquito. That species has not yet been discovered in Ventura County but has been found in Los Angeles County.

"It's possible," said Ventura of the presence of the species locally. "We always felt the invasives were here in Ventura County."

For protection against all mosquitoes, people should remove standing water and protect their homes with screens. They should wear long-sleeve shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes.

Ventura said they should also use an EPA-approved insect repellent.

Authorities on Tuesday [22 Sep 2020] announced the 1st ever detection in Yolo County of an invasive mosquito that prefers to bite people during the day and has the potential to transmit serious diseases, including Zika.

The adult female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, more commonly known as a yellow fever mosquito, was found in a trap near East and Main streets in Winters, according to a news release from the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District. Officials planned to set up additional traps in surrounding neighborhoods to help assess the spread of the infestation.

"Finding this mosquito for the 1st time likely means it could possibly be established anywhere," District Manager Gary Goodman said in the news release. "We will continue to work diligently to look for and identify locations where these mosquitoes can be breeding."

The district also planned to send field technicians to conduct door-to-door inspections looking for potential mosquito breeding sites, conduct appropriate treatments as necessary, and talk to residents about preventive measures around their home.

The mosquito found in Yolo County also was 1st time this season that invasive mosquitoes were found within the district's boundaries, officials said. In August 2019, invasive mosquitoes were found for the 1st time in Citrus Heights and Antelope. But invasive mosquitoes have not been found anywhere in Sacramento County this season, district officials said.

These mosquitoes are now permanently established throughout the state and were recently found for the 1st time in Shasta counties, too, according to the Sacramento-Yolo district. In San Joaquin County, authorities detected the species last year [2019] and found them again in July [2020].

Mosquitos of all breeds lay eggs above water in small containers such as flowerpots, pet dishes, bird baths, tin cans, tires, and other containers as small as a bottle cap commonly found in backyards, district officials said.

Goodman asked residents to call the district for a free inspection if they are bitten during the day or notice more mosquitoes in their yard. He also urged all residents to inspect their yards daily and drain all sources of stagnant water.

While [_Aedes] aegypti_ can transmit a number of serious diseases such as Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, no known cases of illnesses associated with the pest have been linked to a mosquito bite in California.

The district planned to set up additional traps in surrounding neighborhoods that will help assess the spread of the infestation. Residents with mosquito bites during the day should call 800-429-1022 or request service at <fightthebite.net>.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are increasing their geographic range in California. Now 2 new locations, Ventura and Yolo counties, California, are added to the geographic range of _Ae. aegypti_. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier this year (2020). _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years. Although the above reports point out that the probability of introduction of any of these mentioned viruses with ongoing transmission is unlikely, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito in the localities where they have recently been found as quickly as possible is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
