Turkey confirms H5N1 bird flu strain in chickens
------------------------------------------------
Turkish authorities confirmed on Tuesday [22 Jan 2008] the presence of the
deadly bird flu virus among chickens in a village in the northern Black Sea
region.

An Agriculture Ministry spokesman confirmed that the virus was the H5N1
strain of bird flu. "Two days of laboratory examinations have been
completed and H5N1 was detected in the chickens," the ministry's spokesman
Tunc Tuncel told Reuters.

The virus was found among dead chickens that were collected from Saz
village in Zonguldak province on Saturday [19 Jan 2008] and following
examinations the bird flu virus was detected, the Agriculture Ministry said
in a statement. "All necessary measures have been taken around Saz
village," it said without giving details.

The village was put under quarantine and all animal movements were halted,
Muzaffer Aydemir, the Agriculture Ministry's General Director of Protection
and Control, told Kanal 24 television. He said the authorities had not
begun culling poultry in the region because the case looks like a limited
one. "This is a very limited case. Only spotted in chickens of a citizen
who hunts wild birds. We are sure that the virus passed to the chickens
from wild birds," Aydemir said.

He said the area surrounding the village was disinfected, but no other
cases have been reported so far. Consumers should not stop buying poultry
products, he said, and 12 teams of veterinary and other experts were
working in the area to stop the disease spreading.

An outbreak of bird flu in the winter of 2006 hit Turkey's tourism industry
and caused great damage to the poultry sector. A total of 4 people died
from the H5N1 strain in eastern Turkey in 2006 after being in contact with
diseased birds.

Turkey lies on the migratory route for wild birds flying south from
Scandinavia and Siberia to north Africa for winter.

Avian flu outbreak abating, says Egyptian government
----------------------------------------------------
Egypt's Supreme Committee to Combat Bird Flu -- a government body -- said
on 19 Jan 2008 that infection rates among poultry in farms and homes had
dropped sharply since the second week of January [Read this report in
Arabic at <http://arabic.irinnews.org/ReportArabic.aspx?SID=536>]. It said
this was largely due to a public awareness campaign and the intensification
of vaccination initiatives.

Last week [14-18 Jan 2008], Cabinet spokesman Magdi Radi said 60 per cent
of poultry reared domestically had been vaccinated and that the government
was stepping up efforts, especially in rural areas, to complete vaccination
of the remaining 40 per cent of poultry. Radi also said epidemiological
surveillance had been completed in the governorates of Dahaklia, Behera,
Giza, Fayyoum, and Gharbiyah.

At the same time, Nasr El-Sayed, an adviser at the Ministry of Health, said
that since the beginning of January 2008 fewer suspected human cases of
bird flu had been admitted to hospitals.

However, Amany Nakhla, regional planning assistant for avian flu in the
Cairo office of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA), warned against a slackening in the awareness phase. She said 15 new
suspected human cases of bird flu from the Delta area had been under
medical surveillance since 16 Jan 2008.

In stepping up its public awareness campaign on bird flu, the government is
cooperating with the World Health Organization (WHO). Zuhair Hallaj, the
WHO country representative, said that although the media campaign had been
slow in the last year [2007] positive steps had been taken in the past few
days to improve the communication strategy.

The high population density, popular dependence on poultry for income
generation and as a source of nutrition, limited slaughter-house capacity,
as well as the large number of households keeping poultry in their
backyards meant there were many challenges to the successful control of the
virus.

Nasser said, for example, that it was difficult to convince people to have
their poultry vaccinated. "Many people still refuse the inoculation and
culling of birds so we need a lot of human resources and teams to move from
house to house to look for the [domestically reared] birds," he said.
According to current government measures all farms proven infected with the
bird flu virus are shut down for a period of 6 months and all birds and
farm wastes on the farms are destroyed. The government further prohibits
moving poultry from one governorate to another or from one farm to another
without permission. Farm owners who do not abide by these regulations face
a penalty.

Ibrahim Kerdany, WHO spokesman for the Eastern Mediterranean region, said
the media campaigns were channelled through traditional media outlets
(newspapers, TV and radio) in the affected and high-risk governorates, and
especially through media centres affiliated to Egypt's State Information
Service (SIS).

So far, according to SIS, the government has issued about 250 000 bulletins
about bird flu and how one can protect oneself against it. In addition,
half a million fact sheets have been distributed to students to raise
awareness about the bird-flu issue, the reasons of infection and possible
ways of protection. According to Kerdany, a similar media campaign has also
been launched in Saudi Arabia.

Since the H5N1 virus was first detected in humans in Egypt in February
2006, 43 people have been infected with the virus throughout the country
and 19 of them have died.

[More details of the laboratory investigations regarding the Turkish
outbreak and in particular the genotyping results of the virus strain
involved would be helpful. It would be interesting to compare this strain's
genetic profile with the strain recently identified on the other side of
the Black Sea, namely in Crimea.

Turkey joins other infected Eastern Mediterranean countries, such as Egypt,
where the outbreaks are continuous since the beginning of 2006, as well as
other regional countries recently infected or reinfected, namely Saudi
Arabia, Iran, Israel and Crimea (south west Ukraine). Among those
countries, Egypt is the only one which has chosen to apply a vaccination
policy, mainly due to the fact that the disease is affecting large number
of small, non-commercial backyard poultry holdings.

Turkey and Egypt are the only countries in the region where human cases of
avian influenza have been recorded. This seems to be related to the
epidemiology of the disease in these countries, namely the involvement of
relatively large number of small backyard poultry holdings. - Mod.AS]
