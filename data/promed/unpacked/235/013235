American, Kenyan and South African wildlife scientists are in Tanzania to
study a strange disease which has been decimating the wildlife population
in the world-famous Ngorongoro Crater in the northern tourist circuit of
the country. The team of 11 researchers began its study last week after
Tanzanian wildlife authorities reported that a mysterious disease has
killed at least 600 animals in the past 10 months.
Ngorongoro Crater, dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World, is home to more
than 20 000 large animals, including some of Tanzania's remaining black
rhinos. The 8300 square-kilometre conservation area boasts of the finest
blend of landscape, wildlife, people and archaeological sites in Africa.
A Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority (NCAA) official said the
mysterious disease had attacked 323 buffalo, 193 wildebeest, 69 zebra, 7
rhinos, 6 lions, and 4 hippos since May 2000. "We don't know the cause of
the animal deaths, but early samples (red urine) show it is babesiosis,"
said Emmanuel Chausi. According to expert testimony, babesiosis is a
disease causing breathing problems due to lack of sufficient red cells
which supply oxygen in animals.
In 1994, a similar peculiar disease, later identified as Canine Distemper
[a viral infection, not a protozoan infection - Man. Ed. DS], killed more
than 2000 lions in the world-famous Serengeti National Park, also found in
the north of Tanzania.
Wildlife scientists fear an outbreak of such strange diseases in game
parks, if not immediately controlled, may wipe out the animal populations
vital for the booming tourist industry in the East African country.
"We have embarked on extensive research to control these dangerous diseases
to preserve our natural heritage," Chausi said. He said the deaths of
buffalo, zebras, and antelopes in the crater could be due to severe drought
which hit the northern part of Tanzania last year, causing widespread food
shortages among villagers surrounding the national parks.
"We suspect the prolonged drought also contributed to the deaths of some
animals like buffalo and antelopes because their carcasses were found near
water sources," he said.

[Babesiosis is caused by an intraerythrocytic protozoan parasite of the
genus _Babesia_. The main vectors are ticks. The acute disease generally
runs its course within about one week. It presents with fever, inappetence,
increased respiratory rate, muscle tremors, anemia, jaundice, and loss of
weight, with hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria in the final stages.
With virulent strains there may be hypotensive shock combined with
generalized nonspecific inflammation, coagulation disturbances, and
erythrocytic stasis in capillaries. Animals that recover remain infected
for years.
The diagnosis of babesiosis may be confirmed by examination of
Giemsa-stained blood or organ smears. There are a number of serologic tests
available for the detection of carrier animals. Treatments are available
but may be impractical in wildlife. Furthermore, not all treatments are
available in every country.
Human cases of babesiosis are most commonly due to _B. microti_ and can be
transmitted by ticks as well as via transfusion of blood products.
Since a blood smear can find the organism, it seems unlikely these animals
died of babesiosis. Surely other serological tests have been done by now. -
