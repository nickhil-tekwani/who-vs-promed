The Department of Infectious Diseases [DID] at Holy Family Hospital [HFH] in town [Rawalpindi, Punjab] received a total of 17 suspected patients of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) so far in the year 2018, of which only 3 were tested positive for CCHF; however experts still believe that people must follow preventive measures while dealing with sacrificial animals ahead of Eidul Azha [22 Aug 2018].

Data collected by 'The News' on Friday [17 Aug 2018] has revealed that from January this year to date, the HFH received a total of 17 suspects of CCHF including 7 suspects from district Rawalpindi, 4 from Chakwal, 2 each from Mianwali and Attock, and one each from Gujrat and AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir]. Of these suspects, one each from Rawalpindi, Mianwali, and Chakwal were confirmed positive for the infection while 14 were tested negative.

Of the 3 confirmed CCHF patients, 2 were discharged by the hospital after complete cure while a female patient who was taken to HFH from Mianwali on [21 Jun 2018] in critical condition expired at the emergency department of the hospital the next day. The HFH sent her blood sample to National Institute of Health, Islamabad that tested her positive for CCHF after her death.

The HFH received the last patient of CCHF on [25 Jul 2018] who was taken to the hospital from Chakwal. The patient was discharged on [3 Aug 2018] after achieving complete cure and at present, no CCHF suspect is undergoing treatment at the HFH, said Head of DID at HFH Professor Dr Muhammad Mujeeb Khan when contacted by 'The News' on [Fri 17 Aug 2018].

He, however, like other health experts said that people should not take panic but must follow proper preventive measures while handling with sacrificial animals.

["For the purposes of the R&D Blueprint, WHO has developed a special tool for determining which diseases and pathogens to prioritize for research and development in public health emergency contexts. This tool seeks to identify those diseases that pose a public health risk because of their epidemic potential and for which there are no, or insufficient, countermeasures. The diseases identified through this process are the focus of the work of R&D Blueprint." (http://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/en/).

"The 2nd annual review was conducted on 6-7 Feb 2018. Of the epidemic-prone diseases prioritized by the R&D Blueprint, CCHF is the most widespread: found in around 30 countries, CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia, south of the 50th parallel north (the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector), and is expected to continue to expand its range. Because of its epidemic potential, its high case fatality ratio (10-40 percent), its potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and the difficulties in treatment and prevention, CCHF constitutes a threat to public health services, and the WHO R&D Blueprint has prioritized it for research and development in public health emergency." (http://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever/en/).

In endemic countries (where capability exists) there is delay when relying on molecular diagnostics like RT-PCR which have to be undertaken in centralised reference labs. This delays time to treatment and isolation and increases risk to contacts and healthcare workers.

There is need for a commercially available, bio-safe, rapid, point of care test with the operational characteristics suited to field use or in low-resource and/or low capacity settings.

Active collaboration between endemic countries such as Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and Turkey for CCHF therapeutics research, with sharing of information across the health and research communities, can be helpful towards finding locally applicable solutions to this important zoonotic pathogen. - Mod.UBA
