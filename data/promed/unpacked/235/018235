Ten peacocks have died, and several others are suffering from an unknown disease in Singalo village, Tharparkar. A number of birds died due to Ranikhet [Newcastle] disease in Tharparkar last year [2012], and the residents of the village feel that the birds might be suffering from the same disease, as the signs are similar.

"The members of the wildlife department have yet to visit the district," said a resident, Muhammad Moosa Rahimoon. Another resident, Allah Dino Rahimoon, felt that the weather was to blame for the deaths. "We are keeping the birds in the shade at homes and are trying to cure them using traditional medicines," he said.

The villagers fear that the disease could spread and infect peacocks in other villages. Several teams from the Sindh Wildlife Department visited various parts of Tharparkar after the peacocks fell ill last year [2012]. The provincial department had claimed that only a few birds died from the disease. Media reports alleged, however, that a substantial number of birds had died from Ranikhet last year [2012]. No wildlife official was available for comment.

[The peacock (_Pavo cristatus_) is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent. It is unclear whether these 10 dead birds were free-ranging or owned peacocks.

For a picture of a male and female peacock, go to http://www.chrisjacobs.org/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/03/Male-Peacock-displaying.jpg.

Virtually all birds are considered susceptible to infection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV; Fam. _Paramyxoviridae_).

NDV has been categorized into 5 pathotypes based on clinical signs in infected chickens; designated: a) viscerotropic velogenic, b) neurotropic velogenic, c) mesogenic, d) lentogenic or respiratory and e) subclinical enteric. The clinical signs mentioned above appear to be neurologic but do not match exactly those usually observed in neurotropic velogenic Newcastle disease, which include paralysis of the wings and legs, torticollis, and incoordination.
