Department of Primary Industries (DPI) experts are no closer to identifying the cause of a mysterious syndrome that has killed thousands of cattle in the western Riverina [New South Wales, NSW].

The DPI says the dry conditions currently being experienced by landholders could lead to another outbreak and farmers are being urged to be on alert.

Drooling and diarrhoea (3D) [death is usually the 3rd D - Mod.TG] syndrome has been blamed for cattle deaths as early as 2006, but ongoing investigations have hit a roadblock.

The DPI held an information session with farmers in the Hay region to discuss the issue after 3D syndrome struck again in the past 18 months.

There was also an outbreak of the disease in 2009.

If farmers see cattle with signs of 3D syndrome they are asked to immediately contact a district veterinarian so testing can be undertaken.

A Mossgiel farmer went to the Local Land Service (LLS) forum, attended by about 15 graziers, last week [week of 10 Nov 2014]. [He] lost 64 cattle from 3D syndrome last year [2013] and closer to 100 in 2009. He said experts remained at a loss to explain what was causing the cattle deaths. "Nothing's really changed -- and it hasn't changed since 2006," he said. "They still don't know (what's causing the outbreaks)."

The syndrome's signs include cattle being "off their feed", prefer to lie down, noisy breathing, drooling, diarrhoea, and they usually die anywhere from 1 to 5 days after first becoming sick.

[The farmer] had his own theories on what was causing the virus-like syndrome. He said it could be an insect causing it or the deadly calicivirus that is associated with rabbits. However, he said DPI scientists had previously dismissed the theory. "There has been a lot of rabbits die around the same time, which made me think it could've been the calicivirus," he said.

Any farmers who notice their cattle looking sick and displaying signs of 3D syndrome are urged to immediately contact a DPI official so testing can be carried out.

[3D sounds rather vague: diarrhea, drooling, death. If a producer recognizes drooling early, how long until death?

If there is a pattern here, then we should learn from this. How similar is this outbreak to the ones in 2006, 2009, and 2013? What stopped the spread of the illness? Is it spread via air? Fomites? Or nose-to-nose contact?

What kinds of investigations have been done? Do these animals have a fever? Are they off feed before showing signs of illness? Do all affected areas have anything in common? Water? Hay? Feed?

Maybe it is the weather? Or insects? There need to be more details of what has occurred as far as investigations of similarity of premises and years.

According to the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/agriculture/livestock/health/specific/cattle/cattle-deaths-with-drooling-and-diarrhoea-3d-syndrome):

A syndrome with the key signs of drooling and diarrhoea leading to death has been reported by graziers in the Mossgiel/Hay/Ivanhoe area of NSW. Cases were first reported in 2006 and again in 2009 and 2013.

Combined losses across all properties where disease is known to have occurred are in the hundreds. Samples have been tested for exotic viruses and all tests have been negative. At this stage the cause of disease has not been identified. Work is continuing to determine the cause. The pattern of disease seen on affected properties and the extensive range of testing for infectious agents indicates that it is not caused simply by the presence of a transmissible agent. As there is no evidence that the disease is being spread from property to property, there is no reason to place restrictions on the movement of cattle on account of 3D syndrome.

Further investigations of cattle with signs consistent with the 3D syndrome are important in order to determine the extent of the problem and to assist in determining the cause.

This factsheet provides general information to farmers and a separate factsheet for vets shows autopsy findings that would assist them in investigating cases to determine if 3D syndrome is the likely cause of death.

On affected properties, owners have reported:
- Mild illness initially- "off colour"
- Off feed
- Prefer to lie down
- Noisy breathing in a small number
- Drooling
- Diarrhoea
- Deaths- generally 1-5 days after first noting sick; some longer
- Nearly all affected died
- Generally little struggling prior to death
- Stock in good condition
- Cattle feel hot and if temperature measured, increased (41-42 deg C/105.8-107.6 deg F)
- Cattle affected: 3D syndrome typically occurs in cattle 5 months or older
