Horse deaths mystery
--------------------
Mystery surrounds the cause of a disease which is believed to have
killed at least 12 horses in Cornwall over the past month. Owners
have been warned to be extra vigilant as the figure could be as great
as 20 and possibly much higher due to a shortage of information
available about atypical myopathy.

While the illness has been identified, little is known of its causes,
and its onset is so quick that it is spreading worry among horse
owners. The disease strikes fast and can kill within 72 hours. It
causes a breakdown of the horse's muscles which has a toxic effect.
Symptoms include sudden lethargy, weakness and muscle stiffness. If
the condition worsens towards a critical point, animals will often be
found collapsed on the floor, dying.

There is no evidence to suggest atypical myopathy is contagious, but
its exact cause remains unknown. In the last month John Daniels of
Equus Solutions in St Hilary has seen 2 of his horses contract the
disease. The 1st to pick up the illness died, but the experience
meant they were quick to notice when a 2nd horse began displaying the
same symptoms. They rushed her to treatment and she has now been stabilised.

"It has come as a major shock," said Mr Daniels. "The illness came on
so quick; she was in the same field where we were working, when in
the middle of the afternoon she started looking a bit depressed. We
brought her into the stable and noticed she was drenched in sweat."

They took the horse to the animal hospital in St Columb Major where
she was treated for the disease with intravenous fluids and
anti-inflammatory drugs. She is now well on the road to recovery.

"A lot of the time it is fatal," said Mr Daniels. "They can go from
fit and healthy to dead in as little as 72 hours."

While they know the disease is around, the lack of any certainty over
why the outbreak has occurred means they are still on tenterhooks.

"There's no real way of knowing and it's scary -- we don't know
whether it will happen again, what causes it or how to stop it," said
Mr Daniels. "We need somebody to pick up the case and do some
research into it, because I've heard of around 20 horses catching it."

The Department for Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) claim there
have been 10 recent cases across the country, while Veterinary
Assistant Alistair Todd, with Church End Veterinary Centre in St
Austell knows of 12 instances. Due to the GBP 1000 [1617.86 USD] cost
of carrying out a postmortem on a horse the real figure could be much more.

Mr Todd said: "Scientists are not sure whether it is linked with
bacterial or fungal toxins. It seems to be more common in the autumn
when heavy rain and cold conditions mean bacteria can grow on the
grass. "It is unusual to have so many cases in such a short space of time."

It is believed that the condition is linked to grass and the
management of horses. Owners are advised to [de]worm horses
regularly; not to use water-logged pasture or fields near wooded
areas; and stable their horses overnight.

[Atypical myopathy is a disease of grazing horses recorded in Europe
since 1984. Since fall 2000, nearly 1000 cases have been reported
across Europe, with France being the most seriously affected country.
In 2005, a web-site dedicated to the enigmatic Atypical myopathy was
established in Belgium,
<http://www.myopathieatypique.be/>.

According to the data available on the said web-site, about 600 cases
have been recorded since autumn 2006 in various European countries
including 155 during the spring of 2010. The census of the cases was
provided by this site under the auspices of the University of Liege
(Belgium) in close collaboration with the epidemiological
surveillance in French Equine Pathology (RESPE;
<http://www.respe.net/info/information-myopathie-atypique-automne-2010>).
The condition is suspected to be caused by a lethal toxin produced by
_Clostridium sordellii_, ingested or produced within the digestive
tract of the horse.
