_P.falciparum_ malaria in Java, Indonesia
-------------------------------------------
Three weeks ago our clinic treated an expatriate for falciparum malaria
contracted in a popular beach-resort area frequented by tourists two hours
west of Jakarta. The main towns in this area are Sambolo and Carita. Prior
to this case, malaria has not been reported frequently enough in this
resort area over the last few years to warrant, in our opinion, a
recommendation for medical prophylaxis, though we have recommended it for
those traveling to the West Javanese national park area of Ujungkulon to
the south of Sambolo-Carita.
Additionally, during the past 4 years there has been a significant increase
in malaria in Central Java Province adjacent to Yogjakarta Province. There
is documented a more than ten-fold increase in some areas like Cilacap and
Purworejo. The reasons for the increase are likely multifactorial. Some
entomologists point out that in recent years control programs (spraying)
have fallen by the wayside due to lack of funding. A recent in vivo drug
resistance study in Purworejo, Central Java found a 35% prevalence of
malaria in the local population with a high level of resistance to
chloroquine by both _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_.
Other areas with endemic malaria include Kokop and Parangtritis (beach
area) in Yogyakarta Province and Cilacap and Banjarnegara in Central Java.
_P.falciparum_ accounts for 50-60% of cases in Central Java and 20-30% of
cases in Yogyakarta Province.
Data from the Ministry of Health on Yogyakarta Province suggest an annual
peak incidence of 8 000 slide confirmed cases during 1994. Since then the
number of slide confirmed cases in Yogyakarta Province has been stable at
approximately 2 000 cases per year. Autochthonous malaria within the city
of Yogyakarta has not been confirmed.
Based on this information, antimalarial prophylaxis with either doxycycline
or mefloquine and personal protective measures would be prudent for all
overnight travelers to Central Java and rural Yogyakarta Province, which
lies adjacent to the areas of documented increase, with the exception of
the cities of Semerang and Yogyakarta. All travelers anticipating overnight
stays in rural areas outside these 2 main cities, including Borobudur,
should consider malaria prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis with
primaquine should also be considered for G6PD normal individuals. We do not
recommend such measures in the major urban areas of Java at this time
including Jakarta, Bogor, Bandung, Solo, and Surabaya.

Background information on malaria in Indonesia
------------------------------------------------
_Plasmodium falciparum_ accounts for approximately 66% of cases. _P. ovale_
and _P. malariae_ are common in the Eastern region. Chloroquine-resistant
P. falciparum IS reported. Chloroquine-resistant _P. vivax_ has been
reported since 1991 in Irian Jaya, North Sulawesi, Flores and West
Kalimantan, with highest rates (14%) on Nias.
Malaria accounted for 6.7% of all deaths in this country during 1986.
Risk occurs in all seasons and throughout the country, except in the large
cities. Sumatra and Kalimantan are considered hypoendemic, with the
exception of Nias Island (mesoendemic). Highest rates for Kalimantan are
registered in the eastern portion. Irian Jaya has the highest rates for
eastern Indonesia. Flores Island is classified as meso- to hyperendemic;
Lombok and Sulawesi (north, central and southern portions) as hypo- to
mesoendemic.
33 000 cases were reported in 1988 from Java and Bali, and 22 802 in 1989;
1.64 million in 1990 (including 64 854 in East Timor and 26 018 from Java &
Bali); 1.91 million in 1991 (including 15 506 from Java and Bali); 1.31
million in 1992 (including 13 655 from Java and Bali); 21 847 from Java
(notably Central Province) and Bali (10/100,000) in 1993; 575 000 in 1994
(including 19726 in Java and Bali); 1 460 569 in 1995.
The principal vectors are _Anopheles letifer_, _An. nigerrimus_, _An.
aconitus_, _An. barbirostris_, _An. balabacencis_, _An. dirus_, _An.
leucosphyrus_, _An. ludlowae_, _An. maculatus_, _An. minimus_, _An.
flavirostris_, _An. philippinensis_, _An. sundaicus_. An. sinensis_, _An.
koliensis_ and _An. punctulatus_ (in Irian Jaya).

[The spread of malaria in Java can easily be explained by decreased control
activities as suggested. Sporadic chloroquine resistance has been know in
Indonesia for some years, and the standard prophylactic recommendation for
Europeans is chloroquine and proguanil.
It would be appropriate to have a comment from the authorities on the
report and the suggestion that malaria control activities has been reduced
in recent years, and further data on resistance is important to decide on
relevant prophylaxis. -Mod.EP]
