This letter is in response to the article in ProMED-mail detailing an
extension of an animal rabies epizootic in western North Carolina. As a
Public Health Veterinarian for North Carolina I am familiar with the
situation and believe that a follow-up would be in order.
The last major rabies epizootic in North Carolina was during the 1950s.
Through effective public health measures the epizootic was controlled and
the number of animal rabies cases receded to background levels.
During this decade several animal rabies epizootics have entered North
Carolina. In 1990, 1 county had rabies diagnosed in its terrestrial animal
population by the State Laboratory of Public Health; in 1999 there are 84
(of 100) counties which have had rabies diagnosed in their wildlife
population.
The counties of the coastal plain (eastern NC) have the epizootic in their
wildlife as do the majority of the Piedmont (central NC). The spread of the
disease continues into the foothills and mountains of the state. There are
no physical barriers to the spread of this disease in (primarily) the
raccoon population and it is expected to eventually encompass the entire
state.
As is usual, the number of cases of animal rabies diagnosed in North
Carolina rises in the warmer months. The interest of the media correlates
well with the increase in diagnosed cases. Media interest is also piqued by
the extension of the epizootic into the remaining few counties of the state.
In summary, the epizootics that entered the state from two different
directions are nearly a decade old in North Carolina. They have spread from
their points of entry in the northeastern and south-central/south-eastern
parts of the state. The extension of the disease in North Carolina's
wildlife is following a pattern seen in other states which have been
similarly affected. Rabies is expected to eventually spread to the wildlife
populations in the remaining parts of the state which now are unaffected.

to date have only been patently successful in foxes, this epidemic will
just have to eventually burn itself out. - MHJ
