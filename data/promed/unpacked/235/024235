Foot and Mouth Disease in Uruguay (virus O)
Translation of an extract from an e-mail received on 27 Oct 2000 from
Dr Carlos A. Correa Messuti, Ministry of Animal Production, Agriculture
and Fisheries, Montevideo:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 23 Oct 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: 15 Oct 2000.
Location of the outbreak: Department of Artigas (in the northern part of
the country).
Animals present in the outbreak: 322 bovines, 63 sheep, 47 pigs
No. of cases: 29 bovines, 11 pigs
No. of deaths: 7 pigs
Due to the proximity of urban centers, the probable origin of the
infection is a sow infected by ingesting feed of animal origin,
slaughterhouse waste, or contaminated by-products.
- Health state of emergency throughout the national territory.
- Surveillance zone throughout the Department of Artigas.
- A total ban was placed on the movement of animals and animal products
from and into the department.
- An 'outbreak zone' was defined with a radius of 5 km around the
affected establishment
- A 'peripheral zone' 25 km in radius around the outbreak
- Testing is being carried out in these 2 zones.
- 22 control and disinfection posts have been established at the
boundary of these 2 zones.
- Stamping out of all susceptible animals in the 'outbreak zone' is in
progress.
