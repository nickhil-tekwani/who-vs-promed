The GFRA [Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Research Alliance] 2015 scientific meeting will be held in Hanoi, Viet Nam 20-22 Oct 2015. The deadline for early-bird registration and abstract submission is 15 Aug 2015. More details can be obtained from the website http://www.gfra2015.org. For any queries, please feel free to contact Wilna Vosloo at <wilna.vosloo@csiro.au>.

In the previous GFRA workshop that was held in Arusha, Tanzania in October 2013, we focused on the role of African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) in the transmission of FMDV between wildlife and livestock in an endemic setting to assist with effective control measures and strategies. In this workshop, we want to focus on the role of Asian buffalo in the epidemiology of FMD in South East Asia with the same aim. In addition, this will contribute to the design of better and more targeted vaccines for each affected region. FMD transmission and the risk factors involved in transmission are a focus of this workshop. We aim to exchange and distribute the latest research findings between research partners to facilitate a greater understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transmission of FMD in endemic settings. The workshop will also address the gaps in our knowledge and new research focus areas regarding transmission and the factors increasing the risk of transmission.

[FMD is endemic in most of Africa and Asia and some countries in Latin America. In these areas, the impact of the disease is not only associated with the loss of trading opportunities, but also with the productivity of the animals, since FMD results in a decline in milk production, may induce abortion in pregnant livestock, death in young animals and a loss of traction power. These losses, whilst not often dramatic in an endemic setting, are insidious and costly. They undermine other attempts to increase productivity, and in the subsistence farming setting, they are a major factor in maintaining livestock keepers in the poverty trap. Even where vaccination is routinely practised, it is expensive and often ineffective. In terms of the protective requirement of a FMD vaccine, vaccination needs to be repeated frequently, and vaccines must afford protection against current circulating FMDV strains. In many developing-country settings this is not achievable.

FMD ecology remains poorly understood, and the disease dynamics in terms of reservoirs and factors favouring transmission remain largely unexplored. For example, despite the fact that Asian buffalo have been shown to be susceptible to FMDV infection and capable of harbouring the FMD virus asymptomatically for long periods of time (that is, they are carriers), their role in long-term maintenance of the virus is still undetermined.

GFRA, launched in 2003, is a worldwide association of 16 leading animal research organizations combating FMD. Its aim is to build a global alliance of partners to generate and share knowledge -- in a virtual FMD laboratory -- to develop tools that can better combat the threat of the disease.
