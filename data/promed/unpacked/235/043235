Cases of scarlet fever are running at 3 times the level of last year [2014], disturbing new figures show. Public Health England (PHE) said there have been 302 cases in Wessex in the "season" from September [2014] to March [2015], compared with 119 in the same period last year [2014].

Across England there have been roughly 6000 confirmed cases since September [2014]. It is the 2nd season in a row with "exceptionally high numbers" according to Public Health England [PHE], after last year saw the highest number of cases since the 1960s -- more than 14 000 -- instead of the average of up to 4000.

This common childhood infection is usually mild and can be treated with antibiotics, although there is a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body, such as the ear, sinuses, and lungs.

The NHS [National Health Service] advice is that early symptoms include a sore throat, headache, and fever with the characteristic red pinhead rash that feels like sandpaper to touch appearing after 12 to 48 hours. Other symptoms may include: swollen neck glands; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit; a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen; and a general feeling of being unwell.
