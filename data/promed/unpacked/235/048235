Florida authorities are investigating sudden deaths among cattle in parts of Florida and Georgia. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services this week received multiple reports related to acute deaths in cattle. These deaths are being investigated by both the Division of Agricultural Environmental Services and the Division of Animal Industry. Local law enforcement agencies and veterinarians have also been involved in the ongoing investigation.

While the specific cause has not yet been determined, these deaths may be related to feed. The product in question is Producer's Pride 20% All Natural Cattle Cube, lot number 8DEC22MUL2, manufactured by Purina Animal Nutrition, and distributed to 40 Tractor Supply Company stores in Florida and Georgia in multiple locations.

Tractor Supply Company has voluntarily removed the product in question from their shelves in all 40 stores. In addition, Purina Animal Nutrition has initiated a voluntary market withdrawal of the affected product. Consumers are advised to either discard the product or return it to their retail purchase location for exchange or refund. There are no expected impacts to human health at this time, nor are there expected to be, according to Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried.

The department has collected product and cattle samples from across the state, and is in the process of conducting laboratory tests. In addition, the Department has conducted on-site verifications at Tractor Supply Company locations, outreach to Purina Animal Nutrition to facilitate the voluntary withdrawal of the affected product, as well as outreach to the agricultural community.

Veterinarians or producers who are aware of sudden unexplained deaths in cattle should contact the State Veterinarian's Office at 850-410-0900.

[This article tells us where the situation occurred, a possible link as to the cause of the situation, but it does not describe the details of the sudden deaths of cattle. Was this observed immediately after eating? Did they die while still eating the suspect product? How long after eating was the problem noticed? How many herds are thus far are affected? The article indicates this is happening in Florida and Georgia. However, is this one herd on each side of the state line or is this state wide with multiple herds affected? How many animals have died and how many herds are affected? The animal data is lacking in this article.

According to The Ledger (14 Jan 2019) https://www.theledger.com/news/20190114/14-cattle-deaths-in-polk-linked-to-toxic-feed-suspected-product-made-by-producers-pride-under-recall the cattle deaths led to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issuing a recall of the suspected product, Producer's Pride 20% All Natural Cattle Cubes, that were sold by the Tractor Supply Co. in 39 stores across Florida and 1 location in southern Georgia. The recall issued late (Fri 11 Jan 2018) affects about 1500 bags with the lot number 8DEC22MUL2.

Realizing it may be only one county in Georgia is very different from having the entire state affected.

The Ledger also indicated this has been going on for approximately 2 months, possibly beginning in late December 2018. Apparently this 'toxin' is not acutely toxic or we would have animal affected. Several other sources reported a county would have 14 deaths, another 18 deaths, another county 16 deaths. Some sources indicated only one animal would seem to be affected acutely and then several days later another one or 2 animals would die. So while several articles are discussing how many animals in a county may have been affected, there remain no specific details. Some sources indicated veterinarians were involved and necropsies had been done, but no results were listed in the multiple news articles.

It is impossible to make an informed opinion as what may have happened or suggest a possible toxic agent when data is so scarce. However, we hope the problem is resolved quickly and hopefully we will not see this grow into a further problem. ProMED would welcome additional information from informed sources. - Mod.TG
