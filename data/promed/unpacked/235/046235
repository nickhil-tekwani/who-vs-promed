Japan: Mild Avian Influenza Virus Infection Too Risky to Ignore
-----------------------------------------------
The world's 1st confirmed human cases of [less pathogenic] avian
influenza virus infection are too "risky to ignore," even though none
of those affected have had health problems, Japanese officials
warned. The H5N2 strain [serotype of avian influenza virus] -- a
milder form [than] the H5N1 serotype which has killed more than 70
people in Asia since 2003 and 2 people in Turkey -- needs global
attention, because it could mutate, they said today [Wed 11 Jan 2006].
"There is no health risk for those infected workers, but as long as
the virus is an H5-type strain, it is risky to ignore it," said a
researcher at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. "In the
past, there was a case where a mild strain [i.e. a LPAI (low
pathogenic avian influenza) virus] eventually transformed to a lethal
one for chickens [i.e. a HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza)
virus]," warned the scientist, who declined to give his name in line
with institute policy. The Japanese government said Tuesday [10 Jan
2006] that 77 farm workers had been infected with H5N2, after tests
on 350 workers and their families at affected chicken farms. The
workers, who no longer show any symptoms, are the world's 1st to test
positive for the mild strain. Developing countries hit hardest by
bird flu do not test for H5N2.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an H5N2 epidemic in
birds in 1983-1984 in the United States originally caused little
death, but within 6 months reached a mortality rate of 90 percent.
Japan, which has stockpiled the influenza [neuraminidase inhibitor]
Tamiflu in case of an avian influenza pandemic, designates all H5
[serotype] strains as avian influenza, requiring the killing of the
infected chicken.
"If a patient with conventional human influenza is infected by mild
bird flu, it could create a new type of human influenza strain for
which no vaccine or medicine are prepared," the institute's scientist
said. "Because it is winter, and it is the season for influenza, the
authorities should keep their eyes on even the milder avian influenza
viruses," he said.
Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry instructed poultry workers to
take preventive measures, such as wearing masks and washing their
hands frequently. "Workers who were infected with human influenza
should avoid working in poultry farms," the Ministry said in a
statement late Tuesday [10 Jan 2006]. But no one has been found to
fall ill, let alone die, from the mild strain of avian influenza
virus. Japan is the only country to treat H5N2 as an infectious
disease, the National Institute researcher said.
"I hope these cases provide a warning whistle to countries
worldwide," he said. "Scientists only found in 1997 that avian
influenza is infectious for human beings, and now we know that a
milder [form] of the avian virus, which is hard to detect because it
doesn't [produce] any physical symptoms, can infect human beings," he said.
A Japanese Health Ministry official said that the mild strain should
also be discussed in a 2-day conference on avian influenza co-hosted
by the WHO in Tokyo from Thursday [12 Jan 2006].
