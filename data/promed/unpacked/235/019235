At least 3 people are reported to have died from cholera in South Sudan's Jonglei state after an outbreak of the waterborne disease in the Nyuak and Kongor areas of Twic East county [Jonglei state]. The commissioner of Twic East county, Dau Akoi, said the disease has hit 2 populated payams (districts of Nyuak and Kongor, including the county headquarters of Panyagoor).

"There is [a] cholera outbreak in Twic East county now. 3 people died and 17 others are now admitted" to hospital, said Akoi in Bor on Sun 18 May 2014. A team of medical doctors will be sent to Twic East to investigate the suspected cases of cholera, he said. It is not clear when the team will leave the state capital, Bor, for Twic East county.

South Sudan's ministry of health said last week that one person had died from cholera in Juba, following an outbreak in the South Sudanese capital where 18 suspected cases have been reported.

Oxfam said the source of the disease is not yet known. It is currently working together with other aid agencies to respond to the outbreak and prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. It says a cargo of supplies was due to arrive in the capital on 18 May 2014. The agency plans to construct latrines, treat water, distribute buckets, mobilize garbage collection, and conduct public education campaigns on good hygiene practices to vulnerable communities. "With a quick response, it is hoped that the outbreak can be contained," Oxfam said in a statement extended to Sudan Tribune last week.

"This outbreak highlights the squalid living conditions of many South Sudanese particularly in urban areas, and the scale of public health risk this poses. It also demonstrates how urgently funds are needed to respond to increasingly dire humanitarian situation in South Sudan," the statement added.

Cholera is contracted through the ingestion of contaminated food and water and generally spreads in places with poor hygiene and sanitation. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, muscle cramps, and dehydration.

Ongoing conflict in South Sudan has forced thousands of displaced people to seek refuge at overcrowded UN bases across the country, placing an enormous strain on already limited water and sanitation facilities. Only 6 per cent of people in South Sudan currently have access to latrines and safe drinking water is also lacking.

[Cholera has now been found in Jonglei State, which is located in north east South Sudan in the Greater Upper Nile region of the country. It does border with the Central Equatoria State to the south and west somewhat. A map of the states of South Sudan can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SouthSudanStates.svg.

The scope of the outbreak in this civil war ravaged country with many areas of internally displaced people is yet to be determined. - Mod.LL
