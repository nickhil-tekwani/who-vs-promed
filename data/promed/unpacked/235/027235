By official accounts, the pig contagion wreaking havoc across Eastern Asia has virtually skipped over North Korea, with a single outbreak reported there in May [2019]. But wayward feral pigs have stoked concern that Kim Jong Un's reclusive state is hiding an African swine fever [ASF] disaster.

Five wild boars were found dead in or near border areas separating the 2 countries this month [October 2019] before being tested positive for the viral hemorrhagic disease, officials in South Korea said. The finding reflects the freedom with which animals roam the 4-km (2.5 mile) wide buffer zone that divides the nations and creates an involuntary park and refuge for fauna.

It also hints at a spillover of the deadly virus from North Korea, where unofficial reports indicate the disease is spreading out of control. South Korea has deployed helicopters to disinfect parts of the 250-km-long border-barrier, near which more than a dozen outbreaks have occurred on farms since the virus was 1st reported there a month ago.

ASF has spread to almost all areas of North Korea, and pigs in the western province of North Pyongan have been "wiped out," said Lee Hye-hoon, who chairs the National Assembly's intelligence committee, citing South Korea's National Intelligence Service.

The virus killed 22 hogs in May [2019] on a cooperative farm about 260 km north of Pyongyang, near the border with China, North Korea's agriculture ministry said in a 30 May 2019 report to the World Organisation for Animal Health, or OIE.

But since then, there have been no follow-up reports to the Paris-based veterinary body and scant coverage of the event in state media.

The Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] has no information beyond the report received by the OIE, said Wantanee Kalpravidh, the United Nations agency's Bangkok-based regional manager of the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. The FAO is awaiting approval to send a delegate to North Korea, she said in a text message Friday [11 Oct 2019].

Widespread transmission of ASF, which isn't known to harm humans but kills most pigs in a week, may put North Korea's food security in graver jeopardy.

Crop production there is forecast to be smaller than usual for the rest of 2019 due to below-average rainfall and low water supplies for irrigation, the FAO said last month [September 2019]. About 40% of the population, or 10.1 million people, are estimated to be food-insecure and in urgent need of food assistance, according to results from a UN assessment conducted last April [2019].

African swine fever will worsen hunger and malnutrition, said Cho Chunghi, who fled North Korea in 2011 after spending a decade working for the government's animal disease control program. Many North Korean households raise pigs to earn money to buy rice. "Pork accounts for about 80% of North Korea's protein consumption, and, with global sanctions taking place, it's going to be hard for the country to find an alternative protein source," said Cho, who now works as a researcher at Good Farmers, a Seoul-based non-governmental organization that supports developing nations to generate profit through agricultural activities. "The virus is extremely destructive as people are now unable to make money through raising pigs, while the country's economy is restrained," he said.

Pigs raised by individual farms outnumber those on state-owned and collective farms, which will make it almost impossible to halt the spread, especially given North Korea's inexperience in preventing and mitigating epidemics in animals, Cho said.

This lack of capacity is a threat to the entire Korean Peninsula, where the virus could become endemic, or generally present. That would make it more difficult to stamp out the disease through the usual steps of quarantining and culling diseased and vulnerable livestock.

South Korea has culled 154 653 pigs at 94 farms as of 11 Oct 2019, according to the nation's agriculture ministry. Routine tests for the virus on wild boars were introduced before Pyongyang reported the outbreak, the Ministry of Environment said in a 9 Oct 2019 statement. Now, streams and soil near the border are also being tested.

The country has repeatedly asked Pyongyang to join a collective effort to fight the transmission, but its northern neighbor hasn't responded.

"The fact that North Korea has reported the outbreak to an international organization suggests the situation is probably getting out of their hands," said Ahn Chan-il, a former North Korean soldier who defected in 1979 and who now heads the World Institute for North Korea Studies. "It's an apocalypse in the making."

[The following data specifying the most recent measures undertaken by South Korea to control and prevent further spread of the epizootic, which has been introduced from North Korea, are derived from FAO's weekly "ASF situation in Asia update" (issued in Rome, Thu 10 Oct 2019, 19.00 pm; at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/2019/Situation_update_2019_10_10.html):

"MAFRA [Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs] held another stand-still for 2 days, conducted a thorough inspection on the 599 farms within a 3-km radius of the 13 confirmed farms; a preliminary surveillance by phone has been conducted daily of 1671 farms within 10-km radius and epidemiologically linked. The roads in border areas were disinfected, and disinfectant has been sprayed by helicopter in the DMZ [the demilitarized zone between the 2 Korea's]. The government purchases pigs ready for market from farms within 10 km, upon being proven that the pigs tested negative following a voluntary request from farmers; other pigs are destroyed as part of precaution measures in Paju, Gimpo cities and Yeoncheon County.

To prevent ASF spread to southern parts of the country, MAFRA set a buffer zone (outside the 10-km radius of affected farms in Goyang, Pocheon, Yangju, Dongducheon, Cheorwon and Yeoncheon-gun) that is separating the affected zone from southern zones. Control posts were established on the main roads at the edge of the buffer zone to control the traffic of feed vehicles between affected and southern zones. In this case, all feed must be unloaded at the edge of the buffer zone, limiting the mobility of the feed vehicles within its zone. Additionally, an intensive disinfection of roads etc. around the boundary is being carried out in the buffer zone. In the buffer zone, the access of vehicles (except passenger cars) to all farms is controlled. Weekly inspections of all pig farms are being carried out for 3 weeks. Environmental inspections of gathering facilities such as slaughterhouses and feed mills are applied once a month. Virus screening of animal transport vehicles is being conducted; farm-level prevention is being enhanced; and livestock-related vehicles movement to other areas is being monitored in real-time using GPS. The latest ASF outbreak was confirmed on 9 Oct 2019 on a pig farm (including more than 4000 head; fenced, no swill feeding) in Sinseo-myeon, Yeoncheon-gun, located within the key control area."

The mentioned recent outbreak has been reported by South Korea to the OIE (follow-up report No 9, submitted 11 Oct 2019).

An OIE summary report addressing the total of 15 outbreaks in South Korea, as of 11 Oct 2019, of which 14 in domestic pigs and 1 in wild boar, with links to all follow-up reports, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778. The report includes an interactive map presenting all outbreaks (click on the cluster to center, zoom in to the required resolution).

So far, the South Korean veterinary authorities have managed to prevent the spread of ASF from the border area southwards. Repeated virus introductions from North Korea, most likely by wild boar, may challenge their remarkable efforts. - Mod.AS
