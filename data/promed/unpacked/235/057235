When SI, 21, a resident of North Assam's Lakhimpur district, recently started throwing up, running a temperature, and complaining of a headache, his family rushed him to the mini-primary health centre in the area.

The district has been at the centre of an acute encephalitis syndrome outbreak. At least 7 Japanese encephalitis (JE) death cases have been confirmed this year [2018] in the district so far.

Acute encephalitis syndrome is a condition of brain inflammation caused by both bacterial and viral infections. It is accompanied by fever, headaches, seizures, disorientation, and vomiting in people, and if not treated quickly can result in death.

The Japanese encephalitis [JE] virus has been responsible for most cases of acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] in India and South Asia. [Not usually true. A minority of case of AES that have been laboratory tested have been shown to be due to JE virus infection. - Mod.TY]

When a blood test was run on SI, he tested positive for Japanese encephalitis. In spite of treatment in the hospital, he did not survive.

The vector borne disease [virus] is transmitted by _Culex_ genus mosquitoes. According to National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NDGCT), 96 acute encephalitis cases have been reported in Lakhimpur district between January and August this year [2018], of which 43 have been found to be positive [for JE virus? - Mod.TY].

Not only SI, but 6 other people (ages 9, 80, 1, 19, 13, and 13) also died of JE.

Health department officials said several fresh cases have been reported from Narayanpur, Boginodi, Nowboisa Borsala, and in many wards of municipal areas of the district.

The district health officials have taken a slew of initiatives to prevent outbreak of the disease, said an official. Vaccination and intensive fogging have been done around 100 m [328 ft] in the affected areas all over the district, he said. Identification and proper mapping of the affected areas is also done by the district health officials and this is stated by the joint director of health, the official added.

A local farmer, identified as MB (57) of Nafuk village under Sapekhati PS of Sivasagar, died due to Japanese encephalitis on Thursday [16 Aug 2018]. He was undergoing treatment in Sivasagar Civil Hospital but finally breathed his last on Thursday. The toll of Japanese encephalitis victims in Sivasagar this year [2018] has now gone up to 17.

[This is the busy Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season in northeastern India, including Assam state. The 1st report above appears to use the terms "Japanese encephalitis" and "acute encephalitis syndrome" interchangeably, although the samples of patient SI were reported as positive, presumably for JE virus. Where laboratory confirmation of exclusion is reported, usually these encephalitis cases are attributed to Japanese encephalitis (JE) as a minority of cases, with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of unspecified etiology for the majority. This is the season for JE virus, but AES also occurs at this time. As noted in many earlier posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). Fortunately, vaccination for JE is being carried out in the affected areas in the district, which will prevent cases of encephalitis due to infection with that virus. - Mod.TY
