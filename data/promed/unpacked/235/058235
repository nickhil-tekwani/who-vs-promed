Dengue Epidemic Declared in Palau (Micronesia)
----------------------------------------------
SAIPAN (Northern Mariana Islands): On Mon 4 Dec 2000, Palau's Bureau of
Public Health declared a dengue epidemic after 28 confirmed cases and 40
other suspected instances of the tropical disease were reported in the last
5 and a half months. The sudden increase of cases in September and October
prompted the Bureau to declare an epidemic. The 28 confirmed cases were
reportedly detected in Koror and Airai.
A total of 12 boxes of intravenous (IV) fluids has been sent by the
Northern Marianas in an effort to assist the Palau government's fight
against the disease. The Bureau is expecting to receive 50 more cases of IV
fluids from Hawaii. The bureau has been closely monitoring the prevalence
of the disease in areas [where dengue-transmitting mosquitoes may be
breeding. The bureau has been sending [selected blood samples to the
World Health Organization laboratory in Australia, since Palau does not
have resources to purchase vials for [all the samples. Since last week,
health sanitarians have been conducting a house-to-house inspection in
several areas to monitor whether the disease had already spread.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is more commonly seen in children under 15 years
old. It can be effectively treated by fluid replacement therapy if an early
clinical diagnosis is made. The education ministry has directed schools to
cancel physical education games during the outbreak. Dengue is common in
most of the Pacific islands including Palau.
