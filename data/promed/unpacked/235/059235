An unidentified middle-aged man has reportedly died from yellow fever infection in Benin [Benin City, capital of Edo State, Nigeria].

This recent death has again heightened fears of residents of the state over the non-availability of yellow fever vaccine at the government's health centers.

The victim, who reportedly died at the accident and emergency unit of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), was said to have been rushed to the hospital on Friday [14 Dec 2018] afternoon, but he died even before he could be transferred to a ward.

A source who did not want his name in print, told our correspondent that all medical personnel and the accident and emergency ward of the hospital were now clothed in full protective gear.

The viral disease, which broke out about a month ago, has claimed several lives in the state.

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. David Osifo, also confirmed that the disease had spread to about 10 out of the 18 local government areas of the state.

Senior Special Adviser, SSA to Governor Godwin Obaseki on health, Dr. Aanu Fakunle, disclosed that the state government was doing everything possible to put the outbreak under control. She disclosed that the local government councils were also doing their bit in health education in their communities.

"I can say that all hands are on deck; all things are working together with support from the federal ministry of health, NCDC, WHO, and the state epidemiology team," she said.

At the time of filing this report, Dr. Osifo could not be reached for comment, as calls made to his mobile phone failed to connect.

[This appears to be a very recent yellow fever (YF) case in Edo state. A 5 Dec 2018 reports indicated that there are 9 fatal YF cases in the state that apparently occurred previoulsly to the one reported above. The dates on which these 9 previous YF victims acquired their infections, became ill, and died were not given, other than "a few weeks ago." YF remains active in Nigeria currently. The 25 Nov 2018 Nigeria CDC situation report states that all 36 states plus the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) have reported at least one suspected case (https://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/78698f9f796fd5af9c3a3fb722cc0c02.pdf).

A mass YF vaccination campaign is currently underway in Nigeria, although it is not mentioned in the report above, for Edo state. Clearly, it is needed there now.
