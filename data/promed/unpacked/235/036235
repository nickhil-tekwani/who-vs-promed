Some blueberry plants in British Columbia are dying. However, 18% of samples from damaged plants tested negative for both blueberry scorch and shock viruses in 2022. Thus, a new problem appears to be emerging and killing off blueberry bushes.

Initial results of genomic sequencing confirmed 2 strains of a new virus in affected plants, as well as one strain of _Blueberry shock virus_ that has never been detected in British Columbia before. Because not all viruses lead to crop damage, it remains to be investigated if the new virus is actually responsible for the sick plants.

[Blueberry (_Vaccinium corymbosum_, family Ericaceae) scorch and shock disease symptoms are similar and may include leaf scorching, dieback of shoot tips and twigs, as well as flower blight. Fruit production and shoot growth are seriously reduced.

_Blueberry scorch virus_ (BlScV; genus _Carlavirus_) has been described as a heterogeneous collection of strains, including the strains associated with blueberry scorch on the west coast of North America and others associated with Sheep Pen Hill disease on the east coast. The virus appears to be transmitted by aphids and grafting.

_Blueberry shock virus_ (BlShV; genus _Ilarvirus_) was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The virus is pollen borne and also transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. BlShV is also considered an emerging virus in cranberry (_V. macrocarpon_).

Both viruses spread quickly through a crop from the point of 1st infection. Certified virus free planting material is essential in the management of these viruses.
