In England, the downward trend of infections caused by hospital
superbug MRSA came to an end in the last quarter of 2007, when the
number of cases rose slightly, the Health Protection Agency (HPA)
said on Thursday [24 Apr 2008]. There were 1087 reported cases
between October and December 2007, an increase of 0.6 percent over
the previous 3 months.

MRSA, or methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, is a deadly
bloodstream infection resistant to treatment with most available
antibiotics. The number of MRSA reports had been going down from 1742
in the 2nd quarter of 2006 to 1080 in the 3rd quarter of last year
[2007]. "Over the last year, cases of MRSA bloodstream infection have
been steadily falling," said Dr Georgia Duckworth, head of the HPA's
Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance
Department. "We would obviously like to have seen the trend continue
in this quarter and hope that ongoing surveillance will show that
this plateau is not indicative of a levelling trend, but we need to
see next quarter's figures."

The HPA was established 3 years ago to integrate the fight against
infectious diseases. The figures came as the Healthcare Commission,
the independent watchdog for healthcare in England and Wales,
announced one of the biggest inspection programs for NHS acute
trusts, with more than 170 being checked for infections.

Hospitals are due to start MRSA screening of patients coming for
non-emergency procedures from this month [April 2008] and for all
emergency admissions over the next 3 years.

[Hospital-acquired infections, also known as nosocomial or
health-care-associated infections, encompass almost all types of
infections that were not present or incubating at the time of
admission to the hospital. Most infections that become clinically
evident after 48 hours of hospitalization are considered
hospital-acquired. Infections that occur after the patient's
discharge from the hospital also can be considered to have a
nosocomial origin if the organisms were acquired during the hospital
stay.

Nosocomial infection rates have been expressed as the number of
hospital-acquired infections per 100 admissions; however, because of
progressively shorter inpatient stays over the several decades, the
rate of nosocomial infections per 1000 patient days has actually
increased 36 percent, from 7.2 in 1975 to 9.8 in 1995, although the
number of hospital-acquired infections per 100 admissions has
remained stable

In the news release above, only numerator data is given; without any
denominator, interpretation of data is not possible.

MRSA epidemiology and patient populations differ substantially from
one institution, region, or time to another, so that nosocomial
infection data should be adjusted for interventions (such as days on
a device or operative procedures) that increase patient risk for
infection. If not adequately adjusted, crude rates can be potentially
misleading
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1664844>.

Several states in the U.S. have mandated screening for MRSA
colonization on admission to a hospital and subsequent isolation of
MRSA carriers. There is an ongoing debate on the importance of
universal screening of all hospital admissions versus targeted
screening of high-risk populations such as nursing home residents
