[During a 10 Feb 2021 press conference, the minister of agriculture of Algeria mentioned that "the source of this virus is migratory birds, and we [Algeria] have put all regions on alert in anticipation of any emergency." He stressed that "the epidemic was contained in Ain Fakroun town, which appeared in there." (See https://www.poandpo.com/agrifish/algeria-declares-state-of-emergency-over-bird-flu/)

In the African continent, HPAI subtype H5N1 has been recently reported in wild birds and poultry in Senegal and in wild birds in Mauritania. Outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N8 are still present in South Africa. - Mod.CRD
