Bird flu spreads in Russia
---------------------------
Bird flu appears to have spread to another part of Russia, as
authorities try to contain an outbreak around Moscow. About 3000 wild
ducks have been destroyed near the Black Sea city of Anapa after a
number were found dead.
Separately, experts are carrying out tests at a 4th location near the
capital. A veterinary official said it is almost certain the deadly
H5N1 strain is the cause, as in the 3 earlier cases.
Strict measures have been put in place to combat the spread of the disease.
It is understood the chickens involved in all 4 cases were bought at
a market close to the main motorway encircling Moscow. No human cases
of bird flu have been recorded in Russia yet. People who had been in
contact with the dead birds were taken to hospital as a precautionary
measure but showed no signs of any illness. The outbreak is Russia's
2nd this year [2007] and the 1st ever recorded close to the capital.

[Anapa
(<http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/geo/geohack.php?params=44_52__N_37_22__E_type:city>
44o 52 N, 37o 22 E) is a seaport town in the Krasnodar Region in
southwest Russia. It is located on the northern coast of the Black
Sea near the Sea of Azov (map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/38/Anapa.html>).
On 29 Jan 2007, Russia notified the OIE about H5N1 in Krasnodar,
reportedly affecting native chickens and traditionally raised ducks,
geese and turkey cocks. The notification, including map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_imm_0000004793_20070209_131601.pdf>.
Destroying wild ducks is an exceptional and rather controversial
control measure; official information, including the accurate
description of the "wild ducks" population allegedly involved, and
laboratory test results (if available), are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
