RE: Anthrax in horse
-----------------------
On Mon 13 Aug 2007, the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory (TVMDL) has reported a case of anthrax in a horse. This
case is in an endemic area approximately 20 miles from the earlier
bovine cases in Tom Green County in July [2007]. Cattle on this ranch
had been earlier vaccinated for anthrax, but the horses were not. Of
6 horses originally in the ranch, 2 were lost. The surviving horses
have now been vaccinated. The carcasses of the 2 horses that
succumbed have been incinerated.

[This area is enzootic to some in the know and the disease is an
unknown to others. When I investigated the previous outbreak that
killed some 25 animals on one ranch ten miles NNW of San Angelo I
found that the owner's veterinarian was ignorant of the risk. Plus
his client had vaccinated none of his some 250 head against anything
including blackleg. A neighbour who had been losing geriatric cows
believed that calfhood vaccination was all that was needed;
fortunately his 10-15 year old cows had died of senecio poisoning and
old age, not anthrax.
In this outbreak it is clear that there had been background cases
probably in the whitetail deer as horses graze high and the horses
succumbed to horseflies with contaminated mouthparts. Fortunately he
had vaccinated his herd.
Texas needs to mount a more aggressive rancher information program in
this region. - Mod.MHJ]
