A horse in Burlington County [New Jersey] was among 3 in the region that tested positive for the mosquito-borne illness Eastern equine encephalitis during the last 2 months, the New Jersey Department of Agriculture said Thursday [25 Sep 2014].

The viral disease was found in a 6-year-old gelding in the county 21 Sep 2014. The horse, which had not been vaccinated, was euthanized the same day, according to the department. The department did not specify the town where the infected horse was kept.

The other 2 cases were discovered 10 Aug 2014 in a 4-year-old mare in Gloucester County [New Jersey], and 11 Sep 2014 in a 2-year-old mare in Ocean County [Sep 2014]. Both horses also were euthanized.

The 3 are the 1st reported cases of the disease this year [2014]. In response, Agriculture Department officials are urging horse owners to make sure their animals' vaccinations are current because the virus can affect horses as well as birds, reptiles and mammals, including humans. The infections in horses are not considered a significant risk factor for humans.

"Horse owners need to be vigilant in vaccinating their animals against diseases spread by mosquitoes," Department of Agriculture Secretary Douglas Fisher said in a statement. "Vaccinated animals are much less likely to contract deadly diseases such as (Eastern equine encephalitis) and West Nile virus."

Horses cannot transmit the virus to humans. However, humans, through carelessness, may allow their horses to acquire the disease. Vaccination protects the horses. It requires 2 vaccines approximately 21 days to 30 days apart to initiate the immunity. In high risk areas, such as near lakes, ponds or in wet years, or if living in coastal areas, horses should have a single repeat injection every 4-6 months. The immunity to Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) wanes very rapidly.

There has also been an increase in equine West Nile virus (WNV) this year (2014). Again, the mantra is vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. WNV vaccine is in combination with EEE and generally with Western equine encephalitis (WEE) as well. In some areas it is possible to include tetanus in the same combination vaccine. Vaccination is a simple way to protect your horse. - Mod.TG]
