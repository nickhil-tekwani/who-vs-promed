A dead bat found in a child's room in Beaumont [Texas] has tested positive for rabies. Beaumont Animal Services got a call about a deceased bat in the 3800 block of Russell Drive on [Sun 14 Aug 2016]. The bat was located in a 10 year old boy's bedroom, according to a press release from Beaumont Animal Services.

The boy was unable to verify, with complete certainty, that he did not have contact with the bat so the animal control officer notified the boy's father that he would be shipping the bat the following day to be tested for rabies.

Animal Services was notified on [Tue 16 Aug 2016], that the bat did test positive for rabies. The local and state health departments were notified and recommended to the family that the boy begin post exposure rabies shots.

Beaumont Animal Services would like to remind people that even though bats are highly beneficial to our ecosystem, with a single bat being able to catch more than 1000 mosquito size insects in just one hour, they still have the potential to carry rabies.

If you find an injured, sick, or dead bat, do not touch it. If a bat is found inside your house, immediately call your local Animal Control agency to have a trained officer sent to capture and remove the bat.

Not all bats found in houses may be sick, some bats are just weighed down when they are carrying their young. The best thing the public can do in relation to bats is to make sure that all of their companion animals are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations to help prevent the spread of the disease.

[2] Utah: bat, human exposure

The Utah County Health Department confirmed 2 of the county's residents have been exposed to rabies.

A representative for the health department said the residents, one male and one female, had contact with bats that tested positive for the disease. One was exposed after their dog had contact with a bat in a yard. The other exposure happened when the individual found a dead bat and picked it up with bare hands.

According to a news release from the health department, rabies is a virus that affects the nervous systems of humans and other mammals. If left untreated, the virus is fatal. A person can contract rabies through a bite, scratch or saliva from an infected animal.

"If you find yourself in close proximity to a bat, dead or alive, do not touch, hit, or destroy it and do not try and remove it from your home," said Steve Mickelson, Utah County Health Department nursing director. "Call your local animal control office to collect the bat for testing. Call your local health department immediately to report the exposure and determine if preventive treatment is needed. If the bat is available for testing and test results are negative, preventive treatment is not needed."

The 2 residents will each be treated with 4 rabies vaccine shots and an immunoglobulin shot.

More information from the Utah County Health Department:
"Animals do not have to be aggressive or behaving erratically to have rabies. Changes in any animal's normal behavior can be early signs of rabies. Bats that are on the ground, unable to fly, or active during the day are more likely than others to be rabid. Such bats are often easily approached but should never be handled."

Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. Spillover events from bats to other hosts are not perpetuated in the recipient species. - Mod.PMB]
