Michigan health officials investigate salmonella infections
-----------------------------------------------------------
Michigan State health officials are investigating at least 11
salmonella infections among Michigan residents who drank
unpasteurized orange juice.
The cases were reported between early May and Jun 2005. 8 infections
were reported in children and 5 required hospitalization. There have
been no deaths.
The infections appear to be linked to unpasteurized orange juice
products recalled by Orchid Island Juice, of Fort Pierce, Florida.
The juice is packaged and distributed under a variety of brand names,
including Nino Salvaggio's, Westborn Market and Natalie's.

[The orginal posting noted 15 cases from Michigan, Ohio and
Massachusetts of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium associated with
the unpasteurized juice with 16 more potential cases in other
states. These 11 cases from Michigan suggest that the number
confirmed to be the same organism has increased, unless only 4 were
from Ohio and Massachusetts. - Mod.LL]
