A nationwide alert has been issued to hospitals, ambulance services
and GPs after a batch of heroin contaminated with anthrax killed 6
addicts in Scotland, raising fears for drug users across the UK. It
is feared that the death toll will rise to at least 10 soon, the
Guardian understands, after cases spread across Scotland from Glasgow
to Lanarkshire, then to Dundee, Fife and now central Scotland.

The 1st cases came to light before Christmas, when an addict died in
hospital in Glasgow. It emerged today that the 6th addict died
earlier this week in Stirling. [For location, see below.] A further 6
users with the lethal bacterial disease are in hospital, in the worst
anthrax scare in recent times.

Health ministers issued an alert to all primary care trusts in
England tonight [7 Jan 2010] after the latest cases came to light,
advising drugs workers, consultants and accidents and emergency units
to watch out for suspected cases. A fresh alert has also been issued
by the agency Health Protection Scotland, which has set up an
outbreak control team to investigate the source of the contamination,
while a parallel investigation has been launched by police. Heroin
users are being urged to stop taking the drug immediately.

Dr Colin Ramsay, the consultant epidemiologist at HPS who is leading
the agency's inquiry, said contaminated heroin, or a contaminated
cutting agent, could be responsible for the infections. "The death of
this patient in NHS Forth Valley indicates further geographical
spread of the cases, meaning that heroin users all across Scotland
need to be aware of the risks of a potentially contaminated supply,"
he said. "If any heroin users do notice signs of infection, for
example marked redness and swelling around an injection site, or
other signs of serious infection such as a high fever, they should
seek urgent medical advice."

The Department of Health alert issued tonight states: "Investigations
are continuing into the cause of these cases and into any heroin
supply routes that may be affected. While cases remain confined to
Scotland, you should be alert to the possibility of anthrax infection
in injecting drug users presenting with severe soft tissue infections
or sepsis."

Dave Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum voluntary organisation,
said it was suspected that a large batch of heroin was to blame. "It
was alarming when it was just centred on Glasgow; now it looks as if
it's following the drugs supply route," he said.

Gordon Meldrum, director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug
Enforcement Agency, said the spate of deaths was disturbing. "Illegal
drugs are often prepared in unhygienic surroundings and can be
vulnerable to contamination from various harmful agents.It is highly
probable that the contamination of heroin by anthrax is accidental
and there is a history of batches of heroin being contaminated in
Afghanistan, Turkey, and other countries key to the production and
supply of heroin. Production processes can be basic and often be
conducted in areas where there is contamination from animal carcasses
or faeces. Our priority remains to reduce the harm to drug users and
the communities they live in and all cases will be investigated and
reported where appropriate to the procurator fiscal."

The 6th casualty was well known for begging in Stirling city centre.
A neighbour said: "He was a wee skinny guy with dark, straggly hair,
who was a junkie and begged on the streets -- but he was a harmless
wee guy. It's a shame."
