Landscaper contracts tularemia in case considered unusual
---------------------------------------------------------
The Vineyard's 1st tularemia case of the year [2005], a 50-year-old
male landscaper, may have contracted the potentially fatal disease
after handling a dead rabbit he found while working in Edgartown,
state public health officials said this week [1st week July 2005].
The latest case, which was confirmed in June 2005, is also notable
because health officials have determined that it was an oropharyngeal
brand of tularemia, indicating that the affected glands were in the
man's throat.
All but 7 of the 30 cases confirmed on the Island since the outbreak
began in the summer of 2000 have been the pneumonic form, leading
medical investigators to advance the theory that people have inhaled
airborne particles contaminated with the tularemia bacterium.
Epidemiologists at the state department of public health (DPH) now
believe that the latest victim also inhaled the bacteria.
"The most likely explanation for his exposure is that he inhaled
coarse particles as opposed to fine, and they didn't make it into his
lungs," said Dr. Bela Matyas, the medical director of the
epidemiology program at the DPH in Boston.
Nearly all the victims of the tularemia outbreak have been
landscapers or people who worked predominantly outdoors. The outbreak
claimed the life of one victim, killing a 43-year-old Chilmark man in
August of 2000. He was known to have mown a lawn near Squibnocket
shortly before he fell ill with flu-like symptoms.
Tularemia is a powerful but rare bacterial disease. Rabbits are the
most common carriers, in addition to rodents, such as squirrels,
voles and muskrats, but a bite from a dog tick is the most typical
way the disease is transmitted to people. On the Vineyard, though,
the pneumonic cases have dominated, making the Island the only place
in the United States to experience an outbreak of pneumonic tularemia.
Dr. Matyas was skeptical yesterday [7 Jul 2005] that this year's case
of oropharyngeal tularemia was contracted by ingesting any of the
bacteria. "He could have handled that rabbit and then handled food,"
said Dr. Matyas. "But maybe he raised up some dirt when he picked up
a dead rabbit."
This week [1st week July 2005], the Edgartown landscaper talked to
the Gazette and explained that he was taking care of a property in
April 2005 on the western edge of Edgartown when he saw the rabbit
carcass. The man, who had only recently moved to the Vineyard, asked
to remain unnamed.
Meanwhile, state officials at the DPH said there are no other confirmed or
probable cases of tularemia on the Island that they are investigating. They
have analyzed about a dozen blood samples from landscapers on the Vineyard who
have been sick, possibly with tularemia, but only this one has turned up
positive for the disease so far. Tularemia affects only about 200 people a year
nationwide.
Alfred DeMaria, the director of communicable disease control at the
DPH, said doctors are treating landscapers who become sick with
antibiotics before there is concrete evidence of tularemia infection.
"People at high risk who come in with symptoms, we're treating them.
Most of the time we want to avoid antibiotics, but we want people to
be over-treated for it," said Dr. DeMaria.
The outbreak of tularemia on the Vineyard has attracted national
attention, not only because of the singularity of such an event in
the medical annals, but also because the bacterium is ranked as one of
the top 5 bioterrorist agents. 3 times in the last 5 years, the CDC
dispatched epidemic intelligence teams to the Vineyard from its
infectious disease facility in Fort Collins, CO to study the outbreak
and unlock the riddle of why such a rare disease is flourishing here.
They came up with [no?] solid answers and concluded simply that the
landscapers were at the highest risk and would be advised to wear
dust masks as a measure of protection from inhaling tularemia
bacteria.
The Katama area of Edgartown and the Squibnocket region in Chilmark
have been identified by researchers as hot spots for tularemia.

[Tularemia, a category A bioterrorism disease, continues to be
endemic on Martha's Vineyard, off the coast of mainland
Massachusetts, USA. Since the landscaper did not consume the rabbit,
it is indeed likely that some aerosol transfer did occur during his
work, or, that hand-to-mouth transfer occurred. - Mod.LL]
