CDC releases plan for a smallpox emergency
------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Mon 26
Nov 2001 released its plans to cope with smallpox if it is used as an agent
of bioterrorism. The plan does not call for mass vaccination in advance of
an outbreak, because the risks associated with vaccination [with Vaccinia
virus are deemed to outweigh the risks of exposure to smallpox virus
[Variola virus.
"Although smallpox was eradicated 21 years ago, we've had such a plan in
draft for many years," said Dr Lisa Rotz, an expert in bioterrorism
preparedness from CDC. The plan was developed in conjunction with state
epidemiologists, bioterrorism coordinators, immunization program managers,
and other health officials. In recent years, CDC and the public health
service have expended considerable effort to expand connectivity nationwide
for rapid communications, Rotz told Reuters Health. "With our HealthAlert
network, we are in much better shape than we were several years ago to
handle a bioterrorism attack," she said. "We're releasing this interim plan
so that state and local health departments can begin to think about state-
and community-wide responses" in the event of an outbreak, Rotz added. For
example, "planners can think about increasing their rapid response
capability, identify personnel who would go immediately to help implement
the guidelines, identify contacts of the cases and who would need
vaccinations, as well as enhancing surveillance.
"At the heart of this plan is ring vaccination, or search and containment,"
she continued. "The idea is to identify individuals infected with smallpox
and identify those who have been in contact with the patient and vaccinate
those in outward rings of contact. This strategy will produce a buffer of
immune individuals." The guidelines note that current supplies of smallpox
vaccine are limited, but vaccine would be available "within hours" of a
case being detected anywhere in the country, Rotz said.
Dr D A Henderson, director of the Office of Public Health Preparedness at
the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, DC, mentioned
reassuring results from recent studies regarding methods to stretch
supplies of the current vaccines. "We've been getting some early reports
from dilution studies, including from one site where they have vaccinated
77 individuals with diluted vaccine. Each person had a "take", so it looks
encouraging for a 1-to-5, perhaps even a 1-to-10 dilution," he said.
Dr Harold Margolis, CDC senior advisor for smallpox preparedness, pointed
out that the vaccines have been used periodically over the years for
laboratory workers. "The manufacturers have continued to conduct a battery
of tests looking at potential microbial contamination and potency. All the
vaccines have maintained their potency for over 20 years," he said.
Henderson wants to allay public fears regarding the potential consequences
of a bioterrorism attack with variola virus. "People are afraid that
someone who is infected could spread the infection widely by traveling on
an airplane. That's not realistic, he pointed out, because there is an
incubation period of 10 to 12 days, followed by 2 to 3 days of high fever
and prostration with severe headache and backache. "It's only after that
point, when the rash begins, that the individual can transmit the disease.
However, people are likely to feel quite poorly and to be staying in bed,
not traveling around the country."
In the guidelines, CDC notes that the overall mortality rate associated
with smallpox is about 30%. Two rare forms of the infection have a nearly
100% mortality rate, however; flat-type smallpox, which is characterized by
severe toxemia and confluent lesions, and hemorrhagic-type smallpox.
