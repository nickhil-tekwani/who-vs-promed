Cases of syphilis among men who have sex with men [MSM] have risen by nearly half in the past year [2014], according to figures released by Public Health England [PHE]. The body released a report today [23 Jun 2015] that shows "the impact of STIs [sexually transmitted infections] remains greatest in young heterosexuals under the age of 25 years and in men who have sex with men."

It delivered a dire warning about the spread of syphilis and gonorrhoea among gay men in England -- with a huge rise in both attributed to risky behaviours.

PHE notes there have been "large increases in STI diagnoses were seen in MSM, including a 46 percent increase in syphilis and a 32 percent increase in gonorrhoea. High levels of condomless sex probably account for most of this rise, although better detection of gonorrhoea may have contributed."

Dr Gwenda Hughes, who leads STI surveillance at Public Health England, said: "We are particularly concerned about the large rises in diagnoses among gay men. In this group we saw a 46 percent increase in syphilis and a 32 percent increase in gonorrhoea. Gonorrhoea in particular is becoming harder to treat as new antibiotic resistant strains emerge.

Dr Hughes continued: "Health promotion and education to increase risk awareness and encourage safer sexual behaviour remain the cornerstones of STI prevention. Ensuring easy access to sexual health services and STI screening is a vital component in the control of STIs. Effective commissioning is critical to improving STI prevention. Prevention work should continue to focus on people in the groups at highest risk of infection, such as young people and gay men."

PHE reminded people: "Men who have sex with men (MSM) should have a full HIV and STI screen at least annually or every 3 months if having condomless sex with new or casual partners."

[The news report above reports on the continued rising incidence of syphilis and gonococcal disease in men who have sex with men (MSM) in the UK, as is occurring in many localities in the United States and in many other countries around the world, where it is frequently associated with high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as lack of condom use, multiple anonymous partners, and use of mobile phone dating apps (such as Tinder and Grindr) to find sexual partners.

Other reasons for the syphilis epidemic in MSM include: 1) an overly optimistic thinking that HIV is no longer the death threat that it once was as a consequence of antiretroviral treatment; 2) use of pre-exposure HIV chemoprophylaxis; 3) an increase in recreational drug use that facilitates high-risk sexual behavior; and 4) serosorting, which is selective unprotected sex with partners of the same HIV-serostatus.

The news report above does not comment on the factors responsible for the continued rise in incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea in the UK. Knowing the responsible factors in this UK outbreak is important so that disease control programs can effectively target efforts to limit continued transmission. - Mod.ML
