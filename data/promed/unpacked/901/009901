An 8-year-old Vietnamese girl from the country's northern Thanh Hoa
Province has been infected with bird flu and hospitalized, said an
official with the National Steering Committee for Avian Influenza
here on Tuesday [6 Jan 2009]. The girl ate chicken before being
hospitalized, the official told Xinhua. Specimens from poultry raised
in Dien Chung town, where the girl is from, have recently tested
positive for bird flu virus, the official added. The girl is now
being treated at the Viet Nam National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology, and she is in a stable condition, said the official.

About 7800 poultry have been culled in Dien Chung Town to prevent
further spread of the disease, said the official. This is the 1st
human case reported in the country this year [2009]. Vietnamese
health officials warned last month [December 2008] that the country
faced risks of bird flu reoccurrence and human infection of the
disease due to the cool temperatures.

Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting from December 2003, have
caused 106 human infectious cases [and 52 fatalities] and led to the
killing of tens of millions of fowl in the country, official figures showed.
