Concerns Regarding Announced Anthrax Vaccinations: Lack of Demonstrated
Safety and Efficacy
Given the Pentagon proposal to vaccinate 1.4 to 2.4 million U.S. troops
with human MDPH anthrax vaccine (produced by the Michigan Department of
Public Health) (1), using a vaccine for which there is only limited
published data regarding both safety and efficacy, it is worthwhile to
review what is known and allow ProMED-mail subscribers to add additional
information and comments.
The vaccine was licensed by the F.D.A. in 1970, based on one published
study by Brachman et al. (2) and presumably on other unpublished data.
Brachman's study, which would be even more difficult to do today, involved
vaccinating New England millworkers exposed to anthrax in imported animal
products in the 1950's, when (generally cutaneous) anthrax was still a
common disease among the employees.
During the four year study period there were 26 cases of anthrax, of which
twenty-one were cutaneous, and five were due to inhalation. One case
occurred in a recipient of the complete vaccine, and two in recipients of
the partial vaccine series. 35% of participants completed the vaccine
series. Although the study calculated vaccine effectiveness as 92.5%, I
believe that all that can be said is that there is some efficacy, but the
actual % efficacy cannot be calculated due to the small number of cases.
Furthermore, what we would really like to know is the efficacy against
inhalation anthrax, because of its resistance to standard treatments and
high (about 90%) mortality. Cutaneous anthrax is amenable to standard
therapy and fatal only when septicemia intervenes.
The small numbers -- five inhalation cases -- do not permit any conclusion
about vaccine efficacy with regard to inhaled organisms. Nor could any
estimate be made of the infectious dose. This is particularly important
because exposure to anthrax in wartime is likely to involve very high
concentrations of the organism, and any vaccine intended for such use must
demonstrate efficacy in this setting.
Since there are currently no populations identified as being at high risk
of anthrax, another "gold standard" study of the vaccine in humans is not
possible. There is animal data, however, which provides an indirect and
incomplete, yet suggestive idea of vaccine efficacy.
P.C.B. Turnbull (3) collected data from five studies in which the U.S.
human vaccine was compared to other anthrax vaccines in exposed guinea
pigs. Various challenge strains of anthrax were used, although the
infectious doses and means by which the animals were exposed were not
specified. Per cent survival in the vaccinated animals ranged from a high
of 100% to a low of 4%. An abridged summary of his table follows. It
comprises data from animals immunized with three doses of the MDPH vaccine
2-3 weeks apart:
Challenge % Survival
Anthrax Strains Vaccinated Unvaccinated
Vollum/Vollum 1B 100 16
9 Other Strains 28 3
Ames 75 0
Vollum 100 0
Ames/NH/Pen Res 4 0
Ames/NH/Pen Res 17 0
Vollum 1B 71 0
Vollum 1B 67 0
Vollum 1B 67 10
Clearly, these guinea pig survival rates do not engender enthusiasm about
how well the vaccine may perform in soldiers facing an airborne anthrax
challenge.
Turnbull stated, "The study of Brachman et al. remains the only one
supplying hard data on the effectiveness of the vaccines in humans.
However, with all the usual cautions that must be applied when
extrapolating data from animals to humans, tests in animals have indicated
that the protective efficacies of both the UK and US vaccines are less than
ideal." He also wrote, "In addition to the uncertain performance outlined
above, the injection into human beings of crude and undefined preparations
is increasingly regarded as unsatisfactory, particularly, as in the case of
the anthrax vaccines, when they are associated with frequent complaints of
unpleasant side-reactions." (4)
A number of candidate vaccines were developed during the 1980's and 1990's,
some of which Turnbull discusses. Their performance in animal tests
surpassed that of the MDPH vaccine. I am unaware whether any of them
underwent human trials. However, given the inadequate supply of the MDPH
vaccine at the time of the Gulf War, as well as the FDA waiver which
allowed the Department of Defense to use unlicensed vaccines and other
therapeutics, one wonders whether other human anthrax vaccines were given
to troops in the Gulf. If so, information on their performance, such as
antibody titres post vaccination, may be available.
Because the MDPH vaccine, despite its 35-year history, had only been used
on small numbers of veterinarians and others with possible occupational
exposures, there was no large scale use from which to make judgments about
safety until the Gulf War. Then an estimated 150,000 troops were given a
partial or full series of injections. It is critical that whatever data
exist regarding safety as well as efficacy in these vaccinees be made
available to the public before the vaccine is used again on a large scale.
Furthermore, since anthrax vaccine in the future is likely to be used in
concert with other prophylactic measures against threat agents like _C.
botulinum_ [toxin and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, the Gulf vaccinees
form a particularly important group for study. Safety should be
demonstrated both when the vaccine is used alone, and also when it is used
with other measures, including use with other vaccines and chemical
protective agents, such as pyridostigmine, atropine, etc.
The Rockefeller Report (of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs) (5)
drew the following conclusion: "Although anthrax vaccine had been
considered approved prior to the Persian Gulf War, it was rarely used.
Therefore, its safety, particularly when given to thousands of soldiers in
conjunction with other vaccines, is not well established. Anthrax vaccine
should continue to be considered as a potential cause for undiagnosed
illnesses in Persian Gulf military personnel because many of the support
troops received anthrax vaccine, and because the DOD believes that the
incidence of undiagnosed illness in support troops may be higher than in
combat troops."
My final concern regarding the use of the MDPH anthrax vaccine in the
prevention of biological warfare-induced disease is theoretical. I presume
that genetically engineered strains may be used. It does not require much
sophistication to create antibiotic-resistant anthrax strains. It is
possible, perhaps likely, that "vaccine-resistant" strains may be used.
Such strains have been used by anthrax researchers in the US to test the
efficacy of candidate vaccines. Other innovations in anthrax virulence can
only be guessed at. Has the MDPH vaccine demonstrated efficacy against
strains engineered for extra virulence? Even if it has, it may well face
strains never before seen in our laboratories. Is it reasonable to assume
any vaccine efficacy in such unpredictable circumstances?
Because these are serious issues which the Army failed to consider in its
environmental assessment (6), the one opportunity that existed for public
comment, I hope ProMED-mail's experts will shed additional light on this
subject.
