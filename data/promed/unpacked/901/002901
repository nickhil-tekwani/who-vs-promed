---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Excerpt.] Historically, the emergence of infectious diseases in humans has most often been caused by interspecies barrier breakthrough of animal-origin pathogens. A natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 is by far the most likely scenario. Pinpointing the precise natural origin of the virus would also help to reject alternative hypotheses. Characterisation of the codon preferences of SARS-CoV-2 and its genome's structure indicate that the circulating virus is highly similar to strains carried by wild animals. The virus's evolutionary history in animals and its fast adaptive mutation within the infected human population also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to have come from nature than other potential sources. A variety of evidence indicates that horseshoe bat species found in Cambodia, Thailand, Japan, and the southwest border areas of China, as well as Malayan pangolins captured in anti-smuggling actions, carry coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. Although the animal viruses that have been identified are not immediate precursors of SARS-CoV-2, their existence suggests that global investigations into the evolutionary characteristics of the animal origin for SARS-CoV-2 are warranted. Such investigations would include testing wild animal hosts of coronaviruses at the nucleic acid and serum levels to positively identify the natural origin of the cross-species spillover. Various studies have already reported that several species of mammals (including mink, civets, cats, pangolins, rabbits, ferrets, foxes, deer, etc.) are capable of being infected by SARS-CoV-2. It is entirely possible that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses could cross the species barrier between humans and animals repeatedly in many parts of the world. In fact, it is almost certain that such animal-to-human transmissions are happening repeatedly. There are many unsuccessful jumps before a virus takes to humans. Therefore, tracing such sporadic zoonoses and the virus's potential intermediate hosts among an even greater range of animal species in the real world is also of great importance.

[B] SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in Laos
Date: Sat 18 Sep 2021 2:21 a.m. PDT

Bats dwelling in limestone caves in northern Laos were found to carry coronaviruses that share a key feature with SARS-CoV-2, moving scientists closer to pinpointing the cause of COVID-19.

Researchers at France's Pasteur Institute and the University of Laos looked among hundreds of horseshoe bats for viruses similar to the one that causes COVID. They found 3 with closely matched receptor binding domains, the part of the coronavirus's spike protein used to bind to human ACE-2, the enzyme it targets to cause an infection.

The finding, reported in a paper released Friday [17 Sep 2021] that's under consideration for publication by a Nature journal [see citation below], shows that viruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 exist in nature, including in several _Rhinolophus_, or horseshoe bat, species. The research supports the hypothesis that the pandemic began from a spillover of a bat-borne virus. About 1000 such infections may be occurring daily in southern China and Southeast Asia in areas with dense populations of bats from the _Rhinolophus_ genus, a study Tuesday [14 Sep 2021] found.

The 3 viruses found in Laos, dubbed BANAL-52, BANAL-103, and BANAL-236, are "the closest ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 known to date," said Marc Eloit, head of pathogen discovery at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and co-authors. "These viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2's origin and may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans."

The receptor binding domains of 3 Laos coronaviruses are closer to that of SARS-CoV-2 than to the RaTG13 virus identified in _Rhinolophus affinis_ bats from the Mojiang mineshaft in Yunnan province, which was regarded as the pandemic strain's closest match. The BANAL-236 virus has an almost identical receptor binding domain to the pandemic virus, according to the paper.

"The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 looked unusual when it was first discovered because there were so few viruses to compare it to," said Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, who wasn't involved in the research.

"Now that we are sampling more from nature, we are starting to find these closely related bits of gene sequence," Holmes said in an email Saturday [18 Sep 2021]. "Eventually, with more sampling, the natural ancestry of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome will be revealed."

None of the bat viruses isolated in Laos harbors a so-called furin cleavage site in the spike that facilitates cell entry. It's a feature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has led some scientists to theorize that it was created in a laboratory.

No evidence supporting the lab-leak theory has emerged. Last month [August 2021], the US intelligence community ruled out the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was developed by China as a biological weapon, but no consensus was reached on its origin.

The lack of furin cleavage may be explained by insufficient sampling in bats, or by acquisition of the furin cleavage site during chains of transmission in an alternate animal host, or during unreported circulation in humans in the early stages of the outbreak when the virus may have caused few symptoms, the authors said.

"Our results pinpoint the presence of new bat sarbecoviruses that seem to have the same potential for infecting humans as early strains of SARS-CoV-2," they said.

People who spend time in or close to caves, such as guano collectors, are particularly at risk of being exposed. Further investigations are needed to assess if people exposed to bats have been infected by one of these viruses and whether they have antibodies that may provide protection against subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infections.

"This paper is really interesting, and we need more research like it," said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead for COVID-19, in an email.

The researchers studied 645 bats from 46 species captured on 4 sites -- in Fueng and Meth districts of Vientiane province, and in Namor and Xay districts in Oudomxay province -- between July 2020 and January 2021. The bats live in the limestone karstic terrain common to China, Laos, and Viet Nam in the Indochina peninsula.

The paper highlights the diversity of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses present in bats in Southeast Asia, Holmes said.

"Continual sampling is the only way to understand the origins of this virus, and it is important that more sampling is done throughout China as this remains the most likely place of origin," he said. "This study emphasizes that bat coronaviruses that have the potential to infect humans readily exist in nature and could emerge at any point. This is the clear risk for the future."

[C] Estimating spillover incidence
Date: Thu 16 Sep 2021
Source: Science.org [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/sars-viruses-may-jump-animals-people-hundreds-thousands-times-year


Only 2 new coronaviruses have spread globally the past 2 decades: SARS-CoV, which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. But that may just be the tip of the iceberg of undetected infections with related viruses emerging from bats, a new paper claims [see citation below]. In a preprint published yesterday [14 Sep 2021], researchers estimate that an average of 400 000 people are likely infected with SARS-related coronaviruses every year, in spillovers that never grow into detectable outbreaks.

Although that number comes with big caveats, "It should be eye-opening to the entire scientific community that we don't know very much about the frequency of zoonotic spillover," says virologist Angela Rasmussen of the University of Saskatchewan, who was not involved in the work. That needs to change, she says, "because otherwise we grossly underestimate it."

The researchers, including Peter Daszak from the EcoHealth Alliance and Linfa Wang from Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, created a detailed map of the habitats of 23 bat species known to harbor SARS-related coronaviruses, the group to which SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong, and then overlaid it with data on where humans live to create a map of potential infection hot spots. They found that close to 500 million people live in areas where spillovers can occur, including northern India, Nepal, Myanmar, and most of Southeast Asia. The risk is highest in southern China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and on Java and other islands in Indonesia.

"This is a definitive analysis of where on the planet the next SARS- or COVID-like virus is most likely to emerge," Daszak says. The maps could guide efforts to reduce the likelihood of spillover by changing behaviors in high-risk communities and targeting surveillance to detect new outbreaks earlier, he says. Daszak, a vocal advocate of the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 came from the wild instead of a research lab, says the maps could also guide efforts to find the virus' natural origin. (Several studies are underway or being planned to look for SARS-CoV-2 and its relatives in _Rhinolophus_ [horseshoe] bats and other animals.)

But the researchers went one step further. Small surveys done before COVID-19 erupted have suggested some people in Southeast Asia harbor antibodies against SARS-related coronaviruses. Combining those data with data on how often people encounter bats and how long antibodies remain in the blood, the researchers calculated that some 400 000 undetected human infections with these viruses occur each year across the region.

Daszak says interactions with bats are much more common than people think: "Just living there means you're exposed: People are sheltering in caves, they're digging guano out of caves, they're hunting and eating bats." The paper does not even address how many people work in the wildlife trade and may be infected indirectly when a bat virus infects another animal first, he says.

Although 400 000 infections annually sounds like a lot, Rasmussen says that "in a region with likely hundreds of millions of bats and nearly half a billion people, it isn't that many." The confidence interval stretches from one to more than 35 million hidden infections per year, however, big enough to "fly the entire population of Rhinolophid bats through," Rasmussen quips. Models are only as good as the data that are fed into them, says Vincent Munster, a virologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who studies coronaviruses. The data on antibodies only include a few thousand people, he notes, and the assays used to test for antibodies can easily lead to false positives.

"I think if the seroprevalence estimate is way off, the whole thing collapses," says David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, who calls the modeling "shaky." The high number of hidden infections "doesn't ring true," Fisman says, because you would expect regular spillovers to be recognized, as they are for rabies and the Nipah virus.

But Rasmussen says many infections could remain hidden if they are short-lived and don't lead to onward transmission because the viruses are not well adapted to humans. They might not infect enough cells -- or cells of the right type -- to be transmitted to another person, or they might not be able to escape humans' immune defenses. In cases when the virus does spread, sheer chance may keep it confined to a small, isolated community.

"A lot of the viruses are probably unable to be transmitted from one person to another, but I have very little doubt that there have been illnesses due to these viruses that get misdiagnosed or never diagnosed," Daszak says. "A rural farmer in Myanmar is hardly likely to go to the clinic because they've got a bit of a cough."

The work is part of a nascent effort to try to understand the risk factors for viral spillover from animals into humans, Munster says. Already, one message is clear, he says: "I think for virtually any zoonotic pathogen from wildlife, spillover is more frequent than previously recognized."

Sanchez CA, Li H, Phelps KL, et al. A strategy to assess spillover risk of bat SARS-related coronaviruses in Southeast Asia. medRxiv. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.09.21263359.

Article [A] above is an impassioned letter to The Lancet from Chinese researchers calling for a broader-based investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2. I have excerpted only a small portion of their letter, in which the authors recommend searching for SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in countries (such as those in Southeast Asia) known to harbor the horseshoe bat species and various wild animal species associated with this coronavirus family of sarbecoviruses, and making the point that animal-to-human transmission of these viruses must be happening repeatedly, even if most such spillover events are undetected.

Almost as if to answer this call to action in The Lancet letter, field and laboratory investigators from the Pasteur Institute and the University of Laos studied numerous bat species found in limestone caves in northern Laos and found 3 coronaviruses very closely related to SARS-CoV-2 [item B]. This is the 1st solid evidence of multiple SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in Southeast Asia and outside of China and lends support to the notion that the search for ancestors and relatives of SARS-CoV-2 should extend beyond manmade political borders.

Finally, modelers primarily from EcoHealth Alliance have developed a framework for quantifying the extent of undetected spillover events, coming up with the initial eye-popping figure of 400 000 SARS-like virus spillovers in humans annually [item C]. As pointed out by Drs. Munster and Fisman in the Science news article, however, false positive serology tests could lead to a drastic overestimate of the true number of spillover events. If a given infection has a low incidence (in this case, approximately 400 000 spillover events among about 400-500 million inhabitants, or about 1 in 1000 individuals), and a serological test is only 95% specific, then Bayes Theorem predicts that the vast majority of reported positives will be false positives. Nevertheless, setting aside this and other potential issues deriving from limited or poor-quality existing data, Sanchez et al. have proposed a useful framework to estimate SARS-like virus spillover events that incorporates inputs from the bat host, human-bat interface, virus, and human (see Fig. 4 in the URL above). - Mod.LXL]

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including the USA (66 898), India (29 620), UK (29 438), Thailand (29 125), Turkey (26 161), Philippines (23 075), Brazil (22 789), Russia (20 329), Malaysia (15 549), Iran (12 847), and Mexico (11 711) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7113 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 16 Sep 2021 to late 17 Sep 2021). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 4.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 4.2% decrease in daily reported cases and 17.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 228.93 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.70 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
