Man infected with angiostrongylus after eating snails
-----------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Taiwan) revealed yesterday [31 Jan 2013] that a 48 year old man had been infected with _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ after eating undercooked snails.

The CDC [Taiwan] said that _A. cantonensis_ can enter the human body through the consumption of parasitized snails or slugs, so people should pay extra attention when handling these types of food. According to the CDC, the man had snail soup with 5 of his friends a few days before exhibiting symptoms of headaches and neck stiffness.

CDC official, Doctor Luo Yi-jun said "he started to have fever and headaches a week to a month after eating the snail soup and his doctor found that _A. cantonensis_ had affected his brain." According to the CDC, the patient is still undergoing medical treatment in a hospital. Meanwhile, his friends who had snail soup with him have not shown any symptoms of infection.

Luo said that snails are the primary intermediate hosts of _A. cantonensis_. Humans are incidental hosts of this roundworm, and may become infected through ingestion of larvae in raw or undercooked snails or other vectors, or from contaminated water and vegetables. "When _A. cantonensis_ infects human brains," Luo said, "the most common symptoms are headaches and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or altered consciousness, and vomiting." According to the CDC, aside from this patient, 8 out of the 9 people who were infected with _A. cantonensis_ last year [2012] had consumed snails. They all made full recoveries after receiving medical treatments.

The CDC said that people should wear gloves when handling snails and boil them for at least 3 minutes to avoid infection. _A. cantonensis_, also known as the rat lungworm, is prevalent in Southeast Asia and tropical Pacific islands. The recognized distribution of the parasite has been increasing over time and infections have been identified in other areas, including Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States.

[Small outbreaks and single cases of _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ are seen regularly in communities where consumption of raw snails is regarded as a delicacy. The infection may be overwhelming and lethal. Eosinophilia is the key finding which should lead to suspicion of _A. cantonensis_. - Mod.EP
