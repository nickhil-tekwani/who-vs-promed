2000/024 First report of potato spindle tuber viroid in Costa Rica
In 1997/1998 symptoms of leaf roll, dwarfism, chlorosis and occasional leaf
necrosis were observed in several potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) fields in
Cartago, the main potato-growing region of Costa Rica. Leaf samples from
122 symptomatic potato plants (cvs Atzimba, Floresta, Idiafrit, Birris)
were collected from 10 plots and tested (dot blot hybridization, biological
test on tomato _Lycopersicon esculentum_ cv. Super Marmande). Results
showed the presence of potato spindle tuber viroid (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) in diseased samples. This is the first report of potato spindle tuber
viroid in Costa Rica.

[Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) causes a economically important
disease in potato. It is easily spread by contact (grafting, pruning, leaf
contact). Detection of the pathogen has depended on infectivity indexing on
indicator hosts or more recently by nucleic acid hybridization assays. USDA
and CIP scientists have developed a PCR protocol for rapid and specific
detection of PSTVd RNA that can be used for certification and quarantine
programs. A recent paper (M. Querci et al, 1997. Evidence for heterologous
transmission of potato spindle tuber viroid in particles of potato leaf
roll virus. J. Gen. Virol. 78: 1207) demonstrated that PSTVd could be
transmitted by the green peach aphid (_Mysus persicae_) from potato plants
doubly infected with the viroid and potato leafroll virus (PLRV) but not
from potato
infected only with PSTVd. - Mod.DH
