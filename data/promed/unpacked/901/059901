[The latest information available from the OIE WAHID database indicates that Newcastle disease had been reported in Macedonia as absent since 2005. See Macedonia's OIE 6-month report, January to June 2019, at https://tinyurl.com/y7ym2pfl.

According to the media report published on 10 Apr 2020, "After experts determine the extent of the contamination, the hatchery will be quarantined for 21 days or longer. In the meantime, the premises, the equipment, and the vehicles will be thoroughly disinfected. No new chickens will be brought in until an official veterinarian declares the poultry disease eradicated.

"State veterinarians will be inspecting commercial poultry farms in Pretovec, Ilinden, Kisela Voda, as well as the municipalities of Zelenikovo and Studenichani, to see whether the infection has spread among neighboring chicken flocks" (https://mia.mk/newcastle-disease-found-in-local-poultry-farm-chickens-to-be-destroyed/?lang=en). This information (in Macedonian) is also available on the Food and Veterinary agency website at <fva.gov.mk/mk/200409-potvrdena-bolesta-nukastel-farma-brojleri-gazi-baba>. - Mod.CRD
