In the event Northeast Tennessee anglers haven't had enough troublesome news to tide them over, we've got more.

The presence of whirling disease -- [caused by] a dreaded neurological parasite that cripples rainbow trout -- has been discovered in the Watauga River near Foscoe, N.C. The infestation was confirmed by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission late last month [July 2015].

The infected area is part of the upstream tributary that feeds Watauga Lake. That alone is disconcerting. The way whirling disease works, however, it can take all kinds of shortcuts into Northeast Tennessee trout streams.

"All it takes is for 1 fisherman to bring it over clinging on their boots," said Huck Huckaba at Eastern Fly Outfitters in Piney Flats.

"So far, nothing has been reported in Tennessee, but everyone needs to be aware. In the very least, make sure you clean and dry your boots before changing watersheds," he said.

When whirling disease became a scourge of numerous western trout streams, biologists recommended disinfecting waders and wading shoes with chlorine bleach. Subsequent research revealed that washing boots with common dish detergent and rinsing them off was just as effective -- and not as hard on expensive wading gear.

Brown trout seem to be fairly resistant to the parasitic spores that cause whirling disease, but rainbow and brook trout are particularly susceptible to it.

The disease attacks the trout's central nervous system, eventually warping the spine in such a way that the infected fish can only swim in circles. Obviously, a trout in this condition is not long for this earth. Don't contribute to the spread of this hideousness by being too lazy to clean and dry your wading boots.

[Whirling disease affects salmonids (i.e., trouts, salmon, grayling, whitefish). The etiologic agent, _Myxobolus cerebralis_, is a protozoan that was introduced to the United States from Europe in the 1950s.

It needs to infect a tubificid oligochaete (_Tubifex tubifex_, a kind of segmented worm) to complete its life-cycle (in fact, _T. tubifex_ is the definitive host of _M. cerebralis_, and fish are intermediary hosts). Infection by the parasite in fish does not always lead to development of the disease or to population losses. However, this can occur under certain circumstances, and whirling disease has been associated with major fishery losses and economic costs.

The impact on wild salmonid populations is associated with the lineage of _T. tubifex_ present in the area, as some are more prone to be infected.

Whirling disease cannot infect humans, mammals, or fish that are not members of the salmonid family. - Mod.PMB
