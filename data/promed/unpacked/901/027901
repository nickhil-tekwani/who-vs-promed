More than 10 000 patients in the northern province of Chiang Mai have suffered dengue fever this year [2013] with 8 fatalities from the virus, according to a top Public Health Ministry official.

Chiang Mai Public Health Office deputy director Dr Surasingha Wisarutrat said 10 017 persons have been diagnosed with dengue fever since January [2013], with 9320 of the afflicted being Thais, while 697 were migrant workers from neighbouring countries. He said that 8 have died from the disease and added that the most affected were Mae Ai district followed by Mae Taeng and Doi Tao districts.

Dr Surasingha said the Chiang Mai Health Office has urged all communities in the province to help implement pro-active measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He said that although the dengue fever epidemic has declined, the effort to destroy larvae breeding sites should continue.

The public health office will conduct a Big Cleaning Day in villages and communities beginning in September [2013] to eradicate the mosquito larvae.
