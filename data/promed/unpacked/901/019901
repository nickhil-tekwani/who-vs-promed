Further comment on the disease security issue
---------------------------------------------
In the press report cited in the ProMED-mail post archived as "Influenza A
virus, virulence, 1918 pandemic strain 20041007.2754", Dr Kawaoka seems to
indicate that the possibility of treatment of other influenza type A
strains with "Tamiflu" (oseltamivir) makes biosafety level 3 containment
sufficiently prudent for his new 1918 pandemic-like one.
However, shortening duration of symptoms once they appear and preventing
development of clinical illness by initiating treatment shortly after
exposure does not necessarily amount to maintaining sufficient control of
person-to-person spread to prevent another pandemic, should the virus
infect someone. Even in clinical research, few drugs are 100 per cent
effective; and in actual clinical use, effectiveness is less than efficacy,
so that some patients may not respond well to treatment. Prophylaxis
against illness is not the same as prevention of infection and leaves open
the potential for transmission by an asymptomatic carrier.
Furthermore, oseltamivir has not been tested clinically against any
comparably virulent strain, and potential of the virus for rapid extension
throughout the lungs might overwhelm the protection offered by the drug,
however unlikely that may seem at present. Presumably Dr Kawaoka has
determined through experiment that his particular strain happens not to be
one that is resistant to oseltamivir at pharmacologic concentrations, and
hopefully there will be no opportunity for his viruses to pick up or
develop alleles that confer resistance.
Nonetheless, with stakes so high, it may pay to return the reconstructed
virus to a level 4 facility... and to take special steps to secure that
facility against bioterrorists.
