In a follow-up to a report concerning a health advisory issued in California over _Serratia marcescens_ bloodstream infections potentially associated with BD PosiFlush™ Heparin Lock Flush and BD™ Pre-Filled Normal Saline Flush syringes, Nebraska health officials issued the following (see http://dhhs.ne.gov/publichealth/HAN/han%20Documents/ADVISORY043018.pdf):

CDC, state, and local health departments, and FDA are investigating an ongoing multi-state outbreak of _Serratia marcescens_ bloodstream infections. Molecular testing of clinical isolates from patients in 3 states (Colorado, Tennessee, and Ohio) has resulted in an indistinguishable or closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern, suggesting a possible shared exposure.

The infections are primarily among pediatric patients with central venous access. Common exposures identified include heparin and saline flushes, specifically, BD PosiFlush™ Heparin Lock Flush and BD™ Pre-Filled Normal Saline Flush syringes, all manufactured by BD.

No products have tested positive for _S. marcescens_ to date. Product testing is ongoing; other products cannot be ruled out at this time.

Out of an abundance of caution, BD is voluntarily recalling certain lots of BD PosiFlush™ Heparin Lock Flush and BD™ Pre-Filled Normal Saline Flush syringes due to this potential contamination with _S. marcescens_ [recalled product lot numbers are available at http://legacy.bd.com/alerts-notices/posiflush-recall.asp).

[The news report above describes a multistate outbreak of _Serratia marcescens_ bacteremia, occurring primarily in pediatric patients with central venous access. Genotyping of clinical isolates from patients in 3 states (Colorado, Tennessee, and Ohio) suggested a common source and the outbreak has been associated epidemiologically with pre-filled syringes containing heparin or normal saline that were said to be manufactured by a single company. The company has recalled the products. However, cultures of the syringes are said so far to be negative.

_S. marcescens_ are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family. _Serratia_ is not normally part of the human flora and _S. marcescens_ has been increasingly recognized as an important pathogen, especially in healthcare settings and in adult and pediatric compromised patients (1). The organism is also known for its propensity to develop antimicrobial resistance. Colonized or infected patients and contaminated environmental surfaces represent important reservoirs for these organisms. Transmission through carriage on the hands of healthcare personnel and on sinks and other hospital equipment are important routes in many nosocomial outbreaks.

_S. marcescens_ has caused NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) sepsis outbreaks due to contamination of intravenous (IV) fluids (see ProMED-mail post Serratia marcescens - Venezuela (02): (CA) NICU, fatal 20120417.1103584). Contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing has also been found to be a source in another NICU outbreak (2).

A multistate outbreak of _S. marcescens_ bloodstream infection was reported in 2009 to be associated with contamination of prefilled heparin and/or saline syringes made by a single company, but, unlike the current outbreak, cultures of unopened prefilled heparin and saline syringes manufactured by this company grew _S. marcescens_ that genetically matched clinical isolates (3).
