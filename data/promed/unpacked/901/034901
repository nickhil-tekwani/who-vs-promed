European Parliament decides on a communicable disease network
------------------------------------------------------------------
On 24 September the European Parliament and Council, with the help of
the Commission, decided to set up a network for epidemiological
surveillance and an early warning and response system for the prevention
and control of communicable diseases in the European Community (EC) (1).
A network committee, representing the member states and the Commission,
will consider measures proposed by the Commission before they are
adopted. The Commission, with the member states, have been called upon
to ensure that this network is consistent with and complementary to the
relevant EC public health programmes and interchange of data between
administrations (IDA) telematic projects. The decision comes into effect
on 3 January 1999.
Scientists continue to debate whether surveillance, prevention, and
control of infectious diseases should be carried out by and from a
European centre for infectious diseases akin to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States or through a virtual
centre based on electronic networks. The European Parliament had
favoured a central institution and the Commission a network with
national surveillance centres acting as nodes. To date specific disease
networks, such as the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring
of AIDS, the EuroTB programme, ENTER-NET, and EWGLI (European Working
Group on Legionella Infections), the development of telematics for
effective communication about outbreaks, and an inventory of
communicable disease surveillance, have produced European data sets and
enabled effective action for the public health to be taken without a
European centre (2,3). The debate now appears to have been overtaken by
the decision of the European Parliament.

providing they talk to each other!
