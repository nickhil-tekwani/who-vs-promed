Mozambique: Disease Hits Staple Crop in the North
-------------------------------------------------
Parts of Mozambique's northern province of Nampula are facing food
shortages due to devastation of the staple crop, cassava, by brown
streak disease.

The World Food Programme (WFP) deputy director in Mozambique, Karin
Manente, told IRIN on Tuesday that the agency was "setting up an
assessment mission" to visit the affected districts in Nampula and
would be able to assist the affected districts after the assessment
mission returned with its findings, including the numbers of people
in need.

A joint WFP and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) crop and food
supply assessment mission earlier in 2004 found that the main problem
regarding pests and diseases is cassava brown streak disease, which
is seriously affecting yields in Memba [a district of Nampula] and to
a lesser extent in parts of the neighbouring districts

Farmers had tried to harvest their cassava crops earlier than usual
in an attempt "to beat the rot that sets in and spoils the tubers".

Manente said it was now evident that 3 or 4 districts in the northern
coastal area of Nampula had been adversely affected by the spread of
brown streak disease. "Cassava is a staple food in that part of the
country ... we're setting up a mission and looking at how we can
support them. Already we are talking to a couple of NGOs about a
programme to support [people in need] in those areas for a 3 to 6
months."

Meanwhile, a preliminary report from a joint government and WFP
mission to Chemba, Maringue and Buzi districts in the central Sofala
province "indicates a worsening food security situation".

In its latest situation report, WFP noted that "most of the people
interviewed have food stocks to last only through September, and
others through October".

"Also, the Zumbo district administration in the western province of
Tete reported that 14 500 people were food-insecure in 17 villages.
According to the administrator, some of them are abandoning their
houses ... in search of food aid. WFP is working closely with
cooperating partners to assess the situation," the report added.

The joint WFP/FAO crop and food supply assessment report indicated
that some 187 000 Mozambicans would require food aid until March 2005.

[According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses),
Cassava brown streak disease virus (CBSD) is a member of the genus Potyvirus,
family Potyviridae, but its etiology and epidemiology have not been fully
characterized, and no insect vector has been identified. As is the case with
cassava mosaic disease, the CBSD virus may be transmitted by whiteflies -- a
group at the University of Bristol (U.K.) has reported transmission of the
virus by whiteflies.

Cassava is a hardy, drought-resistant tuber with an edible root that
grows in tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. It provides an
important source of energy for millions of people in Africa. CBSD
infection causes a dry necrotic rot in the storage roots, decimating
yields, often leading to complete spoilage or significant reductions
in quality. Disease management involves planting of stem cuttings
from healthy plants without leaf chlorosis, shoot tip die-back,
cankers, fungus patches, or streaks on the stems.

The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has begun
a major, proactive emergency program to combat the disease and
stabilize production of this important food crop. Locally grown
cassava cultivars with apparent resistance -- or tolerance -- to CBSD
have been identified in Tanzania and Mozambique and are being
evaluated. These less susceptible cultivars have been made available
to selected farmers in villages in Tanzania, and in Mozambique for
evaluation by National Agricultural Research Services and the
International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) programmes to
screen a wide range of cassava material for resistance to CBSD.
