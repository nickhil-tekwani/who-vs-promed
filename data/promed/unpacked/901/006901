Bird flu has been reported in different animals in 2 parts of Wales as a high alert warning has been issued across the UK.

Newport City Council posted that wild geese and swans in the city had tested positive for the "highly pathogenic avian influenza HPAI H5N5". The Department of Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) has also said a case has been reported in the past week [7-13 Dec 2020] in a little grebe, a type of water bird, in Carmarthenshire.

Nearly 150 cases have been reported across the UK since the beginning of November [2020], prompting advice to the general public and bird owners. One of the largest outbreaks was reported this week at a wild bird rescue centre near Droitwich Spa in Worcestershire on 13 Dec 2020. All birds on the premises had to be humanely culled.

The risk level has been increased to "very high" for wild birds and "medium" level for poultry. Anyone who sees a dead bird is asked not to touch it -- and if you see a dead or visibly sick bird, particularly swans, geese, ducks, gulls or birds of prey, they should be reported to Defra through 03459 335577.

Anyone who keeps birds must now keep them inside, as new rules are in place due to the increased number of cases across both England and Wales. Bird keepers must also follow strict biosecurity measures. The rules have been tightened after Defra issued a warning in November [2020] about bird flu potentially being on the rise.

The risk to public health is said to be very low, and the Food Standards Agency said that on the basis of current scientific evidence it posed a very low safety risk for UK consumers. Defra has also pointed out that avian flu is not linked to coronavirus.

[Currently, HPAI viruses appear to be propagating quickly in Europe. During the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus in Europe in 2016-2017, HPAI viruses of subtype H5N5 were also isolated, although in a more limited number. Experiments in primary chicken and duck cells revealed only minor differences in cytopathogenicity and replication kinetics between H5N5 genotypes and H5N8. Results of a recent study by Bergervoet et al. (1) led to the conclusion that the limited spread and the differences in geographical distribution of HPAI H5N5 viruses compared with H5N8 are related to the timing of the reassortment events and introduction into Europe rather than changes in virus pathogenicity or replication kinetics. However, a similar scenario is observed this year (2020), so other explanations might be operating. - Mod.PMB
