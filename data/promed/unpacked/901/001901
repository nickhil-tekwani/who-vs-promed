- 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported, one collected from Sindh province, and one from Balochistan province.

Afghanistan
- 1 new case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was reported this week from Kama district, Nangarhar province. Onset of this latest case was [1 Jan 2018].
- This is the 1st officially reported WPV1 case in Afghanistan in 2018, and highlights the challenges faced by the programme in the last few areas where the virus is still circulating, and the importance of identifying and vaccinating every last child.
- 1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample was reported this week, collected in Kandahar district, Kandahar province on [27 Dec 2017].
- A vaccination campaign using bOPV was completed last week, targeting over 5 million children.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Zhob district, Balochistan province, with onset on [15 Nov 2017].
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2017 remains 8. There are no cases reported in 2018.
- 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week; 1 was collected from Karachi Site, Sindh province, and 1 was collected from Killa Abdullah district, Balochistan province. Both samples were collected on [1 Jan 2018].
- A nationwide vaccination campaign using bOPV was completed last week, vaccinating over 37 million children.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- An immunization campaign held in 14 provinces across Nigeria, including Borno, was completed last week. The campaign vaccinated over 26 million children using bOPV.
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission.
- As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Phase 3 of outbreak response is launching this month January [2018], taking into account the recommendations made during the November [2017] Outbreak Response Assessments for the countries and the Technical Advisory Group meeting in December [2017]. The objective is to maintain and improve the multinational, regional outbreak response across the Lake Chad basin region, in particular improving operations, reach and surveillance among hard-to-reach areas and populations.

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

[The good news this week is that 2017 was an all time low for cases of WPV1 associated paralytic polio, worldwide with only 22 cases reported all year (there were still 412 AFP - acute flaccid paralysis - cases in Pakistan pending resolution by the end of week 51 in 2017 http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/pakistan/Week_51-Dec_23_2017.pdf). More good news is that there are no new cases of cVDPV2 in either Syria or in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It's too soon to "celebrate" interruption of transmission, but hopefully celebration will be forthcoming.

The not-so-good news this week is the confirmation of a case of WPV1 in Afghanistan, and the isolation of WPV1 from environmental samples in 1 province in Afghanistan (not where the newly confirmed case is from) and in 2 provinces in Pakistan (where most recent confirmed cases have date of onset in mid-November 2017). The significance of the positive environmental samples is that the WPV1 is still circulating in the region.

[2] Rumors impacting vaccination activities - Nigeria
Date: Thu 25 Jan 2018

The Conversation:
Author: Oyewale Tomori, Fellow, Nigerian Academy of Science

When a rumour surfaced in 2003 that Nigeria's polio vaccine was possibly being contaminated with anti-fertility agents a boycott of the vaccine ensued and the country's polio immunisation campaign was dealt a heavy blow.

The boycott lasted for nearly 15 months - from February 2003 to July 2004 - and it had devastating consequences. The polio caseload shot up. And by 2008, Nigeria alone accounted for 86 percent of all the polio cases on the continent. Since the boycott the country has struggled to be declared polio free.

The country's polio immunisation campaign, and its entire routine immunisation programme, face another possible setback. A round of rumours has been circulating that people dressed in Army uniforms were forcefully vaccinating primary and secondary school children and injecting them with unknown diseases. Social media was flooded with rumours that the campaign is a ploy to infect the children of the region with the Monkey Pox Virus aimed to wipe out the people of the region. The rumours caused massive panic and even led to the closure of schools in the south east and north east of Nigeria as parents have rushed to take their children home.

The military exercise was started in September last year [2017] and the rumours came at a time when the Nigerian Army was conducting Special Security and Training Exercise, code-named Crocodile Smile 2' for the South-South and South West zones of Nigeria.

The Nigerian government dismissed the social media reports, declaring that only the federal, state and local government health agencies are authorised to administer vaccines to pupils nationwide.

But the country's efforts to eradicate polio could be hanging in the balance. The reports from state health care agencies are that the rumours are starting to take their toll.

Nigeria is still not polio free. In 2014, it came close, after being removed from the list of polio endemic countries in the world. But new cases have since emerged and it remains the only country in Africa and one of 3 in the world (the others being Afghanistan and Pakistan) that has not eradicated polio.

Worringly the boycott may have led to a transmission of the virus to other countries. Cases of the virus genetically linked to those originating in Nigeria have been found in Yemen and Indonesia which had already eliminated the disease.
[There were many countries that were impacted by the boycott in Nigeria in 2003 in addition to Yemen and Indonesia - Mod.MPP]

Nigerian health authorities are concerned that in addition to affecting the polio campaign, the rumours could affect routine immunisation in general. The worst case scenario would be that diseases that should have been eliminated could continue to be transmitted.

The rumours that caused the 2003 polio vaccine boycott in northern Nigeria were fuelled and festered by a combination of factors and circumstances.

Firstly, they came at a time when people had had bad experiences with government health interventions. A few years earlier 11 children in the northern state of Kano had died during a meningitis clinical trial conducted by Pfizer.

Secondly, there were political tensions linked to the 2003 presidential election which led to a distrust of the government at the time and support of the boycott.

Thirdly, the rumours were effectively confirmed by influential and highly placed political and religious leaders who gave them credence.

A spokesman for one of the state governors was quoted as saying: "our people have become really concerned about polio vaccine."

In addition to these statements some political and religious leaders in Kano, Zamfara and Kaduna - all states in northern Nigeria - called on parents not to allow their children to be immunised.

There are several important steps that the Nigerian government must take to neutralise rumours before they lead to dire health consequences. It must start by building public trust.

But it is also important for the government to combat ignorance with knowledge about the vaccine. Before any immunisation exercise is conducted, citizens must be given adequate information. Health workers must be equipped to answer questions that people may have. Readily available pre-packaged frequently asked questions pamphlets would be helpful. And the media must also be brought on board from the outset.

To combat false rumours governments and relevant authorities must articulate and disseminate appropriate counter messages. The message must provide answers to the fears that led to the rumours in the 1st place. And they should be disseminated through the same channels used by those spreading the rumours.

Government must also promptly and appropriately respond to the concerns of high profile individuals such as politicians, and of the populations they represent.

And lastly, health interventions must be provided by the publicly recognised health agency of government - rather than agencies that could be questioned.

[Prof. Oyewale Tomori's comments re: the resurgence of anti-vaccination rumors in Nigeria are very worrisome. The impact of the vaccination boycott in Nigeria during the years 2003 to 2005 led to a major increase in polio transmission in Nigeria as well as spread of the WPV from Nigeria to 18 countries that had been polio-free for one or more years, including countries outside of Africa. (MMWR: Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication -- Nigeria, January 2004 -- July 2005. September 9, 2005 / 54(35);873-877. Available at: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5435a4.htm). It has only been 1.5 years since the last documented cases of WPV1 in northern Nigeria, and given that the WPV1 isolates involved in those cases was genetically related to an isolate from 5 years earlier, the possibility of low grade "silent" transmission of the WPV1 in the areas with civil unrest (parts of Borno state) still exists.
