Kazakhstan: HIV outbreak in Kazakh children and their mothers
-----------------------------------------------
New cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have been recorded in
southern Kazakhstan. The number of HIV-infected children in the
Southern Kazakhstan region has risen to 91 [up from 72 in early
October 2006 - Mod.CP]. The children are former patients of local
hospitals, in the age range one to 5 years old. Eight of them have
already died. Thirteen of their mothers who were also treated in
local hospitals have also become infected [up from 7 in October 2006
- Mod.CP].
It is presumed that this extensive transmission of HIV infection was
a consequence of transfusion of contaminated blood. An alternative
explanation is that disposable instruments and syringes were reused
by medical staff without adequate sterilization. The most recent 2
cases of HIV infection of children were detected literally days after
screening of adults who had been in contact with infected patients.
Currently, the entire population of the district (oblast) is being
screened to detect cases of HIV infection. In the regional centre,
the city of Shymkent, since the middle of January [2007], a legal
process has been underway to investigate the possible criminal
negligence of medical staff. In total, 21 employees of local medical
establishments are being prosecuted.

[It is to be hoped that the legal process underway in Shymkent will
establish the source of this distressing incident and the precise
mode of transmission of HIV and that adequate compensation will be
forthcoming.
