SARS Situation update
As of 2 Apr 2003, there were 3 additional SARS cases reported, bringing the
total to 98.
2 of these new cases were reported in hospital staff who are linked back to
the first index case. To date, 91 cases have arisen from the first index
case, comprising 45 family members, friends, or close contacts, and 46
hospital staff. Among these are 3 children below 18 years of age.
A 7th imported case was reported today. She is a 42-year-old Indonesian
woman, the mother of the 5th imported case (17-year-old Indonesian
student). She left Singapore for Hong Kong and Guangdong on 15 Mar 2003 and
returned to Singapore on 23 Mar 2003. She became unwell on 24 Mar 2003 and
was admitted to TTSH as a suspect SARS case on 25 Mar 2003.
So far, apart from the first imported case, the 6 other imported cases have
not given rise to any SARS cases.
The total number of people who have recovered from SARS and have been
discharged from hospital is 57. The remaining 37 patients are hospitalised,
out of which 11 are in serious condition (including the fourth imported
case).
The number of suspect cases is 47, including 2 children (below 18 years
old) and the 20-year-old student from Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
Discharge and follow-up of SARS patients
-------------------------------------
SARS patients are discharged from TTSH and followed up in accordance with
the guidelines from the World Health Organisation (WHO). Upon discharge,
SARS patients are given medical leave for 2 weeks and are required to stay
at home. They are reviewed by the doctors at TTSH before they return to
work or school. During their 2 weeks' medical leave at home, their
condition is monitored by staff from TTSH through daily phone calls.
Update on Children with SARS
----------------------------
One of the children with SARS is the 4-year-old boy from Pat's Schoolhouse
whose condition remains stable. None of the children in the Schoolhouse
have developed SARS as of today, 12 days later.
Another is the 17-year-old brother of the above boy, who did not attend
school during the school holidays. He has since been discharged, together
with his 13-year-old sister from Pei Cai Secondary School, who was a
suspect SARS case.
The third child with SARS is the 17-year-old Indonesian boy from Bowen
Secondary School. His condition is stable.

[A] Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases: 1 Apr 2003
[2 Apr 2003 accessed 6:00 PM EST]
Latest Case Counts
-----------------
Since yesterday, 5 additional probable cases of SARS and 2 deaths have been
reported in Canada. A total of 58 individuals who meet the probable case
definition of SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia,
including 6 deaths; 93 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect
case of SARS have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
Since SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may
change over time. At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is
estimated at approximately 4.0 percent of probable or suspect cases (N=151),
which is similar to that reported by other countries, depending on the
criteria used to define a SARS case.
Table 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 1 Apr 2003
Province/Territory: Probable Case(1)/ Suspect Case(1)/ Deaths(2)
British Columbia: 2/ 12/ 0
Alberta: 0/ 7/ 0
Saskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0
Ontario: 56/ 68/ 6
New Brunswick: 0/ 1/ 0
Prince Edward Island: 0/ 4/ 0
Total: 58/ 93/ 6
(1) These persons may drop off the probable or suspect case list if another
cause is identified for their illness
(2) This figure is included in the number of probable cases
Summary of Disease Transmission to Date
----------------------------------
The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has reported a total of
56 probable cases of SARS. It is believed that 4 generations of
transmission have occurred. The index case in Ontario was an individual who
travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a cluster
of SARS cases has since been reported. Upon return to Canada, disease
transmission occurred in 4 members of the immediate and extended family. A
physician who had close contact with members of this family was also
diagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases were reported in individuals in
a hospital setting where some of the first cases were treated. Most
recently, SARS has been reported in a few of the household contacts of
these hospital-associated cases. To date, transmission of disease has
occurred in household and hospital settings. There is no evidence of
transmission in the general community. An isolated case in Ontario was
reported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did not stay in at
the Metropole Hotel.
Reports of the 2 probable cases from British Columbia have been linked to
travel-related exposure. The first identified probable case of SARS in
British Columbia stayed at the Metropole Hotel, and the second individual
was exposed to a SARS case in Hong Kong. Both individuals are currently in
isolation and there is no evidence of further spread in British Columbia.
All of the 12 suspected cases currently under investigation in BC are also
associated with travel-related exposures. A Canadian with SARS [not counted
in the official Canadian case count], who is currently hospitalised in Hong
Kong, also stayed at the Metropole Hotel.
Preliminary Descriptive Findings
-----------------------------
Given the information currently available, the average age of probable
cases in Canada is 46.2 years (n=45, range 2 to 82 years), with 31 females
and 20 males. The current number of probable cases by reported symptom
onset date and type of exposure is also provided (Figure 1 - Number of
probable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date and exposure type
from: 23 Feb 23 to 1 Apr 2003 (n=45, excluding 13 for whom onset dates or
exposure classification are unknown))

Table 2: Known current status of probable cases in Canada: 1 Apr 2003
(n=23, excluding 35 individuals whose status is either unknown or missing)
Status: Number of Cases/ Proportion
Improving: 5/ 21.7 percent
Stable: 15/ 65.2 percent
Deteriorating: 2/ 8.7 percent
Critical: 1/ 4.4 percent
Total no. of probable cases with known status, currently hospitalised:
23/100 percent
Preliminary Epidemiologic Findings
------------------------------
Transmission: Based on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly
all of the probable cases of SARS in Ontario that occurred in individuals
outside of the initial family cluster have been linked either directly or
indirectly back to exposure to the first hospitalised case of SARS, on 7
Mar 2003. It is believed that disease transmission occurred mainly as a
result of person-to-person contact. The initial hospital-associated cases
are thought to have contracted the illness as a result of unprotected
contact with the initial cases prior to the recognition of SARS. Subsequent
transmission may have then occurred between households of these
hospital-associated cases, and between other healthcare workers. To date,
there has been no evidence of transmission in the general community.
Furthermore, there is presently no evidence to suggest that disease
transmission occurs prior to the onset of fever in a suspected or probable
case of SARS.
Estimated incubation period: While it is difficult to conclusively
determine the incubation period of the etiologic agent, given the fact that
many of the probable cases in Ontario may have multiple exposures, the
current estimated mean incubation period is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10
days).
Clinical Manifestations: The main signs and symptoms seen in cases of SARS
include fever (greater than 38.0 degrees Celsius), cough and shortness of
breath. Symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may not be
present. A few cases have developed increasing respiratory distress and
require mechanical ventilation. In the majority of hospitalised cases, an
infiltrate on chest x-ray and lymphopenia is evident. In addition,
thrombocytopenia (less than 150 000 / cubic mm), elevated creatinine kinase
and elevated ALT/AST may be observed. The WHO is coordinating global
efforts to better characterize the clinical manifestations of SARS. Because
awareness and surveillance of the disease have increased worldwide, an
increase in the number of suspected cases is to be expected.
Severity of Illness: Of all of the probable cases reported to date, most
remain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 3 are now in intensive
care. All 6 deaths have been associated with individuals with underlying
illness and all but one occurred in elderly patients. Of 32 probable cases
for whom hospitalisation status is known, 3 are currently in intensive
care. In addition, 2 of the 3 cases that required intubation have since
died.
Public Health Measures
---------------------
Ontario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable
diseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province
has introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the
spread of SARS. Key public health measures include: extensive contact
tracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation
of suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for
asymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals
and health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact
precautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS
and have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and
their patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.
Health Canada is supporting Ontario in its SARS response efforts by
providing epidemiologic and infection control expertise, as well as
emergency supplies as needed. Health Canada, in collaboration with the
Provinces and Territories, has implemented enhanced surveillance for the
detection of SARS cases, alerted laboratories, and initiated special
laboratory investigations in an effort to identify the cause of SARS. In
addition, Health Canada has initiated the first phase of implementing
screening procedures for all domestic and international travellers
departing from Toronto, in response to the WHO recommendations to prevent
travel-related spread of SARS. In addition, due to recent concerns
regarding the possibility of transmission of SARS aboard aircraft, Health
Canada has also recommended the follow-up of all passengers on flights
where a suspect or probable SARS case is identified. For regular updates on
public health actions taken by Health Canada, please see the most recent
update:

[A] China, Guangdong/Beijing from Ming Pao newspaper, Hong Kong [in Chinese,
trans. by JS]
<http://www.mpinews.com/newsletter.cfm?newsid=200304021057ca31057y>
Guangdong Province Health authority announced that in March [2003] it had
361 atypical pneumonia cases and 9 deaths. Total deaths to date in
mainland(?) increased to 43. From 1-31 Mar 2003, the province has had 361
atypical pneumonia cases, representing a drop of 47.5 percent compared with
February 2003. At the beginning of March 2003 there were 145 cases, in the
middle of the month 128, and by the last 10 days of the month 88. The trend
is clearly down. The spread of the ilness appears to be under control,
especially among health workers.
For this month [March?], patients that left the hospital were 507, an
increase of 133 over the previous month [February?]; 9 deaths, 18 fewer
than last month. The provincial government earlier indicated that the
entire province has had 31 deaths due to atypical pneumonia.
On a separate note, Beijing has had 3 deaths from atypical pneumonia.

[similar report from China Daily 3 Apr 2003
<http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/news/2003-04-03/110553.html>]
9 people died of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province last month,
Guangdong Provincial Bureau of Public Health revealed Wednesday. There
were 18 fewer deaths from the mystery illness last month, compared to
February's toll of 27 deaths, a bureau official, who declined to be named,
said. A total of 361 people were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia in the
southern Chinese province between 1-31 Mar 2003, down 47.5 percent from
February's total.
Some 145 cases of atypical pneumonia were detected from 1-10 Mar 2003, 128
were discovered from 11-20 Mar 2003, while the remaining 88 cases were
diagnosed in the last 11 days of last month. Most of March's cases were
reported in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, the official said.
The gradual fall in the number of new infections indicated that the fatal
disease was basically under control in Guangdong Province, the official
said. No doctors, nurses, or medical staff were diagnosed with atypical
pneumonia in March, the official said, and the peak period of infection,
mid-February 2003, was believed to have passed. The official urged local
residents and tourists in the province not to panic.
Meanwhile, a total of 507 atypical pneumonia patients recovered and were
discharged from hospital in March 2003 -- 133 more than in February 2003,
the official said. By the end of March [2003], Guangdong had detected a
total of 1153 atypical pneumonia patients since its first case was reported
in Foshan on 16 Nov 2002. So far, 40 people have died of the disease in
the province.
About 80 percent of Guangdong's atypical pneumonia patients have now
recovered and been discharged from hospitals thanks to effective medical
treatment, the official said. The atypical pneumonia outbreak struck 7
cities -- Guangzhou, Heyuan, Shenzhen, Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhaoqing, and
Jiangmen -- in the Pearl River Delta.

[B] China, Shanghai from the Statesman / Xinhua
<http://www.thestatesman.net/page.news.php?clid=8&theme=&usrsess
=1&id=10180>
Shanghai today reported its first SARS case. "A woman suspected of being
infected has been hospitalised and isolated for treatment in the city of
Shanghai," the official Xinhua news agency reported. The patient travelled
to south China on a business trip in late March [2003]. Shortly after her
return to Shanghai she fell ill with SARS symptoms. The Shanghai municipal
committee of the communist party of China and government gave assurances
that they would keep the public well informed of the matter, the report
said.
[C] Thailand from the Strait Times
<http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/topstories/story/0,4386,180850,00.html>
Thailand yesterday ordered all foreigners from SARS-affected countries to
wear masks at all times or face a fine of 10 000 baht (US $417) or up to 6
months in jail. Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan told a news
conference that visitors from Singapore, mainland China, Hongkong, Taiwan,
and Vietnam would be screened on arrival, and anyone with SARS symptoms
would be deported immediately.
"Those without symptoms who are allowed to enter must wear masks at all
times," she added.
Thai residents returning from Singapore, Vietnam, Hongkong, mainland China,
and Taiwan must stay at home for 14 days, cannot go to school or work, and
must avoid close contact with friends and relatives.

[As of the time of finalizing this posting, the new data available on the
Health Canada and CDC USA websites were for probable and suspected cases
reported to the respective agencies as of 1 Apr 2003. It should be noted
that the data for Health Canada disaggregates cases by suspected and
probable, whereas the USA data combines all suspected and probable
cases. Hence, there are challenges in attempting to draw comparisons
between these data and those of countries where only probable cases are
being reported.
Suspected cases are important in public health investigation to ensure
appropriate infection control measures are implemented, and for contact
tracing and evaluation. But, as they are considered suspected cases, it is
possible that as further information becomes available, they will be shown
to be due to etiologies other than the yet-to-be-determined agent(s)
responsible for SARS.
Again, with the exception of Hong Kong SAR and Guangdong, China, all cases
to date are traceable to known contact with other cases of SARS. One should
question here whether the case definition used in some areas precludes the
identification of cases without known contact with a SARS case. The CDC
criteria include: "Travel within 10 days of onset of symptoms to an area
with documented or suspected community transmission of SARS (see list
below; excludes areas with secondary cases limited to healthcare workers or
direct household contacts) or, Close contact* within 10 days of onset of
symptoms with either a person with a respiratory illness who traveled to a
SARS area or a person known to be a suspect SARS case.
* Close contact is defined as having cared for, having lived with, or
having direct contact with respiratory secretions and/or body fluids of a
patient known to be suspect SARS case. Areas with documented or suspected
community transmission of SARS: Peoples' Republic of China (i.e., mainland
China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region); Hanoi, Vietnam; and
Singapore".
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>
We await further information on the epidemiologic studies of SARS in Hong
Kong and Guangdong, China.
The information on the Canadian cases now includes daily descriptive
epidemiology, providing the age distribution of cases as well as further
classification by severity of illness. According to these data, the
fatalities have been associated with increased age and presence of
pre-existing health conditions.
We have included several newswire reports in this update to highlight an
increase in the amount of information now coming out of China, with
preliminary epidemiologic information on disease trends in Guangdong and the
report of 3 fatal cases in Beijing & a first possible case in Shanghai.
Hopefully this reporting will continue on a real-time basis so that there
will be daily updates on the situation in China.
The newswire report on the infection control measures taken by Thailand was
included to demonstrate the level of concern and the various degrees of
infection control measures being undertaken at national levels. This brings
back memories of initial reactions during the early increases in HIV/AIDS
before much information on transmission routes and the etiologic agent were
known. However, it is very hard to be overly critical in the face of an
outbreak of "unknown" etiology with respiratory spread. - Mod.MPP]
