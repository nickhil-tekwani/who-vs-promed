In 2013, an influenza virus that had never before been detected began circulating among poultry in China. It caused several waves of human infection, and in late 2016, the number of people to become sick from the H7N9 virus suddenly started to rise. As of late July 2017, nearly 1600 people had tested positive for avian H7N9. Nearly 40 percent of those infected had died.

In early 2017, Yoshihiro Kawaoka, professor of pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, received a sample of H7N9 virus isolated from a patient in China who had died of the flu. He and his research team subsequently began work to characterize and understand it. The 1st of those results are published today (19 Oct 2017) in Cell Host & Microbe.

For the 1st time, Kawaoka says, his team has identified an influenza virus strain that is both transmissible between ferrets (the best animal model proxy for human influenza infections) and lethal, both in the animal originally infected and in otherwise healthy ferrets in close contact with these infected animals.

"This is the 1st case of a highly pathogenic avian virus that transmits between ferrets and kills them," Kawaoka says. "That's not good for public health."

Everyone in the influenza field knew it was only a matter of time before the virus became pathogenic in chickens, which is to say that it became capable of causing disease, but Kawaoka says it took several years. It was initially hard to detect because, unlike some other influenza viruses such as H5N2 -- which is highly lethal in chickens and caused significant outbreaks on poultry farms across the U.S. and elsewhere in 2015 -- H7N9 was not killing the chickens it infected.

Instead, it remained silent, passing unknown from chicken to chicken and, occasionally, infecting humans that came into contact with the birds.

Influenza viruses are well known for their propensity to adapt. With each new infection of a host, small changes take place within the genomes of influenza viruses. Sometimes these mutations occur in key regions and lead to significant alterations to the original virus, rendering it capable of infecting new hosts, making hosts sick, causing greater illness, and becoming resistant to the drugs typically used to treat them.

Kawaoka and his team observed this within the sample isolated from the deceased patient, who while alive had been treated with the common flu drug Tamiflu. Using a technique to read the genetic identity of the virus population that had infected the patient, Kawaoka's team learned the virus had started to mutate: The sample contained a population of H7N9 virus that was sensitive to Tamiflu and a population that was resistant.

So the team created 2 viruses virtually identical to those isolated from the patient, one sensitive to Tamiflu and the other bearing the mutation that conferred resistance to the drug. Comparing this to a low-pathogenic version of the H7N9 virus that Kawaoka and others had previously studied, the research team assessed how well each virus grows in human respiratory cells, where most influenza viruses take up residence in the body. They found that each grew efficiently, though the resistant strain was less effective than the other 2.

The team also found that each virus infects and causes illness, to varying degrees, in several animal models for influenza, mice, ferrets and macaques.

To test whether the virus was transmissible between mammals, the researchers set up experiments in which ferrets were housed alone in individual cages separated by a barrier that allowed respiratory droplets to pass from one cage to the next. In each pair, one ferret was deliberately infected with the virus while the other was placed into the cage healthy.

Each of the 3 virus types were transmitted from infected ferrets to the previously uninfected animals. Two of 3 ferrets infected with the nonresistant strain of H7N9 -- the strain currently circulating in China -- died, as did the animals to which they passed the virus.

"Without additional mutations, the virus transmitted and killed ferrets," says Kawaoka, noting that further alterations to the virus may not be necessary to make it a potential public health threat, though human-to-human transmission has thus far remained limited.

The team also confirmed the drug-resistant H7N9 did not respond to oseltamivir, the active agent in Tamiflu. It did respond to another drug called a protease inhibitor, but Kawaoka says it is a drug currently approved only in Japan and only for use in pandemic situations.

"I don't want to cause alarm," Kawaoka says, but "it's only a matter of time before the resistant virus acquires a mutation that allows it to grow well, (rendering it) more likely to be lethal at the same time it is resistant."

However, Kawaoka and his team are currently unable to better understand what mutations may enable this transition, at least in the United States, where a moratorium on work that might cause a pathogen to take on a new function not currently known in nature has been in place for several years.

"We can't do the experiments to find out why," Kawaoka says. "We really need to understand why H7N9 is lethal and transmissible, and what is different in this one resistant H7N9. If we knew that, because there are multiple viruses circulating, we could narrow down efforts to those that are lethal and transmissible."

He recently published a commentary in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, co-authored with 2 colleagues who are also experts in influenza, in which they explain the challenges this moratorium creates for understanding the potential of viruses like H7N9 to become pandemic.

"Results from (gain-of-function) studies would almost certainly help in understanding the pandemic potential of influenza viruses and produce public health benefits, such as the prioritization and development of pre-pandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs," the authors write. "Fundamental (gain-of-function) research on transmissibility, host-range restriction, drug resistance, immunogenicity, pathogenicity, and replicative ability would also benefit global public health."

The H7N9 virus is likely to continue to mutate as it infects humans, resulting in adaptations that enhance the viruses' pathogenicity or ability to pass from person to person, Kawaoka adds. In other words, nature is already performing its own gain-of-function experiments, with potentially serious consequences.

It has, however, become a bit easier recently to detect when poultry are infected with H7N9, thereby allowing people to limit their exposure. That's because the virus has begun to kill birds in China, too. But unlike in the U.S., where farmers cull their flocks to limit the spread of infectious disease, China relies on vaccines. This worries Kawaoka, given how well the virus has been shown to grow.

For now, he says: "We should improve our surveillance."

Lab experiments on a new strain of the H7N9 bird flu suggest the virus can pass easily among animals and can cause lethal disease, raising alarms that it has the potential to create a global human pandemic.

The H7N9 virus has been circulating in China since 2013, causing severe disease in people exposed to infected poultry. Last year [2016], human cases spiked, and the virus split into 2 distinct strains that are so different they no longer can be treated with existing vaccines.

One of these has also become highly pathogenic, meaning it has gained the ability to kill birds, posing a threat to agriculture markets.

U.S. and Japanese researchers studied a sample of this strain to see how well it spread among mammals, including ferrets, which are considered the best animal model for testing the transmissibility of influenza in humans.

In the study, published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, flu expert Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin and colleagues tested a version of the new H7N9 strain that was taken from a person who died from the infection last spring.

They found that the virus replicated efficiently in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates. It also caused even more severe disease in mice and ferrets than a low pathogenic version of the virus that does not cause illness in birds.

To test transmissibility, the team placed healthy ferrets next to infected animals. The virus spread easily from cage to cage, suggesting that it can be transmitted by respiratory droplets such as those produced by coughing and sneezing. Two out of 3 healthy ferrets infected in this way died, which Kawaoka said is "extremely unusual" and suggests that even a small amount of virus can cause severe disease.

"The work is very concerning in terms of the implications for what H7N9 might do in the days ahead in terms of human infection," said Michael Osterholm, an expert on infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota. Since 2013, the H7N9 bird flu virus has sickened at least 1562 people in China and killed at least 612. Some 40 percent of people hospitalized with the virus die.

In the 1st 4 epidemics, the virus showed few changes. But in the last flu season, there were 764 cases, double the previous level. "The whole world is worried about it," Osterholm said.

A new risk assessment tool from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ranks H7N9 as the leading animal flu strain with the potential of causing a human pandemic. The most recent global pandemic was the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak, which infected millions and killed more than 200 000 globally.

Some researchers are concerned that the highly pathogenic strain could cause even more severe disease and higher death rates, but mortality from the low pathogenic strain is already "alarmingly high," said Dr. Timothy Uyeki, a CDC flu expert.

Existing H7N9 vaccines are based on the 2013 strain. The CDC has developed a new vaccine based on the low pathogenic strain of the mutated virus, Uyeki said. The low pathogenic strain accounted for most of the human infections last year [2016]. Uyeki believes the vaccine would likely also offer protection from the new highly pathogenic H7N9 strain, but it needs to be tested in people.

In February 2017, China gave the go ahead for clinical trials of H7N9 vaccines developed by state-owned Beijing Tiantan Biological. The company said in a filing that it was developing 4 vaccines against the H7N9 virus.

[The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the current 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 Oct 2016) has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors remain crucial.

Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in China and bordering countries would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore, the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low [http://www.who.int/csr/don/13-september-2017-ah7n9-china/en/].

The above study data on pathogenic and pandemic potential of this still essentially avian influenza virus is indeed a matter of concern, which merits strengthened surveillance in both animal and human health for early detection of evolutionary changes in the virus, particularly any evidence of more efficient human to human transmission. - Mod.UBA
