A 7 year old boy in Hong Kong has been infected with H9 bird flu, adding to the health woes in a city already fearing a wider outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. The boy was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward. The Centre for Health Protection on Friday [7 Feb 2020] confirmed that the boy's nasal swab tested positive for the strain of avian flu, with the subtype still to be determined. The boy had recently returned to the city from mainland China.

The centre said the boy had underlying illnesses and developed a cough and runny nose on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020], which turned to a fever on Wednesday [5 Feb 2020]. He went for treatment at the outpatient ward at the Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club Clinic and was transferred to an isolation ward at Kwong Wah Hospital in Yau Ma Tei for further medical care. He was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital's isolation ward on Thursday [6 Feb 2020], where his condition was stable.

According to the centre's preliminary investigations, the patient had visited his grandparents' home in Shenzhen at the incubation stage of his viral infection. Although the family kept poultry in their house, the boy had not come into direct contact with the birds. His family members have not reported any symptoms.

A Department of Health spokesperson said investigations were underway and the relevant medical staff at the clinic, ambulance and hospitals, as well as any possibly affected patients, had been placed under medical observation.

H9 is a seasonal influenza that is required by law to be reported to the city's health authorities. Hong Kong has in total recorded 8 H9N2 infections, the most recent an imported case in 2013. The virus is a relatively mild type of avian flu, and no local deaths have been recorded.

Hong Kong is also battling a strain of coronavirus that originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei province. The flulike virus -- contracted by 31 500 people worldwide, mostly in the province -- has infected 26 people in the city, killing one.

Dr Joseph Tsang Kay-yan, a private specialist in infectious disease, said he believed the boy was an isolated case. "If we see similar cases or many local birds dying of unknown causes, then that would warrant further concern," Tsang said.

Hong Kong health officials reported an imported case of influenza A (H9) infection today [7 Feb 2020].

The patient, a 7 year old boy with underlying illnesses, developed a cough and runny nose on 4 Feb 2020 and fever on the next day. On 5 Feb 2020, he was brought to Wang Tau Hom Jockey Club General Outpatient Clinic (GOPC) for medical advice and was transferred to Kwong Wah Hospital (KWH), where he was admitted to the isolation ward for further management. He was transferred to the general ward of KWH yesterday [6 Feb 2020] and then was transferred to the isolation ward of Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment today [7 Feb 2020]. He has been in stable condition.

His nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for the influenza A (H9) virus upon testing. Subtyping result is pending. His clinical diagnosis was avian influenza.

Preliminary investigation by the CHP [Centre for Health Protection] revealed that the patient visited his maternal grandparents' home in Shenzhen during the incubation period, where backyard poultry was kept. However, the patient had no direct poultry contact recently, nor consumption of undercooked poultry or contact with patients. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far.

Novel influenza A infection, including influenza A(H9), is a notifiable infectious disease in Hong Kong. Eight cases of influenza A (H9N2) have been reported in the past, including 2 local cases in 1999, one local case each in 2003 and 2007, an imported case in 2008, an imported case and one with the source of infection unclassified in 2009, and one imported case in 2013. No deaths have been recorded so far. Influenza A (H9N2) infection is a mild form of avian influenza.

[As mentioned in the above report, A/H9 influenza is essentially an avian virus and not seasonal or human.

There are 9 known subtypes of H9 viruses (H9N1, H9N2, H9N3, H9N4, H9N5, H9N6, H9N7, H9N8, and H9N9); all H9 viruses identified worldwide in wild birds and poultry are LPAI viruses. H9N2 virus has been detected in bird populations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Rare, sporadic H9N2 virus infections in people have been reported to generally cause mild upper respiratory tract illness; one infection has resulted in death (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm).

It is critical that influenza viruses from animals and people are fully characterized in appropriate animal or human health influenza reference laboratories.

WHO guidelines, entitled "Protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases", are available at https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275657/WHO-WHE-IHM-GIP-2018.2-eng.pdf.

Under WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework, member states are expected to share their influenza viruses with pandemic potential on a regular and timely basis with the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a WHO-coordinated network of public health laboratories. The viruses are used by the public health laboratories to assess the risk of pandemic influenza and to develop candidate vaccine viruses. - Mod.UBA
