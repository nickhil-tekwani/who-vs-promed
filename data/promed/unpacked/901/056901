According to the Russian media sources, African swine fever (ASF) has
broken up in the province of Heilongjiang, in north east China. In
particular, pig holdings in the cities of Hulin, Mishan, and Tsidun in the
region of Primorje (Russian Primorsky Krai), bordering Russia, have been
affected.

The sources are reporting an increase in surveillance activities by the
Russian authorities in the border region. It is feared that the virus may
spread to Russia, infecting wild swine and poorly maintained pig farms.

The population has been encouraged to refrain from buying Chinese pig meat.
An official confirmation [from China] is pending.

[ASF has been recorded, during 2007, in several ex-Soviet Union countries:
Georgia, Armenia, Abkhazia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. Rumors about its possible
presence in China were officially refuted (see ProMED-mail 20060924.2732).

Confirmation of the Russian-sourced rumors, or -- it is to be hoped --
their official denial, is anticipated. The province of Heilongjiang can be
located on the map of China at
