_E. coli_ outbreak linked to baby spinach
-----------------------------------------
Fast facts
Illnesses: 14 (4 new)
Hospitalizations: 4 (2 new)
Deaths: 0
States: 9 (2 new)
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that Josie's Organics prepackaged baby spinach with a "best by" date of 23 Oct 2021, may be contaminated with _E. coli_ and may be making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
Since the last update on 15 Nov 2021, 4 more illnesses have been reported. As of 3 Dec 2021, a total of 14 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 9 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2021/o157h7-11-21/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 13-27 Oct 2021 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2021/o157h7-11-21/epi.html).

Location / Number of sick people
--------------------------------
Indiana / 4
Iowa / 1
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 2
Missouri / 1
Nebraska / 1
Ohio / 1
Pennsylvania / 1
South Dakota / 2

Sick people range in age from 2 to 76 years, with a median age of 26, and 79% are female. Of 12 people with information available, 4 have been hospitalized and 3 developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _E. coli_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 12 people interviewed, 10 (83%) reported eating spinach in the week before they got sick. This percentage was significantly higher than the 46% of respondents who reported eating spinach in the previous week in the FoodNet Population Survey, a survey that helps estimate how often people eat various foods. This difference suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating spinach. 6 people reported eating Josie's Organics brand spinach.

Laboratory data
-------------------
On 15 Nov 2021, CDC reported that officials in Minnesota found _E. coli_ O157:H7 in a package of leftover Josie's Organics baby spinach collected from a sick person's home. Whole genome sequencing (DNA fingerprinting for bacteria) showed that the _E. coli_ O157:H7 in the leftover package of spinach is closely related to bacteria isolated from ill people. This means that the person likely got sick from eating the spinach.

Public health actions
---------------------
CDC is advising people not to eat, sell or serve Josie's Organics prepackaged baby spinach with "best by" date of 23 Oct 2021.

[Several more cases have been added to the number infected and the isolate for EHEC from a sick person's home was genetically related to the outbreak strain so a "smoking gun" has been established. Produce such as spinach, often eaten without cooking, can be contaminated with enteric pathogens anywhere along the chain from the field to the table. Often, it is related to irrigation with contaminated water. - Mod.LL
