WHO has informed us that there was a misprint in last week's WER. The date
of notification of the imported case was 10 Nov 1998.
PAHO reports today (Tue 24 Nov 1998) that on Fri. 20 Nov 1998 the El
Salvador Ministry of Public Health reported 6 cases of cholera (one death).
_V. cholerae_ 01 El Tor Ogawa was isolated from one case.
4 of the cases were imported from Jutiapa, Guatemala, and the other 2 from
frontier zones with Guatemala (Metapan, Santa Ana & San Alejo, La Union).
15 suspect cases have been hospitalized in Santa Ana. An information,
health education and control plan is in operation along the frontier.
