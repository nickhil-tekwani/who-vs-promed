After peafowl in Thar, mystery disease strikes camels in Dadu
-------------------------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease has claimed lives of around 100 camels in the
Johi area of Kasho, Dadu district within 15 days, severely affecting
the day-to-day routine of the people highly-dependant on the beasts of
burden.

In January [2011] an outbreak of a mysterious disease had reportedly
killed around 200 peafowl in the Thar Desert, raising fears that the
disease might completely wipe out the already endangered bird. It was
reported that about 8 to 10 birds were dying every day in the areas of
Kehri and Islamkot union councils, Tharparkar district [Since this
avian-health related event escaped ProMED-mail's attention at the
time, the relevant newswire of January 2011 is presented in item 2
below. - Mod.AS]

Meanwhile, the population of Kasho, a hilly area in the Dadu
district, depends on camels for travelling, milk, and meat among other
purposes, and is genuinely upset over the emerging situation with loss
of their animals, said to be worth over Rs 0.2 million [about USD
2400].

"A team of veterinary doctors has collected some body parts of dead
camels and taken them away for laboratory testing but there has been
no respite in camel casualties in the area," said a local journalist,
Asif Jamali, while talking with Pakistan Today on Thursday [7 Apr
2011].

Livestock owners in the area say that on an estimate, the cattle
farmers -- who are already poor and also affected by floods -- have
suffered losses of around Rs 20 million [about USD 240 000] so far due
to the death of camels, he added.

The camel owners of the area have also lodged a protest against the
authorities concerned for not reaching out to the poor people and save
their costly animals while camel carcasses are lying along the
roadsides and agricultural lands.

When the locals approached some veterinary doctors, they responded
that they had seen such disease for the 1st time and have no idea on
what medicines should be given to save the camels.

Dadu Livestock District Officer Habibullah Jamali confirmed the
deadly disease outbreak in camels. 4 years ago, another similar
disease was noticed in the Koshitan area of Sehwan and 3 months ago
[January 2011] in the Thar district but it has emerged in Kasho for
the 1st time, he added.

"We initially thought the disease was some routine infection in
camels but we have sent body parts from dead animals to a laboratory
in Tando Jam and are awaiting their report," said Jamali, adding that
400 camels have been given doses of antibiotics.

Reportedly, the camels first show symptoms of flu and cough and then
die within 3 days. The animals have been badly hit by the mysterious
disease in around 30 villages including Kher Shah, Rajo Dero, Thor,
Laudo Dero, Nag Jo Koh, Sobho, Doltani, Bhakhshi jo Koh, Wahi Pandhi,
and Rajo Ghando. It has to be noted that the Kasho area of Sindh
including Johi are the breeding grounds of camels.

[Pakistan's (dromedary) camel population (2009 figures) is 930 000. A
significant part of them are situated in the arid Thar desert, which
is divided between Pakistan (southeast) and western India (see map at
http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_4m8Rz_zZlVQ/Sb3d-EDZTXI/AAAAAAAABwk/H8oLGg7H6ng/s400/the-indus-river0.gif).

In view of the respiratory signs, previous disease cases in Pakistani
(dromedary) camels, in early 2011, were suspected to be hemorrhagic
septicaemia, but PPR (peste des petits ruminants) was said to deserve
consideration as well. Definite final diagnosis has not become
available. This is still the case; accurate and detailed
epidemiological information from reliable, professional sources on the
allegedly affected camels in the location described, including
laboratory results if available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Rare and mysterious disease kills endangered peacocks
-----------------------------------------------------
Peacocks of a rare species [but see comment] are dying everyday
because of a mysterious disease in the Tharparkar district of Sindh.
So far 200 birds have perished at an alarming rate of 8-10 birds a day
in the areas of Kheri and Islamkot union councils of the above
mentioned district, sources claimed.

The disease first attacks the throat of the bird and later it
develops into a lump that grows larger day by day until it bursts and
a worm wriggles out of the throat and then the bird turns blind and
dies.

So far no survey had been carried out to determine the population of
these rare and endangered birds, which are famous for their beautiful
and kaleidoscopic tail and their dance during the mating season.

The bird, called the Indian peafowl is only found in India and Thar
desert, is one of its kind and because of the life threatening disease
the species might be wiped out if prompt action is not taken by the
authorities. The number of this fascinating birds had fallen earlier
as well when there was a drought and the rainfall patterns had
changed. Besides, when electric poles were installed these birds died
of electric shocks as they landed on electric wires, which caused the
wires to hang downwards and contract other wires causing electrocution
and instant death of the peacocks.

According to villagers no wildlife officials have visited the areas
where this rare breed of peacocks has perished. [But see comment at
end].

The authorities must act promptly and the disease they are suffering
should be diagnosed and treated immediately before it is too late and
we lose our nations' treasure.

The etiology of the peafowl disease described is not (yet) known; any
available information will be appreciated. This condition may
exacerbate an already established problem, namely a sharp decrease in
the numbers of the Indian peafowl (_Pavo cristatus_) due to illegal
trade for train-feathers and mortality due to indiscriminate
application of pesticides and herbicides in crop-fields (1).

In the past, avian influenzas have been reported to affect peafowl in
Pakistan (see ProMED-mail 20080623.1940). Reference

[The symptoms match gapeworm infection. Gapeworms, _Syngamus
trachea_, are worms that localize in the trachea (windpipe) of birds.
Heavy infections cause respiratory distress in young birds with their
small trachea being mechanically blocked which plugs the passage of
air. Infective _Syngamus_ eggs apparently overwinter in
worm-contaminated pens. It is also thought that earthworms are an
intermediate host of this parasite. Control is treatment of infected
birds with Thiabendazole or Tramisol.
http://www.peafowl.org/ARTICLES/2.

Indian Peafowl are widely distributed in the wild across South Asia
and protected both culturally in many areas and by law in India.
Conservative estimates of the population put them at more than 100
000. The peacock may be endangered in the wild in some places, but
there must be many thousands in zoos and private estates worldwide.
And how do you treat wild peafowl with Thiabendazole or Tramisol?
