Outbreak of _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT204b infection in Germany
--------------------------------------------------------------
Two weeks ago Eurosurveillance Weekly reported that outbreaks of
_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT204b infection had been occurring in the
United Kingdom, Iceland, Germany (1), and the Netherlands (2). Cases
began to appear in August and the outbreak appears to have come to an
end in mid September. Further details have now been received about
the German cases.
Fourteen similar multiresistant strains of _S. typhimurium_ with the same
pattern of resistance and plasmid profile as seen elsewhere in Europe
were reported by Germany. The cases, aged 8 to 42 years (mean 20),
became ill between 22 and 28 Aug 2000. Eleven of the 14 isolates
from Germany are associated with an outbreak at a takeaway food outlet
(belonging to an international chain) in a small town of Saxony, in
which 17 people (6 of whom were employees of the fast-food shop)
became ill. Epidemiological investigations have shown that all 17 cases
had eaten a particular dish (fried minced meat, salad, fried potatoes,
cheese), but no leftovers were available for examination. Environmental
inspection of the shop after the cases occurred identified no defects in
hygiene.
