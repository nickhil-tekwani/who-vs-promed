The State Department of Health (SESA) discarded on [Tue 5 May 2015] that a 31-year-old resident of Arapongas [Parana state], died a victim of hemorrhagic dengue. According to tests done by the State Central Laboratory (LACEN) the cause of death was yellow fever.

[The affected individual], brother of the Arapongas government secretary, traveled in late March [2015] to Mato Grosso do Sul on a fishing trip. The symptoms began on 23 Mar [2015] and he sought treatment while still in Mato Grosso do Sul. On return to Arapongas on 27 Mar [2015], he was hospitalized and died on 31 Mar [2015]. The initial diagnosis was leptospirosis and then it was changed to dengue hemorrhagic fever. LACEN dismissed these 2 suspected etiologies and confirmed yellow fever.

[Where in Mato Grosso do Sul had this individual traveled? If he went fishing initially, transmission may have been acquired in a sylvatic cycle. Was there an epidemiological investigation that has been able to identify the probable location of infection, if the cycle involved was, in fact, sylvan?

In theory, the patient arrived in Arapongas on the last day of the viremic period (which, as a rule, begins 1-2 days before the onset of symptoms and extends to 3-5 days). Were actions taken in order to block possible introduction and spread of yellow fever virus in Arapongas or in localities in Mato Grosso do Sul where his travel itinerary took him on the way to Arapongas? Let's watch this - Mod.RNA.

Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in forested areas in many parts of Brazil. There are 2 cycles of yellow fever virus transmission -- urban and sylvan (forest), which is why Mod.RNA asks specifically where the infection was acquired. The concern is that a person infected in the forest (sylvan cycle) could come to a locality where _Aedes aegypti_ vectors are abundant enough to feed on the viremic individual and initiate ongoing urban transmission. This is a real concern, and explains why Mod RNA asks if an epidemiological barrier was set up in Arapongas or if the patient's route of travel from Mato Grosso do Sul was identified. This mosquito vector is abundant enough across Brazil to transmit dengue and chikungunya viruses, and potentially YF virus, to many people annually. Fortunately, a large proportion of the population in Brazil is vaccinated against YF. However, no mention is made of the YF vaccination status of the population in Arapongas.
