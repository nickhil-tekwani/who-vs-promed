FDA investigation shows shrimp as probable source of _Salmonella_ outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A week after announcing an outbreak, the FDA has determined that cooked shrimp is the likely source of _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Weltevreden infections in patients in 2 states. The most recent person became sick in late April 2021, according to a 78-word outbreak notation on a weekly data table posted by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA reports that "it appears that the product lots linked to outbreak illnesses are past its shelf life and are no longer available for sale."

Investigators continue to review the outbreak, but no further details were provided in the FDA update. The agency did not name a producer, importer, supplier, or seller in the update and no product description such as brand name was provided. The patients in the _Salmonella_ Weltevreden outbreak are from Nevada and Arizona.

A week ago when the outbreak was revealed by the FDA, a spokesperson from the CDC said 6 people had been confirmed as outbreak patients. "If the information we collect indicates that there could be an ongoing risk to the public, we will issue a Food Safety Alert," the CDC spokesperson told Food Safety News. Neither the CDC nor the FDA has reported how long they have been aware of the illnesses.

[The FDA site implicated "cooked shrimp" as the suspected vehicle. This would suggest that the contamination occurred in the processing of the shrimp after cooking or that the cooking process was faulty. Shrimp are not usual carriers for _Salmonella_ but can more commonly carry _Vibrio_ species that can cause gastroenteritis.

Previously, recalls have be announced for shrimp due to contamination with _Salmonella_ but most of them were not associated with human infections. In 2016, however, the Maricopa AZ County Department of Public Health [Salmonellosis, st Javiana - USA: (AZ) susp. frozen shrimp 20161019.4570858] released a report on their investigation into a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Javiana outbreak that sickened at least 50 people in July and August 2016. There were 40 confirmed cases and 10 probable cases. A total of 33 (66%) of the cases reported eating at one restaurant. As many as 40 other restaurants or fast food establishments were reportedly patronized by patients. Up to 3 had more than 1 person reporting eating there within the week before illness onset with 2 cases each. Although all the human cases were serotype Javiana, the frozen unopened box of U10 shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Weltevreden and the 5 re-packaged shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Javiana. The 5 prepped/re-packaged shrimp all match the outbreak PFGE pattern of _S._ Javiana. - Mod.LL
