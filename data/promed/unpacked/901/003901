Mortality in pigs, reaching 90 percent, recorded in 2 of Armenia's
regions, is suspected to be associated with the introduction of
African swine fever (ASF). This was stated by the Deputy Chief State
Veterinary Inspectorate (AIT) of Armenia, Gevork Tovmasyan, in an
interview with Armenia News Agency "Novosti." According to him, the
data are preliminary; final information will be known within several days.
Tovmasyan explained that the delay was related to difficulties in the
sending of infected tissues of animals to England, but the issue has
now been solved. He added that results of laboratory investigation in
Georgia have been received today [24 Aug 2007].
According to the Rescue Service of Armenia, the pig mortality due to
African swine fever, has been observed during the last days in 4
villages: Vaagnadzor, Vaagn, Lambak, and Dcex, in the Loryisky region.
Preventive measures are being applied in the Tavushcky and Loryisky
regions of Armenia. Quarantine and disinfection stations have been
established in some places.
Earlier, Tovmasyan informed that Armenia has sent tissue samples to
Russia and Georgia for laboratory investigations, to determine the
livestock disease.
According to latest figures, more than 21 000 pigs have died in areas
bordering Georgia.

Difficulties in transmission of samples to IAH (Institute of Animal
Health) at Pirbright were probably related to airline security
considerations; fortunately, they seem to have been overcome. Similar
difficulties were allegedly involved in the transmission of samples
from Georgia during the early stages of the ASF outbreak there.
Confirmation from IAH on the arrival of the apparently sent samples,
and results of the laboratory investigation, are anticipated.
Similarly, results of the laboratory investigations in Georgia and
Russia will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
