PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007 (07)
******************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>

[Note: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail) in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to include
other prion-related diseases. These updates supersede the previous
update thread.

The definitions of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, can be found by accessing the Department of Health website
(<http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/index.htm>)
or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in the vCJD thread.

Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in
these updates where appropriate, and other forms of CJD (sporadic,
iatrogenic, familial, and GSS Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease)
are included also when they have some relevance to the incidence and
etiology of vCJD.

In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living
animals may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - as of 2 Nov 2007

[N.B. The Department of Health ceased issuing monthly CJD press
notices at the end of September 2007 because the same data are also
published by the National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh at
<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/figures.htm>.]

These following figures show the number of suspect cases of CJD
referred to the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh and the number of
deaths of definite and probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).

Definite and probable vCJD cases in the UK as of 2 Nov 2007
----------------------

Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
----------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 114
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 47
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 162

Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
----------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 4

Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 166

These data indicate that there have been no new cases diagnosed
during the past month, but one patient has died, raising the vCJD
death toll to 162.

These data are still consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak
in the UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year
2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in
2005, 5 in 2006, and so far 4 in 2007.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2007 so far
-----------------------------
As of 2 Nov 2007 in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have been
93 referrals, 38 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from iatrogenic
CJD, 2 deaths from familial CJD, one from GSS, and 4 deaths from vCJD.

*Acquired in UK
** Acquired in Saudi Arabia
*** Includes 17 inconclusive and 9 pending (1 from 2006, 8 from 2007.
**** Includes 17 non-vCJD type unknown (2 from 1996, 2 from 1997, 1
from 2001, 1 from 2003, 4 from 2004, 3 from 2005, 4 from 2006) and 36
type pending (2 from 2005, 8 from 2006, 26 from 2007).

Notes:

-- Cases are listed based on the year of death when available. If the
year of death is not available, the year of sample receipt is used.

-- Referrals: Cases with possible or probable prion disease from
which brain tissue or blood in the case of familial disease were submitted.

-- Inconclusive: Cases in which the samples were not sufficient to
make a diagnosis.

-- Non-vCJD type unknown are cases in which the tissue submitted was
adequate to establish the presence but not the type; in all cases,
vCJD could be excluded.

[In submitting these data, Terry S. Singeltary Sr. draws attention to
the steady increase in the "type unknown" category, which, according
to their definition, comprises cases in which vCJD could be excluded.
The total of 26 cases for the current year (2007) is disturbing,
possibly symptomatic of the circulation of novel agents.
Characterization of these agents should be given a high priority. - Mod.CP]
