An increase in infection levels by the parasite _Neospora caninum_ has forced the Cattle Health Certification Standards (Checs) to add it to their list of targeted diseases.

Evidence shows infection levels from the parasite, which is hosted in dogs, could be as high as 51 percent across UK beef and dairy herds.

The risk is so great that it is the 1st new disease in 15 years to be added to Checs, the regulatory body for cattle-health schemes in the UK and Ireland, and joins Johne's disease, BVD [bovine viral diarrhea], IBR [infectious bovine rhinotracheitis] and leptospirosis.

Neospora can cause abortion in cattle if they ingest oocysts shed by infected dogs. The parasite can also be spread during pregnancy to the foetus from dams infected before their own birth.

Checs executive director Tim Brigstocke says the biggest loss from neospora comes from abortion -- this is either directly in the form of the loss of a calf but also -- in the dairy industry -- failure to get a cow back into milk.

He says: "Cattle infected with the parasite are up to 7 times more likely to abort, and with an average dairy herd size of 121 cows, the cost to a farm each year is about BP 3000."

Mr Brigstocke is now calling on farmers to get involved in a licensed health scheme to eradicate neospora.

Gareth Hateley, vet lead of the cattle expert group of the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency, says farmers can also take other steps to reduce neospora infection.

Farmers keeping closed herds will reduce the risk of introducing neospora on to the farm.

"They should dispose of cattle tissues left over from a calving, or aborted foetuses.

"If infected with neospora these pose a high risk of transmitting the parasite to dogs," he says.

Mr Hateley says dogs should also be prevented from having access to calving areas or parts of the farm where pregnant cattle are kept in order to stop them becoming infected from eating placenta or abortion material.

He adds: "Dog owners should be made aware of the risks too; if the dogs is infected and their faeces isn't picked up, there is a possibility that they could be leaving infected material for cattle to eat as well as starting off the whole cycle again."

There are no licensed drugs for the treatment and prevention of neospora infection in cattle.

"That means preventative measures are key to controlling the spread of neospora," he says.

[_Neospora caninum_ is a protozoan parasite of animals. Until 1988, it was misidentified as _Toxoplasma gondii_. Since its 1st recognition in dogs in 1984 and the description of the new genus and species _Neospora caninum_ (Apicomplexa: Eimeriina: Sarcocystidae) in 1988, neosporosis has been detected in various species of livestock, including cattle, sheep, goats, horses and deer. Neosporosis belongs to the most frequently diagnosed causes of abortion in dairy cattle worldwide. Furthermore, _N. caninum_ infections in dairy cows may also be associated with premature culling and decreased milk production.

In general, _N. caninum_ is very similar in structure and life cycle to _T. gondii_, with 2 important differences: (i) neosporosis is primarily a disease of cattle; dogs and related canids are the definitive hosts of _N. caninum_, whereas (ii) toxoplasmosis is primarily a disease of humans, sheep, and goats; felids are the only definitive hosts of _T. gondii_.

Although antibodies to _N. caninum_ have been reported in human serum, the parasite itself has not been detected in human tissues. Thus, the zoonotic potential is uncertain.

A number of approaches have been employed to control neosporosis in cattle herds. These include improving farm biosecurity, test and cull programs, test and exclude from breeding, and artificially inseminating with beef semen. Biosecurity may prove beneficial to avoid introducing the parasite into a closed herd not already infected with Neospora.

Farm management practices to reduce _N. caninum_ infection can include:
(i) minimizing fecal contamination of cattle feed or water by canids,
(ii) prompt removal of aborted bovine fetuses and fetal membranes; and
(iii) limiting the introduction of infected cattle into the herd and culling infected animals.

If employing the test and cull method of control, every animal must be serologically tested and those that test positive removed from the herd. Test-negative animals should be periodically retested since titers tend to wax and wane and there is a possibility of horizontal transmission resulting in new infections. This approach can be devastating depending on how many in the herd test positive. Notwithstanding the risk of horizontal transmission, a more economic approach would be to test each animal and exclude the daughters of seropositive cows from the replacement pool. If a cow is very valuable there is always the opportunity to preserve the genetics by embryo transfer into a seronegative dam.

It is possible to reduce the risk of Neospora abortions in dairy cattle by inseminating seropositive dams with beef breed semen. This is effective because crossbreed pregnancies have a more robust placentation with higher levels of peripartum pregnancy-associated glycoprotein, which may have protective value. Beef breeds in general, and the Limousin breed in particular, are more resistant to Neospora infection than are dairy breeds. Beef cow-calf herds that manage their cows on range for summer grazing have lower seroprevalence than those that do not, while increased seroprevalence is associated with higher winter stocking density.

These control methods might not be economically or practically feasible on dairies or beef cattle operations. Buying replacements originating from seronegative herds can mitigate the risk of introducing infected replacements into a negative herd. General management efforts to reduce stress from concurrent disease, environmental and social stress, and providing an adequate wholesome ration may reduce immunosuppression and hence abortion rates.

There is accumulating evidence that some _N. caninum_ infected cows can develop a degree of protective immunity against abortion and/or congenital transmission, indicating that immunoprophylaxis to prevent abortion or congenital transmission is a feasible goal. A commercial vaccine is not currently available. In the future, vaccine development is likely to depend on identification of specific Neospora genes that may enable the production of genetically engineered vaccines.

The above information on control/prevention of _N. caninum_ is derived from a comprehensive, recent (2015) review by C. T. Estill and C. M. Scully, which also includes updated information on the epidemiology, lifecycle, pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical signs of the disease; see at http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/34/11184708/1118470834-58.pdf. - Mod.AS]
