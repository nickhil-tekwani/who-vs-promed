The number of people killed in the Free State since the outbreak of
Rift Valley fever (RVF) has risen to 2, health officials said on
Monday. "A total of 21 human... cases of Rift Valley fever have been
confirmed, all acquired in Free State, with 2 deaths," Deputy
Minister of Health Molefi Sefularo said in a statement. The
department said most of the cases followed direct contact with
RVF-infected livestock. The human cases were farmers, veterinarians
and farm workers. Sefularo said additional suspect cases were
currently being tested.

On Monday [15 Mar 2010], agricultural officials in the Northern Cape
announced they were awaiting RVF test results from 4 districts. "The
Northern Cape provincial government has embarked upon an
all-out-effort to foil the current outbreak of RVF," agriculture MEC
[Member of the Executive Council] Norman Shushu said in a statement.

33 dead lambs
-------------
Shushu said one farm in the Colesberg area reported a confirmed case
of RVF with 4 cattle dead, out of 14 that took ill. Suspected cases
had also emerged around farms near Richmond, Carnavon -- where one
reported 30 dead lambs -- Prieska and Douglas, where farmers had
reported livestock mortalities. "Samples were collected and we are
awaiting the results thereof." Shushu said the Northern Cape has had
no confirmed human cases. A suspected case in Colesberg tested negative.

Provincial veterinary services would update the Red Meat Producers
Organisation in the Northern Cape and the National African Farmers'
Union on the sickness on Monday [15 Mar 2010]. The provincial
agriculture and health departments would launch a public awareness
campaign on RVF. Shushu urged farmers in the affected areas to
immediately vaccinate their animals and avoid opening carcasses they
suspected died from RVF.

Heavy rainfall
--------------
In 2009, the Northern Cape veterinary services reacted to an outbreak
of RVF in the Kakamas area. Some 5000 doses of vaccine were used to
contain the disease at the time. This year RVF was reported in the
Free State after heavy rainfall countrywide in January and February
[2010]. The province reported high mortalities in lambs and abortions
in sheep in the Bultfontein district, as well as parts of Boshoff and
Jacobsdal. In the Eastern Cape the disease was also reported in the
Hofmeyer area.

Rift Valley fever is caused by a virus spread by mosquitoes amongst
sheep, cattle and goats. People can get RVF through contact with the
blood or other body fluids of infected animals.

[As Mod.CP pointed out in his excellent summary of Rift Valley Fever
(ProMED archive no. 20100309.0761), outbreaks of RVF in animals
precede human cases. The establishment of an active animal health
surveillance system to detect new cases is essential in providing
early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities.
