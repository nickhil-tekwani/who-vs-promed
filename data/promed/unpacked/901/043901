Here is some information which may be of help.
_Camelpox virus- is a distinct species within the Genus _Orthopoxvirus_,
which exclusively infects camelids. Clinical manifestations vary from a
singular pox lesion to a generalized form, with pox literally covering the
entire animal and even found on internal organs (e.g. lungs). Mortality may
reach 30 percent, and complications due to secondary bacterial and mycotic
infections are common. Severe cases of camelpox to the point of fatality
have been described in camels from Saudi Arabia after they have been
exported to the UAE (1).
Differential diagnoses include:
1. papillomatosis, the warts of which may be taken as pox lesions after
secondary bacterial infection, but they are usually smaller, and
2. contagious ecthyma caused by _Pseudocowpox virus_, a member of the genus
_Parapoxvirus_, Pox induced through an infection with the latter cannot be
clinically distinguished from pox caused by camelpoxvirus.
Lumpy skin disease (LSD, caused by another poxvirus which belongs to
another genus, _Capripoxvirus__, with the better-known members _Sheeppox
virus_ and _Goatpox virus_) has not been described on the Arabian peninsula
yet [see
comment]. Until 1988, it was restricted to sub-saharan Africa, but it is
now known in Egypt (3).
LSD does infect cattle and displays a clinical picture resembling pox, but
the host range does not include camels. On the other hand, the host range
of camelpox is restricted to Old World camelids (New World camelids are
susceptible to the infection, but the natural occurrence of camelpox is
restricted to the Old World -- with the exception of Australia).
Hence, camelpox is unlikely to be the cause of the observed disease in cows.
To cut this short; if the described pox-like disease in camels and cows is
indeed caused by the same etiological agent, pseudocowpox virus would be a
possible but very surprising candidate, because -- at least in cows -- only
the udder is usually affected and fatal outcomes are very unusual. Hence,
it seems more likely that 2 different viruses are at work: one causing the
pox in camel and the other responsible for the effects seen in cattle.
Alternatively, bacterial infection(s) might also be considered.

[Dr Pfeffer's response to our request for information and his useful data,
particularly regarding camelpox, are timely and gratefully
acknowledged. Hopefully, someone in the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture
(which reportedly has been notified about the cases) will be able to
enlighten us on the investigations and their results.
Regarding the presence of LSD in the Arabian peninsula, the reader is
referred to OIE's epidemiological data. According to those, LSD has been
recorded and reported in Bahrein (1993, 1994, 2002, 2003); Kuwait (1991);
Oman (1994); and the United Arab Emirates (2000). These might have been
introductions from Eastern Africa by imported cattle for slaughter. See
