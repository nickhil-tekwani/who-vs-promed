Now we have the first official report about this epidemic: nmepid1.jpg -
shows the _Neisseria meningitidis_ cases in Hungary but it contains only
the reported cases. They know [about an additional 11 cases in December,
but the written report-cards haven't arrived yet. We have only a paper-form
report system.
nmepid2.jpg - Number of cases 1 Dec 1999 to 7 Jan 2000. The cases are
serious, with haemorrhagic symptoms at 65%, patients had to [be treated in
acute care units.

nmepid3.jpg - map of cases. The first number = C serotype, the second
number = "non-B" serotype. 5 patients died as a result of the epidemic.
What they did to stop [the epidemic?
1. Ordered quarantine in army-barracks and chemoprophylaxis and active
vaccination.
2. Active vaccination in other barracks.
3. _Neisseria meningitidis_ A&C active vaccination will be a part of the
army vaccination schedule.
4. Civilian persons - chemoprophylaxis for the contacts.
5. Vaccination possibilities at certain hospital departments and in
laboratories.
