Rare meningitis discovered in 5 kids
------------------------------------
Meningitis caused by _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, a very rare
disease, is becoming increasingly common in Viet Nam, said Dr Nguyen
Van De, chief of the Parasitology Faculty of Hanoi Medical University.

From 1995-2000, Viet Nam recorded only 15 cases, but so far this
year [2008], the number is 5. All are children under 15 years old in Hanoi.

The children caught the disease when the _Angiostrongylus
cantonensis_ worm got into their brain, causing meningitis. Typical
symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, convulsions, and squinty eyes.

_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ can appear in [cerebrospinal fluid] and
also in lens crystallins and lung arteries.

There are over 20 species of _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, which
parasitise mice, 2 of which cause meningitis in humans.

[Background information on _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ infection
was excerpted from the parasitic disease information fact sheet of
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/angiostrongylus/factsht_angiostrongylus.htm>.

_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is a nematode (parasitic worm) of rats,
which is also called the rat lungworm. The adult form of the parasite
can be found only in rodents. Infected rats pass larvae of the
parasite in their feces. By ingesting the rat feces, snails and slugs
get infected with the larvae. Then, the larvae mature in snails and
slugs but do not develop into adult worms. When rats eat infected
snails or slugs, the larvae mature into adult worms in the rats. An
excellent diagram demonstrating the life cycle of the nematode can be
found at <http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/angiostrongyliasis.htm>,
with additional more detail on the organism and clinical manifestations.

People can become infected by eating raw or undercooked snails,
slugs, freshwater prawns, crabs, or frogs infected with this
parasite, but fish cannot transmit this parasite to humans. There is
no known human-to-human transmission of this parasite either.

Most of the infected cases do not show any symptoms or have only mild
symptoms of short duration. Sometimes, the infection can render a
rare type of eosinophilic meningitis. The clinical symptoms of
eosinophilic meningitis are caused by the presence of larvae in the
brain and by local host reactions. The symptoms of eosinophilic
meningitis include headache, stiff neck, tingling or painful
sensation in the skin, low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.

The majority of people can fully recover spontaneously with
symptomatic treatment. Antibiotics have not been shown to be
effective for the treatment of eosinophilic meningitis.
