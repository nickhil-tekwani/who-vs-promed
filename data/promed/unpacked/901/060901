Avian Influenza Virus (H4N6) Reported in Canadian Pigs
------------------------------------------------------
WESTPORT, CT: Canadian and American researchers have isolated avian
influenza virus H4N6 from domestic pigs. Because of the prior demonstrations
of transmission of avian influenza viruses from pigs to humans and the
pandemic potential of avian influenza strains; "The appearance of avian
influenza viruses among pigs poses concerns for both veterinary and human
health," Dr. Christopher W. Olsen, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
and colleagues say in the October issue of the Journal of Virology [J Virol
2000;74:9322-9327.
The team reports on their investigation of a Canadian farm where an outbreak
of pneumonia in pigs began in October 1999. The researchers isolated 8
viral RNA segments from affected animals. Analysis of these segments
"demonstrated that these are wholly avian influenza viruses of the North
American lineage," according to the report. Further investigation revealed
the identity of the virus as avian influenza virus H4N6, a relative of
strains commonly found in Canadian ducks. "To our knowledge...this report is
the first to document the isolation of a wholly avian influenza virus from
pigs in North America and the isolation of an H4 influenza virus from
naturally infected pigs," Dr. Olsen and colleagues point out. "Given the
evidence that pigs can support reassortment of human and avian influenza
viruses, including the recent isolations of human-avian-swine triple
reassortant H3N2 and H1N2 viruses from pigs in the United States, it is
prudent that we enhance surveillance for atypical influenza viruses in pigs
as part of overall pandemic preparedness efforts and that we consider the
potential for these H4N6 viruses, or H4 reassortant viruses, to enter the
human population."

Footprinnt of H5N1 virus detected Hong Kong Poultry Farm
--------------------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: Signs of a virus similar to the avian influenza virus that killed
6 people in 1997 have been found on a Yuen Long farm. It is the first time
that the "footprint" of the H5 virus has been found in Hong Kong since the
crisis 3 years ago, which turned the international spotlight on the
territory and led to the slaughter of one million chickens. Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department officials said last night that
inspectors had found chickens at a farm in Ngau Tam Mei which appeared to
have been exposed to the avian virus. The 10 000 chickens - now isolated -
will be destroyed if more sophisticated test results available next week
confirm they contain the H5 virus. The department has ordered the farm to
stop supplying chickens and is checking other farms. Workers at the Ngau Tam
Mei farm are also being tested. Assistant department director Dr Liu
Kwei-kin said that based on preliminary tests, the virus was unlikely to
pose a significant risk to the public. There was no evidence of disease at
the farm. "So far we have only found antibodies, or the 'footprint' of the
virus," he said. Dr Liu said there were 3 possibilities for the test
results - the antibodies were reacting to a different virus; the H5 virus
was one that did not cause disease; or the H5 virus was one that did cause
disease.
The department said it would introduce new measures to ensure chickens were
safe to eat. All batches of chickens supplied from the territory's 120 farms
would be tested before they were sold. The department would take more than
1500 blood samples from the farms, or 13 samples from each farm, in the
coming week. The 18 poultry farms in Yuen Long will be inspected first. At
present, the department only takes samples from local farms every 2
months. On Thursday, the department found 24 of the 52 chicken blood samples
obtained from the Yuen Long farms showed traces of antibodies to H5. It is
understood that more than 2000 chickens from the Yuen Long farm, imported
from the mainland, have reached the market since the last inspection.
Aquatic birds such as geese and ducks are the sources of H5 virus. The
Government began segregating the farming and slaughter of chickens and water
birds after the 1997 crisis. "The Yuen Long chicken farm does not keep water
birds. We still have to investigate the source of the virus. We do think the
segregation policy is very effective," Dr Liu said. Imported chickens
undergo tests on the mainland and in the SAR. The 1997 crisis began when the
H5N1 virus, previously found only in poultry, mutated and infected people. A
total of 18 people were infected and 6 died.
Dr Daniel Lavanchy, chief of the WHO's influenza division, said from Geneva
last night that he was not surprised by yesterday's announcement. "As H5
could be epidemic among migrating birds, occasionally we will see chickens
also affected." He said there was no cause for alarm as long as no human
infection was spotted.
