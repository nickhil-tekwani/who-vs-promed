Postal worker ill, but anthrax ruled out
-------------------------------------
An employee of Dutch postal company, TPG, fell ill on Sun 18 Jul 2004,
after handling an item that he said contained a yellow powder. Initial
tests ruled out anthrax contamination, but the mystery substance has not
yet been identified.
The postal item originated from a post box on the Prinses Julianalaan on
the corner of the Alkmaar Medical Centre. The postal worker fell ill when
collecting mail from the post box. But, the man was well enough to drive to
the TPG distribution center in Alkmaar North, where 6 of his colleagues
were also working. 4 workers came in contact with the postal deliverer, and
one of them touched the package.
The ill employee complained of breathing problems, and eye irritation, and
was taken, as a precautionary measure, to the hospital. He was released
several hours later, and TPG-Post said, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that he was
doing well.
The other worker who touched the package complained of irritation to the
hands, but this abated over time. None of the 6 people working in the
distribution center, on Sun 18 Jul 2004, have reported any further
problems, news agency ANP said.
The discovery of the suspect package comes after the Netherlands issued a
general terrorism alert on 9 Jul 2004. The Dutch secret service AIVD has
warned that Islamic extremists might be preparing an attack.
Meanwhile, a sample of the postal item's contents was taken to the research
institute ID-Lelystad, where it will undergo further tests. Police said
initial tests ruled out anthrax, but the substance has not yet been
identified. The postal worker said the package contained a yellow
substance, and police have been unable to explain the incident. The TPG
distribution center was cordoned off on Sunday [18 Jul 2004] night as
microbiological investigations were carried out.
Police said, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that fire extinguishers were found in the
vicinity of the Prinses Julianalaan, and the discovery indicated the
suspect substance could have originated from the extinguishers. The powder
used in such equipment can be extremely irritating.
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, 5 people died, and 17 were injured,
in the US when anthrax in powder form was sent through the mail, sparking
global concern of biological terror attacks. Envelopes with white powder
soon started arriving in mailboxes right across the globe, including the
Netherlands. All of them were found to be harmless, and Dutch authorities
prosecuted several people for sending "joke" anthrax letters.

Fire extinguisher powder "cause of anthrax scare"
-----------------------------------------------
The powder that made a TPG postal worker ill on Sun 18 Jul 2004 almost
certainly originated from a fire extinguisher, tests by the Dutch Forensics
Institute have determined. Breathing in the yellow powder can lead to
breathing difficulties, nausea, and eye irritation. The Alkmaar postal
worker became ill on Sunday [18 Jul 2004] night after emptying a post box
on the Prinses Julianalaan, raising fears of an anthrax letter. He was
taken to the hospital for treatment, but released several hours later. Fire
extinguisher powder was later found in the vicinity of the post box.

[In exploring what this "yellow" substance associated with these fire
extinguishers might be, we found the following information on them: Type
BC: The BC dry-chemical extinguisher is filled with sodium or potassium
carbonate. It isolates the burning material from oxygen, but enough heat
can convert the solid carbonate into CO2 gas, and so this type of
extinguisher should NOT be used for Type A or Type D fires. Dry-chemical
extinguishers are normally red, with small nozzles (and sometimes hoses).
Type ABC: The ABC dry-chemical extinguisher is filled with ammonium
phosphate. It isolates the burning material from oxygen, but burning Class
D materials can liberate oxygen from the phosphate ion, and so this type of
extinguisher should NOT be used for Type D fires. Dry-chemical
extinguishers are normally red, with small nozzles (and sometimes hoses).
Ammonium phosphate: Following uses: Flame proofing (building materials,
pulp, and paper); Preventer of afterglow in matches; Agriculture:
Ingredient in specialty all-soluble dry fertilizers; Waste Water - Nutrient
for biological purification. ... But, though it may be the suspect
material, it is not yellow.
Members with special knowledge in this area are asked to share it so that
we can better identify this chemical. Of course, a report from the Dutch
Forensics Institute would be most welcome. - Mod.MHJ]
[At the beginning of April 2004 somebody spread a strong-smelling yellow
powder at night outside the door to the ATM section of a bank in a small
town in Rio state. 9 people -- 2 bank employees who discovered it and 7
firemen who went to clean up (with brooms) -- had to be treated for
inhalation and eye irritation. The chemical people arrived later and found
that there was not enough product left from the cleanup to analyze. The
culprit was caught on the security cameras, but, has not been identified.
No motive is known. Could it have been the contents of a chemical fire
extinguisher? (Report posted in Portuguese on LISAS
