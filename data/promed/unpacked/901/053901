JAKARTA - Dengue fever has claimed two lives so far this year and 129
others have contracted the disease in Jakarta, the Jakarta Post Wednesday
quoted an official of the city health agency as reporting.
Lindawati, the agency's public relations officer, said people should be on
alert because the number of people being infected with dengue fever was on
the increase.
She cited as an example that on 10 Feb 1999 the number of infected people
was 77, but four days later it jumped to 108. On Tuesday the number reached
129.
"We should be careful because there is a possibility that the number will
continue increasing. Based on past experience, outbreaks always take place
in the period between March and April," she said.
Lindawati was confident that the number of people infected with the disease
would not be as big as last year's if people actively participated in the
one-month eradication program which started on January 28. Activities in
the program include keeping houses and neighborhoods clean.
Head of the City Council Commission E for social welfare Soeparmo urged the
health agency to be on high alert against the possibility of an outbreak
next month.
Last year's outbreak in Jakarta was said to be one of the most serious
cases in recent history in which 133 deaths and 15,427 sufferers were
recorded.
Dengue fever, an acute tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, leaves
its victims with fever, rash and severe pains in the joints and back.
