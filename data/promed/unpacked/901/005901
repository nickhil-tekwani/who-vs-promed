Organization: Southern Eye Bank
The media discussion of CJD and various tissues has now begun to impact the
transplant community. On May 12, 1997, the ABC World News Tonight broadcast
led listeners to believe that brain tissue and corneas used in
transplantation cause this disease. I may be being a little over draumatic
here so please feel free to edit as much of this as necessary. I do,
however, wish to submit the following News Release issued by the Eye Bank
Association of America. All eye banks in the US are requested to join. In my
eye bank's case, the State of Louisiana requires my participation within
this organization. For further information, please feel free to contact the
EBAA by telephone at (202) 775-4999 or email at Sightebaa@aol.com. If I can
be of further service, please let me know.
I have typed the news release as it was received at Southern Eye Bank on
May 16, 1997.

NEWS RELEASE
Eye Bank Association of America

From: Patricia Aiken-O'Neill, Esq.
Re: ABC World News Tonight
ABC World News Tonight aired a program on Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease on
Monday, May 12, 1997. ABC reporter John McKenzie, stated that "even with
standard sterilization practices, this lethal disease can be transmitted
from patient to patient through neurosurgical instruments as well as
transplants of certain brain tissue and corneas. At least 100 people have
been infected this way."
This is a gross misstatement. One case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease has been
transmitted through corneal transplantation, documented in 1974. No other
cases of transmission have been reported in the 20 plus years following this.
Since the 1974 incident occurred, strict medical standards and rigid
protocols have been established and followed by all EBAA accredited eye
banks. The health of all eye tissue used for corneal transplants is
routinely screened and medical information on all donors carefully
scrutinized. These steps to insure that diseases will not be transmitted are
the highest priority of all eye banks associated with the Eye Bank
Assocation of America, and utmost care to maintain these thorough procedures
is adhered to rigorously.
The Eye Bank Association of America has asked Paul Friedman, Executive
Producer, ABC World News Tonight to retract this very misleading statement.

I saw and taped the ABC News report.
The following is a transcript I have prepared from the tape. This is solely
for the benefit of those on the list who will have difficulty getting a
timely copy or transcript of this news report. I'm sure there are copyright
regulations regarding using it for anything other than informational
purposes. It is formatted in a modified script format so that those who did
not have the opportunity to see the original broadcast can get the flavor of
how the graphics subtly (or not so subtly) played into the text.

Segment: Your Health
Peter Jennings:
On Your Health tonight, the good news and the bad. The good news is that
people may not be contracting Alzheimers disease as often as we think. The
bad news is that they may be getting something worse instead. We agree
that's pretty harsh language to describe a situation that has not been
getting much public attention. But it is fairly accurate. This is about
something called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is fatal. It destroys your
brain, and what is worse it is infectious. Worthy of notice, without a
doubt. Here's ABC's John McKenzie.
[Voice over - John McKenzie

Marie Farris was 63 years old when suddenly she began displaying frightening
symptoms...
[Cut to Voice of Calvin Farris and pan to closeup of Marie's calm, smiling face]
She just barely knew her first name. She no

longer could write and when she was sittin' she would look like she was
lookin' off into space all the time.
[Intercut between two shot Calvin Farris and John McKenzie and mid shot

The doctor told us it was Alzheimers disease.
[Cut to photo of very smiling, happy Marie - voice over John McKenzie]
But, her decline seemed too rapid to be Alzheimers. Within just four weeks
her condition had worsened dramatically.
[Cut to photo of wild eyed, emaciated, yellow tinted skinned, visibly aged
Marie - voice over continues]
So the family sought a second opinion.
[Cut to outside shot of University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics - voice over
continues]
Here at the University of Iowa doctors reached a different conclusion.
[Cut to close up of Marie Farris' medical record indicating admission date
12/17/9 and discharge 12/20/9 without year visible - voice over continues]
Marie Farris suffered from CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[pan down medical record and highlight "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease" - new,
unidentified voice over]
It can be easily missed for a couple of reasons, first of all...
[Cut to interview of voice over Dr. Robert Rodnitzky - University of Iowa
Hospital]
the characteristic features that distinguish it from Alzheimers are often
very subtle early in the course of the illness and, secondarily, not every
physician will recognize those characteristic signs.
[Cut to unflattering, head shot photo of aged Marie Farris sitting in easy
chair - voice over John McKenzie]
The ordeal of Marie Farris raises disturbing questions about how many other
mistakes have been made ...
[Cut to head shot of aged Marie Farris staring blankly lying in bed with
Pomeranian dog - voice over continues]
how many of the 4 million Americans diagnosed with Alzheimers
[Pan out to show half of bed and knit afgan/quilt]
actually have CJD.
[Cut to mid shot of man at desk in white physician's coat making entries
into record book - voice over continues]
Based largely on reports from doctors around the country, health officials
have maintained there only about 250 new cases of CJD in this country each year.
[Cut to cascade graphic of medical reports with barely visible/readable
titles like "Diagnosis of Dementia" - voice over continues]
But several autopsy studies suggest this disease has been under diagnosed.
[Cut to lab where two doctors in full gowns with eye/face shields are
conducting an autopsy (body mostly shielded from view) - voice over continues]
The studies show that when pathologists actually did autopsies and examined
brain tissue from patients with Alzheimers and other brain disorders, they
uncovered hidden cases of CJD, anywhere from about 1% to 13%.
[Cut to mid shot of John McKenzie in a lab with microscopes and lab
equipment in background]
John McKenzie:
These preliminary findings suggest a public health problem is being
overlooked. If larger autopsy studies at more hospitals in this country
confirmed that even 1% of Alzheimers patients had CJD that would mean 40,000
cases. And each undetected case is significant because, unlike Alzheimers,
CJD is infectious.

Even with standard sterilization practices, this lethal disease can be

through

neurosurgical instruments, as well as
[Cut to head shot of doctor in scrubs, mask and surgical glasses with

transplants of certain brain tissue and corneas
[Cut to mid shot operating team similarly dressed conducting operation]
At least 100 people have been infected this way.
[Cut to mid shot John McKenzie and Dr. Laura Mandelidis sitting at lab table
while Dr. Manuelidis, with gloved hands, handles fixed human brain - voice
over continues]
Dr. Manuelidis:
This part of the brain, is involved ...
[Simultaneous voice over]
Dr. Laura Manuelidis, a neuropathologist at Yale Medical School, has used
[Cut to close up of brain in Dr. Manuelidis' hands]
brain samples to uncover hidden cases of CJD
[Cut to mid shot Dr. Manuelidis]
Dr. Manuelidis:
It's a very good idea to take a closer look at Alzheimer's patients and
other people who are written off as having typical senile dementias because
there may be a hidden group in those patients.
[Cut to head shot of Michael Hansen of the Consumer Policy Institute interview]
Michael Hansen:
That's why we're saying we have to find out. Because if we find out
[Intercut to two shot Hansen and McKenzie - Hansen continues]
that there is much higher CJD rates than we thought, that suggests that this
explosion happened because of something and they would start to look for
infectious sources.
[Cut to Dr. Manuelidis and colleague reviewing DNA sequences on backlighted
viewer board - voice over John McKenzie]
To start looking more closely at how
[Cut to close up of pencil pointing to DNA sequence - voice over continues]
CJD might be spreading.
[Cut to more mid shot of doctors performing brain surgery - voice over

To look at medical supplies
[Cut to customers holding their red plastic shopping baskets while standing

even food supplies, and answer
[Cut to mid shot photo of old, ill Marie Farris staring blankly from her bed

the question, "How do people like Marie Farris get this disease?"

[Cut to Peter Jennings]
Peter Jennings:
If you would like more information about this or any of our reports on Your
Health, you can reach us through e-mail. It's Health@ABC.com.

End of Report
Later on the late night/early morning/all night edition of ABC World News,
the anchor introduced a shortened version of the segment with this comment.
I missed the first few words.
... better protect the food supply, it is possible the CJD may be spreading
unnoticed in the United States. A look at this camoflaged killer from ABC's
John McKenzie.
The report ran approx. 3:30 minutes in its original form and approx. 2:15
minutes in its shortened form.
