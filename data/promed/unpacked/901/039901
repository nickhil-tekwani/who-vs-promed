New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 19
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) cases reported this week: 3

Headlines
Summary of newly reported viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - one case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan - 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - 3 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2); and
- Horn of Africa (Somalia) - 1 cVDPV type 3-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- One case of WPV1 was reported in the past week, with onset of paralysis on [27 Aug 2018], from Kandahar. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 15.
- A total of 5 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from Kandahar province, collected in late August [2018] and early September [2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 4.
- A total of 7 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, from across the country, collected in August [2018] and September [2018].

Nigeria
- A total of 3 cases of cVDPV2 cases were reported this week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 to 14.
- These latest reported cases had onset of paralysis in late August [2018] and early September [2018], from Katsina and Yobe states, linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak centred around Jigawa.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No cases of cVDPV2 reported from Niger in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 in Niger is 2. These 2 cases of cVDPV2 were reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria. The 2 cases are from Zinder province, Niger, with dates of onset of paralysis on [18 Jul 2018 and 8 Aug 2018]. Nigeria is also affected by a separate cVDPV2, centred around Sokoto state.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigation and risk assessment to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. Active searches for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- The earlier detection of WPV1 in Nigeria and current cVDPV2 in Nigeria and Niger continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week.
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication". The high-level meeting was convened by HE [?], the minister of health, as well as the WHO director-general and the regional director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- One cVDPV3-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, from Banadir, Somalia, collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of cases in 2018 is 14.
- It is important to note that detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the commencement of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[I suspect that the newly confirmed case in Afghanistan is the same as the case we reported in a media report on 26 Sep 2018 [see Poliomyelitis update (44): Afghanistan, Pakistan violence 20180926.6053992]. This is a case from the Bagh-e-Shahr neighborhood, of southern Kandahar province. The MoH statement to the press mentioned that the affected 2 year old girl's family lives in an area where some locals do not allow health workers to conduct polio vaccination -- a recurrent problem confronting the polio eradication efforts.

Well, this week it is hard to tease out good news, but the absence of reports of additional cases in Niger, the DRC, Papua New Guinea, and Syria is good news. The not-so-good news includes 2 countries reporting new cases -- Afghanistan and Nigeria -- the former WPV1 associated and the latter cVDPV2 associated. In addition, multiple countries are reporting positive environmental samples -- Afghanistan and Pakistan (WPV) and Somalia (cVDPV). The positive environmental samples signal continued circulation of the polioviruses: WPV in Pakistan and cVDPV in Somalia.
