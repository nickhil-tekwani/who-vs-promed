[For] pineapples, one of the biggest challenges worldwide is plant parasitic nematodes [PPN]. In Kenya, there is sparse knowledge on how nematodes affect pineapple production. A study was conducted to compare population densities and diversity of nematodes in 2 commercial plantations with contrasting management practices in central Kenya. In addition, the influence of plant age was assessed and compared with nearby smallholders.

"Nematode infection of pineapple results in reduced root function, the plant will deteriorate and eventually die, reducing yield and fruit quality. Interactions between plant parasitic nematodes and other pathogens, or between nematode species in a mixed community, are common and can result in extensive damage or disease complexes," says Solveig Haukeland, NIBIO [Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research]. Yield reductions of pineapple were associated with PPNs in several countries, including Hawaii, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil. The reniform nematode [_Rotylenchulus reniformis_] can reduce yield by 60%.

Soil and root samples were collected from fields of different ages in the commercial plantations, as well as from 29 smallholder fields. [One] commercial farm relies heavily on fumigant, [the other] more on biological nematode management. A total of 18 different types of nematodes associated with pineapple [were found], with greater diversity in smallholdings than in commercial farms. Most prevalent were root knot nematodes [of] _Meloidogyne_ spp. [with] _M. javanica_ the principal species present. Across all sites, there were higher densities in older fields of 24 and 36 months than fallow and 3-month-old fields.

Differences in nematode management probably play a role in population trends, however, fumigants do not solve the problem. [They] initially knock down the PPN population, [but] negatively impact beneficial organisms and nematode predators, creating a favourable environment for the surviving PPNs to resume reproduction at higher rates. [A] higher number of genera in smallholder farms could reflect the lack of nematode management, providing a basis for greater biodiversity, although the extended monoculture does appear to be detrimental to free-living nematodes. The study concludes that there is a high level of PPN infection in pineapple in Kenya, which would constitute an important factor contributing to low yields.

[A large number of nematode species in at least 20 genera have been reported in association with edible pineapple (_Ananas comosus_ with many cultivars, family Bromeliaceae) worldwide. Species of root-knot (_Meloidogyne_), lesion (_Pratylenchus_), and reniform (_Rotylenchulus_) nematodes are known to cause major crop or yield losses.

Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in many types of soil. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting, and leaf chlorosis; large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. Affected plants may show increased sensitivity to other bacterial or fungal pathogens.

Root knot and many other nematodes can persist in the soil for many years and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management is generally aimed at keeping nematode levels below economic thresholds. An integrated approach is required, including phytosanitation (exclusion), cultural measures (such as long crop rotation with non-host species), nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties, if available.
