The Japan Ministry of Health has reported that a 23-month-old cow has
been confirmed to have mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE); in fact, this makes it the youngest animal in
the world to be confirmed as having BSE [re. age, see commentary].

This is the 8th case of BSE in Japan [sic; see comment], and more
alarming is that the strain of BSE is new.

A major concern is that the new strain of BSE may not always be
detected by current screening procedures in Japan.

According to the CDC, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a
progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from
infection by an unusual transmissible agent called a prion. The nature
of the transmissible agent is not well understood.

Currently, the most accepted theory is that the agent is a modified
form of a normal protein known as prion protein. For reasons that are
not yet understood, the normal prion protein changes into a pathogenic
(harmful) form that then damages the central nervous system of
cattle.

[Following the discovery of the 1st case of BSE in Japan, in September
2001, 35 additional cases had been detected by the end of January
2009; no cases have been discovered between January 2009 and the one
currently reported as positive.

The enhanced Japanese surveillance consists of the testing of all
slaughtered cattle above the age of 21 months, fallen stock, and
mandatory reporting and investigation of all clinical BSE suspects. So
far, more than 10 million cows have been tested within the scheme, by
far most of them in slaughterhouses. The epidemic appeared to peak in
2006. Cases were detected mostly in dairy cattle; in cattle born in
1996 and 2000; and in cattle born in Hokkaido. The respective numbers
for the years 2001-2009 were: 3, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 3, 1, 1; the last
case, prior to the current one, was recorded in January 2009 in
Hokkaido.

All cases but 2 were regarded as "classical" BSE (C-BSE). Two cattle,
slaughtered at abattoirs, were identified as having atypical BSE by
confirmatory examinations involving Western blotting (WB) and/or
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Both these cases were classified as L-BSE
on the basis of their glycoform profiles. The 1st L-BSE case was
reported in a young Holstein steer (23 months old); the 2nd case was
reported in an old Japanese meat cow (186 months old).

The statement in the above newswire concerning the reported case as
"the youngest animal in the world to be confirmed as having BSE" is
questionable. Though BSE cases under 24 months of age are rare,
Japan's 1st BSE-L case, in October 2003, involved a young animal; BSE
cases in animals under 24 months have also been recorded in the UK in
1989 and 1992 (see archived post 20031008.2526).

The current BSE case has become Japan's 37th. Clinical details and
profiling results are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
