Norovirus outbreak affects 100 guests
-------------------------------------
About 100 guests and employees at a Hilton hotel near Dulles International
Airport have been sickened by the highly contagious norovirus, forcing the
hotel to stop taking reservations as it sanitizes the building, authorities
said last night [18 Jan 2007]. By yesterday, dozens of guests had accepted
offers to move to hotels in the area, although others remained at the
Hilton Washington Dulles Hotel. Late last night, the Fairfax County Health
Department confirmed that the sickness was caused by norovirus infection,
sometimes called "the cruise ship illness" because of outbreaks in recent
years. The Herndon area hotel said that on Tuesday [16 Jan 2007] night,
some guests began complaining of gastrointestinal distress, including
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

USA: norovirus cleaning begins at Dulles Hotel
----------------------------------------------
The Hilton Washington Dulles Airport hotel closed yesterday [19 Jan 2007]
for the weekend so crews could scrub and sanitize every surface after about
120 employees and guests were sickened by the highly contagious norovirus,
which officials say is particularly severe this year [2007]. As the last
guests filtered out early in the afternoon, workers from a professional
cleaning company prepared to scrub every nightstand and counter twice with
a chlorine bleach solution. The crew will also clean carpets and drapes and
mist each room with a disinfectant. "It's a floor-by-floor, room-by-room,
surface-by-surface process," said Jim Cree, the hotel's director of sales
and marketing, who was washing his hands more than hourly yesterday [19 Jan
2007] to avoid the bug. "This will be the most sanitized building in the
country."
This season is shaping up to be a particularly severe one for the illness
sometimes known as "winter vomiting disease," said an expert at the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which helps track some of the
23 million cases of norovirus infection that occur each year. 1st
identified in 1972 but only routinely tested for in the past decade,
norovirus is perfectly suited for causing dramatic outbreaks in crowded
settings, including cruise ships, hospitals, nursing homes and hotels. Even
a very small amount of the virus can cause infection. It survives prolonged
periods on such surfaces as counters and door handles, and it can become
airborne under some circumstances. Some common disinfectants -- such as
alcohol-based waterless hand scrubs -- won't kill it.
The chief mystery about the microbe, to both scientists and the public, is
whether norovirus infections are becoming more common or just better
publicized. "That is the key question, and I don't think we really have an
answer to it," said Robert L Atmar, a norovirus researcher at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston. "We certainly have better tools to diagnose
the infection now, and they are being applied more frequently. That said,
it seems that in the last year, there has been an increase in the number of
norovirus outbreaks that have been reported," he said.
Marc-Alain Widdowson, a medical epidemiologist at CDC, said that "this
winter season [2006-2007] seems to be worse than previous winter seasons.
The last time we had things this bad was 2002-03." The severity of
outbreaks may vary year to year, as is the case with influenza, even if the
long-term incidence is not rising, he said. Current estimates are that at
least half of the more than 75 million annual cases of foodborne illness in
the United States are caused by norovirus. About 20 per cent of people who
go to a doctor because of acute diarrhea are infected with it. The virus is
believed to cause 10 times as many cases of diarrhea-and-vomiting illness
as the next most commonly implicated microbe.
The Virginia Department of Health has reported 52 norovirus outbreaks --
which account for many more individual cases -- this winter [2006-2007],
according to the most recent data available. Last month [December 2006],
dozens of Catholic University students fell ill with norovirus. Far from
Washington, there was an outbreak on the Queen Elizabeth 2 during a voyage
from England to New York. In Maryland, 34 gastroenteritis outbreaks have
been reported this year [2007], state health officials said. Ten appear to
be caused by norovirus, and test results are pending in the other
instances. A District health spokesman said last month's outbreak at
Catholic University was the only large norovirus incident reported in
recent years.
At the Hilton, guests 1st began reporting symptoms Tuesday [16 Jan 2007]
night, and some suspected food poisoning, Cree said. The hotel contacted
the Fairfax County Health Department, and scientists examined the
restaurant and kitchen and collected stool samples from people who were
ill. Tests on those samples confirmed norovirus as the culprit. Hilton
officials found reservations at other hotels for guests checking in
mid-week and through the weekend and moved a gala and other events.
Employees will return to work Mon 22 Jan 2007, and the hotel is scheduled
to reopen at noon Tuesday. The Hilton isn't the only area hotel that has
been forced to close because of the virus. In 2003, dozens of guests and
visitors at the nearby Hyatt Dulles fell ill. The hotel reopened after 3
days of top-to-bottom cleaning.
Lucy Caldwell, a Virginia Department of Health spokeswoman, said the best
way to avoid the misery of norovirus is frequent hand washing. If you do
become ill, disinfect everything you've touched. "Spend time cleaning the
toilet, including the handle," Caldwell said. "Clean anything you touch.
The soap dish, your phone, the remote control." Norovirus is almost always
passed through vomitus or feces. Perhaps as few as 10 virions -- individual
virus particles -- are enough to cause infection. The incubation period is
usually a day or more. Three-quarters of people report vomiting and
diarrhea, although only 1/3rd have fever, and symptoms usually last about 5
days. About 20 per cent of whites appear to be genetically resistant to one
strain of norovirus, called Norwalk virus. Death from the infection is
uncommon, but it can occur in the debilitated elderly.
Norovirus has been responsible for several large, dramatic outbreaks that
illustrate its extreme contagiousness and persistence. Early this decade,
660 patrons of a restaurant in Nagasaki, Japan became infected with
norovirus. Boiled broccoli that had been handled with bare hands after
cooking was the most likely source of infection. Contaminated drinking
water, and even insufficiently chlorinated swimming pools, have caused
outbreaks of norovirus infection.
