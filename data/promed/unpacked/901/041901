Tamiflu resistant bird flu in Indonesia
---------------------------------------
An Australian researcher says H5N1 avian flu viruses from Indonesia
are markedly less susceptible to the antiviral drug Tamiflu than a
previous line of the H5N1 family of viruses.
Jennifer McKimm-Breschkin says laboratory testing shows the viruses
from Indonesia are 20 to 30 times less susceptible to the drug as
compared to H5N1 viruses that circulated in Cambodia a couple of
years ago. Dr. McKimm-Breschkin, who's attending a conference on
infectious diseases in Toronto, says the findings are not good news.
She says they may help to explain the high death toll from H5N1
in Indonesia, where 80 of 100 patients have died of the disease.
A scientist from the World Health Organization says it's not clear
what the impact of the reduced susceptibility to Tamiflu means for
people from that part of the world who become infected with the
virus. Dr. Frederick Hayden says a lot of factors can have an impact
on whether oseltamivir treatment of H5N1 patients is successful,
including how much time passes between infection and the start of drug
therapy.

Tamiflu resistance in Indonesia
-------------------------------
Roche Holding AG's Tamiflu, the antiviral drug stockpiled in the event
of a pandemic, may be becoming a weaker weapon against bird flu in
Indonesia, where the disease has killed the most people, a study
showed. Laboratory tests on 6 samples of the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza collected from poultry in Indonesia in 2005 showed they were
between 15 and 30 times less sensitive to Tamiflu than a family of the
viruses collected in Southeast Asia a year earlier. [It is pity they
did not have access from strains from humans, which might have
different susceptibilities due to the differences that enabled them to
infect humans in the 1st place. - Mod.JW].
The study, led by Jennifer McKimm-Breschkin, a virologist at the
Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization in
Melbourne, was presented at a conference in Toronto [Canada] yesterday
[Thu 21 Jun 2007].
"The decrease in drug sensitivity does not appear to be drug-induced,
but may be due to "random mutations" that have occurred as the virus
has circulated among birds, McKimm-Breschkin said in her presentation.
Tamiflu is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the
1st choice for doctors treating human cases of avian flu. Strains
either resistant or less sensitive to Tamiflu have been linked to the
deaths of at least 5 people in Viet Nam and Egypt, raising concern
that the drug won't work effectively in the event of a pandemic.
While the H5N1 virus has killed millions of poultry in about 60
countries, it is known to have infected only 313 people in a dozen
countries since 2003, according to the WHO's tally, last updated 15
Jun 2007. A total of 3 of every 5 cases have been fatal. Millions
could die if H5N1 develops the characteristics of seasonal flu and
begins spreading easily between people, touching off a global outbreak.
A vaccine against pandemic flu isn't expected to be widely available
until several months after the start of a pandemic, according to the
WHO. Without a vaccine, antiviral drugs will be the first line of
defense to limit sickness and deaths, and decrease the spread of the
contagion. Supplies of Tamiflu that would cover two-thirds of a
country's population may cut deaths from flu by half in the event of
a pandemic, Roche said in an e-mailed statement today [22 Jun 2007],
citing a separate study presented at the flu conference in
Toronto. Basel-based Roche is collaborating with researchers to
gauge resistance to Tamiflu, David Reddy, head of Roche's influenza
task force, said in a telephone interview from Toronto today.
"Resistance should never be taken lightly. We need to constantly look
at resistance," Reddy said. The change that has occurred in
Indonesia's H5N1 strain "is still modest" and its sensitivity to
Tamiflu can vary, he said.
More studies are needed to determine whether a virus's sensitivity to
Tamiflu in the laboratory is of any therapeutic significance, said
Fred Hayden, a medical officer on the WHO influenza team in Geneva.
"The pathogenesis of the infection in patients, how rapidly the virus
is growing and, critically, when they present for care" are other
variables that influence the drug's effectiveness, Hayden said over
the telephone from Toronto today. Tamiflu's active ingredient
oseltamivir works by blocking neuraminidase -- one of the 2 surface
proteins in influenza viruses and the 'N' in H5N1 -- that allows the
virus to spread from infected cells to other cells in the body.
The dominant strain of H5N1 circulating in poultry in Vietnam,
Malaysia and Cambodia in 2004 was more sensitive to oseltamivir than
a human seasonal flu virus known as H1N1, according to laboratory
tests on 16 samples. A total of 6 samples of the H5N1 virus from the
Kandal region of Cambodia the following year showed a 6-fold to
7-fold decrease in oseltamivir sensitivity, McKimm-Breschkin said.
"Results suggest that nature may be a step ahead, and that relying
solely on oseltamivir for stockpiles poses the risk that we will be
left behind without an effective drug," she said.
The effectiveness of GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Relenza antiviral
treatment was tested on the same samples in the study. There was no
change in the sensitivity to the drug across the 2 main virus
families, or clades, tested, McKimm-Breschkin said. Relenza, an
inhaled medicine, is known scientifically as zanamivir and belongs to
the same class of drugs as Tamiflu, neuraminidase inhibitors.
"As all H5N1 clades retain sensitivity to it, zanamivir should also
form part of any pandemic stockpile," said McKimm-Breschkin, who was
a member of a team of scientists that discovered the drug.
Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors "has been clinically
negligible so far, but is likely to be detected during widespread use
during a pandemic," WHO says on its website.
Roche recommends adults take 75 milligrams of oseltamivir twice a day
for 5 days to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms for
seasonal flu. Doctors are testing whether avian flu patients need a
double dose. Inadequate dosing with oseltamivir may lead to the
emergence of high-level resistance of the drug, McKimm-Breschkin
said. The problem could be exacerbated if it's given to patients who
are infected with a less sensitive strain, such as that circulating
in Indonesia, she said.
