A deadly virus in the equestrian community is causing great anguish for horse owners. So far, 4 animals have had to be put down after contracting the disease.

The state says the strain is rare and could be highly contagious among horses. The virus can be transmitted through shared buckets, saddles, grooming utensils, and also on people's shoes and clothes.

"It's devastating to think that you could potentially lose one of your best friends," said horse owner [KS]. [She] is worried about her horse Angel's health.

"What kind of chance or risk that you're taking by going anywhere, being around any horses," she said

Horses have been euthanized after being infected with a strain of [equine herpesvirus 1 ] EHV-1, which causes neurological damage.

So far, 4 horses have been put down and 5 others tested positive for the virus. The confirmed cases happened at a boarding facility; the state says by law it can't say the exact stable but that is located in northern Wake County. "I feel horrible for the people at the stables where this has happened," said [KS].

The farms where the outbreak happened are under quarantine. The animals there are receiving vaccinations.

The state says the last time this virus infected horses in North Carolina was 2 years ago.

"I was going to go down to Southern Pines to meet some friends to go trail riding tomorrow," said [KS]. As a precaution, she has been canceling or delaying plans so Angel doesn't come in contact with the deadly virus. "It's not only keeping my horse safe, but it's also making sure that I'm not accidentally spreading something," she said.

The horses still at the farm and quarantined are receiving vaccinations and being closely monitored.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
