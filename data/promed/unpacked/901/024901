Health department tests inconclusive on source of botulism toxin
----------------------------------------------------------------
The source of botulism toxin found in 4 people is unknown, because tests to
determine whether they contracted a potentially fatal paralyzing illness
from being injected with an anti-wrinkle treatment, or got the toxin some
other way, were inconclusive, officials said on Tue 7 Dec 2004.
Investigators suspect that the 4 people, 2 in New Jersey and 2 in South
Florida, may have been injected with botulinum toxin for cosmetic reasons.
All 4 have been hospitalized since the Thanksgiving weekend [27-28 Nov
2004]. Tests conducted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
detected botulism toxin type A in the blood from 3 individuals. Specimens
weren't available for the 4th person.
"We don't know in this incident just yet what the specific cause of their
condition was," Florida Health Secretary John Agwunobi said. Agwunobi noted
that the toxin also causes the type of botulism that comes from eating
contaminated foods, or from having a wound contaminated by botulinum
bacteria. But the toxin is also used in injected cosmetic anti-wrinkle
preparations, and Agwunobi noted that the 4 people involved "had a common
history: all had access to anti-wrinkle injections."
"I don't think that's an insignificant fact," Agwunobi said. Agwunobi also
stated that, while the probe is ongoing, investigators have been unable to
extensively question any of the 4 victims.
The state Department of Health also released a statement saying that
typical botulism toxin doses contained in approved commercial anti-wrinkle
preparations, when appropriately administered, haven't been associated with
illnesses of the severity demonstrated by the 4 people who were hospitalized.
The department also said that, so far, it hasn't received reports of any
additional potential cases that may be linked to the 4 cases, but, that
epidemiologists are monitoring hospitals, labs, and poison control logs in
an effort to determine whether other related cases exist. Officials also
say that there is no indication the poisoning is related to bioterrorism.

[This report confirms that the illness was indeed botulism caused by
neurotoxin A. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the source. -

The moderator's statement about the mouse bioassay [Reversal of the
paralysis by administered botulinum antitoxin confirms the diagnosis. -
Mod.LL] is incorrect [see paragraph 3 in: Botulism, human, botox related -
USA (FL): susp. (03) 20041208.3254].
A better way to say it is: "Prevention of paralysis in mice treated with
type-specific botulinum antitoxin, while untreated mice become paralyzed in
a manner consistent with botulism, provides evidence of botulinum toxin in
the injected specimen. Monovalent [A, B, and E] and trivalent [A-B-E]
antitoxins are available for this purpose, permitting characterization of
the toxin type according to the pattern of survival and paralysis among the
mice.

[Drs Elizabeth Bancroft <ebancroft@ladhs.org> (also from the LA County
Department of Health Services) and SB Werner <bwerner@dhs.ca.gov> (from the
California Department of Health Services) also responded to the
misstatement attributed to me. Indeed, they are all correct, the botulinum
toxin's effect on the transmission of acetylcholine is irreversible. The
use of antitoxin in the mouse bioassay confirms the diagnosis by preventing
the paralysis, not reversing it. My moderation had the word "prevention",
not "reversal" in its original version, which was inadvertently changed
after leaving my laptop and arriving at the ProMED-mail site [mea culpa. -
Mod.SH]. ProMED-mail thanks this trio of Californians for their prompt
responses to the error. - Mod.LL]
