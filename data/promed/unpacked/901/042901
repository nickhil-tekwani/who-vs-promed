Sources in the Government of Castile and Leon autonomous community confirmed Friday, 9 Aug 2013, that the Territorial Health Service of Salamanca found _Salmonella_ in samples of the analysis carried out of the fish that was served at a wedding feast -- and that caused an infection of 83 people who had to receive medical care, of which 25 are still admitted to hospitals.

On the other hand, sources reported that the Health Service conducted cultures in the Hotel Don Gregorio venue, which have so far found no evidence of the existence of the bacterium.

The treatment consisted of a thorough cleaning and the removal of samples for analysis, which, if negative, allow the establishment to continue operating. The fish samples analyzed will be transferred to a laboratory in Majadahonda for a thorough examination to find out the type of _Salmonella_ that has infected the wedding guests.

[Overall, fish are not commonly infected or colonized in their gastrointestinal tracts with salmonellae. Outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with eating raw or undercooked fish have been reported and are usually due to contamination of the caught fish during processing.

Castile and Leon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castile_and_Leon) is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was so constituted in 1983 and it comprises the historical regions of Leon and Old Castile (Spanish: Castilla la Vieja). It is the largest autonomous community in Spain, covering an area of 94 223 square kilometres (36 380 sq miles) with an official population of around 2.5 million (2011). - Mod.LL
