Bird flu suspected in southern Russian region
-----------------------------------------------
A suspected outbreak of bird flu has hit another region in Russia, a
regional Emergency Situation Ministry official said Monday [6 Mar
2006].
The official said that provisional laboratory tests of fowl that died
on 2 Mar 2006 in the southern Astrakhan Region, home to more than a
million people, had found "antibodies [to] both the H5 bird flu
strain and Newcastle disease," which means that "birds were infected
either with one virus or both of them."
Newcastle disease is an acute, highly contagious viral disease found
in birds, especially poultry. The human form of the virus is not
thought to be life-threatening, but symptoms include conjunctivitis.
Local health officials said that measures were being taken to prevent
the disease from spreading from a village about 1000 miles southeast
of Moscow, where the dead birds had been found.
According to the ministry, with the disease now having reached the
heart of Europe, almost 800 000 birds in southern Russia have died of
bird flu or been culled in the last month.
"A total of 768 533 have died or been culled since 3 Feb 2006,
including 16 287 in the last 24 hours," a ministry official said.
"The authorities have been taking measures to address the epidemic."
The Agriculture Ministry said earlier that cases of bird flu had been
registered in 7 regions in the Southern Federal District, a major
stopover area for migrating birds. Areas hit included the republics
of Kabardino-Balkaria, Daghestan, Chechnya, Kalmykia and Adygea, and
the Krasnodar and Stavropol territories.
Over 1.3 million birds have died or been slaughtered in 3 outbreaks
of bird flu since July 2005, the ministry said. The figure includes
more than 416 000 birds that died from the virus.
No human cases of bird flu have yet been reported in Russia.

Austrian Cats Test Positive for Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------
Three cats have tested positive for the deadly strain of bird flu in
Austria's first reported case of the disease spreading to an animal
other than a bird, state authorities said Monday.
The sick cats were among 170 living at an animal shelter where the
disease was detected in chickens last month, authorities said.
In Austria, all the cats from the affected shelter have been moved to
a location where they will remain under observation. The shelter has
been closed, Health Minister Maria Rauch-Kallat told reporters in
Vienna.
"We have decided to put all the cats in quarantine," Rauch-Kallat
said. "Here they will be observed by veterinarians and experts in the
coming days and weeks."
German authorities last month confirmed that a cat on the Baltic Sea
island of Ruegen had succumbed to the deadly virus, which it is
believed to have caught by eating an infected bird.
That would be consistent with a pattern of disease transmission seen
in wild cats in Asia.
German officials have warned pet owners to keep their cats indoors
and dogs on a leash in areas where the disease has been detected
Austria confirmed the nation's first case of H5N1 in a wild bird last
month and has since detected several dozen cases in birds, including
29 in Styria.
According to WHO, several tigers and snow leopards in a zoo and
several house cats were infected with H5N1 during outbreaks in Asia
in 2003 and 2004.

[If the affected cats come from the Graz animal sanctuary
(contaminated by an introduced sick swan), the incident may have less
significance than if the cats come from elsewhere. In the latter
case, cats may have become sentinels of a widely spread infection
among wild birds. The possible epidemiological and public health
implications of H5N1 in domestic cats have been discussed in earlier
postings; subscribers are referred, again, to the paper and the

Poland confirms 1st case of deadly H5N1 virus
-----------------------------------------------
2 dead swans found in northern Poland had the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu, the Polish veterinary institute was quoted as saying by the
PAP news agency on Monday [6 Mar 2006].
"It was the H5N1 strain. It's certain," the institute's Jan
Zmudzinski said. "The test specifically for the H5N1 strain was
positive."
The findings confirm the 1st case of the deadly virus in Poland after
2 swans were found on Sunday [5 Mar 2006] infected with the H5 bird
flu virus on the banks of the Vistula river in the northern city of
Torun.
Preliminary tests for bird flu are routinely conducted in Poland's
veterinary research institute in the city of Pulawy. If the presence
of a bird flu virus is confirmed, special tests for the deadly H5H1
strain are carried out in Britain.
The government confirmed that the samples will now be sent to the
Community Reference Laboratory for avian influenza in Weybridge in
the United Kingdom for further tests to confirm they had the more
deadly H5N1 virus.

[4] Uganda: suspected

The Uganda Media Centre director, Robert Kabushenga, said tests
carried out in Nairobi, Kenya had established that there was no avian
influenza in Uganda. The center, in a statement issued on Saturday [4
Mar 2006], said, "since its formation, the National Task Force has
developed an emergency preparedness and response plan. A surveillance
plan has been put in place to monitor migratory birds and domestic
poultry."
The statement quoted the task force as saying, "in the process of
monitoring, samples were collected from dead wild birds and chickens
on farms experiencing unusual death rates. These were sent to the
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) at KEMRI, Nairobi,
for testing."
"As of 3 Mar 2006 at 6:00 p.m., CDC was unable to confirm the
presence of avian influenza in the samples. Further research is being
undertaken at more specialized laboratories," it said.
It said the main carriers are wild birds, although domestic poultry
suffered most, and the virus is carried mainly in bird excreta. It
said the disease is not easily transmitted to humans.
However, the statement advised the public to limit interaction with
sick birds. It said Ugandan chicken was free of bird flu and posed no
health threat. "It is safe to eat chicken, eggs and other poultry
products," it said.
