IITA Raises Alarm Over New Cassava Disease
-----------------------------
The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) at Ibadan,
Nigeria has alerted farmers to the presence of cassava mosaic disease (CMD)
in the country.
Described as the most devastating cassava virus known, CMD appeared in
Nigeria in the early 1970s, when it almost wiped out cassava production in
Nigeria, and now is back again in a more devastating form. This warning
signal was conveyed to farmers and stakeholders by IITA authorities at an
emergency workshop organised last week at the IITA High Rainfall Station
located at Onne in Rivers State.
According to IITA, if urgent steps are not taken to tackle the new invasive
cassava virus, the country risks losing its entire cassava production to
the rampaging disease. Cassava is seen as the staple food for the entire
southern part of the country.
The new CMD has been identified by IITA scientists as a recombinant between
African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic virus,
which is much more damaging than the old form of the virus in Nigeria.
James Agba, IITA Administration Manager at Onne, warned in his welcome
address at the workshop that the devastating nature of the new CMD is
illustrated by the current grave threat to food security it has created in
Eastern and Central Africa, particularly Uganda.
Agba said that a recent diagnostic survey has shown the presence of ACMV,
EACMV, and its variants on cassava in West Africa, particularly Cameroon,
Ghana, and Togo.

[The following is a summary which includes new information about the status
of the current severe cassava mosaic disease (CMD) in East and Central
Africa. I thank James Legg (<jlegg@infocom.co.ug>), a plant virologist at
IITA-ESARC and NRI, Kampala, Uganda and an expert on CMD, for his
generosity in sending me the information. - Mod.DH]
[The importance of cassava as a key staple food crop in much of sub-Saharan
Africa is attested to in FAO records (2001), which indicate gross
production of 94 million tonnes/ha, more than any other crop on the
continent. Cassava production is essential to the livelihood of more than
200 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. The crop is vital to food
security on the African continent because of its capacity to yield under
marginal soil conditions and its tolerance of drought.
Opportunities for commercial development, however, remain largely
undeveloped, in contrast to the other major cassava production zones in
Asia and South America. In addition to the feeding of the people of the
African continent, it possesses tremendous potential for future
exploitation and as such provides a key to Africa's future development.
Pests and diseases are major constraints to the production of cassava in
Africa, and the most economically important of these is cassava mosaic
disease (CMD). CMD is caused by cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) which
are propagated either through feeding activity of the whitefly vector,
_Bemisia tabaci_ or by planting CMD-diseased cuttings.
Continent-wide losses have been estimated at between 12 and 25 percent of
the total African crop. During the late 1980s, an epidemic of unusually
severe CMD was reported from north-central Uganda, and since then, it has
expanded to cover a wide swathe of the cassava production zone of East and
Central Africa. In view of the wide regional coverage of this disease, and
its devastating impact on cassava production in affected areas, it has
become known as the African CMD pandemic
There are 3 whitefly-transmitted cassava mosaic geminiviruses (CMGs) so far
associated with the current pandemic; African cassava mosaic [ACMV], East
African cassava mosaic [EACMV], and a recombinant between ACMV and EACMV
[Ugandan variant or EACMV-Ug]. The genome of a fourth CMG (South African
cassava mosaic virus) has been recently sequenced. Different CMGs, virus
strains, and mixtures are known to affect symptom severity and ultimately
crop yield. EACMV-Ug is commonly present in mixed infections with ACMV,
causing the severest symptoms.
EACMV-Ug infects cassava crops in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda, as
well as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Republic of Congo
(ROC), and isolated locations in southern Africa. Crop loss estimates in
Africa range from insignificant to 95 percent, with estimated annual losses
in 1997 ranging from 15-24 percent, equivalent to 15-27 million tonnes
based on the total production (86 million tonnes) for 1998.
The whitefly, _Bemisia tabaci_, is the vector of the virus in Africa. It
appears to react synergistically with CMD-infected cassava, reproducing
more rapidly on diseased plants than healthy ones. Moreover, a novel
'invading' population of the vector in Uganda has been reported to be
associated with the epidemic. However, neither this 'invader' nor the
'local' population occurring in pre-epidemic areas appear to be closely
related to the widely distributed, polyphagous, and highly fecund B biotype
of Old World origin.
The pandemic appears to be driven by elevated _B. tabaci_ populations,
which are carried by wind from affected to neighbouring unaffected areas.
_B. tabaci_ adults are known to fly distances of at least 7 km, and given
their generation time of approximately 1 month, it is easy to see how the
pandemic can 'advance' distances of 30-50 km per year, as has been reported
from field surveys.
In attempts to manage the CMD pandemic in Africa, 4 strategies have been
deployed: 1) implementation of strict plant quarantine measures in affected
pandemic regions; 2) rapid multiplication of nuclear stocks of
CMD-resistant germplasm; 3) importation from IITA-Nigeria of tissue culture
plantlets derived from CMD-resistant cultivars; and 4) establishment of
open quarantine facilities to facilitate importation of CMD-resistant
germplasm from Uganda (the base of IITA's cassava germplasm development
activities in East Africa).
Under the quarantine edict in Tanzania, use of CMD-infected cassava stems
for replanting was prohibited, and no infected planting material was
allowed to move from the affected area to any other part of the country.
The accompanying hardship necessitated providing sweet potato vines to
farmers in northern Tanzania in order to provide food security during the
period of time needed to multiply CMD-resistant germplasm.
A 2002 assessment of the status of the African pandemic indicates that it
now straddles the central tropical belt of Africa that corresponds to the
prime cassava production zone. CMD crisis zones, areas from which high
incidences of severe CMD have already been reported, are almost certainly
part of the pandemic and are affected by EACMV-Ug. Threatened areas, those
not yet affected by high incidence of severe CMD but which lie near
pandemic or crisis zones, are in danger of being affected in the next 1-5
years.
High incidences of severe CMD in Central African Republic (CAR) have been
reported by FAO. Information on the status of CMD and virus occurrence is
urgently needed from Gabon, Cameroon, and CAR, which border DRC and ROC to
the north and west. CMD is progressing westward, raising concern that it
may eventually spread to Nigeria, the largest producer of cassava in the
world, contributing about a third of all cassava production in Africa.
Perhaps the greatest challenge posed by the African CMD pandemic is the
apparent westwards expansion into Central and West Africa, where losses
could potentially far exceed the gains currently being made in the East.
This problem is compounded by the insecurity that still characterizes much
of DRC. Rapid mobilization of resources and expertise to address the
problem will be essential, but it is encouraging that IITA and partners are
currently receiving support from USAID and other donor partners to tackle
the pandemic in DRC and ROC. At the same time as studies are conducted to
identify the western 'front' of the pandemic in Cameroon, Gabon, and CAR,
the preemptive deployment of CMD resistant cassava varieties must be
initiated in Nigeria.
Although the threat to African cassava production posed by the pandemic
still remains great, IITA's resistant germplasm offers the solution.
Judging from the tremendous success achieved with its deployment in East
Africa, it seems clear that continued vigilance in monitoring, early
introductions of resistant germplasm, and preemptive multiplication in
threatened zones will ensure that major losses over sustained periods will
be avoided, and that the cassava sector will be revitalized with the
injection of a diversity of new, high-yielding and multiple pest- and
disease- resistant varieties. It is the hope of IITA that given such a
scenario, in the years ahead the African CMD pandemic may ultimately be
judged to have had a positive, rather than a negative, impact on cassava in
Africa and the livelihoods and prosperity of the millions of Africans that
produce and consume the crop.]
