The District Agricultural Office said on Monday [27 Aug 2007] that 5
farms in the west of Malaga province are being investigated in the
face of a possible outbreak of blue tongue [disease].
An outbreak at Casares last Friday [24 Aug 2007] has now been
confirmed by the Provincial Office of the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department of the Junta de Andalucia and all farms in a 20 km (12.5
mi) radius are now being inspected, across the municipalities of
Estepona, Manilva, Casares, and part of Marbella. There are a total
of 800 farms in the zone with some
20 000 animals. [For the location of Casares see map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=36.44414,-5.27234|14|4&loc=ES:36.44414:-5.27234:14t=l&map=36.44414,-5.27234|10|4&loc=ES:36.44414:-5.27234:14>.

The movement of all sheep, goats, and cattle in the area has been
halted. Infected animals are being sacrificed to stop their suffering
and the owners can apply for compensation from the Junta de
Andalucia. The regional government can also help with 70 percent of
the cost of insurance against the disease.
Under EU legislation bluetongue has to be controlled and eradicated.

[From the information above, it is not clear which species is
affected, whether a laboratory investigation has been carried out, or
if the virus was identified.
Spain notified the OIE [World Organization for Animal Health] on 26
Jul 2007 about the detection of a new serotype for the region, BTV-1,
in sheep in southern Andalusia; see ProMED-mail 20070727.2421 and
OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database) interface,
with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5799>.
It is likely, but requires confirmation, that the suspected outbreaks
in Malaga are caused by the same serotype BTV-1, which was identified
in the same area in July [2007]. In pervious years (2004, 2005, and
2006), bluetongue in Spain was caused by BTV-4.
An official notification is anticipated.
