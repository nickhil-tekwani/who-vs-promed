NEWCASTLE DISEASE - SWEDEN & DENMARK
====================================
Previous posting: "Newcastle disease - Sweden archive.951121
In response to the Moderator's request for an update Lotta Ekstrand
has provided this report:
Dear Mr Hugh-Jones,
here are, as requested, some details on the recent outbreak of Newcastle
disease in Scandinavia:
In the end of October/beginning of November 1995, Newcastle disease was
found in 3 or 4 small household flocks of laying hens in different parts of
Denmark. [The Danes reported six outbreaks in the counties of Viborg and
Copenhagen.]
On the 13 of November 1995 Newcastle disease was confirmed in blood samples
from the largest broiler parent stock farm in Sweden, located in the
southernmost region of the country (i.e. in the region closest to Denmark).
[A grandparent breeder operation some 25kms east of Malmo.] The symptoms
had been rather mild; markedly reduced feed consumption and [egg] production
were the only signs noticed. No respiratory or nervous symptoms, no increase
in mortality.
The outbreak was stopped by total stamping out of the hens in all 12 houses
at the site, which meant that 92 850 broiler breeders and 180 000 day old
chickens were culled [and buried on the farm], and 1.3 million eggs were
destroyed.
Several restictions were forced onto poultry handling in the surrounding
area, such as special hygiene measures for trucks delivering feed to poultry
farms, no poultry whatsoever leaving the area (covering roughly 50 by 40
km), no poultry club shows, special arrangements for slaughter and so on.
Transport of poultry was severely resticted in the entire country, and all
shows, exhibitions and competitions were cancelled.
Blood samples for serology and virology were taken from all other units
belonging to the breeding company/hatchery mentioned above, from all broiler
production farms that had recently recieved chickens from this hatchery, and
from all poultry flocks (more than 400 flocks) in the restricted area. Blood
samples were also taken from other kinds of domestic birds, and also from
wild birds shot in the area.
ND was not found in any other flocks than the original ones, and no signs of
illness has been reported from the broiler production farms. High titres for
paramyxovirus 1 (PMV1) were found in two small poultry flocks in the
restricted area. These were destroyed. In about 20 other flocks in the area
low to moderate titres were found, these flocks showed no symptoms and it
has not been possible to isolate virus in the samples from these flocks.
The preliminary evaluation of this outbreak (according to the authorities
responsible, that is the Swedish National Board of Agriculture) is that we
really have two different problems here: a true outbreak of Newcastle
disease at a broiler breeding farm, and a (probably much older) PMV1 problem
in household/back yard flocks on the countryside. This still has to be
further investigated.
The origin of the virus which caused the outbreak in the broiler parent
flocks is still unknown. However, the genetic markers of the isolated virus
matches the PMV1 isolates from Denmark very well, and is also very simalar
to isolates from South Africa. When the outbreak was first confirmed, Norway
immediately banned all imports of poultry from Sweden and Denmark, and has
not reported any signs of ND whatsoever.
The general restrictions has now been lifted off the area, but the
breeding/hatchery farm is still kept under special isolation rules.

The epidemiology of this outbreak is quite interesting, and will probably
keep people here busy for a long time...
Sincerely
Lotta Ekstrand

- This is a classic ND scenario nowadays with background infections in
small backyard flocks with highly vaccinated and protected large commercial
flocks normally unaffected though at risk. The Swedish primary infection
was confirmed by demonstrating ELISA and HI antibodies, and by isolation and
identification of the virus by the Swedish National Veterinary Institute
and by the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, England.
