WASHINGTON: Could an obscure disease afflicting milk cows be making people
sick? Scientists are not sure, but the dairy industry wants the government
to eradicate the cattle illness. At least one in 5 herds [in the United
States is believed to be infected with a livestock disease called Johne's
(pronounced YO-nees). Scientists are studying its possible link to Crohn's
disease, a chronic bowel disease in humans for which there is no known
cause or cure.
The National Milk Producers Federation, which estimates Johne's [disease
costs the dairy industry at least $200 million a year, is asking Congress
for $1.3 billion to identify and destroy infected cattle. "There's such a
tremendous public concern about the potential spread of disease from
livestock to humans. It's obviously something the dairy industry wants to
take seriously," said Franklyn Garry, a Johne's [disease expert at
Colorado State University.
"Even if this is, as we suspect, not a human health concern, it still is a
concern for cattle farmers," said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the milk
producers. Crohn's disease afflicts more than 500 000 people in the United
States, many under 30 [years of age, and causes such severe inflammation
that [some patients [must have sections of their intestines removed. Its
link with Johne's is hotly debated. The bacterium _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_, which causes Johne's [disease, is found in many -- but
not all -- patients with Crohn's disease. The diseases have similar
symptoms: diarrhea and weight loss.
A popular theory about Crohn's is [that it is triggered by the immune
system's reaction to a virus or bacterium. "Because of continued potential
public health concerns relating to this disease, animal production
industries must give this disease more attention," the United States
Department of Agriculture said in a 1999 report. The Crohn's disease
connection is a delicate one for dairy producers: they cannot afford to
ignore it, but they do not want to scare the public, said Garry.
An Agriculture Department study in 1996 found 22 per cent of US herds had
at least 10 per cent of their cattle infected with Johne's disease. The
lower milk production resulting from the disease costs a 100-cow farm about
$18 000 a year. The milk federation wants the government to pay for testing
herds and to reimburse farmers for the loss of sick cattle. To avoid
affecting beef prices or raising public health concerns, infected animals
would be slaughtered and sent to rendering plants for non-food uses. About
334 000 cattle (about 3.6 per cent of the nation's milk cows) would be
destroyed under the 7-year program.

[The link between _M. paratuberculosis_ and Crohn's disease is tenuous at
best. This concern is likely to result in policy changes that affect both
animals and people. - Mod.TG
