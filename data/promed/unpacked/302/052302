On 4 Jan 2011, an Arctic fox (_Vulpes lagopus_) attacked a group of 4
dogs on the small island of Hopen located in the southeastern part of
the Svalbard archipelago, Norway, in the Arctic.

During the attack, 2 dogs were bitten before they killed the fox. The
staff suspected that the animal might be infected with rabies virus
because of its aggressive behaviour. No staff had been bitten by the
fox; however, 3 had handled the dead body.

The fox was a thin, young adult male. Its eyes lay deep in the orbit,
and the nictitating membranes showed pronounced protrusion. The
stomach contained small amounts of seaweed and white hairs. The fox
carcass was sent to the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) in Oslo,
which is the reference laboratory for animal rabies in Norway. Seven
samples from different parts of the brain were analysed by direct
fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). All samples were positive for rabies virus. A
571 base pair fragment of the viral nucleoprotein (N) gene was
sequenced: a BLAST search against the GenBank database showed 99
percent identity with rabies virus isolates from the Arctic.

The staff had not previously been vaccinated against rabies so were
given post-exposure prophylaxis. The dogs had already been vaccinated
against rabies at annual intervals and so were given an additional
inactivated rabies vaccine. This vaccination follows the protocol of
the CDC and WHO
<http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/acip_recommendations.html>,
<http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8532.pdf>.

Rabies is regarded as an endemic disease throughout most parts of the
Arctic, and several epidemics have been reported during the last 40-50
years in arctic Canada, Russia and Greenland. The Arctic fox is the
main host of the virus, and the same arctic virus variant seems to
infect the Arctic fox throughout the area it inhabits. How rabies is
maintained in the fox population remains largely unknown. On Svalbard,
rabies was diagnosed for the 1st time in 1980 during an outbreak in
the Arctic fox population. In 1980 to 1999, a total of 25 animals were
diagnosed with rabies on the islands, including 3 reindeer (_Rangifer
tarandus platyrhynchus_) and one ringed seal (_Pusa hispida_). No
further cases had been reported until the present case. Mainland
Norway remains rabies free.

[This report highlights that even in the sparse arctic environment,
one needs to be aware of the importance of dog vaccination for rabies,
being alert to possible exposure and seeking immediate diagnosis and
treatment, as rabies can infect a wide range of mammals in the arctic
including fox, reindeer, and seals.

The Svalbard is a group of islands midway between mainland Norway and
the North Pole. It is a breeding ground for many seabirds, and also
polar bears, reindeer and marine mammals. The human population is less
than 3000, mainly involved in coal mining, tourism and research.
Further information on Svalbard can be found at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svalbard#Population>.

For a concise review on arctic rabies, readers are encouraged to read
<http://www.actavetscand.com/content/45/1/1>, which is excerpted
below:

"The folklore of the Canadian Inuit indicates that these people knew
of a rabies-like disease that was transmitted from arctic foxes to
dogs and people, and in Greenland epidemics among sledge dogs have
been described for almost 150 years. Mainland Norway and Sweden have
both been regarded as rabies free countries during the last 150 years.
How rabies virus is maintained in the arctic fox population through
periods with low population densities remains unknown. Long incubation
periods, prolonged periods of virus excretion and oral infection
through frozen carcasses where the virus may be preserved for longer
periods of time, are mentioned by several authors as possible
explanations.

The control of rabies in wildlife is mainly through oral bait
vaccination. The vaccine is distributed inside a capsule, which is
punctured when the animal eats the bait. The vaccine will then be
released in the oral cavity and absorbed through buccal mucosae. In
frozen conditions, the vaccine will 1st thaw in the stomach, where
previous experimental work has shown absorption to be limited and
subsequent immune response to be rare. The amount of infective virus
in the bait will also be reduced or eliminated after repeatedly
freezing and thawing.

After the onset of dog vaccination, rabies has remained mainly as a
disease of the arctic fox in these regions. There are several examples
of southward spread of rabies virus from arctic regions, and arctic
rabies represents a permanent potential source of infection of
sub-arctic areas."
