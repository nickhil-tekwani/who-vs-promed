The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is investigating a single
case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad
cow disease, in a cow from an Alberta farm. This case of one cow was
detected as part of Canada's ongoing BSE surveillance program. BSE
is a progressive, fatal disease of the nervous system of cattle. It
is what is known as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE).
Other TSEs include scrapie in sheep, chronic wasting disease in deer
and elk, and Creutzfelt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. Latest
Information (as of 4 Jun 2003 - 15:45 EDST) The following is a brief
review of what we have done, and an overview of the testing that is
ongoing.
As you know, a total of 18 premises were placed under quarantine. They involve:
- the original Alberta case farm and one farm where the infected cow
co-mingled in a pasture;
- a total of 10 farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan as part of our
trace-back investigations of where the infected cow had come from;
these farms are divided between a "primary" and a "secondary" line of
inquiry;
- 3 Alberta farms in our trace-forward investigations of where the
cow's offspring went to; and
- 3 locations in British Columbia that received feed derived from the
rendered BSE-infected cow, and had ruminants on the premises.
We completed the sampling and testing on the 3 Alberta trace-forward
farms. The tests came back negative, and we lifted the quarantine on
these premises, which left 15 locations under active investigation.
We have received complete test results from the case farm and the
co-mingle farm in Alberta, and from both of the Saskatchewan farms.
These have come back negative.
Today we would like to report that we have completed the rapid tests
for one of the Alberta farms in the primary line of inquiry and for
the 3 quarantine locations in British Columbia, and they have come
back negative.
Yesterday over 260 head of cattle (the extended trace-outs from the
primary line of inquiry) were depopulated, bringing the total to date
to over 1500. In keeping with the thoroughness of the investigation,
young calves regrettably had to be slaughtered to ensure they did not
enter the food chain in the future. They will not be tested, as they
are too young to have developed the disease. These are difficult but
necessary decisions. We empathize with the farmers and their families
involved in these trying circumstances.
Earlier today, the first shipment of some 240 cattle from 3 of the 5
farms on our secondary line of inquiry arrived at the abattoir. Their
samples will be airlifted to our laboratories this evening. We are
awaiting test results from approximately 500 animals from 2 farms in
Alberta as part of our trace-back and trace-out investigations in the
first line of inquiry.
As part of the CFIA's comprehensive trace-out investigation, we have
identified movement of 5 bulls to a farm in the US. This is not an
unusual occurrence, as movement of cattle between the 2 countries has
been common over the years. Representatives from the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service and the Food and Drug Administration made a
brief statement following the CFIA's opening statements.
More information regarding charts and graphs of the progression of
the investigation can be found at the CFIA's web site.
