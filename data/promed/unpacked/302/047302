Three Hungarians have been quarantined after becoming infected with
an untreatable [see comment below] strain of tuberculosis, index.hu
reports. However, the situation is yet to develop into an epidemic.
The WHO and the Red Cross say a serious epidemic is threatening
Europe as a drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis is spreading on the
continent. According to the organizations, there have not been this
many untreatable cases of the illness since the World War II.
In related news, Hungary will not be able to buy new machines for its
lung screening stations, because it has not been successful in
winning a Norwegian tender for development of this area. The average
age of equipment used at Hungary's 160 lung screening stations is 15
to 20 years.

[It is likely that what the posting refers to as 'untreatable' refers
to multidrug resistant (MDR) or extremely drug resistant (XDR)
strains of tuberculosis. These strains, while resistant to the
1st-line group of antituberculosis medications, are treatable --
although with more difficulty -- with less effective and more toxic
medications. - Mod.LL]
