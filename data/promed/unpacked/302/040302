Mefloquine-resistant falciparum malaria from Tanzania
----------------------------------------------------
One month ago, this patient who was seen at our outpatient clinic: F,
44y, travelled to Tanzania for 3 weeks (tourism). Fever, headache,
malaise, myalgia started 3 weeks after return and the patient was treated
with treatment with doxycycline through family doctor has no effect.
The patient was diagnosed with _P. falciparum_ malaria with a very
low parasitaemia (only very few trophozoites in thick film). The patient
was treated with Riamet, and showed a good response.
Analysis of blood concentrations of mefloquine at time of admission
showed 1400 ng/ml (B. Betschart, Switzerland) 2 days after the last
intake of mefloquine. This level is consistent with protective blood
concentrations. Thus, our patient managed to acquire a truly
mefloquine-resistant Pf strain.

[Reports of _P.falciparum_ resistant to mefloquine are rare from
Africa. This case is well documented, and there is little doubt that the
patient had a truly mefloquin-resistant _P.falciparum_ infection.
However, mefloquine should still be regarded as an efficient anti-
malaria drug until further data become available, but patients must be
warned that symptoms -- despite treatment or prophylaxis with
mefloquine -- should be regarded as malaria. - Mod.EP
