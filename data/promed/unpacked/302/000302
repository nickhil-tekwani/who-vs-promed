Since 2 Oct 2005, no new cases of FRI (febrile respiratory illness) have been
identified in connection with a respiratory outbreak in a Toronto nursing
home. A FRI case is defined as a resident, staff member or visitor with sudden
onset of fever with malaise and/or anorexia, with or without runny nose and
congestion or cough.
In total, 93 cases, including 16 deaths, have been identified to-date. The
case breakdown is as follows: 70 residents, 16 staff and 7 visitors. All
deaths have occurred in residents of the nursing home. Cases are rapidly
improving upon initiation of antibiotic therapy.
Autopsy specimens were received from 7 patients through the coroner's office
and tested by the Central Public Health Laboratory in Toronto. All were
tested for _Legionella pneumophila_ by DFA and culture. To-date specimens from
3 deceased patients are positive for _L. pneumophila_. Culture results on the
other 4 deceased patients are pending.
While the media continues to give this outbreak substantial coverage, at this
point the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) is
considering the outbreak under control. The province of Ontario has ongoing
surveillance of FRI in place in hospitals and residential institutions. All
indications suggest that this outbreak is waning and there is no heightened
risk to the general population. In response to the identification of
Legionella bacteria in several cases, all staff and residents will be given
antibiotic therapy.
As a result of this ongoing surveillance, outbreaks are regularly detected,
especially during the influenza/respiratory season, which we are now entering
in Canada. The 1st outbreak of laboratory-confirmed influenza for the 2005-
2006 season was reported in a long-term care facility (LTCF) elsewhere in the
country last week, and other common respiratory viruses are circulating as
well. (see Canada's weekly FluWatch surveillance report at:ï¿½
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fluwatch/index.html> )
In terms of the larger picture with respect to the respiratory [illness]
season in Canada, we are likely to see many reports of respiratory outbreaks
in nursing homes and other institutions. As is often the case, a proportion
of these outbreaks may not have any identifiable etiologic agent. Using
increasingly sophisticated molecular testing techniques, laboratory scientists
are able to detect and identify previously unrecognizable pathogens, e.g. new
coronaviruses and parvoviruses etc. As a result, appropriate risk assessment
is an important accompaniment to these reports, especially given the current
wide media coverage of respiratory illnesses/outbreaks.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Squires and the Public Health Agency of
Canada for sending this update on the outbreak in Toronto. The last paragraph
is a very accurate and astute assessment of the situation most departments of
health in the northern hemisphere are facing at this time of year and moving
forward.
With the current concerns regarding when and where the next influenza pandemic
will arise (and in the shadow of the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003), and on
public health preparedness to both identify the onset of the pandemic early as
well as to develop and implement control measures rapidly, there is a
heightened focus of the media on coverage of outbreaks of febrile respiratory
illness. This current outbreak came to the attention of the media because it
was "different" from the majority of febrile respiratory illness outbreaks in
long-term care facilities, and in fact, the etiologic agent turned out to be
_Legionella pneumophila_.
We now await further information on the source of the infection. Outbreaks
have been associated with cooling towers, whirlpools, spas, showers, and other
sources of aerosolized warm water. - Mod.MPP]
