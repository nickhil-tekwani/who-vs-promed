Lassa fever in UNAMSILLL peacekeeping force in Daru
----------------------------------------------------
There has been another probable case of Lassa fever in Freetown, unrelated
to the four cases (and four deaths) reported earlier. A 21 year old male
member of the Indian contingent of UNAMSIL peacekeeping forces stationed in
Daru, Kailahun District presented with fever on about 10 July 2000. He was
treated presumptively for malaria. Subsequently malaria and typhoid were
ruled out by laboratory tests. He was acutely ill, with temperatures up to
41 C. Lassa fever was suspected, and he was transported to the UNAMSIL
referral hospital in Freetown, where he has been maintained in strict
isolation, with careful precautions in handling of blood and body fluids. He
developed phayrngitis, facial and pharyngeal edema and erythema, and
bleeding and ecchymoses at venipuncture sites. He was started on IV
ribavirin. On Day 3 of treatment, his temperature has come down and he is
objectively and subjectively much improved. He continues to have
albuminuria, but no evidence of renal, hepatic or pulmonary failure.
Prothrombin times remain moderately elevated.This patient was very well
managed by the UNAMSIL medical services in Daru and Freetown.All contacts
are being followed with temperatures recorded twice daily. UNAMSIL's
preventive medicine officer is traveling to Daru to assess conditions at the
UNAMSIL camp, including food security and rodent control.Some conclusions
can be drawn. We have now had a third introduction of Lassa fever into urban
Freetown. (The first was the DFID worker who later died in London). This is
the first case involving UN peacekeeping forces, many of whom are living in
tents, in Lassa fever endemic areas, among rural Lassa fever virus-carrying
rodents. We have no laboratory capacity to confirm the diagnosis, and have
done no definitive investigation. (E.g.: What is the intensity of exposure
for UNAMSIL forces? Have there been other sub-clinical/ undiagnosed cases?
Are there other more aggressive measures we should be taking, both for
outsiders and for the resident population?)

I would appreciate information and advice on the following:(1)How/where can
I get some laboratory confirmation for suspect cases? (2)What are the
options for sending possibly Lassa fever virus-infected laboratory specimens
out of the country? (3)Is the lab in Guinea operating? (4)Has the time come
to mount a full epidemiological investigation of this problem?
