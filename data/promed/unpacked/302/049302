Florida's Poison Control Centers urge people to go to the emergency room if they experience bleeding after using synthetic marijuana, or "spice."

Nearly 40 people in the Tampa Bay area in Florida have developed severe bleeding after using synthetic marijuana, or "spice," they bought from dealers in the region.

Spice -- also known as K2, among many other names -- contains herbs, such as bay bean, having been sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids intended to mimic the effects of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, when smoked, according to Florida's Poison Control Centers. Most of the common active ingredients used in synthetic marijuana are illegal to buy, sell or possess in the United States, per the Poison Control website.

In Hillsborough County, Florida, cases of severe bleeding linked to spice use began cropping up in early December [2021], according to a [6 Dec 2021] Facebook post shared by Florida's Poison Information Centers. The most recent cases were reported Monday [13 Dec 2021], and tests indicated some of the spice was contaminated with a rodenticide, or a chemical used to kill rats and mice, 10 Tampa Bay reported.

[Many rodenticides are anticoagulants, meaning the blood does not clot. Consequently, severe bleeding can occur and without prompt treatment can result in death.

We are not told in this article which rodenticide was involved, but from a case in Illinois we know some of the rodenticides.

Extracted from ProMED post Drug abuse - USA (03): (IL) synthetic cannabinoids, bleeding disorder 20180411.5740877:
The rodenticide identified in Illinois is brodifacoum, a long acting vitamin K (clotting factor) antagonist anticoagulant, which is lethal. It is a coumarinderivative, specifically a 4-hydroxycoumarin. It is a very widely used anticoagulant rodenticide. The good news is brodifacoum can be treated with vitamin K and blood transfusions if caught early enough. However, there are rodenticides on the market today for which there is no treatment.

Brodifacoum is lethal, and if you have any signs of bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to a hospital. Notify them you may have been exposed to a rodenticide through synthetic marijuana.
