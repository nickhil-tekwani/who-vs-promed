This is an update of the encephalitis situation in Nepal.
Total reporting Units: 8 (zonal hospitals that report immediately and
weekly to the Vector-Borne Disease Research and Training Center (VBDRTC) in
Hetauda, Makwanpur. VBDRTC acts as focal point for the EWARS [Early Warning
Reporting System] in Nepal. Please note that the following information
represents only those cases being attended at the sentinel hospitals.
Cases of encephalitis in Nepal are reported all year long; although, there
are no laboratory means to establish etiology. Diagnosis is made on clinical
grounds. Every year, between June - October, an increase in the number of
cases of encephalitis is observed, and based on studies conducted in the
country, it is assumed that many of them are due to Japanese Encephalitis
(JE) virus.
This year, starting from epidemiological week No. 28 (approx. second week of
July '97) we observed an increasing trend in the number of encephalitis cases
reported through the EWARS. The number of cases by week is summarized below:
15 = 6 25 = 2
16= 5 26 = 6
17 = 6 27 = 4
18 = 7 28 = 10
19 = 3 29 = 10
20 = 6 30 = 12
21 = 7 31 = 28
22 = 4 32 = 42
23 = 8 33 = 51
24 = 5
A total number of 223 [222] cases reported plus 24 deaths [case-fatality rate
9.7%]
Of the total number of cases, Bankey district accounts for the highest
number of cases (38), followed by Bardiya with 16, Jhapa 15, Chitwan
4, Rupandehi 10, Kailali, Nawalparasi and Morang with 8 each, Surkhet and
Dang with 3 cases each, Kanchanpur, Makwanpur, Gorkha, Saptari and Tanahu
with 2 cases each, and Mahotari, Sindhuli, Siraha, Sunsari and Dhanusha with
1 case each; 3 cases from neighboring States of India have been also
detected. In total, 20 districts or 22% of all the districts of Nepal (75).
Of the total number of cases (cases and deaths) of 247 to date, information
regarding 139 cases; 62% are male and 38% female; 4 cases (3%) are under one
year of age, 24 (17%) on the age group 1-4; 57 cases (41%) are aged 5-14
years, 42 (30%) in the age of 15-44, 9 (6%) aged 45-60 years and 3 (2%) 60
years or more.
Is to be noted that of the total 139 cases with complete information, 94
(68%) have been reported since epidemiological week No. 28.

[Thanks to Dr. Luna for providing these details. It would be useful to have
a definitive answer regarding the question of etiology. Were these all shown
to be due to JE virus, the need for a JE vaccine in Nepal could be shown more
clearly. -- Mod CHC]
