The following moderator information was posted with regard to
Pseudorabies, after a brief literature review. However, it has come to
the attention of this moderator that there may be conflicting and/or
possibly inaccurate publications in the literature. As it is not the
desire of any moderator, or of ProMED-mail, to post inaccurate
information, the following is included as a review, and Dr. Sundberg's
information follows.
Both sets of information have merit, especially from a historical
point of view, and history, however recent, may have recorded more
than one source of the derivation of the name. I am grateful to Dr.
Sundberg for his information and for keeping us all on our toes.

[Pseudorabies is also known as Aujeszky's disease, Mad itch, and
Infectious bulbar paralysis. It is an acute viral infection of the
central nervous system of nearly all subhuman mammals, although it is
primarily associated with swine. The virus affects the central nervous
system and can cause a variety of clinical signs, including
convulsions and persistent pruritus (itching). This has resulted in
the pigs appearing to "go mad" in attempts to relieve the intense
itching. Consequently the common name of the virus is Mad itch.
Animals with rabies have been said to be "mad", thus, this virus
became known as Pseudo or false rabies based upon the activity of the
affected animals. The disease in species other than swine is almost
invariably fatal and is often marked by the same intense pruritis. The
virus has been found in several species of non-human primates. Human
infection is possible, but the records before 1970 are unclear -

With regard to pseudorabies, itching is not described as part of the
clinical syndrome in pigs [as we now know it - Mod.TG. Itching was
primarily attributed to the practice of pigs and cattle being penned
together either in the feedlot or out in the corn field, as the cattle
were used to scavenge waste corn out of the field. As the cattle would
lay down pigs would be known to come up behind them and bite them on
the vulva. If the pig was shedding pseudorabies virus (PRV) in the
saliva, the virus would enter the vulvar wound. The irritation in the
nerves of the region would be the cause of the intense itching and
hence the term "mad itch." It would indeed be very intense and
pictures/accounts of the self-mutilation because of the pruritis are
remarkable. This is very uncommon now with the segregated rearing of
cattle and pigs. It is also possible possible to have *mad itch* on
another area of the animal, depending on the area of the bite. The
point is that the localized nervous inflammation from the infection is
the cause of the pruritis.
The reason PRV is "pseudo" rabies is not dementia from "mad itch." It
is the clinical presentation of young pigs -- trembling, clonic/tonic
convulsions, some salivation may be noted because of the CNS
disturbance, and death. Very early on in the US this was described as
being similar to rabies, hence "pseudorabies". In Europe, where the
disease is older and was better described and recognized, it is known
as Aujezsky's Disease, although the term "pseudorabies" has now
slipped into their vocabulary also.
Humans apparently do not have the molecular receptor for PRV --
including [in the respiratory and gastro-intestinal epithelium. We
are not naturally infected, although it is possible that people could
have antibodies if the virus were introduced through a wound, etc.
While it is possible to be exposed, we are not at risk of infection.
The most common clinical presentation for animals other than pigs is
unexplained death, although it is possible to see a bovine in
respiratory distress because of viral (PRV caused) pneumonia. In these
cases the differential diagnosis would include PRV and rabies,
treatment will be unsuccessful, and the only way to get a definitive
answer is via post mortem and histology. Histological lesions for each
infection are pathognomonic.
