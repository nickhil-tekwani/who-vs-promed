Nosocomial outbreak of hepatitis C in Gdansk
--------------------------------------------
A local outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection has occurred in Gdansk, Poland. The outbreak has been linked to a private medical clinic performing radiological imaging. In the middle of January 2013, 3 patients were hospitalized in the Regional Hospital of Infectious Diseases with the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C.

It was revealed that all 3 had undergone CT scans with contrast administration on 5 Nov 2012, all in the same private medical imaging facility.

The case was referred to the State Sanitary Inspection for epidemiological investigation. Altogether, out of 25 patients who had undergone contrast CT scan on 15 Nov [2012] in the aforementioned center, 9 have been diagnosed with hepatitis C virus infection. The medical imaging center is suspected of re-using contrast injector syringes on multiple patients.

The outbreak is currently being investigated by the local Prosecutor's Office.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gajewski for providing this information. An unwelcome outcome for 9 of the 25 people who received radiological scanning in a private clinic in Gdansk.

However, hepatitis C does not always require treatment. Depending on the virus genome therapy with interferon and ribavirin may be successful in most cases. New therapeutic agents, such as telaprevir and boceprevir, have become available for treatment of hepatitis caused by some genotypes of hepatitis c virus. Hopefully appropriate treatment will be made available for these patients. - Mod.CP
