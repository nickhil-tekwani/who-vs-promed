South Korea's worst ever foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic has
grown into a social and economic disaster, especially with the Lunar
New Year holiday approaching, as the disease has dealt a heavy blow to
meat prices and supplies. The outbreak, the 5th in South Korea since
2000 and by far the most severe, was 1st confirmed on 29 Nov 2010 in
Andong, North Gyeongsang province, and has spread to 8 cities and
provinces so far.

The total number of animals, mainly pigs and cattle, that have been
put down due to the highly contagious animal disease and efforts to
contain its spread seems to be several million and growing. The
disease is also estimated to have caused more than 1.7 trillion won
[USD 1.5 billion] in damage, including direct expenses and
compensation to farmers, according to the Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

The country's largest cull in history is a cause of grave concern
because the meat shortage, which adds to heavy inflation on food
prices, could mean a major setback for President Lee Myung-bak's vow
to limit inflation below 3 percent.

Wholesale pork prices reached a record high of 7137 won (about 6.4 US
dollars) per kilogram as of 27 Jan 2011, and the average price of pork
between 1 Jan and 27 Jan 2011 stood at about 5644 won per kilogram, up
53 percent from the last month's [December 2010] average, according to
the Korea Institute for Animal Products Quality Evaluation.

As rising meat prices coincide with the preparations for the Lunar New
Year, when meat is an essential component of the ancestral rites
table, many South Koreans are viewing next week's holiday with great
alarm owing to the unparalleled rise in the cost of living. "It's hard
to purchase meat to prepare for ancestral rites on Lunar New Year's
day because of FMD, and prices of fish products also have generally
risen. I'm worried because more than 1/3rd of goods are more expensive
than last year [2010]. It's really hard," Tae Jung-hee, 53, who was
shopping in Namdaemun market in central Seoul, said.

There is also serious concern for the future of the country's
livestock industry, with exports likely to suffer long-term declines
[see commentary]. In a desperate attempt to curtail the spread of FMD,
the government had initiated a vaccination campaign targeting only
cattle on 25 Dec 2010 at the cost of losing its FMD-free status and
thereby risked a longer export ban by overseas buyers [see
commentary]. As its efforts turned out to be inadequate, the
government decided to vaccinate all livestock in the country.

In Anseong, a city 100 km south of Seoul in the southern part of
Gyeonggi province, approximately 60 percent of the city's swine and
2.5 percent of cattle have been culled so far, according to Kim
Jong-su, director of livestock at Anseong City Hall.

The city confirmed its 1st case of FMD on 6 Jan 2011. Kim said a cold
snap, in which temperatures have been below freezing for the past few
weeks, contributed difficulties to combating the spread because hoses
and pumps for spraying disinfectant have been frozen. The city has set
up 34 quarantine guard posts on the roadside to disinfect passing
vehicles.

Anseong Mayor Hwang Eun-sung said the most important thing right now
is to figure out the exact cause of FMD. "We can deal with the result
once we know the cause. It is still vaguely believed that FMD spreads
through cars or people, and if we don't draw up decisive measures
based on the exact cause any time soon, the situation is expected to
be more difficult," Hwang said.

The disease has devastated the livelihoods of the country's livestock
breeders. Many livestock buildings are now empty as the government has
embarked on the major cull. Lee Kye-chan, 82, said his son's cattle as
well as those of his neighbors had been lost to FMD and that they are
distraught at losing their animals. "He is devastated. There are 70
cattle left, and he can't be at ease," Lee said.

FMD, while highly infectious among cattle, sheep, pigs and other
cloven hoofed animals, does not affect humans. South Korea was hit by
the disease in 2000, 2002 and twice early last year [2010].

Korea's imports of beef and pork have jumped this month [January 2011]
amid a massive slaughter of cattle and pigs caused by the spreading
FMD, the Korea Customs Service said yesterday [Fri 28 Jan 2011].

Korea imported 24 513 tons of beef during the 1st 21 days of this
month [January 2011], up 22.7 percent from the same period a month
earlier. Pork imports also jumped 31.1 percent to 26 625 tons.

Prices per-kilogram of beef and pork also jumped 25.1 percent and 16.7
percent this month [January 2011] compared with the same period a year
ago.

Korea has culled around 2.6 million livestock since the outbreak of
the highly contagious disease in late November [2010]. The disease has
spread almost across the entire nation now despite the government's
stepped-up quarantine efforts.

Prices of pork and other meats soared in the domestic market, making
it more expensive for people to prepare meals for family gatherings
during the Lunar New Year holiday early next week.

As part of stabilizing meat prices, the finance ministry said Tuesday
[25 Jan 2011] that it will cut import tariffs on 60 000 tons of pork
from the current 25 percent to zero until the end of June 2011. Pork
is cheaper than beef and popular especially among working-class people.

The move is in line with ongoing government anti-inflation efforts and
is also aimed at easing price hikes amid worries that demand for the
meat is expected to spike ahead of the upcoming holiday.

In an earlier meeting to discuss anti-inflation measures, Vice Finance
Minister Yim Jong-yong said that the government will take "every
possible measure" to stabilize soaring pork prices as part of efforts
to ease the suffering of working-class people.

"We take the supply shortage of pork caused by FMD seriously," Yim
said at the meeting with other policymakers. "We will respond actively
[with market situations] by pursuing every possible measure, including
expanding the tariff quota [on pork]."

He added that the government will work hard to stabilize prices of key
agricultural and fishery goods.

Canada will ship more pork to South Korea due to an outbreak of FMD
that has ravaged South Korea's pig herds, Agriculture Minister Gerry
Ritz said on Friday [28 Jan 2011].

South Korea's government said it may raise a quota for tariff-free
pork imports to help boost local supplies.

Pork prices spiked to record levels in Asia's 4th-largest economy
after it culled nearly 30 percent of its hog population to stop the
spread of the disease among livestock.

[Since the start of the FMD epizootic in South Korea, there have been
repeated statements explaining the application of the disease-control
policy "no vaccination, stamping out with culling of contiguous
animals" by the need to prevent damage to the country's exports of
animals and their products in case S. Korea's status of "FMD-free
without vaccination" is lost.

We have attempted to obtain data on S. Korea's exports in recent
years, during which Korea maintained the status of an "FMD-free
without vaccination" country. With the kind assistance of a subscriber
to whom we are very grateful, the following (most recent available)
information, pertaining to 2008 and 2009, has been obtained.

1. Live animals (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs): export negligible or nil
during both 2008 and 2009.

2. Pork: 2008 - total export (to 22 countries) of 10 405 325 kg for
the value of USD 17 716 376. The main buyers were Russia, Philippines,
Thailand and China (respectively USD 9 197 402, 4 919 435, 1 792 165
and 1 279 380 each).

2009 - total export (to 20 countries) of 12 513 335.5 kg for the value
of USD 11 624 578. The main buyers were Philippines (USD 6 869 109)
and Thailand (USD 3 163 573).

3. Beef: 2008 - total export of 254 961.9 kg for the value of USD 748 809.

2009 - total export of 2 526 305.9 kg for the value of USD 7 969 287.
The main buyers were China (4 417 838), Viet Nam (USD 1 734 752) and
USA (USD 1 054 040).

S. Korea has traditionally been predominantly an importer, not
exporter of animals and their products. - Mod.AS]
