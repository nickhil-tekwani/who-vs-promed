There have been several articles recently, which included questions about rabies vaccination of pets, and the timing of the disease manifestations in dogs and cats.

States laws vary as to the age for the 1st rabies vaccination in dogs and cats, from 12 to 16 weeks of age -- when most dogs and cats will have lost any passive maternal immunity which would prevent the vaccination from immunizing, but young enough they are unlikely to be "out and about" and exposed. If a pup or kitten's "mother" had never been vaccinated, they would be susceptible to rabies at birth, and immunizable by 6-8 weeks.

The reason the 1st rabies vaccination in an adolescent animal is not considered as immunizing for 28 days, is 2-fold: (1) the time it takes this one, killed, highly adjuvanted vaccination to elicit maximum response; and (2) "PEP" [post-exposure prophylaxis]: if the vaccine is given to an exposed animal, one incubating the virus, as long as this virus, which migrates up nerves to the brain, is still 28 days away from the brain, the vaccine will prevent disease. This is the basis for any program of vaccinating in the face of exposure; this is the basis of rabies PEP in humans -- and it works very well in most cases.

What is completely nonsensical and unjustifiable is all states accepting this on one hand, while some states continue to withhold an initial or booster vaccination of (non-adolescent) exposed dogs and cats, and most states require quarantines longer (much longer) than 1 month for dogs and cats properly vaccinated, (much less ) previously vaccinated but overdue for boosters, (or even) the never vaccinated. We assume and accept that a vaccination will prevent any unknown rabies exposures weeks or months before, if a pet is alive more than 28 days after vaccination. But we don't trust that same vaccination when given to a pet which was not even bitten but just in proximity to a rabid animal.

The moderator questioned how a Human Society could have protected the adopters. If the kitten was under 12 (many states) to 16 weeks old (a few states) the adopted kitten was too young for a rabies vaccination.* To eliminate the possibility of exposing humans to rabies, the kitten would have had to have been held until it was 12-16 weeks of age, vaccinated, and held another month -- which is obviously totally impractical. [Reread the report. This 'kitten' was 6 months old. - Mod.MHJ] That the adopters took the kitten to a veterinarian, does not necessarily mean their other pets were properly vaccinated -- they could have had a fee examination certificate.

That state laws vary so widely is emblematic of the stupidity of most states rules and regulations. A recent article proving the rapidity and level of anamnestic response to booster rabies vaccination, and a civil case winding through the Massachusetts courts should worry Colorado, as their rules are similar to those in Massachusetts. That is, both are quite strict, and are scientifically, and immunologically unsupportable. In Colorado animals that have 2 or more documented rabies vaccinations and are legally "current" are boostered, and confined and watched at home for 45 days. Those which have had 2 or more documented rabies shots but are not current are vaccinated immediately after exposure, placed under a 90 day home quarantine, and re-vaccinated in 30 more days. But euthanasia is encouraged for all "high risk pets" -- those never vaccinated, or only having had one vaccination less than 28 days or more than 1 year before -- or (in addition to several vaccinations) required to have the pet quarantined at a secured facility for 90 days, to be followed by 90 days of home confinement. Long term quarantines are a death sentence for most pets. The costs alone are unfeasible for most owners, even if the owner considers it acceptable for shy, elderly, or ill pets.

Often glossed over, although all mammals can contract and die from rabies, is that susceptibilities vary widely and not all species can effectively pass on every -- or possibly any -- strain of rabies virus. Species which have their own strain of rabies pass that strain within their species the most effectively; in fact there is some evidence that species only both contract, and before they die, pass on only their own viral strain. This makes cows, horse, rodents, cats, humans, all dead end hosts. Certainly tests will never be done on humans, but hopefully research on viral strains may elucidate this, because while tens of thousands of people die of rabies where canine strain rabies is prevalent, due to the lack of a few hundred dollars worth of PEP for proactive control programs, the US spends from 10 million to 100 million dollars per potential life saved, because PEP is recommended and given if there is a negligible probability the 'exposed' person would get rabies.

* "too young". A rabies vaccination can be given before 12 weeks-16 weeks but it wouldn't be recognized as a 1st vaccination. I've given a few young dogs being transported to Africa (after checking with the vaccine manufacturer) 2 rabies vaccinations at 8 and 12 weeks, to better protect them.

The advice you provided regarding animals exposed to rabies ("Secondly, vaccinating and holding them in quarantine at their veterinary clinic for 3 weeks would be adequate, and, if necessary, they could have been revaccinated before being released.") is in conflict with the Rabies Compendium (http://www.nasphv.org/Documents/RabiesCompendium.pdf).

Regardless of vaccination status, exposed animals are required to be isolated for some period. I don't know if Colorado uses the Compendium's guidelines or have their own standards. In Texas we have a less restrictive standard for animals that are not current. The Compendium recommends euthanasia as the 1st option. For those owners who desire to try to salvage the exposed animal there are different requirements for vaccinated animals versus animals not current on vaccination. Currently vaccinated animals are to be vaccinated immediately and isolated for 45 days. A 6 month isolation and vaccination immediately or within 28 days of release is required for animals that are not current.

[Our thanks to Patricia Burke and James Alexander for their useful and instructive comments.

I would point out that the UK had for decades a 6 months quarantine policy for all dogs and cats entering the country and this was frequently utilized. We brought 2 cats from the US in 1965 and we were met at Tilbury docks by a veterinary officer who collected the cats and had them transported to a certified facility in the Midlands. When we visited them there were some 20+ other cats also under quarantine. Now they have to have been vaccinated and are demonstrating an antibody titer. - Mod.MHJ]
