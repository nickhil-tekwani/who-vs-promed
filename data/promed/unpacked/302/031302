Some 200 tons of convenience foods to be disposed over anthrax threat
---------------------------------------------------------------------
About 200 tons of convenience foods that might contain anthrax
bacillus will be disposed of in Russia's cities of Omsk,
Khanty-Mansiisk, Tver, Surgut, and others.

Chief sanitarian doctor for Russia's Omsk region Alexander Kriga on
Monday [13 Sep 2010] ordered [the disposal] of more than 195 tons of
meat-stuffed convenience foods produced in the period from 13 Jul
through 6 Aug 2010 by the Darina company and 2 more private
enterprises. The companies used horse meat bought from the Aitenov
farm, where anthrax cases were reported among horses. Moreover, 6
farm workers were reported to catch the disease, and one of them died.

According to Kriga, subject to disposal will also [cover] prepared
foods made from meats other than horse meat but manufactured within
the same time span and with the use of the same equipment.
"Practically all our resolutions are challenged at courts but the
claimants lose every one of them," he noted.

[Back in late July/early August 2010 some 127 people were under
observation and preventive prophylaxis, and 6 were hospitalized with
one death. Then the Russian press mentioned some 2.5 metric tons of
horse meat had been identified as possibly contaminated. Products
manufactured between 13 Jul and 28 Jul 2010 were then identified for
destruction. Plus 14.3 tons had been shipped to Nizhnevartovsk
[Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Region], about 11 tons to Tver and
Khanty-Mansiysk, and 500 pounds to Moscow. Patently the problem is
much larger than originally considered. - Mod.MHJ]
