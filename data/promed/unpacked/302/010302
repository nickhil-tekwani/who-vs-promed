[1] Belgium: fatal co-infection
Date: Sun 11 Jul 2021

https://www.foxnews.com/health/belgian-woman-died-two-COVID-strains


A 90-year-old Belgian died after suffering simultaneous infections from two COVID-19 variants.

The unvaccinated woman, who was not named, tested positive after admission to the OLV hospital in Aalst in March [2021] after she fell multiple times. Her oxygen levels were initially good, but her condition rapidly deteriorated.

She died 5 days later, the Guardian reported. An autopsy revealed that she was infected with both the Alpha and Beta variants at the time of her death.

"This is one of the 1st documented cases of co-infection with 2 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern," said Anne Vankeerberghen from the OLV hospital. "Both these variants were circulating in Belgium at the time, so it is likely that the lady was co-infected with different viruses from 2 different people."

"Unfortunately we don't know how she became infected," she added. The Alpha variant first arose in the U.K. while the Beta strain arose in South Africa. The infections likely originated from different people, Bloomberg reported.

Researchers at the hospital could not say if the co-infection played a role in her rapid decline.

In January [2021], scientists in Brazil reported 2 people had been simultaneously infected with 2 different strains of the coronavirus, but research on those patients has not yet been published in a scientific journal, according to Medical Express.

Vankeerberghen speculated that the lack of testing for variants has allowed similar co-infection cases to go undetected.

"Since co-infections with variants of concern can only be detected by VOC-analysis of positive samples, we would encourage scientists to perform fast, easy and cheap VOC-analysis by PCR on a large proportion of their positive samples, rather than just whole genome sequencing on a small proportion," she said.

"Independent of the technique used, being alert to co-infections remains crucial."

[Since the woman who unfortunately died from co-infection was 90 years old, she very likely had comorbidities that contributed to her vulnerability. It may not have been the co-infection per se with 2 variants that made the infection lethal. And how often co-infections occur is an unknown. - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccine passports
Date: Thu 1 Jul 2021

A year ago, vaccines to tackle the COVID pandemic seemed like a far-off idea. Today, though, doses have been delivered to almost one-quarter of the world's people--and some are being asked to prove they're among them, leading to the rise of so-called vaccine passports. The details of these credentials vary from place to place, but at their heart they are the same: digital health records, stored on your phone, to use as proof that you are a low risk to others.

Supporters of digital vaccination credentials say the benefits are clear: they make congregating less risky while incentivizing vaccinations. But critics see drawbacks and disadvantages. They say introducing vaccine passports infringes on civil liberties, unfairly punishes those who cannot get vaccinated (and discriminates against those who will not), unleashes another form of surveillance, and worsens inequalities rather than eradicating them.

Faced with this divergence of views, governments are taking very different approaches. In Europe, for example, 7 countries launched a "digital green certificate" at the beginning of June [2021], with another 21 nations due to join shortly. But some places are taking the opposite stance, strictly limiting the use of such documents or even banning their development altogether.

Along with these debates, there is still basic confusion about how systems would be used. Some, like the EU's app, are for traveling between nations. Others, like New York State's, are for getting into everyday places like restaurants and events. The term "passport" itself is becoming more ambiguous and simultaneously more loaded: when California governor Gavin Newsom announced the launch of his state's digital certificate, he specifically stated, "It's not a passport; it's not a requirement."

Recent precedents
-----------------
Controversy around new technologies has been a running theme during the pandemic. But while some -like the vaccines themselves- have encouraged conspiracy theories, a more useful parallel may be digital contact tracing apps -systems intended to let you know if you'd been exposed to the virus. These started blanketing the world last spring as public health officials and technologists tried everything they could do to stop the spread.

We started tracking the use of digital contact tracing apps last May [2021]. Since then, our tracker has been viewed tens of thousands of times and has been cited in hundreds of research papers. But despite the attention these apps have received, our recent analysis shows that exposure notification systems missed their moment, at least in the US.

So will this latest form of COVID tech be more effective? What's really happening with digital vaccination credentials? We're researching what various places are developing, starting with US states.

What's happening with vaccine passports in the US
-------------------------------------------------
President Joe Biden has already said there won't be a national app, leaving the choice to states. Some states have banned the apps outright as examples of government overreach. Often the debate over the technology seems like a proxy for a larger question: Should governments and businesses be allowed to require vaccination for COVID? We looked at the status of digital vaccine systems in all 50 states.

A few key takeaways:
- Most states have addressed the technology in some way, either in legislation or in comments from a lawmaker, a public health official, or the governor.
- 4 states have active vaccine certification apps.
- 19 states have banned the systems to some degree, typically through executive orders. Most, though not all, of these states are Republican-led.
- Some states have banned their use only in facilities or agencies connected to state government; others have enacted moratoriums on any use whatsoever.

[3] Israel: breakthrough infections
Date: Tue 6 Jul 2021

Abstract
Objectives
mRNA COVID-19 vaccines have shown high effectiveness in the prevention of symptomatic COVID-19, hospitalization, severe disease, and death. Nevertheless, a minority of vaccinated individuals might get infected and suffer significant morbidity. Characteristics of vaccine breakthrough infections have not been studied. We sought to portray the population of Israeli patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 despite full vaccination.

Methods
A retrospective multicenter cohort study of 17 hospitals included Pfizer/BioNTech's BNT162b2 fully-vaccinated patients who developed COVID-19 more than 7 days after the 2nd vaccine dose and required hospitalization. The risk for poor outcome, defined as a composite of mechanical ventilation or death, was assessed.

Results
152 patients were included, accounting for half of hospitalized fully-vaccinated patients in Israel. Poor outcome was noted in 38 patients and mortality rate reached 22% (34/152). Notable, the cohort was characterized by a high rate of comorbidities predisposing to severe COVID-19, including hypertension (108, 71%), diabetes (73, 48%), CHF (41, 27%), chronic kidney and lung diseases (37, 24% each), dementia (29, 19%), and cancer (36, 24%), and only 6 (%) had no comorbidities. Sixty (40%) of the patients were immunocompromised. Higher SARS-CoV-2 viral-load was associated with a significant risk for poor outcome. Risk also appeared higher in patients receiving anti-CD20 treatment and in patients with low titers of anti-spike IgG, but these differences did not reach statistical significance.

Conclusions
We found that severe COVID-19 infection, associated with a high mortality rate, might develop in a minority of fully-vaccinated individuals with multiple comorbidities. Our patients had a higher rate of comorbidities and immunosuppression compared to previously reported non-vaccinated hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Further characterization of this vulnerable population may help to develop guidance to augment their protection, either by continued social-distancing, or by additional active or passive vaccinations.

[4] Russia: new fatality record
Date: Sat 10 Jul 2021
Source: al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/10/russia-sets-latest-pandemic-high-for-coronavirus-deaths


Russia is battling a severe 3rd wave of COVID-19, driven by the highly infectious Delta variant.

Russia reported 752 coronavirus deaths on [Sat 10 Jul 2021], a national record of pandemic-related fatalities over a 24-hour period, as the country battles a 3rd wave of the coronavirus.

Russia has now set 7 new pandemic highs for coronavirus deaths in the last 12 days as it fights a surging outbreak driven by the highly infectious Delta variant and a sluggish vaccination campaign.

The country's official virus caseload passed 5.75 million on [Sat 10 Jul 2021], making it the 5th-worst-hit nation worldwide, according to an AFP news agency tally.

As of [Sat 10 Jul 2021], just 18.9 million of Russia's population of some 146 million people had been fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tallies coronavirus data from the regions.

In Moscow, the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, just 1.8 million of the city's some 12 million people had been fully vaccinated despite free jabs having been available since December [2020].

Authorities have faced a vaccine-sceptic population, with an independent poll this week showing that 54% of Russians do not plan on getting a COVID-19 jab.

Fred Weir, a correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor in Moscow, told Al Jazeera: "It's a bit of a savage irony that Russia's establishment was able to produce a pretty good vaccine and do it early on, but they've completely failed to convince the population to take it.

"Vaccination rates here are an abysmal 16%, far behind most developed countries. Even in Moscow, where there is a much more educated, cosmopolitan population, the rate is only around 20% or so.

"The government is trying to do everything it can to get people vaccinated, but Russians are somewhat reticent."

According to Weir, scepticism is high among older citizens, who mistrust the state. "The majority of the older population, who are the most vulnerable, are refusing to do it," said Weir.

Despite the challenge, the pace of the vaccination drive has nonetheless picked up after Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin last month [June 2021] mandated that 60% of service industry workers must be fully inoculated by mid-August [2021], with a number of Russian regions since following suit.

On [Fri 9 Jul 2021], Sobyanin said 3.5 million Muscovites will have received at least their 1st dose of a vaccine by the end of the weekend.

The mayor has also ordered offices in the Russian capital to send home a 3rd of their unvaccinated employees and restaurants to allow inside only patrons who have been vaccinated or infected in the past 6 months.

The Kremlin, however, has rejected mandatory vaccinations for all groups of the population as well as suggestions of reimposing a nationwide lockdown.

With 142 253 deaths from the virus, Russia has the highest official coronavirus toll in Europe - even as authorities have been accused of downplaying the severity of the country's outbreak.

Under a broader definition for deaths linked to the coronavirus, statistics agency Rosstat at the end of April [2021] said that Russia has seen at least 270 000 fatalities.

[5] Australia: 1st fatality 2021
Date: Sun 11 Jul 2021
Source: al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/11/australia-reports-first-COVID-death-of-2021-highest-daily-cases


Australia has announced its 1st coronavirus-related death of the year [2021] as authorities in the state of New South Wales struggle to contain an outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant.

The woman in her 90s died hours after testing positive for COVID-19, officials said on [Sun 11 Jul 2021].

Hers is the 1st death from a locally acquired infection in Australia this year [2021] and came as NSW logged a record 77 new cases of the virus.

State Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters that the numbers in and around the country's biggest city Sydney, already under a hard lockdown, are expected to rise.

"I'll be shocked if it's less than 100 this time tomorrow, of additional new cases," she said.

On [Sat 10 Jul 2021], there were 50 cases -- the previous 2021 record high. The recent outbreak stands at 566 cases.

Of [Sun 11 Jul 2021] cases, 33 were people who had spent time in the community while they were infectious, raising the likelihood that the 3-week lockdown of more than 5 million people in Sydney and surroundings will be extended.

"Given where we're at and given the lockdown was supposed to be lifted on [Fri 9 Jul 2021], everybody can tell it's highly unlikely at this stage," Berejiklian said.

There are 52 cases in hospital, or about one in 10 people infected in the current outbreak. A total of 15 people are in intensive care, 5 require ventilation.

Australia has fared much better than many other developed countries in keeping its COVID-19 numbers relatively low, seeing just more than 31 000 cases since the start of the pandemic and 911 deaths.

The vaccination rollout, however, has been sluggish due to supply constraints and changing medical advice for its mainstay AstraZeneca shots.

Vaccines are now available only to people above 40 and groups at risk either due to their health or exposure to the virus at work.

Of those hospitalised in Sydney, 11 are below the age of 35 and more than three-quarters of the patients have not had any doses, health authorities said.

[6] Africa, worst pandemic week; Europe; Global
Date: Sun 11 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/africa-marks-worst-pandemic-week-europe-sees-sharp-rises


Africa just experienced its worst pandemic week, with 16 countries reporting resurgences, World Health Organization (WHO) officials said yesterday [Sat 10 Jul 2021], as some countries in Europe report weekly rises topping 100%.

Africa rise amid promising vaccine news
---------------------------------------
At a WHO African regional office media briefing yesterday [Sat 10 Jul 2021], its leader, Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, said cases have risen for 7 weeks in a row and have now topped the peak of the 2nd surge, with the fast-moving 3rd wave continuing to gain speed.

Of the 16 countries reporting sharp rises, 10 have highlighted the more transmissible Delta (B1617.2) SARS-CoV-2 variant. Malawi and Senegal are the latest countries to report surges.

Moeti said, however, that vaccine delivery is showing signs of progress after nearly grinding to a halt in May and early June [2021]. Over the past 2 weeks the region has received 1.6 million doses through COVAX, with 20 million more expected soon from the United States and significant donations in the coming weeks from Norway and Sweden.

"With much larger COVID-19 vaccine deliveries expected to arrive in July and August [2021], African countries must use this time to prepare to rapidly expand the roll-out," she said, noting that less than 2% of Africa's population is fully vaccinated.

Sharp spikes in more European countries
---------------------------------------
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in its weekly communicable disease threat report that cases increased 62.7% over the week before, with the highest spikes in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Denmark, and the Netherlands. New cases in those countries was up 100% to 200% compared with the week before.

A total of 8 countries have reported 2535 cases related to Euro 2020 soccer competition. Several host cities have reported recent rises in COVID activity, including St Petersburg, Baku, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Glasgow, and London.

So far, no infections have been reported among players on the national teams.

In other European developments, new weekly assessments today from UK health officials say the Delta variant made up 99% of sequenced cases over the past week, and 2ary attack rates appear to be falling, but are still higher for Delta than for the Alpha (B117) variant. They added that although the risk of hospitalization seems to be higher, early data do not show signs of increased severity once patients are hospitalized with Delta variant infections.

Public Health England also posted an assessment of the Lambda (C37) variant, first seen in Peru last August [2020]. It said the variant has shown the capacity for wider spread in South America, with some global transmission. So far, however, it hasn't shown the capacity to outcompete the Delta variant.

More global headlines
-------------------
- Several countries reported new daily record highs for cases, including South Korea, Thailand, Bangladesh, and Tunisia. In South Korea, officials raised COVID measures in Seoul to the highest level short of a full lockdown. And Tunisia's health ministry said the health system has collapsed and the country is in a catastrophe.

- In Australia, New South Wales state today reported 44 more local cases, with new restrictions announced for the Sydney area, which is already in a lockdown, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. [https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/opposite-of-where-we-need-the-numbers-nsw-records-44-COVID-cases-as-restrictions-tightened-20210709-p5889w.html] Stepped-up restrictions include limiting outdoor exercise to 2 people at a time, no carpooling with outside households, and limiting funeral attendance to 10 people. [see report on Australia above]

- The global total today rose to 185 841 190 cases, and 4 014 270 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html].
