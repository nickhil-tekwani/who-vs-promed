Dog virus forces quarantine at Jacksonville animal shelter; strays won't be accepted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With one shelter dog testing positive for a contagious respiratory virus and a 2nd showing mild signs, Jacksonville Animal Care and Protective Services has quarantined 130 other dogs, alerted recent adopters to potential exposure and restricted intake.

The shelter also is appealing for foster families and adopters to take in medium and large adoptable dogs -- which may or may not have been exposed -- for at least 2 weeks. They will be provided with all supplies and needed medical care.

"The body's ability to fight illness is greatly compromised by stress, so dogs are best supported by being cared for outside of the shelter," according to the city.

Canine pneumovirus is not typically seen in the city shelter's dog population, with the last case in 2020, according to Animal Care officials. Signs are similar to other respiratory viruses and include coughing, sneezing and nasal discharge, which can progress to pneumonia or difficulty breathing.

"There is not a vaccine to protect dogs against pneumovirus, so preventing it from spreading to healthy dogs and eliminating it from the shelter is our priority," according to the agency.

The dog showing mild signs is being tested for the illness, and the quarantined dogs are being closely monitored for signs.

Canine pneumovirus is dog-specific, so it cannot affect humans or other pets.

Rare and complicated virus, highly contagious like kennel cough
---------------------------------------------------------------
In 2022 there have been increasing numbers of cases across South Florida, with a Miami-Dade city veterinarian advising dog owners to treat the virus like COVID-19 and keep their dogs separated from other dogs. Also, cases were reported at shelters in Pinellas, Hernando and Pasco counties.

The Jacksonville Humane Society, a private nonprofit shelter, has not had a canine pneumovirus case in at least the past 11 years, according to CEO Denise Deisler. But she remembered the 2020 scenario at the city shelter.

"They closed at that time for several months which then led right into the mandatory shutdown for COVID-19," she said. "It is highly contagious so containing it is important. In an already crowded shelter, the risk of spread is greater. They are handling it with an abundance of caution."

Canine pneumovirus has similar signs to kennel cough, which is common in shelters and requires outside lab testing to make a diagnosis.

"When we had several dogs with a cough a few weeks ago, we tested and all were negative for pneumo, but they did have kennel cough," Deisler said. "When the city had several with signs last week, ACPS asked us to send out the tests for them, we did, and one came back positive."

Any dog with the virus must be closely monitored to make sure pneumonia does not develop. If the dog also has other health issues, the virus "could evolve into something more serious," she said.

"Otherwise, they recover with little to no medical intervention," Deisler said. "It's sort of like people not knowing if they have the flu or a cold -- similar symptoms, no real cure or treatment for either."

What's the situation for the next 2 weeks?
------------------------------------------
At the city shelter, the adoption center will remain open, but public access to dog housing areas will be limited. Also, for at least the next 14 days the shelter will not admit healthy stray dogs or owned dogs "whicht are not a threat to public safety," according to the release.

["Canine pneumovirus was 1st isolated in 2010 from dogs with respiratory disease in the United States. Since then, seropositive dogs have been detected in Europe, Africa, and Asia with genomic sequences determined from samples in England and Italy. Seronegative dogs entering animal shelters quickly seroconvert with a strong correlation between exposure to canine pneumovirus and the development of respiratory disease. These observations indicate canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). The canine virus is very closely related to pneumonia virus of mice.

"Infection of mice with the canine virus produced a mild pneumonia and recovered mice were protected from a lethal challenge with pneumonia virus of mice. Pneumovirus has also been isolated from cats, and several wildlife species (raccoons and foxes) show a high seroprevalence for the canine virus. These data call into question whether rodents are a natural host for pneumovirus as wild rodents show little or no exposure to pneumovirus. Canine pneumovirus is difficult to isolate in cell cultures, and many laboratories offer PCR panels that include canine pneumovirus." (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/pneumovirus)

"Canine pneumovirus contributes to what is commonly referred to as the canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC). Clinical signs of CIRDC may include sneezing, nasal and ocular discharge, and sometimes lower respiratory and/or systemic disease.

"Viral pathogens associated with CIRDC in dogs include:
- parainfluenza
- adenovirus-2
- respiratory coronavirus (this is distinct from canine enteric coronavirus)
- herpesvirus-1
- pneumovirus"
- and other respiratory syncytial viruses, mentioned above

"Bacterial pathogens implicated in CIRDC include:
- _Bordetella bronchiseptica_
- _Mycoplasma_ spp.
- _Streptococcus zooepidemicus_ (may cause severe systemic disease)" (https://www.uwsheltermedicine.com/library/resources/canine-infectious-respiratory-disease-complex-a-k-a-kennel-cough)

If your pet is listless, depressed, having difficulty breathing, and possibly not eating/drinking well, it is advisable to have your pet seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible.

Early treatment can help, as can prevention methods of vaccines to help protect your pet. While there is not currently a vaccine for this virus, there are some vaccines associated with respiratory diseases that may reduce and/or prevent the clinical signs of this disease.
