Anti-Rabies Drugs Sent to Marakwet
------------------------
The Government yesterday dispatched over 200 doses of anti-rabies
drugs to Marakwet as the disease affected more people in the
district. The Marakwet District Medical Officer of Health (MOH), Dr
Robert Pukose, however said the doses were not enough to combat
rabies outbreak in several parts of the district.
"The rate of infection is alarming and more doses are required
considering the frequent wild dog attacks reported especially in Tot
Division and other parts of the Kerio Valley," said Pukose.
He said the drugs could be distributed to health institutions along
the Kerio Valley to help in containing the spread of the disease
contracted through dog bites.
"We appeal to the Ministry of Health to donate more of these drugs
since the dispatched doses are only enough for 100 patients,
considering a patient requires 2 doses of anti-rabies to contain the
infection," noted Dr Pukose.
He said a team of medical personnel had been dispatched to Tot
division, the most affected area, to help contain the spread of the
disease.

[Rabies is generally not transmitted from human to human, although
there are one or perhaps 2 documented cases. However, one wonders why
they are not attempting to control rabies in the dogs by vaccinating
the dog population. Likewise, this article does not tell us whether
the dogs are quarantined or euthanized after biting someone. However,
controlling rabies in the pet population, controlling the wild dog
population are both positive steps in stopping the spread of rabies.
In the mean time, we would hope that more medication will be
dispensed to the people suffering. This article does not tell us what
type of anti-rabies drugs were dispensed, but most likely it was
immunoglobulin. ProMED-mail would welcome any additional information
on the situation. - Mod.TG]
