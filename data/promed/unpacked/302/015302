Cheboksary and Novocheboksarsk in Chuvashia report an increasing number of
intestinal infection cases caused by low-quality dairy products made in
Cheboksary. In the city, a total of 1174 people (including 657 children)
have already fallen [ill, with 560 people hospitalised for dysentery.
There are 418 similar cases including 271 among children in
Novocheboksarsk. The figure for the Cheboksary region is 70 cases with
children accounting for more than half of them.
Specialists from federal epidemiologic services have been sent to the
region to render aid.

[This is an unconfirmed media report that lacks specific information about
the cause(s) of the outbreaks. I edited out a sentence that included an
indication in that the increased caseload was associated with the approach
of the summer season. Perhaps dairy products are not properly refrigerated,
thereby exacerbating the problem. We would appreciate further information
about the etiology. - Mod. ES
