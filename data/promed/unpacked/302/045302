[This is by no means a complete roundup of "all the news that's fit to print" about Ebola virus disease (EVD), but a selection from the avalanche of reports of what this moderator considers most important from a public health point of view. - Mod.JW]

***[Correction: WHO, in its latest report issued on Fri 5 Sep 2014 afternoon, said the total number of EVD cases then stood at 3944 and deaths at 1759 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. But in the WHO Situation Report No. 2, also dated Fri 5 Sep 2014, the table titled "Total number of probable, confirmed, and suspected cases in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone as at 5 Sep 2014" shows total deaths as 2097.

How can I help?
---------------
The ongoing Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa is the largest and most protracted ever recorded and it shows no signs of waning as the affected countries have been unable to control the outbreak on their own.

Medical volunteers
------------------
We are appealing to the medical community in the USA for assistance with the West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. If you are a qualified medical professional and want to volunteer to work in West Africa, click here [http://www.usaid.gov/ebola/volunteers] to contact reputable organizations who are active in the EVD response through the Center for International Disaster Information (CIDI).

Donations
---------
If you wish to donate money to organizations responding to the West Africa Ebola outbreak, you can give to the Global Giving Ebola Epidemic Relief Fund [http://www.globalgiving.org/projects/ebola-epidemic-relief-fund/].

[2] UN statement
Date: Fri 5 Sep 2014
Source: UN [edited]
http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=48651


Secretary-general Ban Ki-moon today [5 Sep 2014] vowed to mobilize the United Nations in every possible way to respond to the EVD outbreak in West Africa and issued an "international rescue call" for a massive surge in assistance, warning that "the world can no longer afford to short-change global public health. The next few weeks will be crucial. The people of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in particular are looking to us for support. They are counting on us for a massive surge in assistance: more doctors, nurses and beds; more equipment, trucks and other vehicles."

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [5 Sep 2014] that experts taking part in a 2-day discussion on potential EVD therapies and vaccines identified several therapeutic and vaccine interventions that should be the focus of priority clinical evaluation at this time, including 2 "promising" EVD vaccines.

WHO assistant director-general Marie-Paule Kieny told a press conference in Geneva on the outcome of the experts meeting that it was not yet known if the therapies are 100 per cent safe or whether they will be effective. He added that their safety will be known in November 2014 and will be available for use in countries shortly after. Dr Kieny also noted that blood from EVD survivors might help those who are still infected and still sick to fight the virus. "We have agreed that whole blood therapies and convalescent serums may be used to treat Ebola virus disease," Dr Kieny told reporters. "This can be done in EVD-affected countries now," WHO tweeted, citing Dr Kieny.

Nigeria: EVD management -- why virus must be contained in Rivers, by WHO
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If the Ebola virus disease (EVD) is not contained in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, there is a very high risk that it would spread rapidly to other parts of Nigeria and neighbouring countries, WHO has warned. Meanwhile, the state government said the EVD emergency response team has established contact with almost 96 per cent of people who had primary and secondary contact with the index cases, Mr Koye Olu-Ibukun and the late Dr Ike Enemuo. WHO country representative, Mr Rui Vaz, who is in Rivers State to assess its preparedness to combat the scourge and to offer technical assistance, told newsmen during a visit to the commissioner for health, Sampson Parker, that the biggest challenge at the moment was how to contain the spread.

According to him, EVD can be contained with the cooperation of everyone. Vaz, who was accompanied by other WHO officials, described Rivers as a very important economic point and one of the leading states in Nigeria that requires special attention. Vaz explained that right from the 1st day that WHO got wind of the outbreak in the state, a team of experts with vast knowledge in tackling virulent diseases was deployed to assist in setting up the EVD emergency operation centre -- now operational at Oduoha in Emohua local council [Rivers state]. According to him, WHO officials are presently in Rivers to help strengthen the surveillance system to ensure contract tracing and as well to help develop local capacity to tackle the outbreak. "The most important aspect in EVD control is early diagnosis of any suspect and to take necessary precautions in terms of the isolation needed and other measures that can stop the chain of transmission," he said. Vaz disclosed that WHO has commenced the process of training private hospital operators to ensure proper management of any case, noting that the training had become imperative because 69 per cent of the cases in Lagos were medical workers ...

Health officials in Lagos have warned the public not to rely on ebolavirus testing kits available in the market. It has been found that fake testing kits are being sold that claim to show very quick results (in about 10 minutes). Officials also clarified that as of now, ebolavirus testing kits are not being manufactured. Reliable testing can be done only at officially designated diagnostic centres.

[5] Faster diagnostic test
Date: Tue 2 Sep 2014
Source: International Business Times [edited]
http://www.ibtimes.com/ebola-outbreak-japan-develops-30-minute-simpler-test-quickly-diagnose-deadly-virus-1675502


Japanese scientists said Tuesday [2 Sep 2014] that they have developed a new test that could detect the ebolavirus in 30 minutes, with the help of a technology they claim is faster and cheaper than the current method being used in West Africa.... Eiken Chemical Co., along with researchers at Nagasaki University, reportedly created the new testing method, which can be conducted with a "small, battery-powered warmer," making it ideal for use in places without an adequate power source, the scientists claimed. The current test requires "[expensive] dedicated equipment and a stable supply of electricity," according to a local report.

"The new method is simpler than the current one and can be used in countries where expensive testing equipment is not available," Jiro Yasuda, a professor at Nagasaki University, told Agence France-Presse (AFP). "We have yet to receive any questions or requests, but we are pleased to offer the system, which is ready to go," he reportedly said. Yasuda and his team at the university have reportedly created what they called a "primer," which magnifies only those genes specific to ebolavirus found in a blood sample or any other fluid in the body. If ebolavirus is present, the action of the primers distinguishes DNA specific to the deadly virus in 30 minutes.

Currently, a technique called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, is being used to detect the ebolavirus. The PCR method takes up to 2 hours as doctors need to heat and cool the blood samples repeatedly to complete the procedure. "The ... entire system costs just tens of thousands of yen [a few hundred USD], which developing countries should be able to afford," Yasuda said, according to AFP.

[6] Prevention and suspected cases


Guinea-Bissau: weakness of preventive measures
----------------------------------------------
3 Sep 2014: (ANGOP) Inhabitants of the eastern regions of Guinea-Bissau are concerned about the "weakness of measures" to prevent the ebolavirus in the zone where authorities.... The concern was reported on Wednesday [3 Sep 2014] by a RDN (state broadcaster) citing cases where people have recently entered the border at Burumtuma, a Guinea locality situated a few meters from the Guinea-Conakry border. "A military officer who was on duty in Guinea ... entered Guinea-Bissau at Burumtuma, where he rented a car for Gabu, giving a ride to a lady," said the correspondent RDN, Adulai Bobo Cisse. According to the journalist, in Bafata, another eastern city, people are reporting situations of people in the border paying a "bribe" to border guards to let them pass, contrary to government guidelines. The people and the military officer who traveled from Burumtuma to Gabu are in quarantine in a space outside the regional hospital, said the journalist Bobo Cisse. The hospital director says there is not enough space in the hospital. "This quarantine that is not quarantine is worrying. From the back of the house where they were placed there's a makeshift market selling goats. About 20 meters away there is a place where they sell food and drink," a person from Gabu reported to Bobo Cisse. The house where 3 people were placed in "quarantine" has no drinking water, no bathroom and the bedroom windows have no glass. Another person says that the individuals can receive family visits.

Liberia: Asian workers
----------------------
4 Sep 2014: (CNA) Dr Yasuki Kato, has returned from a 17-day mission in Africa. He was based in the Liberian capital of Monrovia as a member of the WHO mission.... When asked about the possibility of EVD reaching Asia, he said: "EVD is transmitted through direct contact with blood and body fluids of patients. Generally, travellers cannot get infected with ebolavirus. But I notice Asian people working in Liberia, including Chinese and Vietnamese. They're taking part in the construction of power plants, bridges and roads in Liberia. If they return to their home countries and develop a fever, we should be vigilant." Dr Kato himself is under observation and needs to take his temperature every day.

UK: British nurse makes 'full recovery' and leaves hospital
-----------------------------------------------------------
3 Sep 2014: (The Week) William Pooley, who was given the experimental drug ZMapp, has been discharged from a London hospital. The 1st Briton to be infected with the deadly ebolavirus [in Sierra Leone] has made a full recovery, according to his doctors. The 29 year old nurse from Suffolk was being treated in a specialist isolation centre in north London's Royal Free Hospital. His doctors say he is no longer infectious and poses "no risk to the wider community in any way". Doctors are still unable to determine whether [ZMapp] was directly responsible for his recovery, as patients can get better naturally. However, "levels of the virus in his bloodstream did fall significantly" following the treatment, reports the BBC's health editor James Gallagher ... [more]

West Africa: border controls hinder cocoa harvest
-------------------------------------------------
5 Sep 2014: (BBC) It is almost harvest time for cocoa in West Africa, a crop that plays a major role in some of the region's big economies -- most notably that of Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] and Ghana. However, the current EVD outbreak has meant the border between Liberia and Ivory Coast has been closed. This is causing a problem for Ivory Coast's cocoa farmers because many of the workers who harvest the cocoa come from Liberia.
