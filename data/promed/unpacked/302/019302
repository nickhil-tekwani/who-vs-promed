Foot and Mouth Disease in Bahrain
---------------------------------
[Sections of this report which are similar to the information
included in posting 20090409.1366, have been omitted. - Mod.AS]

Given that the outbreak in Bahrain was reported to have been detected
in cattle imported from Somalia with a vaccination certificate, this
may suggest that the vaccine did not provide sufficient protection
against this latest strain.

Map below [see in the above URL] indicates that another strain of
serotype A has been reported in Egypt recently, with high sequence
similarity to a strain isolated from Kenya in 2005 and Ethiopia in
2007. This strain was detected in Egypt for the 1st time in 2006.
These new outbreaks suggest the strain may be established in this region.

The report from Bahrain adds to the growing evidence that 2 distinct
strains of serotype A (as well as serotype O topotype ME-SA, which is
endemic in Palestine, Lebanon and recently detected in Israel) are
currently circulating in the eastern Mediterranean (IAH-WRL, 2009).
The most current disease reports suggest that disease spread around
the region may be due to live animal movements as well as animal products.

Current vaccines may not be as effective when new strains of existing
FMD serotypes emerge, and this, along with live animal movements,
could potentially result in wider spread of the disease in the
region. Controlling disease becomes even more challenging when more
than one strain within a particular serotype are in circulation at
the same time. The UK and EU do not allow legal trade in FMD
susceptible live animals or fresh meat from this region. The legal
import of all other animal products is subject to official certification.

Conclusions
-----------
At this stage, we consider that there is an overall low risk of
introducing FMD into the EU from the currently affected regions in
the Middle East and northeastern Africa. This again emphasises the
need for vigilance and prompt reporting of suspected cases in the UK,
appropriate enforcement at the border, maintaining appropriate level
of biosecurity at all times and full compliance with swill feeding ban.

We continue to monitor the situation.

[The map in the above URL, titled "FMD serotypes and strains reported
2007-2009 (According to OIE and WRL)," includes the following
information on the main serotpes/strains pertaining to the respective
infected countries:
A Iran 05 & O ME-SA PanAsia II: Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Jordan.
A Iran 05 - New variant: Iraq, Libya, Bahrain.
O ME-SA PanAsia II: Palestinian authority, Israel, United Arab Emirates (UAE).
O ME-SA PanAsia II, A East Africa: Egypt.
O?: Lebanon.
O East Africa-3: Yemen.
SAT-2, O, A: Sudan, Eritrea.

The question mark related to the Lebanese serotype O is a cause for
puzzlement. Lebanon submitted an immediate notification to the OIE on
20 Feb 2009, concerning outbreaks in cattle, recorded in 11 villages.
The outbreak had, reportedly, started a month earlier, namely on 19
Jan 2009. The identity of the virus was, at the time of notification,
"pending," and the following comment was included: "Samples taken
from clinical cases shall be sent soon to the OIE Reference
Laboratory of Pirbright [WRLFMD] for serotyping and matching test."
Eventually, the samples were received at Pirbright on 24 Mar 2009;
results of their serotyping and genotyping have not been obtained or
published to the present day (10 Apr 2009). - Mod.AS]
