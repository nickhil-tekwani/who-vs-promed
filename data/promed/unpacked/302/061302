Rabies long incubation, human, Kailali district, Nepal
------------------------------------------------------
A 63-year-old, previously healthy, non-alcoholic from Pahalwanpur, Kailali district (Seti Zone) was referred from Nepalgunj Medical College (Kohalpur, Banke district), who presented with pain in right arm, aggressive behavior, hydrophobia, aerophobia, has been admitted (on 11 Nov 2015) to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, Kathmandu. He developed extreme photophobia after hospital admission. He died on 12 Nov 2015.

According to the patient, a stray dog had bitten his left lower leg 53 years ago, when he was 10 years old. He did not receive anti-rabies vaccine, because at that time it was not readily available in remote areas of Nepal. A long incubation period for rabies (53 years) as seen in this case, has never been reported in literature before. Human rabies remains a neglected and underreported disease in Nepal.

[Our thanks to Dr Pun for informing us of this unusual case.

In case the suspected rabies diagnosis is laboratory confirmed, the patient's anamnesis deserves to be thoroughly studied, relatives/acquaintances preferably involved, to exclude possible exposure to rabies during the past year. A 53-year incubation period for rabies is, to my view, rather unlikely. - Mod.AS

This incubation period is so long that a healthy bit of skepticism seems appropriate. At a minimum, we need two additional pieces of evidence: 1) viral isolation as a proof of diagnosis; and 2) genetic evaluation of the virus to determine its origin eg dog or bat etc. Even if it is of dog origin a minor exposure over such a long duration could have been forgotten such as petting a dog with saliva on its fur, As about half of rabies patients experience pain and a tingling sensation at the inoculation site, the pain in the right arm could suggest the possibility of rabies inoculation in that arm more recently and not the leg that was bitten 53 years before, - Mod.DK.
