Following the recent bout of heavy rains that have lashed the city for the past 2 months, the residents of Mogadishu [Somalia] have witnessed a spate of fever and conjunctivitis cases in recent days. Medical professionals, however, say people will be able to avoid both fever and conjunctivitis by just adopting some basic precautions.

The symptoms of the fever that have affected people throughout the city include redness in the white of the eye, swelling of the eyelids, itching or burning eyes, swollen and tender areas in front of the ears, tears, clear or slightly thick whitish drainage, burning or gritty feeling around the eye area, thick and sticky discharge, and crusting on the eyelashes.

Ophthalmologist Dr. Ahmed Hassan, who runs an eye hospital in Mogadishu, said the spread of conjunctivitis is also associated with normal environmental fluctuations, such as increased humidity in the country during the months of November and December.

Along with the public's lack of basic medical knowledge about conjunctivitis and personal hygiene, these factors could create conditions ideal for pink eye outbreaks. Bacterial pink eye is caused by bacteria such as staphylococci, streptococci, and _Haemophilus_, or [viruses such as] adenovirus or herpes virus, said Dr, Hassan.

Water-borne and vector-borne diseases are the most common this season. The Somali public health authorities are concerned about the highly contagious characteristics of the disease, particularly in families, schools and office environments.

Mohamed Hajji Ali, head of the public health department of the Somali Health Ministry urges those having fever to immediately approach a doctor so that it can be treated before it becomes severe.

People must also avoid touching the personal belongings and objects of those having conjunctivitis, as it can be spread in this manner, he said.

[Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as "red" or "pink" eye, a sign of inflammation that is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water). A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A thick, yellow-green sticky discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggests a more serious disease process such as keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea and is accompanied by conjunctivitis.

The news report above describes the eyelids as being swollen (more commonly seen in bacterial conjunctivitis, but may also occur with adenoviral conjunctivitis) and the drainage from the eyes being "slightly thick" and "whitish" (possibly viral) and also "thick" and "sticky" (possibly bacterial), with "crusting on the eyelashes" (possibly viral). Palpable, tender areas in front of the ears suggest lymph node enlargement in front of the flap of the ear, which is more consistent with a diagnosis of viral conjunctivitis.

Outbreaks of conjunctivitis are commonly due to viruses (e.g., adenoviruses and enteroviruses), adenoviruses being most common (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf). Conjunctivitis due to adenoviruses is spread through hand-to-eye contact or by contact with objects, such as ophthalmologic equipment contaminated with infectious tears, eye discharge, or respiratory discharges. There may be prolonged shedding of adenovirus; a person can be contagious a few days before developing symptoms to approximately 14 days after symptom onset, and adenovirus may be resistant to many common disinfectants and can remain viable for long periods in the environment (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6232.pdf). Treatment of viral conjunctivitis is supportive.

Somalia is located in the Horn of Africa. Mogadishu, located on the Indian Ocean with a population of about 1.3 million, is the largest city in Somalia and its capital (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogadishu).
