Three Additional Equine Cases in Georgia
----------------------------------------
I am the post veterinarian at Ft. Benning GA. I have recently had 2 horses
diagnosed with West Nile virus. They are being treated at Auburn University,
Auburn, AL. One was clinical and the other asymptomatic when tested. A third
horse became ill and was put down. His serum samples are at the State
Diagnostic lab in Tifton, GA. State Vet in GA notified.
