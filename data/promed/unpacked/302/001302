Matanuska-Susitna area potato farmers are fighting an outbreak of "late
blight" for the 3rd time in the past decade. Potato late blight (PLB) can
cause devastation to plants including stored potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant and
hot peppers. First discovered in the Mat-Su in 1995 and again in 1998, it has
not been seen since until last week when it was spotted in a local farmer's
field, according to state Agriculture Division Director Larry DeVilbiss.
So far, parts of 3 commercial farms in the Valley have been affected and
plants from a half-dozen Palmer-area backyard gardens are also being tested
for PLB, he said. One commercial grower has blight in more than half his field
and 2 other growers have only small pickup-size spots of infected plants. The
PLB fungus is a common problem in the lower 48 states, where farmers spray
fungicide for disease control. But it's rare in Alaska, where the state's cold
winters and relative isolation help prevent its spread.
The fungus thrives in cool, wet weather and is spread by wind and water.
Infected potatoes produces spores that spread to other plants. It can also
survive in potatoes and re-emerge if replanted. PLB can also cause stored
potatoes to rot.
The spores can spread quickly -- traveling as far as 80 miles per day, wiping
out entire fields in less than a week, said Jenifer Huang McBeath, a Fairbanks-
based plant pathology and biotechnology professor who inspected 2 of the 3
infected fields in Mat-Su.
Potatoes bring in about $2 million a year for Alaska growers, making them a
small part of farming in the state. But they are one of the largest field
crops, DeVilbiss said. Seed potatoes are also one of Alaska's few farm exports.
Fall is the peak growing season, with potatoes doubling their weight in the
next 2 weeks, DeVilbiss said. That makes farmers reluctant to harvest the
potatoes now, one way to keep the disease from spreading, he said. Despite
that, at least one farmer plans to do just that, and other growers plan to, or
already have sprayed their plants with fungicide.
While farmers can spray from the ground, DeVilbiss has asked the state
Department of Environmental Conservation for permission for aerial spraying.
The chemical is on a national list of approved fungicides, but farmers need
the agency's approval for aerial spraying, said Kim Stricklan, DEC's pesticide
program manager.
PLB is not indigenous to Alaska, so growers suspect it was imported. In 1998,
McBeath traced the outbreak to seed potatoes from Canada although some dispute
that claim, she said.
Besides harvesting plants immediately, McBeath recommended that growers who
suspect plants are infected cut off the plant above the ground. The potatoes
will still grow, but it will reduce the chances of disease spread, she said.
Potatoes suspected of being infected should not be replanted, she said.

[Potato blight caused by the fungal pathogen _Phytophthora infestans_ [Pi] has
been a problem for over 150 years. Many approaches have been developed to
control it, but the fungus still poses a major threat. It has evolved to
overcome most of the measures that were introduced over the years.
Several management strategies can be deployed
---------------------------------------------
Control of Pi has traditionally relied on copper-based fungicides such as
Bordeaux mixture, but copper is potentially phytotoxic, so disease forecasting
was developed to enable growers to predict when the environmental conditions
were highly conducive to spread of Pi. Forecasting methods for PLB differ in
different countries, but in Britain they are based on the "temperature-
humidity rule" devised by Beaumont. Copper is a broad-spectrum protectant
fungicide which must be applied to prevent disease. It has been superseded by
modern systemic fungicides, which move within the plant and can both protect
and eradicate existing infections. The acylalanine fungicides such as
metalaxyl and furalaxyl act specifically on the RNA polymerase of Pi and
closely related fungi. However, resistance to these chemicals can develop
quickly in the pathogen population -- it requires only a single gene mutation
leading to a minor change in the RNA polymerase molecule. In many parts of the
world, Pi is now resistant to these fungicides.
Destruction of foliage
----------------------
If Pi becomes established on potato foliage, sporangia can be washed down into
the soil to infect tubers, or tubers can be contaminated with sporangia during
crop harvesting, thus leading to rotting of the tubers during storage, and
carry-over of inoculum from one season to the next. Destruction of the foliage
(the haulm) with sulphuric acid or herbicide 2-3 weeks before the tubers are
lifted is a recommended strategy.
Resistance breeding
-------------------
The cultivated potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) originated from the Andean region
of South America, where there are several other species of the genus
_Solanum_. _Solanum demissum_ proved to be an important source of resistance,
and by conventional plant breeding this resistance was bred into commercial
potato cultivars. 4 major resistant genes (R genes) were discovered and were
introduced successively into commercial cultivars.
However, within a few years of each R gene being widely introduced into potato
cultivars, resistance was overcome by new strains (termed physiologic races)
of Pi that developed in response to selection pressure imposed by the specific
R genes. Many plant breeders now prefer to develop cultivars that
have "polygenic" or "field resistance" to the pathogen. Such plants have
combinations of several "minor" genes, none of which gives absolute
resistance, but together they slow the rate of development of the fungus and
enable the plant to tolerate infection.
Emergence of new pathogenic strains through sexual crossing
-----------------------------------------------------------
Like many members of the _Oomycota_, Pi has 2 mating types (A1 and A2). It can
undergo sexual reproduction only if both mating types are present in a
population. Both mating types occur in Mexico, near the centre of origin of
_Solanum_ and thus presumably of its pathogen _P. infestans_. In Europe only
the A1 strain was [originally] known to occur -- presumably because it was
introduced by chance on potatoes imported from elsewhere. The A2 mating type
was discovered in Britain in 1978 and is now common in much of continental
Europe.
