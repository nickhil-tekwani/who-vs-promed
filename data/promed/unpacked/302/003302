Philippine health and agriculture officials arrived at a farm in
Pandi near Manila Sunday [1 Mar 2009] to begin slaughtering around
6000 pigs to prevent the spread of the Ebola-Reston virus.

Security was tight, with police checkpoints set up in Bulacan
province to prevent reporters from getting close to the farm where
traces of the non-lethal virus had been detected. Even houses near
the farm were being secured by police to keep outsiders away.

Eric Tayag, head of the National Epidemiology Center, told reporters
that an electric stun-gun would be used to kill the pigs, after which
the carcasses would be burned and then buried. He said they expected
to cull only about 500 pigs Sunday [1 Mar 2009] but hoped later to
slaughter 1000 a day and to complete the process within a week.

Aircraft were prevented from flying over the farm, Tayag said as he
turned down a request from a local television station to shoot the
scene from the air.

According to the World Health Organisation, the strain infecting the
pigs is not dangerous to humans, unlike the 4 deadly Ebola subtypes
found in Africa.

The government earlier imposed a quarantine on 2 farms in Bulacan and
Pangasinan provinces after sample testing found some pigs were
carrying the Ebola-Reston strain. It was later found that the spread
of the virus was only continuing in the farm in Pandi town, Bulacan
province.

The strain was 1st found in laboratory monkeys exported from the
Philippines to the US in 1989.

So far, 6 farm workers and butchers have been found with the
antibodies to Ebola Reston, and scientists are still trying to
determine whether the 6 caught the virus from pigs.

If such a link is proven, it would be the 1st time humans have
contracted the disease from pigs.
