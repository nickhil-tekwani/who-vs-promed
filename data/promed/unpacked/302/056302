[This is the 1st reported case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Panama since 2010. If Darien is anything like southern Louisiana, which I suspect it is, this outbreak is the result of the farm owner failing to revaccinate his horses in a area with enzootic risk. While EEE is rarely lethal for humans, it carries a significant lethal risk for horses.

We discovered a simple way of determining EEE incidence. At the annual vaccination, bleed the horses before injecting them and then check the antibody titre. Horses that had been vaccinated the year before and had been exposed during the subsequent 12 months show a very significant high titre, much higher than that seen in an unexposed but vaccinated horse. This is a cheap and cost effective way of EEE surveillance using these horses at known sites as sentinels. - Mod.MHJ
