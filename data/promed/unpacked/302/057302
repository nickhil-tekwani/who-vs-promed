An 8-week-old puppy from Van Buren County was euthanized after suffering from eastern equine encephalitis (EEEV).

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health on Wednesday [29 Aug 2012] confirmed the case. Dr. Rick Johansen, the Medical Director for Van Buren County, told 24 Hour News 8: "If a dog got it, that means the virus is out there."

EEE is rare in humans. The last known cases in Michigan were in 2010, with 2 in Kalamazoo County and one in Barry County. All 3 people survived, reportedly going through rehabilitation.

EEEV is a serious viral disease spread by mosquitoes that can typically affect people, horses and poultry but also can occur in other mammals, reptiles and amphibians.

Officials say this may be the 1st such case in a dog in Michigan.

The puppy had a sudden onset of seizures, was thin and weak, and unable to stand. The animal's condition became progressively worse while hospitalized, and the owner agreed to have the dog euthanized.

EEE is rare and spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Most people infected have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills and vomiting, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures or coma. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is based on symptoms. Johansen said the human symptoms would include fever, headache and "feeling terrible."

You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV and West Nile virus by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active. You should also eliminate standing water in such things as old tires, tarps and pool covers.

"This is a challenging year for vector borne diseases. Drought conditions and warm weather lead to stagnant pools of water, which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, said state veterinarian Dr. Steven L. Halstead. "This just shows how important it is to protect dogs, cats, and horses from the illnesses that mosquitoes and other vectors such as fleas, ticks, and biting flies can cause."

[Fascinating what we find when we look for it. I wonder why the dog was tested for EEE. This is not necessarily a common test for canines, although it has been reported numerous times.

This puppy was in poor body condition and still very young. Nevertheless, one wonders whether it was the poor body condition that lead to the viral condition manifesting itself.

Clinical signs in dogs include pyrexia, depression, nystagmus, and lateral recumbency and signs of neurological disturbances.

West Nile virus has also been isolated from dogs and cats. EEE has also been isolated from cats. Generally with supportive care, these animals recover from both of these diseases.

The encephalitic diseases have also been diagnosed in pigs, reptiles, and the occasional bovine and recently members of the camelid family.

These diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. Animals are susceptible to mosquito bites. Remember mosquitoes also transmit heartworms to dogs and cats. Please consult your veterinarian about appropriate means of protecting your pet from mosquitoes. Please follow your veterinarian's advice regarding mosquito repellant for your pets. Some repellants and natural remedies can be very toxic. Please also remember to have your pet tested for heartworms and get the veterinary recommended preventative for this particular mosquito transmitted disease.
