[It appears that there new cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia every 3 to 6 days since mid-July 2016, representing continued presentation of sporadic cases and few to no nosocomially transmitted cases since the end of the outbreak in a hospital in Riyadh in June 2016.

The Hajj ended on Wed 14 Sep 2016, so the "all's clear" signal that there are no cases related to the Hajj will not be sounded until after 28 Sep 2016 -- 14 days (one incubation period) following the departure of all Hajj pilgrims from Saudi Arabia.

[According to the above WHO update, there have now been 1800 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection including 643 deaths reported to WHO since 2012 when the virus was 1st identified. As this update covers cases confirmed through 23 Aug 2016, presumably it does not include the 6 additional cases including 2 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia since then, nor does it include the additional case reported by Austria in a Saudi Arabian tourist visiting Austria (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below).
