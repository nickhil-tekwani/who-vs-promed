---------------------------------------------------------------------
Peach trees (_Prunus persica_ L.) with yellowing symptoms on leaves
were found in December (summer season) of 2005 in commercial fields
in Colonia Caroya, Cordoba, Argentina. This symptom resembled _Peach
latent mosaic viroid_ (PLMVd). The viroid-affected trees usually
showed vein banding and yellowing symptoms on leaves, fruit suture
splitting, delays in budding, flowering and fruit ripening, reduced
foliage density, and a spindly appearance. PLMVd is mainly
transmitted by the propagation of infected budwood and to a lesser
extent by pruning tools and aphids.

Extraction and partial purification of nucleic acids was made from
symptomatic leaves collected during the indicated summer season from
7 peach trees from commercial plots. Preliminary identification of
the viroid was made by dot-blot hybridization with a PLMVd probe. The
positive plants were tested also by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
(polymerase chain reaction) with PLMVd primers which amplify the
complete genome. All identified positive samples yielded the correct
sized PCR product and 4 were cloned and sequenced. This local
sequence had 97 percent nucleotide sequence identity with a reported
PLMVd sequence confirming the identity of the local pathogen as
_Peach latent mosaic viroid_.

This result suggests that the source of the pathogen may have been
infected budwood introduced from Europe. To our knowledge, this is
the 1st report of this viroid in Argentina.

[_Peach latent mosaic viroid_ (PLMVd; type member of genus
_Pelamoviroid_) affects only peach and peach hybrids (almond x peach,
plum x peach, etc), while other _Prunus_ species appear to be immune.
It has been recorded in many peach-growing countries particularly in
those growing American or Japanese cultivars.

Although most infections occur without conspicuous symptoms, certain
PLMVd isolates induce leaf mosaics, blotches, and in the most extreme
cases albinism (peach calico disease, PC), flower streaking, growth
delays (late foliation, flowering and fruit ripening), deformations
and discolorations of fruits (usually showing cracked sutures and
enlarged roundish stones), bud necrosis, stem pitting, as well as
premature ageing of the trees which also adopt a characteristic
growing pattern with an open habit. Even trees without obvious
symptoms may suffer reduction of vigour and will serve as pathogen
reservoirs.

PLMVd is horizontally transmitted by the propagation of infected buds
and to a lesser extent by pruning tools and aphids, but not by
pollen; the viroid is not vertically transmitted through seed.
Viroids are exceptionally stable due to their molecular structure and
can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable time. Disease
management relies on eradication of infected plants and the use of
viroid-free planting and grafting material. Budwood should only be
obtained from certified viroid- and virus-free source trees.
