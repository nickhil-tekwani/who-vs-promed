Rapid reporting system for meningitis W135: 2a:P1.2, 5 prompted by haj
outbreak
--------------------------------------
The outbreak earlier this year of infection with _Neisseria meningitidis_
of serogroup W135 in pilgrims returning from the haj and their contacts
prompted the European Commission's Directorate-General V project to set up
a rapid reporting system covering France, Germany, Ireland, the
Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Every Friday our contacts are
asked to report any cases of W135: 2a:P1.2, 5 or compatible strains
reported by their laboratories in the week ending the previous Friday. A
total of 8 cases of infection with W135: 2a: P1.2, 5, or compatible strains
were reported between 2 Sep 2000 and 3 Nov 2000. Of the countries
contributing to this surveillance Germany, Ireland, and Spain have yet to
report any cases of this type.
Two cases of W 135 _N. meningitidis_ infection were identified by the
Netherlands' Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis. The strains
were characterised as W135: NT: P1.5 and W135: 2a: P1.2, 5.
Three cases were identified in France Â­ a 22 month old boy with meningitis,
meningococcaemia, and endocarditis in whom serogroup W135 was confirmed and
multilocus DNA fingerprinting suggested an ET-37 clone such as 2a:P1.2, 5;
a 6 month old boy with meningitis (strain from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
was W135: 2a: P1.2; and a 2 day old girl who died of septic shock (strain
isolated from CSF was W135: 2a: P1.2, 5). All 3 yielded identical genetic
typing results by using MLDF and alleles that were characteristic of the
ET-37 complex.
Three cases were identified in the United Kingdom. A 12 year old boy
survived meningococcal disease caused by W135: 2a: P 1.2/1.5. The case had
been in contact with a case who became ill in April after travelling to the
haj. Another case of W135: 2a: P1.2, 5 meningococcal disease, a 1 year old
boy, arrived from Somalia with his parents in August. A 5 year old boy was
admitted to hospital in the north of England in the week ending 10 Nov
2000. Blood cultures grew _N. meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2, 5. The boy
apparently died, like an earlier case in Oldham. The boy was from a strict
Muslim Bangladeshi community and had not travelled to Saudi Arabia recently.
