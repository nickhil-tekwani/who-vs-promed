Chagas disease, a parasitical malady that can cause heart problems and is prevalent mainly in Latin America, has been detected in patients in the southern United States, according to a study released Tuesday [4 Nov 2014] that recommends paying more attention to it.

Researchers analyzed the routine tests performed on blood donors in Texas between 2008 and 2012 to detect Chagas disease, tests that have been obligatory in the United States since 2007 for people who donate blood, and they found that one out of every 6500 donors tested positive.

That figure is 50 times greater than the estimated infection rate used by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which says that there are 300 000 cases of Chagas disease nationwide, but researchers said their data are consistent with studies performed in other southern states.

The study headed by Melissa Nolan Garcia, an expert in tropical health at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, was presented during the 63rd annual meeting of the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene being held this week in New Orleans.

Nolan said that this is not a disease brought from another country or one that has arrived in the United States due to immigrant flows, but rather it "has already been here for some time," she told Efe.

"There are people who may have contracted it during a trip, but we also have evidence of infected people who have always lived here and have never left the country," a situation that, Nolan said, is a sign "of local infection."

Of the 40 "kissing bugs" collected in 11 Texas counties, researchers found that 73 percent carried the parasite, and half of them showed signs of having fed on human blood.

Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is potentially fatal and normally spread to people through the feces of blood-sucking so-called "kissing bugs," because they feed on people's faces while they are asleep. The disease, which can also be spread through infected blood, affects 7 to 8 million people worldwide and is curable if caught early enough.

The study looked at Chagas disease seropositivity and reports that the prevalence was highest in Hispanics (34/100 000) and mixed races (33/100 000), and lowest in Caucasians (5/100 000) and Asians (6/100 000). The study does not address the question of whether the serological results are true or false positives and does not provide any information on whether the non-Hispanics were truly infected or not, and if yes, whether they could have been infected outside the United States.

_Trypanosoma cruzi_ is found in triatome bugs in southern states of the US, but the extent of transmission to humans still needs to be determined. - Mod.EP
