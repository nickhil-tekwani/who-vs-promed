Elk and cattle near Riding Mountain National Park are being checked for
bovine tuberculosis after an old bull elk, that probably died of
injuries from fights during the rutting season, tested positive for the
disease. George Luterbach of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said
yesterday that it is only the third case of bovine tuberculosis ever
recorded in wild deer or elk in Canada.
Elk, moose and deer killed by hunters outside the park, located about
400 kilometers west of Winnipeg, were checked for disease last year, but
none tested positive for bovine tuberculosis. This year, samples will
again be tested until the hunting season ends at the end of January. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency is about to begin testing cattle within
five kilometers of the park's southern boundary. Elk kept on farms must
be tested every three years, although none in Manitoba has ever tested
positive for tuberculosis.
Last year, about 130 of Ray Armbruster's cattle were destroyed after a
Minnesota slaughterhouse traced an infected carcass back to his Rossburn
farm. Armbruster believes that wild elk infected his cattle, not the
other way around, and he said a testing program for wildlife in the area
is long overdue.
Tuberculosis is caused by acid-fast bacteria and can be spread between
animals at sites of congregation by aerosol or by contact with
exudates.This may be where cattle and wildlife share watering holes or
feeding areas, such as hay bales. Bovine tuberculosis is caused by
_Mycobacterium bovis_, does not survive exposure to sunlight, but can
survive cold temperatures.
Humans are susceptible to bovine tuberculosis, but Luterbach said that
it is highly unlikely hunters will contract the disease if they follow
standard practices such as washing their hands and cooking meat well.
