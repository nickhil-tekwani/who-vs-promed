[1] Lambda variant

A mutant coronavirus variant found in the UK is concerning health experts because it has "unusual mutations" which could make it resistant to vaccines.

The lambda strain was first detected in Peru last December [2020] and has now reached 27 countries, including the UK, which identified 6 cases between 23 Feb and 7 Jun [2021]. In Peru it now accounts for 82% of new cases and makes up 1/3 of all cases in neighbouring Chile.

This suggests the variant is more transmissible than the original strain of the disease. Data [show] it is possibly more contagious than the delta, alpha, and gamma variants -- first detected in India, the UK and Brazil [respectively]. This evidence also indicates vaccines may not offer as much protection against the lambda strain, which Public Health England (PHE) listed as a variant of concern on 23 Jun 2021.

Researchers at the University of Chile, in Santiago wrote in the study published on Thursday [1 Jul 2021]: "Our data show for the 1st time that mutations present in the spike protein of the lambda variant confer escape to neutralising antibodies and increased infectivity." They reached this conclusion after looking at blood samples from healthcare workers who had been given the CoronaVac vaccine from China.

The UK's COVID-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute said the lambda strain's "unusual set of mutations, compared with other variants" make it difficult to properly measure the threat of the strain. There are also worries over a lack of gene sequencing labs in South America.

Without the facilities to track the variant properly, the mutation could spread undetected. Despite Latin America accounting for just 8% of the world's population, the region makes up 20% of global coronavirus cases.

On top of the worrying rate the disease seems to be spreading, only one in 10 Latin Americans have been fully vaccinated with both doses. Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Carissa Etienne, said last week: "While we're seeing some reprieve from the virus in countries in the northern hemisphere, for most countries in our region the end remains a distant future."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Background: The newly described SARS-CoV-2 lineage C.37 was recently classified as a variant of interest by the WHO (lambda variant) based on its high circulation rates in South American countries and the presence of critical mutations in the spike protein. The impact of such mutations in infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies are entirely unknown.

"Methods: We performed a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay and determined the impact of the lambda variant on infectivity and immune escape using plasma samples from healthcare workers (HCW) from 2 centers in Santiago, Chile who received the 2-dose scheme of the inactivated virus vaccine CoronaVac.

"Results: We observed an increased infectivity mediated by the lambda spike protein that was even higher than that of the D614G (lineage B) or the alpha and gamma variants. Compared to the wild type (lineage A), neutralization was decreased by 3.05-fold for the lambda variant while it was 2.33-fold for the gamma variant and 2.03-fold for the alpha variant.

"Conclusions: Our results indicate that mutations present in the spike protein of the lambda variant of interest confer increased infectivity and immune escape from neutralizing antibodies elicited by CoronaVac. These data reinforce the idea that massive vaccination campaigns in countries with high SARS-CoV-2 circulation must be accompanied by strict genomic surveillance allowing the identification of new isolates carrying spike mutations and immunology studies aimed to determine the impact of these mutations in immune escape and vaccines breakthrough."

Epub 30 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00143-9

Summary
------
Background: Lateral flow devices (LFDs) for rapid antigen testing are set to become a cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 mass community testing, although their reduced sensitivity compared with PCR has raised questions of how well they identify infectious cases. Understanding their capabilities and limitations is, therefore, essential for successful implementation. We evaluated 6 commercial LFDs and assessed their correlation with infectious virus culture and PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values.

Methods: In a single-centre, laboratory evaluation study, we did a head-to-head comparison of 6 LFDs commercially available in the UK: Innova Rapid SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test, Spring Healthcare SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Cassette, E25Bio Rapid Diagnostic Test, Encode SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Device, SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test Cassette, and SureScreen COVID-19 Rapid Fluorescence Antigen Test. We estimated the specificities and sensitivities of the LFDs using stored naso-oropharyngeal swabs collected at St Thomas' Hospital (London, UK) for routine diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing by real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR). Swabs were from inpatients and outpatients from all departments of St Thomas' Hospital, and from healthcare staff (all departments) and their household contacts. SARS-CoV-2-negative swabs from the same population (confirmed by RT-rtPCR) were used for comparative specificity determinations.

All samples were collected between 23 Mar and 27 Oct 2020. We determined the limit of detection (LOD) for each test using viral plaque-forming units (PFUs) and viral RNA copy numbers of laboratory-grown SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, LFDs were selected to assess the correlation of antigen test result with RT-rtPCR Ct values and positive viral culture in Vero E6 cells. This analysis included longitudinal swabs from 5 infected inpatients with varying disease severities. Furthermore, the sensitivities of available LFDs were assessed in swabs (n = 23; collected from 4 Dec 2020 to 12 Jan 2021) confirmed to be positive (RT-rtPCR and whole-genome sequencing) for the B.1.1.7 variant, which was the dominant genotype in the UK at the time of study completion.

Findings: All LFDs showed high specificity (98.0% or greater), except for the E25Bio test (86.0% [95% CI 77.9-99.9]), and most tests reliably detected 50 PFU/test (equivalent SARS-CoV-2 N gene Ct value of 23.7, or RNA copy number of 3 x 10exp6/mL). Sensitivities of the LFDs on clinical samples ranged from 65.0% (55.2-73.6) to 89.0% (81.4-93.8). These sensitivities increased to greater than 90% for samples with Ct values of lower than 25 for all tests except the SureScreen fluorescence (SureScreen-F) test. Positive virus culture was identified in 57 (40.4%) of 141 samples; 54 (94.7%) of the positive cultures were from swabs with Ct values lower than 25.

Among the 3 LFDs selected for detailed comparisons (the tests with highest sensitivity [Innova], highest specificity [Encode], and alternative technology [SureScreen-F]), sensitivity of the LFDs increased to at least 94.7% when only including samples with detected viral growth. Longitudinal studies of RT-rtPCR-positive samples (tested with Innova, Encode, and both SureScreen-F and the SureScreen visual [SureScreen-V] test) showed that most of the tests identified all infectious samples as positive. Test performance (assessed for Innova and SureScreen-V) was not affected when reassessed on swabs positive for the UK variant B.1.1.7.

Interpretation: In this comprehensive comparison of antigen LFDs and virus infectivity, we found a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus, and antigen LFD positivity in clinical samples. Our data support regular testing of target groups with LFDs to supplement the current PCR testing capacity, which would help to rapidly identify infected individuals in situations in which they would otherwise go undetected.

Discussion
----------
By extensive head-to-head comparison, we found that most rapid antigen tests performed to a high standard, with good sensitivity and excellent specificity. Consistent with previous reports, the tests delivered an overall sensitivity of 65.0%-89.0% in comparison with RT-rtPCR (18-21 [see source URL for complete references]), increasing to greater than 90% for most tests for samples with Ct values of less than 25 (19,22,23). Among the Innova, Encode, and SureScreen-F tests, sensitivity increased to at least 95% when compared with samples that were infectious in vitro, with viral titre in the specimens correlating with Ct values. This study, to our knowledge, provides the most comprehensive comparison of antigen LFDs and infectivity to date, showing a clear relationship between Ct values, quantitative culture of infectious virus, and antigen LFD positivity, with the tests used in each analysis delivering reliable identification of infectious clinical samples.

Our data support the judicious use of LFDs for rapid antigen detection: not to replace PCR testing, but to supplement current testing capacity and rapidly identify infected individuals in situations in which they would otherwise go undetected. Although sensitivity is lower than with PCR-based testing, the rapid turnaround of these LFD tests, their versatility in terms of cost and portability, and their utility in disrupting transmission chains (2,29) originating from infectious asymptomatic individuals could outweigh the risk of missing positive cases.

[The concept of infected vs infectious is not well appreciated, yet important in interpretation of test results. An individual who is infected but not infectious may become infectious but is not at the time tested, therefore not a threat to spread of the virus at that time. However, they need to be rechecked regularly if there is concern they were exposed to virus. The LFDs perform well for checking for infectious individuals on the day they are tested. - Mod.LK]

https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/07/01/prisons-have-a-health-care-issue-and-it-starts-at-the-top-critics-say


Union leaders, prison healthcare workers and advocates for prisoners' rights said it was troubling that the people leading the federal prison system's Health Services Division during the COVID-19 crisis lacked medical licenses. Nearly 50 000 federal prisoners tested positive for COVID-19 as of last week, and at least 258 have died. The Bureau of Prisons came under fire last year [2020] from politicians and union leaders for pressuring guards to come to work sick, failing to follow its own pandemic plan and buying knock-off N-95 masks.

Concerns over medical care and the qualifications of those responsible for it -- from administrative leaders to staff members who treat patients -- are not unique to the federal system. From California to Alabama, news reports and public records show that prisons routinely hire underqualified and even disgraced medical staff.

The nonprofit National Commission on Correctional Health Care has urged since 1999 that jail and prison medical staff members have the same credentials as those who work outside, in settings like hospitals. But states often allow medical staffers in correctional facilities to work under licenses that are restricted because of past disciplinary issues -- and critics say it's part of the reason prisons were so ill-equipped to combat the coronavirus.

"To people who are inside, it's not always clear what the credentials are of the person who is treating them," said Andrea Armstrong, a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans who has studied prison medical care. "They have a general sense that they are getting the people who can't get jobs anywhere else."

Outside of prison, most patients can avoid bad doctors by doing some research and picking another physician -- but people behind bars cannot.

Sometimes, that meant [prisoners] refused medical care or just didn't seek it out. During the pandemic, prisoners from New York to Texas to California told [the author] they hid signs of illness or refused treatment because they didn't trust prison officials or medical staff. That suspicion is one reason some incarcerated people are still reluctant to get vaccinated, The Marshall Project reported. A little over 46% of US prisoners have gotten at least one shot, compared to more than 66% of the adults in the overall population.

"I actually refused the shot for being very fearful of getting it here," a federal prisoner told [the author] in June [2021]. She asked to be identified only by her 1st name -- [J] -- for fear of retaliation and said that during her time behind bars she's been dealing with an untreated hernia in her chest and has been taken off medication that seemed necessary, including blood pressure pills and antidepressants. "I feel like we have medical staff that does not know how to do their job correctly."

Eventually, [J] agreed to get vaccinated only because she read about judges who'd denied compassionate release to some prisoners who refused shots.

Armstrong, the law professor, said states often allow medical professionals who are barred from working in hospitals and private practices to work in institutional settings like prisons.

Recently, a BuzzFeed News investigation found 10 of the 12 doctors in Louisiana prisons -- including 6 medical directors -- had a history of license restrictions or suspensions due to everything from fraud to child pornography convictions. The report came weeks after a federal judge said the medical care in the state's biggest prison was constitutionally inadequate. A prison spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but previously told BuzzFeed that the hiring practices met state medical board standards.

Some corrections workers -- including Aaron McGlothin, the union president at Mendota federal prison in California -- said the agency's handling of the pandemic is proof of the need for more medical expertise among the system's executives. "They spent USD 3 million buying UV portals," McGlothin added. "They said these killed the coronavirus -- but they weren't FDA-approved."

That was something he considered when he declined to get vaccinated at work and instead waited several weeks to get the shot on his own. "I don't trust the agency," he said of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). "I'm not putting my health and safety in the hands of the BOP.

["For 15 months, The Marshall Project and The Associated Press tracked the spread of COVID-19 through prisons nationwide. We counted more than a half-million people living and working in prisons who got sick from the coronavirus. Prisons were forced to adapt to unusual and deadly circumstances. But now, as new cases are declining and facilities are loosening restrictions, there's little evidence to suggest enough substantive changes have been made to handle future waves of infection.

"With crowded conditions, notoriously substandard medical care and constantly shifting populations, prisons were ill-equipped to handle the highly contagious virus, which killed nearly 3000 prisoners and staff. There were 512 864 cases of coronavirus reported among prisoners and staff through June 2021.

"Corrections systems responded with inconsistent policies, struggling to contain the virus amid understaffing and overcrowding. At its peak in mid-December [2020], more than 25 000 prisoners tested positive in a single week.

"But in recent months, infections behind bars nationwide have slowed to a few hundred new cases each week, and many prisons have eased what restrictions they had in place, including mask-wearing, visitors and other movement in and out, going back to business as usual.

"It's a critical moment, with new coronavirus cases low but the threat of infection looming as new variants spread around the world, said Dr. David Sears, an infectious-disease specialist and correctional health consultant."

"According to the data collected by The Marshall Project and The Associated Press, about 3 in 10 people in state and federal prisons were infected with the virus. But correctional health experts widely agree that this number is an undercount.

"'A great many of the people who ever had COVID, they were never tested,' said Dr. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system who has inspected health conditions in prisons around the country over the last year. 'In most prisons it ran through these places like wildfire. People were never tested'" (excerpted from https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/06/30/a-half-million-people-got-covid-19-in-prison-are-officials-ready-for-the-next-pandemic). - Mod.LK]

Pain associated with worse COVID-19 in sickle cell disease
----------------------------------------------------------
A history of pain in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients -- the disease's most common complication -- is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes in children and adults, according to a Blood Advances study yesterday [1 Jul 2021] (https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/5/13/2717/476266/Comorbidities-are-risk-factors-for-hospitalization). SCD-related organ comorbidities were also related to worse COVID-19 outcomes in children.

The researchers looked at 750 international patients with COVID-19 and SCD from March 2020-2021. Almost half (48.5%) were children, median age 11, and the remaining were adults, median age 31. About 91% were Black and 7% were Latino.

Most had prior acute care visits for pain (55.5% children, 78.5% adults), and almost 1 in 3 had acute chest syndrome in the previous 3 years (29.4% children, 29.5% adults). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were pain (35.2% children, 67.4% adults) and acute chest syndrome (14.8% children, 29.5% adults), which made the researchers question if COVID infection triggered pain episodes.

Data showed that in children, their risk of severe COVID-19 increased with renal comorbidities (risk ratio [RR], 3.67), a history of pain (RR, 3.09), or heart or lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76), with the latter 2 conditions also connected with increased hospitalization risk (RRs, 2.15 and 1.61, respectively). In adults, the risk of COVID-19 severity increased with a history of pain (RR, 1.94).

Half of the patients were on hydroxyurea, a drug meant to reduce pain episode frequency, but the researchers did not find a link with COVID-19 hospitalization or severity. It was, however, associated with a lower risk of pain in adults.

"This study tells us that all individuals with sickle cell disease are not at equal levels of risk," said study author Lana Mucalo, MD, of the Medical College of Wisconsin, in an American Society of Hematology (ASH) press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/asoh-sir062421.php>). "Patients with a history of pain, as well as individuals with coexisting organ conditions, need to be even more careful to avoid COVID-19 infection than those without any comorbidities."

COVID risk from patient encounters appears low in emergency responders
----------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID incidence for emergency medical service (EMS) workers was not affected by work encounters with a COVID-19 patient, according to an Emerging Infectious Diseases study yesterday [1 Jul 2021] (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0363_article).

The researchers looked at EMS responses in King County, Washington, from 16 Feb-Jul 31 2020, and found that about 1% of all encounters were with a COVID-19 patient (1115), of which about 1 in 6 needed an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP), the most common being nonrebreather masks. (Over the study period, EMS workers received COVID-related protocols, including personal protective equipment guidelines. For instance, anytime an AGP was performed, the workers needed to don N95 respirators.)

By the end of the study period, 30 workers had tested positive for COVID-19, with only one linked with a COVID-19 patient encounter within the patient's incubation period (the patient had also needed at least one AGP). As for the other workers, 18 received positive diagnoses outside of their most recent COVID-19 patients' incubation period, and 11 never encountered a COVID-19 patient through work. EMS worker incidence for COVID-19 infection acquired anywhere was 0.57 infections per 10 000 person-days, and no significant change of incidences was attributed to a COVID patient encounter or not.

"We observed that the large majority of COVID-19 illness was a consequence of encounters not with patients but in the community or occupational settings," the researchers write. "These findings support efforts to screen workplaces for provider symptoms or initiate point-of-care provider testing to limit on-the-job exposure as well as to practice guideline-directed social distancing, masking, and hygiene recommendations outlined for the general public, acknowledging that vaccination may affect these directives."

Overall, about 55% of the region's first responders had contact with a COVID-19 patient, and while this includes patients beyond their transmission period, one-third also didn't display common symptoms. Across 8582 person-days, 705 EMS workers performed at least one AGP on COVID-19 patients within their viral incubation period, and across 26 583 person-days, 1389 workers treated a COVID-19 patient within their incubation period who did not need an AGP.

[In the past 24 hours, 8 countries, including Brazil (54 556), India (43 296), Indonesia (27 913), Colombia (26 928), South Africa (26 485), UK (24 741), Russia (24 439), and Argentina (14 034), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7283 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 1 Jul 2021 to late 2 Jul 2021). A total of 49 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 49 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.2% increase in daily reported cases and an 8.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 184.23 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.98 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
