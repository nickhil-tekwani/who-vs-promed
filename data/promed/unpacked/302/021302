Measles outbreak in travellers' camp site
-----------------------------------------
Primary school children are being offered the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] jab after an outbreak of measles on a nearby travellers site. One child living on the site has been diagnosed with measles while 2 more young people living on the Hall Lane camp in Moses Gate are showing early signs of developing the illness. Bolton health chiefs were alerted by the Health Protection Agency of the measles outbreak.

NHS Bolton's Public Health Team confirmed that one young person was affected and 2 more were showing early signs. More than a dozen youngsters living on the site have been immunised against the illness. Now, pupils at Bowness Primary School in Little Lever are being offered vaccination as children from the travelling community attend that school.

Graham Munslow, health protection specialist at NHS Bolton, said: "As a precautionary measure, we immunised 15 children on the site. As all primary school-aged children on the site attend Bowness Primary School, a letter will be sent home to parents, informing them of an optional MMR immunisation session at the school on Monday [24 Sep 2012].

The illness is rare in the UK due to the effectiveness of the MMR vaccination. But in May [2012] there were more than 200 confirmed cases of measles on Merseyside, which contributed to the worst outbreak of the disease since 1988. If parents are unsure whether their child has already received the MMR immunisation, they should contact NHS Bolton's Child Health team.

Measles epidemic kills 22 in Republic of Congo
---------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles, which has been raging in Likouala, North-eastern Republic of Congo, since April has already killed 22 people, the state-run radio said Friday [21 Sep 2012]. The epidemic, which initially hit Liranga and Betou, has now reached Impfondo and Epena.

Following the outbreak, the Ministry of Health on Thursday [27 Sep 2012] launched a 5-day vaccination campaign against measles in the district. Vaccination teams will travel throughout the localities of the Republic of the Congo, which since 2009 has sheltered more than 100 000 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), who are fleeing inter-ethnic violence in the Equateur province.

Measles outbreak in Ohangwena
-----------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Social Services started a measles vaccination campaign on Monday [24 Sep 2012] in areas of the Ohangwena Region bordering Angola to contain a measles outbreak there. The measles outbreak was confirmed by the acting health director in the region, Dr Odon Nkongolo, who said that most of the cases originated in Angola. Dr Nkongolo said the region experienced a smaller measles outbreak in the Engela Health District in January this year [2012].

The numbers of cases reported in the district in the last 2 months have shown a sharp increase. So far 68 suspected cases have been reported, of which 10 have been confirmed. Those confirmed to have contracted measles were treated at the Engela District Hospital. No deaths have been reported.

60 percent of the cases diagnosed were in children younger than 5 years, but children between 6 and 7 years, and adults, have also been diagnosed with measles. A number of people have been treated and discharged from the Engela hospital and by Tuesday [25 Sep 2012] only 5 children were still in hospital.

According to Dr Nkongolo, the latest measles outbreak has mostly affected villages or areas such as Oshikango, Onamhinda, Eeshoke, Okahadulu, Omafo and Oimbandalunga. "So far the situation is under control and measures have been put in place to vaccinate all children between 9 months and 5 years. This started already on Monday this week [24 Sep 2012] and we are still busy in those villages," Dr Nkongolo said.

They are also monitoring the situation in nearby villages in the Engela Health District. He said the Angolan health authorities have been contacted through the World Health Organisation.

Measles outbreak: Children infected in Kalam
--------------------------------------------
Over 100 children have been infected with measles during the last 2 days in Kalam Tehsil, it has been learnt. The disease is spreading fast as there are not enough health facilities or doctors in the area, Ahmadin Siddiqui, a local journalist and social activist, told The Express Tribune. Dozens of children are being brought to local hospitals daily and dispensers are performing the duties of doctors as an emergency measure, said Siddiqui. He said the reason for the outbreak, according to health experts, is that the children had not been administered the required vaccines to protect them against measles.

Locals have demanded of the government to provide better health facilities in the area and appoint a permanent doctor at Kalam's central hospital. Dr Mohammad Imran, who runs a private clinic in Kalam, said that vaccination campaigns by the government are "weak" in the area and parents don't bother to get their children vaccinated against the disease. He said the best way to protect children against measles is to administer the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine after the age of one. Given the present outbreak, he urged local parents to get their children between the ages of 4 to 6 vaccinated against the disease.

The central hospital in Kalam lacks the required health facilities and it is next to impossible for a majority of locals to go to hospitals in Mingora for vaccination, said Nazir Ahmad, a university student. He stressed that the health department should establish permanent vaccination centres in Kalam and send mobile teams to remote villages to prevent further outbreaks. Executive District Officer (EDO) Health Dr Khurshid said that medical teams have been dispatched to the affected areas which have so far administered vaccines to 88 children. He said that after clubbing [sic] details of the vaccination drive being conducted in Kalam and Matiltan, where 2 children recently died of measles, the teams have so far visited 700 houses and vaccinated 273 children. Dr Khurshid said that locals are also being informed about preventive measures they should take to avoid spread of the disease.

The EDO said that a qualified doctor has been appointed in Kalam's central hospital, adding that he will be taking charge of his duties soon.

Confirmed case of measles in Dutchess County
--------------------------------------------
The Department of Health announced today a confirmed case of measles in a student at the Mountain Laurel Waldorf School in New Paltz. Anyone who has visited this school since 10 Sep 2012 or has had any contact with anyone from this school should immediately make sure that they are up to date with their measles vaccinations. All medical practices and laboratories in the area should be on high alert that there may be a number of other children and families who have been exposed and could be communicable.

The Department of Health in Dutchess County says that they have learned that a number of students at this school were not vaccinated and may become ill and put other children and families at risk for contracting measles. This highly contagious disease has increased in the United States recently due to a growing number of unvaccinated individuals who travel to countries where measles is prevalent. Those who were born before 01 Jan 1957, or who have documentation they have received 2 MMR vaccinations, are believed to be immune. All others should consider vaccination, especially if they have contact with anyone who has measles.

"While most of the population is immune, about 97 percent of Dutchess County residents," said Michael C. Caldwell, MD, MPH, Dutchess County Commissioner of Health. "These exposures place non-immune individuals at risk of becoming infected. Of greatest concern are infants less than 12 months of age, pregnant women, and persons who have immunocompromising conditions as they have the highest risk for severe complications."

Measles symptoms include fever, red watery eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. About one out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and up to one out of 20 gets pneumonia. Pregnant women who are exposed may put their baby at risk for birth defects. Individuals who are experiencing these symptoms should call their provider prior to going to the health care office so precautionary methods can be taken in order to reduce the potential spread of measles.

Before measles vaccine, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. Historically, 450-500 people died each year in the United States because of measles, 48 000 were hospitalized, 7000 had seizures, and about 1000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness.

Today, there are only about 50 cases a year reported in the United States, and most of these originate outside the country. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. A total of 50 cases of measles have been reported in the United States to date during 2012, of which 46 were import-associated. During 2011, a total of 222 cases of measles were reported in the U.S. Most patients (86 percent) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. "The increased numbers of outbreaks and measles importations into the United States underscore the ongoing risk for measles among unvaccinated persons and the importance of vaccination against measles," said Caldwell.

The Dutchess County Department of Health sounded the alarm to the medical community about the increased risk of measles in our community with a public health alert Thursday and Friday [20-21 Sep 2012]. "We have been in close communication with medical providers and our colleagues at the Ulster County Department of Health as well as the New York State Department of Health," said Dr. Caldwell.
