For release, 7 Jul 2004: Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) Caseload Climbs; Disease
Detected in Colorado
3 states -- Texas, New Mexico and Colorado -- now have confirmed cases of
vesicular stomatitis (VS), a sporadic, naturally occurring disease that
causes blister-like lesions, that can affect horses, cattle, swine, goats,
deer or other animals.
The infection is thought to be transmitted by sand flies, or black flies,
and, while usually not fatal, it can cause animals to go off feed, become
lame, or lose milk production, while lesions heal in the animal's mouth, on
the muzzle, teats, or above the hooves. Infected animals, and their
susceptible herd mates, are restricted to their premises under a short-term
quarantine to prevent potential animal-to-animal disease transmission.
Colorado State Veterinarian Wayne Cunningham has reported that tests have
confirmed infection in 2 head of cattle, and in 2 horses, in Las Animas
County in southeastern Colorado, as well as, in one horse on a premise in
the central part of the state in Douglas County.
In New Mexico, livestock are quarantined on 11 premises due to VS
infection. These include 6 premises in the Carlsbad area, 3 in Valencia
County near Albuquerque, one in Grant County in southwestern New Mexico,
and one in Cibola County in the northwestern part of the state.
With the exception of infected cattle on 2 of the 5 quarantined premises in
Starr County, all cases in Texas involve only horses. Other cases in Texas
have been confirmed on one premise each in Reeves, Uvalde, Dimmit, Yoakum,
and Val Verde counties.
To report potential signs of VS, owners and practitioners should contact
their state veterinarian's office so that a disease investigation, and
appropriate testing, can be conducted. This investigation and testing will
be done at no cost to the livestock owner.

[It is unfortunate that, on the USDA web-site, as well as in this press
release, the relevant area of Colorado is not more specifically indicated.
Likewise, with VS continuing to spread, it would be most helpful if USDA
would provide us with the strain types of the viruses involved. - Mod.TG]
