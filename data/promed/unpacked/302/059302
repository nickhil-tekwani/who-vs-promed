MENINGOCOCCEMIA - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
====================================

---------------------------------
After 14 probable cases including 6 deaths in the past month, Public Health
Secretary Erasmo Vasquez declared epidemic alerts for this disease on Sat. 3
May, 1997 for 3 cities near the capital, Santo Domingo.
The cities are Sabana Grande de Boya, San Pedro de Macoris and San Cristobal.
The disease is airborne; the symptoms include constant sneezing, runny nose,
fever and neck stiffness, and a rash (petechiae) or purple blotches on the
skin (ecchymoses). The causative bacterium, the meningococcus, is the same
one that causes meningococcal meningitis, inflammation of the membranes
surrounding the brain. When this bacterium invades the bloodstream it
produces an infection that can kill in less than 24 hours.
To place this outbreak in perspective, in the USA about 2600 cases of
meningococcal disease occur each year, with a fatality rate of less than 10%.
[Meningococcemia is a small proportion of that total, but its death rate is
higher. The infection can be treated successfully with sulfonamide drugs -
