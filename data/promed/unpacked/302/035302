France has culled 600 000 to 650 000 chickens, ducks and other poultry over the past month, officials said on Friday [31 Dec 2021], in a race to contain an avian flu virus threatening to become the 4th major outbreak in the country since 2015. The Agriculture Ministry reported virus clusters at 26 factory farms, mainly in the south west -- home to France's lucrative foie gras pate industry -- as well as 15 cases in wild fowl and 3 in backyards.

The government ordered farmers in November 2021 to keep poultry indoors in a bid to stop the spread of the virus by migratory birds, though the 1st case was detected later that month, at a site in the north. The 1st case to strike the south west, where most outbreaks are now located, came on 16 Dec 2021, the ministry said.

Last winter more than 500 farms experienced massive infections that resulted in the culling of some 3.5 million birds, mainly ducks, prompting the government to spend millions of euros in compensation. Poultry farmers had already been hit by massive bird flu outbreaks during the winters of 2015-16 and 2016-17.

[During the winter of 2020/2021, the main avian influenza strain in France was HPAI H5N8. Its last cases were reported in September 2021 from backyard poultry in the north east; at the same time, the same strain circulated also in Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Denmark.

The current avian influenza virus strain circulating in France is HPAI H5N1. The 1st discovery of this strain in France, reported to the OIE on 27 Mar 2021, involved a Brent goose, found dead in Normandy, a flyway from north Europe along the Atlantic Ocean. This event remained solitary until the start of the major European HPAI H5N1 epizootic in the fall of 2021. Since 1 Oct 2021 and as of 22 Dec 2021, 115 (including 3 wild birds) were reported from France, involving domestic chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys and wild birds (including wild mute swan and greylag goose (table 1 in FAO/EMPRES update of 23 Dec 2021 at https://bit.ly/3qISaNy). - Mod.AS]

Europe is experiencing its worst-ever bird flu outbreak, according to a German government research institute. "We are currently experiencing the strongest avian flu epidemic ever in Germany and Europe," the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), Germany's Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa).

New cases are detected daily, and it is not only wild birds being affected, according to the institute. "There is no end in sight -- the countries affected range from Finland to the Faroe Islands to Ireland, from Russia to Portugal," according to researchers. Cases have also been found in Canada, India and East Asia.

In Germany alone, 394 infections have been recorded in wild birds including ducks, geese, swans and seagulls between the start of October [2021] and 29 Dec 2021. The cases were detected primarily along the coast. FLI also recorded 46 infections at German poultry farms.

In the same timeframe across Europe, the FLI data showed 675 infections in wild birds and 534 infections in livestock. There were also additional cases in mammals this year [2021], for example, among red foxes in the Netherlands and Finland, grey seals in Sweden, harbor seals in Germany and otters in Finland.

In the Czech Republic, authorities said on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021] that some 80 000 hens were due to be culled after more than 100 000 animals died of bird flu since late last week. The farm in Libotenice, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) north of Prague, had a total of 188 000 hens before Christmas. "The culling of hens from halls affected by bird flu is under way," State Veterinary Administration spokesperson Petr Majer told Agence France-Presse (AFP). "The numbers show that this strain, the highly pathogenic H5N1, is very aggressive and kills hens in particular fast and on a mass scale," he added. He said vets would also destroy over a million eggs from the farm.

The Czech Republic has registered 48 outbreaks of bird flu this year [2021], the highest number in a calendar year in history. The disease is currently plaguing Europe, with France reporting an outbreak in its foie gras producing Landes region last week. "Clinical signs leave no doubt and it was decided to cull the flock" on Saturday [18 Dec 2021], the day after the outbreak was identified, Marie-Helene Cazaubon, head of the Landes chamber of agriculture, said nearly 2 weeks ago.

Local authorities have established a 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] surveillance zone around the farm. It is the 2nd outbreak detected in the south west since a major epidemic last year [2020] led to the culling of 2.5 million ducks and geese.

Early last month [November 2021] health authorities asked organic and open-air poultry raisers to confine their fowl as a measure to avoid contact with migratory birds that might carry the virus. "We are in a migratory corridor through which birds fly from northern Europe...and we must be very vigilant," said Cazaubon, herself a duck farmer. Cazaubon noted that most of the ducks and geese have already been slaughtered for their fatty liver, to be made into the famous foie gras pate popular during the holiday season. The tradition runs deep in France, but it is controversial because the birds are force-fed in order to fatten their livers artificially. About a quarter of French foie gras comes from Landes, which counts around 800 farms, mainly raising ducks.

Another outbreak of bird flu has been detected in a rural county in East Anglia in England. According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the H5N1 was found in the Watlington area, near King's Lynn. Temporary 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] and 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] surveillance zones have been deployed around the affected areas. A previous case of avian influenza was found in poultry at Holkham. Two cases of avian influenza were detected in Essex last month [November 2021].

[3] UK: commercial poultry farms, spread

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 was confirmed on Tuesday [28 Dec 2021] in 2 commercial poultry facilities, one near Watlington in Norfolk, the other near North Somercotes in Lincolnshire. According to the government report, all birds on the infected premises will be humanely culled. A 3-km [1.8 mi] protection zone and 10-km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone has been put in place around each of the premises.

Yesterday [29 Dec 2021], the government revoked the 10-km surveillance zones around 2 premises in Lancashire following successful completion of disease control activities. Local movement restrictions have now been removed, but the avian influenza prevention zone (AIPZ) measures remain in place.

Slovenia reported on Monday [27 Dec 2021] an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus at a small poultry farm in the east of the country, the STA news agency reported, quoting the country's agency for food safety and veterinary and plant protection.

A veterinarian reported on Sunday [26 Dec 2021] an increase in deaths of poultry at a farm in Slovenska Bistrica. The authorities said all necessary measures have been implemented in infected areas and called on farmers to immediately report any new suspicious cases.

Many cases of H5N1 bird flu have been reported across Europe since the beginning of December 2021.

According to FAO's most recent monthly update on pathogenic avian influenza (23 Dec 2021), HPAI outbreaks in animals officially reported since last update (24 Nov 2021): in total, 651 outbreaks have been reported in 4 geographic regions (Africa, Americas, Asia, and Europe) caused by H5 HPAI (44), H5N1 HPAI (594), H5N5 HPAI (4), and H5N8 HPAI (9).
