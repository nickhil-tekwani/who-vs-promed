Dengue outbreak hits Sarangani town
------------------------------------
Health officials in Sarangani province have declared an outbreak of
dengue hemorrhagic fever. The outbreak has already killed at least 4
children in 5 villages in the capital town of Alabel. Cornelia
Baldelovar, officer-in-charge of the Sarangani provincial health
office, said the mosquito-borne disease has afflicted at least 19
children since the rainy season started last month [June 2004].
Citing a report from Dr. Honorato Fabio, Alabel municipal health
officer Baldelovar said the affected barangays are Poblacion,
Maribulan, Alegria, Spring, and Kawas.
Based on its monitoring, conducted from 6 Jun - 12 Jul 2004, most of
the cases happened in the Poblacion area, where 11 children were
affected. "We consider the situation now as alarming, since the
number of recorded cases already constitutes an outbreak," Baldelovar
said.
Baldelovar said the Alabel municipal government already conducted
fogging operations to help contain further spread of the disease. She
said the municipal health office has also sought the immediate
allocation of P 200 000 [USD 3600] for the purchase of medicines for
the affected children, most of whom are confined to the district
hospital here. Baldelovar said they have also launched an information
campaign, at the barangay level, about the disease and about some
possible remedial measures.
She said they particularly instructed residents to remove all
possible breeding places of mosquitoes inside, and outside, of their
houses, such as tin cans, rubber tires, and bottles, or, drain
accumulated water from trees and plants.

Sri Lanka struggles with dengue
--------------------------------
The latest casualty figures for Sri Lanka's worst-ever dengue
epidemic indicate that nearly 60 people have died, and almost 9500
have been affected.
According to Health Ministry officials, the heavy, widespread monsoon
was intensifying the breeding of the dengue mosquito. And, with
common cold and viral flu spreading in the country, more and more
dengue cases are being misidentified as normal flu cases at the early
stage.
Several health action and patients' groups have urged president
Chandrika Kumaratunga to appoint a high-powered presidential task
force to coordinate the campaign against dengue in cooperation with
civic action groups. Meanwhile, the presidential secretariat launched
a week-long anti-dengue campaign yesterday [23 Jul 2004]. It has
appealed to all citizens to cooperate in stopping the epidemic.

A 2nd Saudi has died in a private hospital in Jeddah as a result of
dengue fever, Okaz daily reported yesterday [Mon 26 Jul 2004].
The cases of suspected dengue fever reported in Jeddah hospitals have
now reached 251. Of these, 145 cases were confirmed by laboratory
tests. Most of these cases were treated, and only 11 patients remain
in the hospital.
A health care official in Jeddah said the health department was
monitoring the situation, which was brought under control thanks to
preventive measures adopted by the disease-control team. The official
said a number of precautionary measures have been taken to prevent
the disease from spreading. These include spraying mosquitoes, and
their breeding areas, and increasing public awareness about the
disease.
In Saudi Arabia, the water-rich areas around Najran are high-risk
areas. Other parts of the country, especially cities in the Western
Region, are also vulnerable, as visitors from infected regions, or
other countries, may arrive carrying the virus.

Yishun reports highest number of dengue cases in a week
-----------------------------------------------
The number of dengue cases surged last week [3rd week July 2004],
with Yishun being the worst affected area. A total of 222 cases were
reported, compared to a weekly average of 68 earlier in 2004. The
National Environment Agency [NEA] said warmer weather, and
intermittent rain, were partly to blame for the high numbers.
The most affected area, so far, is Ang Mo Kio, where about 300 cases
were reported this year [2004]. Yishun is next, with about 230 cases.
Most of the cases happened just last week [3rd week July 2004],
making that week the peak of dengue in Singapore in 2004.
The majority of the dengue cases in Yishun were caused by indoor
mosquito breeding, including the breeding of mosquitoes along the
corridors. The most common breeding grounds are flower pot plates.
All it takes is just a few drops of water in the plate for the Aedes
mosquitoes to breed. The NEA said more households were breeding
mosquitoes, some 2 to 3 times more, than just a few years ago.
Mr. Khoo Seow Poh, Director-General of Public Health at NEA, said:
"everyone knows stagnant water breeds mosquitoes, but, they need to
have the habit to clear stagnant water once a week. It is a question
of discipline and playing their part in removing sources of mosquito
breeding." The NEA hopes to reverse this trend by raising awareness
through its "Mozzie Attack" campaign, and it has spent over SGD 8
million [USD 4 629 000] fighting dengue in 2004.

Nearly 3000 dengue cases in Singapore; authorities blame standing water
-----------------------------------------------
Cases of dengue fever in Singapore could surpass a 5-year high in
2004, with authorities blaming the trend on a significant increase in
the number of mosquitoes breeding in public housing.
An average of 103 people a week in Singapore contracted dengue fever,
bringing the total, so far this year [2004], to nearly 3000 cases,
with one fatality, National Environment Agency spokeswoman Jacqueline
See said.
The latest figures follow an already 5-year high in the city-state
last year [2003], when 4772 people were infected, and 6 died, with
the mosquito-borne disease that is characterized by high fever,
headaches, aching joints, and skin rashes.
The NEA said, on its web-site, that the upsurge was due to a
"worrying trend" in the rising number of homes in which standing
water was present, allowing mosquitoes to breed. The agency estimated
that 18 of every 1000 public housing flats bred the insects, triple
the number from 2003. Around 80 percent of Singapore's 4 million
citizens live in public housing. The tightly controlled city-state
issues fines for people who leave watering cans, buckets, and other
containers with stagnant water, in the open.
