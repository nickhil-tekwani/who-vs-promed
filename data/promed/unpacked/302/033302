[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Benue State)

The death toll in the recent cholera outbreak in Otukpo Local Government Area of Benue State has continued to rise, with the epidemic claiming 12 more lives, including women and children.

Also, at least 80 victims of the epidemic are now receiving treatment at the Otukpo General Hospital and a few private hospitals in the town. Vanguard gathered that the disease, which earlier broke out in Otukpo Wards 1 and 2, had, as of yesterday [14 Nov 2013], spread to 4 council wards, which include Allan Akpa, Otobi Akpa and Ewulo.

A nurse at the Otukpo General Hospital, who preferred anonymity, told Vanguard that the disease had reached an epidemic level in the town. She said: "Since we noticed the 1st outbreak of the disease in Otukpo main town some few weeks ago, the ailment has continued to spread to other parts of the council, and the fear is that it is becoming excessively prevalent. There is hardly a day that we do not record new cases of the disease in the hospital, and most of the patients are usually from the main town. The situation at the hinterlands and neighbouring villages is even worse, because we hear daily of new cases and deaths in these communities. And the figure keeps rising due mainly to lack of proper medical care for victims."
