Lack of Transmission of Chronic Wasting Disease to Cynomolgus Macaques. Brent Race; Katie Williams; Christina D. Orr√∫; Andrew G. Hughson; Lori Lubke, and Bruce Chesebro

Abstract:
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal prion disease that can infect deer, elk and moose. CWD was 1st recognized in captive deer kept in wildlife facilities in Colorado from 1967-1979. CWD has now been detected in 25 states of the USA, 2 Canadian provinces, South Korea, Norway and Finland. It is currently unknown whether humans are susceptible to CWD infection. Understanding the health risk from consuming meat and/or products from CWD-infected cervids is a critical human health concern. Prior research using transgenic mouse models and in vitro conversion assays suggest that a significant species barrier exists between CWD and humans. To date, published epidemiologic studies of humans consuming cervids in CWD endemic areas have found no evidence to confirm CWD transmission to humans. Previously, we reported data from ongoing cross-species CWD transmission studies using 2 species of non-human primates as models. Squirrel monkeys (SM) and Cynomolgus macaques (CM) were inoculated by either intracerebral or oral routes with brain homogenates from CWD-infected deer and elk containing high levels of infectivity. SM were highly susceptible to CWD infection while CM were not. In the current study, we present new data for 7 CWD-inoculated CM euthanized from 11-13 years post CWD-inoculation and eight additional uninoculated control CM. New and archival CM tissues were screened for prion infection using the ultrasensitive RT-QuIC assay, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In this study, there was no clinical, pathological or biochemical evidence suggesting that CWD was transmitted from cervids to CM.

Background and terms of reference
The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) has asked the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food and Environment (VKM) for a statement about the recently published (EFSA, 2018) opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding chronic wasting disease (CWD).

The NFSA has requested VKM to assess whether EFSA's recent report (EFSA, 2018) provides any basis for changing the conclusions reached in VKM's previous opinions on CWD (VKM 2016, VKM 2017a, VKM 2017b), and whether these conclusions from VKM are still applicable.VKM appointed a working group consisting of one member of the Panel on Biological Hazards and one external expert to prepare a statement document answering the question. Both experts participated in the preparation of VKM's CWD reports in 2016 and 2017.

The working group also consisted of a project leader from the VKM staff. The Panel on biological Hazards was requested to read and comment on the statement.

Statement
Since the discovery of CWD in Norway in 2016, VKM has, on the request of NFSA, developed and published 3reports addressing specific questions from NFSA and considering several major aspects of this unexpected challenge (VKM, 2016; VKM, 2017a; VKM, 2017b). The zoonotic risk of CWD was evaluated by VKM in the phase I report (VKM, 2016) and readdressed in the phase III report (VKM, 2017b), which specifically considered the data emerging from ongoing studies led by Dr. Stefanie Czub (University of Calgary / Canadian Food Inspection Agency), in which some Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) fed meat containing CWD prions developed prion disease (Cruz, S. 2017; VKM, 2017b).

Although there are no reports of human disease caused by CWD, and nor are there any epidemiological data suggesting an increased occurrence of human prion disease in regions endemic for CWD, transmission of CWD to humans cannot be excluded. Experiments have shown that the species barrier for transmission of CWD prions and other prions from livestock, such as sheep scrapie, to humans, appears to be strong. Nevertheless, it is probably not absolute.

Importantly, different strains (varieties) of CWD prions exist, and early data from the Norwegian cases indicate that the Norwegian CWD prions might differ from those observed in North America. Transmission experiments are ongoing with Norwegian CWD isolates, and full characterization of these will take years to complete. However, preliminary observations (Sylvie L. Benestad, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, personal communication) do not suggest that there is an increased human risk associated with the Norwegian CWD isolates. Currently, we are not aware of data that indicate that there is a need for further reassessment of the zoonotic risk of CWD, thus maintaining the evaluation "very low risk."

VKM Report 2018:34
In response to requests from the European Commission, EFSA has issued 2 comprehensive scientific opinions (Phase I and II) concerning the emergence of CWD in Europe (EFSA, 2017; EFSA, 2018). The phase I report from EFSA, published in January 2017 (EFSA, 2017), addressed surveillance, animal health risks, and public health risks, whereas the phase II report, released in December 2017 (EFSA, 2018) focused on the important topic of diagnostic methods for CWD and the validity of the methods currently available.

Conclusion
Overall, evaluations of the animal and public health risks associated with CWD, as discussed in the reports from EFSA, correspond well with the assessments from VKM. We are not aware of new information to suggest that the assessments concerning CWD published by VKM should be revised.

The information and statements presented by EFSA (2018) are in accordance with VKM's conclusions regarding the zoonotic potential of CWD, and do not contain new data that make it necessary to change our current and published opinion. Hence, our conclusions are still applicable, and there is presently no need for any revision.

[The article by the Journal of the American Society for Microbiology (the 1st article) is much longer, but the abstract provides sufficient information.

The 2nd article is much shorter, and, as readers may not be familiar with all the abbreviations, it seemed more appropriate to use the majority of the article. The reference may be found in the original paper.

Essentially, it would seem both articles are stating there is no clinical, pathological or biochemical evidence suggesting CWD was transmitted from cervids to _Cynomolgus macaques_.

These statements likely stem from a 2016 study indicating _Cynomolgus macaques_ may be susceptible to CWD https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tbed.12612, and while more research was needed, the seed of possibility of CWD being transmissible to primates was planted. However, these articles seem to put the possibility of transmission of CWD into primates into a more doubtful category. Likely, we will see more research on this topic in coming year. - Mod.TG]
