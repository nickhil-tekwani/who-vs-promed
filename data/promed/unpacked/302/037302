US scientists have confirmed the 1st reported case of pig meningitis
in a human being in North America. The patient is a previously
healthy 59-year-old farmer from upstate New York who was hospitalized
with meningitis. The hospital's preliminary tests revealed the
presence of _Streptococcus suis_, a bacterium prevalent in pigs,
which can lead to meningitis.
"This should heighten awareness of the possibility of this illness
for people with the occupation of dealing with swine," said Kara
Willenburg, MD, of Bassett Hospital. "But it should not affect the
lives of the general public."
Farmers can contract the disease from handling pigs and their feces.
Butchers are also at risk. Washing hands and cooking pork thoroughly
can minimize the risk.
Ruth Zadoks, research associate and veterinarian at Cornell
University's College of Veterinary Medicine, provided the insights
and a DNA-level analysis of _S. suis_ strains found in both the
farmer and the pigs from his farm. With the farmer's bacterial
cultures and the pig samples, Zadoks confirmed that the patient was
indeed infected with _S. suis_.
"Even though we did not match the human strain with those of the
pigs, the strain from the farmer matches superficially a strain found
in both pigs and humans in Denmark and the Netherlands," said Zadoks.
"Some strains are more likely to cause disease in humans."
_S. suis_ has occasionally affected humans in Europe over the last 20
years. However, people have regularly contracted the disease in
Southeast Asia, especially China, where a 2005 outbreak resulted in
204 human cases with 38 deaths, and some 600 pigs killed. In 2005,
South America also documented its 1st case from Argentina.
"It could be that the disease is spreading," said Zadoks. "But also
we may be just better at recognizing it."
All human cases of _S. suis_ have originated with an animal infecting
a human. Public health officials have no fears that the pig bacteria
will spread from one human to another.

[This case represents the more classic meningitis presentation of
human _S. suis_ infection. Although it is stated that this case was
the 1st in North America, a 2002 paper (Marie J, Morvan H,
Berthelot-Herault F, et al: Antimicrobial susceptibility of
_Streptococcus suis_ isolated from swine in France and from humans in
different countries between 1996 and 2000. J Antimicrob Chemotherap
2002;50: 201-209 available at
<http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201>) discusses
4 human isolates of _S. suis_ from Canada.
In addition, the University of Iowa website
(<http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/CEID/Suis.htm>) regarding this
organism states, "The bacterium has caused sporadic illness in other
countries as well, including Canada, and a human case of infection
with the bacterium has recently been described in the USA. Several
investigators have suggested this low number of cases in the USA is
due to under- or misdiagnosis, rather than a true absence of this
disease in the human population." It is possible that the site is
referring to the New York case.
The 2005 Chinese outbreak was atypical because most previous cases
had been sporadic, not in an outbreak, and cases of streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome (STSS) occurred. The outbreak was summarized in
Yu H, Jing H, Chen Z, et al: Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12: 914-20
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol12no06/05-1194.htm>. Part of the
discussion (with citations removed) is found below:
Beginning mid-Jun 2005, a major outbreak of _S. suis_ killed 647 pigs
in almost the same areas as the outbreak in humans. The outbreak in
swine peaked around 20 Jul 2005 with about 4 dead pigs in each
affected village. _S. suis_ caused 98 percent of the deaths of these
pigs in Sichuan during this period. All infected pigs came from
backyard farms, usually with one sick pig in the herd. A pathogenic
strain could have spread by distributing infected piglets to the
backyard pig farms and then propagated among healthy pigs. The single
ribotype identified in the investigation lends support to this theory.
The main risk factor for _S. suis_ infection in the outbreak was
direct involvement in slaughtering sick pigs and preparing carcasses
of pigs that died of unknown causes. Unlike professionals in modern
abattoirs, the local farmers did not wear protective gear or gloves.
Normally one or 2 persons carried out the procedure, which involved
bloodletting though a neck artery, manually inflating the carcasses,
scalding the pigskin with about 80 deg. C water, and splitting and
shaving the skin with large knives. Scalding and shaving were often
performed together. The farmers then sliced the meat into smaller
pieces before cooking for food. The complete process of slaughtering
could take more than one hour. Our study demonstrated that all
patients had been infected during direct contact with blood or
tissues of sick or dead pigs. Often, this may have occurred through
direct exposure of skin wounds. Droplet exposure may also have
occurred during slaughter or processing of carcasses, but we could
not document this occurrence. The observed risk factors were
consistent with those reported in other studies. No evidence of
infection from eating cooked pork from these pigs was observed. The
uncooked meat was shared with neighboring families, but these
villagers normally do not eat raw meat or raw animal viscera.
Person-to-person transmission was highly unlikely since we found no
disease in family members, neighbors, or healthcare workers who had
not been exposed to sick or dead pigs.
One missing link in the outbreak is the exact relationship between a
dead goat in the early cluster of patients and the subsequent
propagation of the _S. suis_ infections. We could not confirm these 2
cases microbiologically. We speculate that _S. suis_ caused these 2
early human infections because they occurred shortly after exposure
to the dead goat, and because clinical manifestations in the 2
patients were similar to those of others in the outbreak. Human _S.
suis_ infection after exposure to sick goats has not been reported,
despite isolation of the organism from these animals. In backyard
farms where different animals are kept together, _S. suis_ infection
could have been transmitted between pigs and goats. Animal
surveillance would help establish the role of animals other than pigs
in carriage of the bacteria and the potential for causing human infections.
Clinically, 3 distinctive forms of human _S. suis_ infection
occurred, namely, STSS, sepsis, and meningitis. STSS has not been
reported from _S. suis_ infection, although it has been previously
described in other streptococcal infections and [a similar illness
from] _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections. Unusual STSS-like illnesses
brought the outbreak to the attention of local health authorities. A
dose effect may explain the relatively high proportion of STSS in
this outbreak. While other explanations like co morbid conditions,
e.g., asplenia, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, and malignancy, have
been reported, this was not the case for the outbreak in our study,
which involved previously healthy adults.
Laboratory examination confirmed virulence factors in the _S. suis_
isolates from this outbreak. They include mrp, sly, and ef, although
their precise clinical role has not yet been shown. These isolates
(mrp+, ef+, sly+) are related to European strains that are considered
to be more virulent than North American strains. Genome analysis
could determine if novel virulence genes were involved. - Mod.LL]
