[South Korea reported the outbreak clusters in 2 geographically
different regions as separate epizootics. Both have now been
eradicated by stamping out without vaccination and consequently
declared as resolved. This will enable Souuth Korea to apply to
regain soon its status as FMD-free country without vaccination.

Early detection and diagnosis enabled immediate, meticulous
application of the required control measures, contributing to this
remarkable achievement. - Mod.AS]
