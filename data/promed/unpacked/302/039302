New H5N1 bird flu case confirmed in Myanmar
-------------------------------------------
A new bird flu case has occurred in Myanmar's Bago division, the
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Yangon Office
confirmed Tuesday [31 Jul 2007]. A poultry farm in the Letpadan
township of the division, 136 km [84.5 miles] north of Yangon, was
detected with the avian influenza on last Thursday [26 Jul 2007], the
FAO representative told Xinhua.
Confirming on Tuesday [31 Jul 2007] that the virus is H5N1, the
Myanmar livestock authorities have taken measures including culling
of a total of 3800 birds, he said.
Before the case, H5N1 virus were found in 2 poultry farms in
Thanphyuzayat, southeastern Mon state earlier on last Tuesday [24 Jul
2007] and more than 300 chickens in the farms were slaughtered. Local
related departments are cooperating in preventing the disease from
further spreading.
In June [2007], some 4 bird flu cases occurred at farms in 3
townships of Hmawby, Insein and Bago. That residual virus was found
during the post-outbreak surveillance period which ran from 7 May 7
to 9 June 2007, earlier reports said, adding that during that period,
a total of nearly 2000 chickens were culled for risk prevention.
Bird flu, which broke out in 5 townships in Yangon over the period
from 28 Feb to 31 Mar 2007, was claimed to have been contained and
restrictions on transport and sale of chickens, ducks, quills and
their products in those areas [were] lifted on 22 Apr 2007. The 5
townships were Mayangon, Hlaingtharya, North Okkalapa, Mingaladon and Hmawby.
According to official statistics, during the bird flu outbreak
period, nearly 2000 fowls died of the virus with 65 812 poultry from
the affected farms and those nearby were culled.
In the fight against the disease, Myanmar has been cooperating with
experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] and USAID.
According to the Myanmar authorities, no human cases have so far been
detected with bird flu virus in the country.
