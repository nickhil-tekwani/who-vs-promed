The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries held a meeting in its headquarters on [Fri 22 Feb 2019] in order to study measures required to prevent the further spread of hog cholera [classical swine fever, CSF] in and by wild boars in the prefectures Gifu and Aichi.

In view of the disease situation in wild boars, it was found necessary to address the disease by the application, for the 1st time in Japan, of oral vaccination in wild boars. The oral baits with the CSF vaccine will be disseminated only in areas where the circulation of the virus has been confirmed.

[The above press release included an attached pdf document with technical details of the oral vaccine to be applied. From what we could gather from the machine translation, the size of the baits, manufactured in Germany, is (in cm) 4 x 4 x 1.5 [1.6 x 1.6 x 0.6 in]. On the outside of the substrate, they include corn flour, paraffin, milk powder, (almond) and coconut oil. The vaccine is presented in an aluminum capsule with 1.6 ml [0.3 tsp] liquid vaccine. (Corrections of the translation, if necessary, will be welcomed). This pdf attachment, in Japanese, including pictures, is available at http://www.maff.go.jp/j/press/syouan/douei/attach/pdf/190222_12-1.pdf.

The most widely applied concept of oral bait vaccination of wild boar against CSF, including bait design and immunisation scheme, was developed, evaluated, and optimised by Kaden et al., 2010 (Ref 1).

The respective vaccines are conventional MLVs (modified live virus). Immunisation occurs by uptake of the oral vaccine through the lymphoid tissues of the oral mucosa and tonsils, where expression of virus stimulates the immune system.

For the above and additional data on the manufacture, testing, and use of the oral CSF vaccine, see article 3.1, "Oral vaccine" in chapter 2.8.3, "Classical swine fever (hog cholera) (infection with classical swine fever virus)," of OIE's Terrestrial Manual (pages 19-20 at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.03_CSF.pdf).

Since the start of the CSF event in Japan, 3 Sep 2018, 177 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The epidemiological statistics, summarised as of Fri 22 Feb 2019, are as follows:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Domestic pigs / 47 448 / 210 / 34 / 47 414 / 0
Wild boar / not available / 174 / 55 / 119 / 0
