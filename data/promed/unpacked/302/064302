Seventh case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in South Dakota
-------------------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome], a viral disease spread by mice that can be
fatal in up to a third of all cases, has been reported in Huron, said Dr
Janice McKenney, a physician at Huron Clinic. The disease was detected in a
healthy young man in his 20s who lives in Beadle County, McKenney said. The
man is now recovering well.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has been recognized as a disease only
recently in North America. So far, it's fairly uncommon, and the chances of
becoming infected are low. However, HPS is potentially deadly and immediate
intensive care is essential once symptoms appear, "The problem is that it
[progresses] so quickly," McKenney said. "Within 12 hours, a person who
looks like he just has the flu is practically at death's door."
Lon Kightlinger, a state epidemiologist with the South Dakota Department of
Health, said this is the seventh case reported in South Dakota since the
disease was identified during an outbreak in 1993 in the Four Corners area
of Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. The last case in South Dakota
was reported in 2000, and of the 7 total reported cases, there were some
fatalities, he said. "Hantavirus is what's called an emerging disease; it's
only been in the last 10 years or so that it's been discovered in New
Mexico and Arizona, specifically," Kightlinger said. "Now it's in 31
states, and as far east as Rhode Island. Nebraska just had their first case
this year. "This is something we need to be watchful of, and if you have
risk factors just be aware of it," he said. "Exposure is as simple as
having mice and rats around, especially this time of year, when they're
moving indoors and looking for food."
Hantavirus is spread through contact with fecal droppings or urine of
infected rodents, particularly the deer mouse and white-footed mouse; both
are field mice that can be found in South Dakota. Ordinary house mice are
not carriers of hantavirus, but if food is scarce or temperatures bitter
cold, field mice can seek shelter in homes, sheds, or barns. The first
symptoms of sickness, fever, and muscle aches can appear from one to 5
weeks after exposure, followed by shortness of breath and coughing. Once
this phase begins, the disease progresses rapidly, often requiring
hospitalization within 24 hours. "Lots of people think it's flu, and then
it's something more serious," he said. "Everybody is susceptible. This is a
new disease and we don't know a lot about it. It's being studied."
Kightlinger said the state health department wrote to Huron area physicians
Thursday to tell them that the disease has been diagnosed here. The virus
lives only a couple of days in the fecal matter or urine, but if people do
have a problem with mice in their homes or in buildings on their property,
they should take precautions to minimize their contact with the rodents.
McKenney said if there are mouse droppings in or around the home, people
should douse the area with a mixture of a gallon of water mixed with a cup
and a half of bleach. "Vacuuming is unsafe because it blows the air out
into the room," she stressed. Once the droppings have soaked in the bleach
solution for at least 15 minutes, wear rubber gloves to clean the area up.
"The person with hantavirus here had not traveled; he had no risk factors,"
McKenney said. "He probably caught it from a mouse in his own home. He's
out of danger now, but he was very, very sick."
