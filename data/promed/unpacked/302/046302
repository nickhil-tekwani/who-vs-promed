Malaria cases in Yamunanagar district
-------------------------------------
The Health Department has detected about 2900 malaria cases at
government and private hospitals of Yamunanagar district in the past
one month.

There could be a large number of patients getting cholera treatment at
private hospitals or with some private medical practitioners as well.
Vijay Mohan Atreja, deputy civil surgeon and malaria officer,
Yamunanagar, said here today [2 Sep 2011] that about 1450 cases
[malaria] had been detected in the Khijrabad belt in Pipli Majra,
Bahadurpur, and Bambepur. About 300 cases had been detected in
Naharpur, 300 cases in Sadhaura, 125 cases in Bilaspur, and about 725
cases in other parts of the district, including Radaur and
Mustafabad.

During a survey of about 51 places of the district, including
government hospitals, government colonies and private hospitals, it
was found that waterlogging in some parts of the district after floods
was found to be a home for hundreds of mosquitoes.

Official sources said there was a problem of patients moving from
these villages to the adjoining UP [Uttar Pradesh] since these were
located on the border of the 2 states. They said it was difficult to
treat patients since many of them moved over to UP without completing
the treatment.

The deputy civil surgeon said that a survey had been launched in the
district. Teams comprising medical officers, lab technicians, health
inspectors, health workers, and ANMs [auxiliary nurse midwife? -
Mod.SH] would go from village to village and prepare slides and get
results on the spot. This could help identify the malaria cases, he
said.

Meanwhile, the State Health Department has taken a serious note of the
problem of malaria outbreak. The Health Department also issued notices
to some private hospitals, private colonies, and government hospitals
to ensure their cleanliness, where larva of malaria was found.
