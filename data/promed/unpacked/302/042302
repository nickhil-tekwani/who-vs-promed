Nine dead rainbow lorikeets [parrots] found at Manly Vale last month
[August 2010] were killed by human "kindness."

Toxicology tests undertaken by the Environment Department proved the
birds were not poisoned, but one of them was found to have a huge lump
of bread in its gizzard.

An Environment Department spokeswoman said the size of the piece of
bread was disturbing.

"It was a big lump of bread that would have displaced a significant
amount of its natural diet," she said. "The bread was tested, but it
wasn't laced with poison."

The report that 9 dead rainbow lorikeets had been found was followed
by reports of dead lorikeets being found at Seaforth, Manly Vale,
Freshwater, Dee Why, Mona Vale, Avalon and Clareville, and led to
fears the brightly-colored birds were being poisoned.

But the Environment Department spokeswoman said none of the birds had
been poisoned, and it is likely they were the victims of human
"kindness." Environment Department spokesman Roger Bell said feeding
native birds any kind of food puts them at risk.

"Many people have taken to encouraging lorikeets into their gardens by
giving them a variety of alluring foods," he said.

"These foods are usually based on sugar, honey or jam, which will
ensure regular visits to the garden by these wonderfully happy,
colorful birds. However, it is this very act of 'kindness' that can
cause the death of lorikeets at an unnaturally early age."

Mr Bell said investigations by scientists have found young lorikeets
dying of diseases they would not contract in the wild, including
necrotizing enteritis, which is caused by inadequate artificial diets
and psittacine beak and feather disease, which affects the birds'
immune system.

[Inappropriate feed can cause digestive upset, mechanical blockage and
even bacterial overgrowth in the birds. Often times, some of these
high carbohydrate, high sugar treats can ferment and cause death as
well. Those who choose to feed birds should learn the proper diets for
the birds they seek to attract. - Mod.TG]
