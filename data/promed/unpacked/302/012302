[This report corrects a misstatement in my moderator's comment to the
preceding post in this thread, in which I said that there had been no
new fatalities in Anhui province (whereas in fact the 2nd report
described 2 new deaths). The report below indicates that I should
have stated that there had been no new deaths in the city of Fuyang,
the worst affected locality. I am indebted to Viki Hansen-Landis for
alerting me to this error. - Mod.CP]

Two more Chinese children have died of hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD), driving the national death toll to 34 -- even as the Health
Ministry announced a decline in HFMD cases in the worst-affected city.

Health authorities in east China's Anhui Province on Friday [9 May
2008] confirmed the 2 children had died of HFMD triggered by the
potentially lethal enterovirus 71 (EV71). The deaths occurred in
Bozhou, northwestern Anhui, and in Hefei, the provincial capital,
said Gao Kaiyan, chief of the Anhui Provincial Health Department.

Information from the Anhui Provincial Health Department said a boy
from Bozhou, aged 14 months, fell ill on 1 May 2008. He was moved to
a county-level hospital after his condition worsened. He died on
Monday [5 May 2008].

A girl from Yaohai District, Hefei, aged 18 months, was reportedly
admitted to the No. 2 People's Hospital of Hefei City. Her condition
deteriorated on Monday, and she died early on Wednesday [7 May 2008].

The Health Ministry said on Friday [9 May 2008] that HFMD incidence
in the worst-hit city of Fuyang, also in Anhui, was in decline, with
discharged patients outnumbering those admitted to hospitals for the
1st time. The ministry said on its website that the majority of the
serious cases had recovered, with no fatalities for 7 consecutive
days in Fuyang, which had reported the initial outbreak and 22 deaths.

According to the Guidelines Regarding Prevention and Control of HFMD
published on the Ministry of Health website, HFMD can be caused by a
host of intestinal viruses, but EV71 and the Coxsackievirus A16 (Cox
A16) were the most common. Both EV71 and Cox A16 can cause HFMD,
which usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and
ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. Those sickened
by EV71 often show serious symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis,
encephalitis, pulmonary edema and paralysis in some children. There
is no vaccine.

As of Thursday [8 May 2008], HFMD had sickened 24 934 children on the
Chinese mainland, of whom 34 had died. The deaths were reported in 6
regions: Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hunan and Zhejiang.

Both Yang Weizhong, deputy chief of the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), and Li Dexin, head of CDC's Institute
of Viral Disease Control (IVDC), said there had been no mutation in
the EV71 found in Fuyang, where both Yang and Li have been working.
The experts said they had finished a complete gene sequencing [of 8
of 9 EV71 isolates] and the 8 strains were 99.3 percent to 99.97
percent homologous. "Also, the 8 virus strains tested in Fuyang have
a higher degree of homology in comparison with the 4 other virus
strains [isolated] from infection cases in Shenzhen, Shanghai,
Chongqing and Shandong between 1999 and this year," said Li.

Work has started on the development of a vaccine against the lethal
EV71, said Li, who added: "Technically speaking, there is no problem
for developing a vaccine and I believe it won't take long."
