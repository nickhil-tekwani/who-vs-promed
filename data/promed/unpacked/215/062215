Epidemiological Alert: Rabies (30 Aug 2010)
-------------------------------------------
In the epidemiological week (EW) 30 of this year [2010], Peru's
Ministry of Health reported the death of a confirmed case of human
rabies transmitted by a hematophagous bat. This case occurred in the
native community of Urakusa, district of Nieva, province of
Condorcanqui, department of Amazonas. [The native community of Urakusa
is located on the right shore of the Maranon River and has a
population of approximately 828 people, who belong to the Aguajun
ethnicity.] On EW 33 a new death was reported, in the native community
of Suhapangkis, located in the same province.

The 1st case corresponds to an unvaccinated 4-year-old boy, who was
bitten in the head on 3 Jun 2010. The 2nd case is an unvaccinated
5-year-old boy who rejects vaccine for cultural beliefs.

Currently, a team is working in the field, where an active search and
vaccination of people exposed to bat bites is underway.

This district has [had] rabies outbreaks record in the native
communities of Cachiaco (2009), Kigkis (2009-2010), and Sumpa (2010).

On the other hand, in EW 30, Colombia reported 2 cases of human
rabies: the 1st, in the municipality of Piedecuesta, and the 2nd, in
Lebrija -- both in the department of Santander. The department did not
have a record of human rabies cases until 2008 and 2009, when one case
was notified in each of these years respectively. The variant, which
originated these cases, is currently under investigation.

The reported cases do not have any epidemiological links. The case in
the municipality of Piedecuesta is linked to a bat and located in the
northern part of the same department, while the case in Enciso is
located in the southeastern part of the department -- 250 km [155
miles] from the capital -- and is linked to a cat.

PAHO Editorial Notes:
---------------------
Human rabies cases due to exposure to foxes, raccoons, skunks,
jackals, and wild wolves, are very rare. Also, although rare,
livestock, horses and deer can also become infected and transmit the
virus to other animals or to humans. Most human cases of vampire
bat-transmitted rabies have occurred in the Amazon region of Brazil
and Peru and in some remote communities of Colombia. Vampire bats are
found only in Latin America. Of the 3 known species -- _Diphylla
ecaudata_, _Diaemus youngi_, and _Desmodus rotundus_ (the common
vampire) -- only the latter has been known to feed on mammals and thus
has possibly transmitted rabies virus in the human outbreaks studied.

Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans
from animals) that is caused by the rabies virus, which belongs to the
family _Rhabdoviridae_, within the genus _Lyssavirus_. This virus
infects domestic and wild animals, and is transmitted to people
through close contact with infected saliva (through bites or
scratches). The incubation period is variable, but it usually ranges
from 3 to 8 weeks. The 1st symptoms of rabies are flu-like, including
fever, headache and fatigue, and then progress to involve the
respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous systems. These
symptoms eventually progress to complete paralysis, followed by coma
and death in all cases. Once symptoms appear, there is no effective
treatment, and the disease is fatal most of the time; hence the
importance of post-exposure prophylaxis.

Rabies, a public health problem in Asia and Africa, is a disease that
can be prevented through vaccination. Registered data show that around
55 000 deaths occur annually in these continents due to rabies, the
majority being children under 15 years of age. The main mode of
transmission is through bites, although transmission might also occur
through other channels.

In the Americas, human rabies transmitted by dogs has been almost
eliminated, although the canine population is still at risk in various
countries. Rabies persists mostly in wild animals. In recent years
rabies in bats has resurfaced as a public health problem in the
Americas. In 2004 for the 1st time more people died as a result of
exposure to wild animals, especially bats, than to dogs in South
America. The occurrence of human rabies outbreaks transmitted by
hematophagous bats is cyclical, thus, it is important to maintain an
active surveillance and act preemptively in areas of high risk.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Peruvian cases of rabies transmitted by hematophagous bats, have been
reported previously in ProMED-mail. These new Peruvian cases have been
recorded in different native communities in the same department of the
province of Condorcanqui. Tragically, one of the recent victims, a
child, had been denied prophylactic vaccination on religious grounds.

Up to 2008 Colombia had been relatively free of rabies, and only one
of the 2 new cases has been contracted from a domestic animal.
According to PAHO in recent years, rabies in bats has resurfaced as a
public health problem in the Americas, and remarkably in 2004 for the
1st time more people died as a result of exposure to wild animals,
especially bats, than to dogs in South America.
