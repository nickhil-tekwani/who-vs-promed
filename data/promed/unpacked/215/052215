Dominican Authorities Quarantine, Sacrifice Birds After Bird Flu Discovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dominican authorities have quarantined and sacrificed a number of
birds after detecting a strain of bird flu last month [December 2007].

The World Organization for Animal Health (WHOA) said in a report that
130 birds were slaughtered after authorities discovered a case of the
virus near the capital, Santo Domingo, and another some 145
kilometers [90 miles] to the east in the village of Higuey.

Officials say the virus is the H5N2 strain, which does not affect
humans. Government livestock director Angel Faxas said officials
believe the virus reached the Dominican Republic through birds
introduced into the country illegally.

[H5N2 is a subtype of Avian influenza (AI) which is caused by a
type A orthomyxovirus. According to ProMED-mail moderator PC, it is
important and also required to report all H5 and H7 strains of avian
influenza to OIE. The low pathogenicity strains do not cause anywhere
near as great a problem as do the highly pathogenic strains. Actions
are usually taken to prevent H5N2 low pathogenic strains from
evolving into highly pathogenic strains which can occur if low
pathogenic strains are allowed to continue to circulate in particular
populations. - Mod.TG]
