From: Ron Behrens <Ron.Behrens@lshtm.ac.uk>

[Regarding the first posting in the current thread, the patient was a
UK resident visiting the Philippines. He did not receive pre-exposure
rabies prophylaxis and, following a dog bite (provoked) in an urban
setting, did not seek postexposure prophylaxis. He sought medical
assistance after the onset of symptoms 3-4 weeks after infection, and
despite full postexposure treatment, succumbed with classic symptoms of
rabies. Both dogs died before the symptoms started in the patient. A more
detailed description of how the diagnosis was made (as it was not
straightforward) will be posted later.
The are no new lessons to be learnt from this case, other than all animal
bites must be treated seriously.

[Just to relearn and remember a very old lesson. And even in this day and
age, once the symptoms start, you will die. - Mod.MHJ
