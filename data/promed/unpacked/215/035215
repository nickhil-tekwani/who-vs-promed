[The 77 new confirmed and 538 suspected cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is increasing fairly rapidly as Nigeria enters the new period of the year when more cases usually occur. Unfortunately, one new healthcare worker in Enugu state was infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 16 states (up from 9 in the previous reporting period) and 40 LGAs (up from in the previous reporting period).

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts of their excreta or within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:
_Mastomys natalensis_: https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis
_Mastomys erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY

CopyEd.RD astutely observed that the cumulative number of new deaths appears to be 12, not 11, based on the sum of the individual state totals. Hopefully next week's report clarifies the discrepancy. - Mod.JH
