A 2nd case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has been detected in a flock of sheep in Hassi El Ferid (Kasserine governorate) after the recording of a 1st outbreak in Magdoudech (Kasserine North delegation) [Delegations of Tunisia (mutamadiyah) are the 2nd level administrative divisions of Tunisia between the governorates and the sectors (imadats). The Delegation of Kasserine north is a 2nd level division of Kasserine Governorate, Latitude 35,17144, Longitude 8,81443. - Corr.SB].

Urgent measures have been taken to deal with the spread of this disease, said Ridha Guesmi, head of animal production at the Regional Commissariat for Agricultural Development (CRDA) in Kasserine.

This includes strengthening immunization campaigns, noting that pre-emptive campaigns have already been launched for livestock in the region since the end of last week.

To benefit from these campaigns are more than 400 000 sheep and 10 000 head of cattle, he added, recalling that last year [2018], about 350 head of sheep and goats and 7 head of cows were vaccinated in the region.

During the working session held Tuesday [15 Jan 2019] at the headquarters of the governorate, emphasis was put on the importance of implementing the circular of the Ministry of Agriculture, in particular providing the necessary logistical and human resources to ensure the smooth running of the vaccination campaign and to take necessary samples for detection and eradication of the virus, he said.

The same source said that samples have already been sent to the Institute of Veterinary Research in Tunis to check whether other cases have been infected.

[FMD may cause heavy losses to sheep and goat flocks, mainly if/when introduced during the lambing season. Mortality in juvenile lambs and kids may exceed 50 percent of the offspring, in many cases providing the only but very costly clinical expression of the disease. In adult animals, clinical signs may be limited to temporary lameness and loss of appetite, and -- in dairy flocks -- a sharp drop in milk production. Mass secondary mastitis cases may cause heavy losses. Vaccination is needed to prevent the said effects and to prevent sheep becoming a source of FMD dissemination in susceptible cattle. - Mod.AS
