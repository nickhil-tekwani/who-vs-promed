At least 88 students and teachers at a school in San Pedro de Colalao in northern Argentina have been sickened with _Shigella flexneri_ infections, according to a La Gaceta report (computer translated). According to director of Epidemiology of Neuquén Province, Dr. Rogelio Cali, the affected students and teachers presented with vomiting, profuse diarrhea (some with blood), abdominal pain, high fever and malaise. At least 2 children required hospitalization.

While the investigation is ongoing, the report notes the outbreak may be linked to the school cafeteria. "The route of infection is hand to mouth. _Shigella flexneri_ is an endemic bacterium, which circulates in the population throughout the year. As the temperature increases, the level of circulation increases. It occurs in places where cleaning is not taken care of and where there is not good handling of the food or the cold chain. When it occurs in enclosed establishments, as happened in this case in a school, it can affect many people. The solution is to take the appropriate measures so that the bacterium disappears," said Cali.

[_Shigella_ was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
