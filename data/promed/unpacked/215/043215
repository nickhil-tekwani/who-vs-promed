Over 40 kudzu patches were scouted for Asian soybean rust (ASR) last week
in SW Alabama. One infected kudzu site was found in Mobile County, and 2
infected patches were found in Baldwin County. These patches were situated
in protected locations, and rust was only found on old kudzu tissue. Both
of these counties had positive rust finds on kudzu in 2005.

Asian soybean rust (ASR) has been discovered on soybeans in Hidalgo County,
Texas, at the Texas A&M Experiment Station in Weslaco, the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported on Wednesday 22 Feb 2006.
Hidalgo County sits at the bottom of Texas along the Mexico border. The ASR
was found in a soybean field that had been planted last fall for research
not related to rust. Scouts checked the field for rust in December 2005,
but no sign of the fungus was found.
"Apparently it came in sometime in January," said Marvin Miller, the Texas
A&M plant pathologist who reported the find after examining a sample
brought in by a technician last week. Most of the soybean plants in the
field were mature, but some younger plants that had grown along the edge of
the field were infected, Miller said.
"This field (about 1 acre in size) will not serve as a source of inoculum,
as it has been harvested," Texas A&M plant pathologist Tom Isakeit reported
on USDA's rust website. "This field was planted much later than usual.
Normally, soybeans in this part of the state would have been harvested by
mid-December," he said. "There are no other soybeans around and there is no
kudzu in this area of the state."
Based on wind circulation patterns, experts estimate the chance of ASR
spores reaching the Midwest increases nearly 4-fold annually if "the
disease establishes itself early in any given season across Texas or
western Louisiana, rather than the south east, where it was largely
confined in 2005," Dow Jones Newswires reported.
The spores that infected the Hidalgo County, Texas, field could have
possibly come from Mexico, Miller said. Last week a Mexican scientist
reported that ASR was found on soybeans in the states of Tamaulipas and San
Luis Potosi, Mexico, in October 2005. The reports have not been confirmed
by the Mexican government, Isakeit said, and the information released was
minimal. Tamaulipas, which borders the tip of Texas, is the northernmost
Mexican state along the Gulf of Mexico. San Luis Potosi borders the south
west corner of Tamaulipas.
"I can't say for sure it came in from Mexico," Isakeit said. "Maybe it blew
in directly from South America," but it is sort of falling into place that
there was movement in Mexico last year, he said.
Though Texas will be increasing its ASR surveillance, Isakeit said it may
be difficult to detect because of the drought conditions. "We might not see
it in South Texas because we need rain to bring the spores down (from the
atmosphere)," he said.
An ASR sentinel plot for this spring was planted last week in Weslaco.
Multi-purpose soybean research plots will be planted near Corpus Christi
this week, which will be monitored for rust, and Victoria County will also
be planting an ASR sentinel plot soon.
"I am more concerned about (ASR) than I was last year," Isakeit said. This
early find "tells me there is some movement of spores."

[3] Rust from Texas, Mexico could fly north in rust corridor
Date: 24 Feb 2006

While scientists are not sure how ASR will behave now that it's in central
Mexico and South Texas, some are concerned that fungal spores from here
will ride the winds to the Midwest's multibillion dollar soybean crop.
Marvin Miller, a Texas Agricultural Experiment Station plant pathologist in
South Texas, found the fungus on soybean leaves on 14 Feb 2006 in a
research field plot at the Texas A&M University System Agricultural
Research and Extension Center at Weslaco.
A preliminary diagnosis made at the Texas Plant Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory in College Station was confirmed by a USDA laboratory in
Beltsville MD, Miller said."Soybean production here in South Texas isn't
significant, but this is of great concern to the production areas of the
Midwest," Miller said. "In addition to soybeans, cowpeas, green beans, and
other edible legumes could be affected by this fungus which causes
defoliation and yield reduction."
The soybean rust fungus (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) was first introduced into
the US in Florida in 2004, probably borne by hurricane winds, but confined
itself to the south east, according to Tom Isakeit, a plant pathologist
with Texas Cooperative Extension in College Station. South Texas rust find
is likely to be a new introduction. "This finding in South Texas is
probably a new introduction," Isakeit said. "And what it suggests is that
soybean rust could take the so-called "rust corridor" to points possibly as
far north as Canada." Prevailing winds have been blamed for taking a number
of other rust diseases on a northerly path, including southern rust of
corn, stem rust of wheat, and common rust of corn, he said.
Joseph Krausz, a scientist at Texas A&M University's department of plant
pathology, said confirmation of soybean rust in both Mexico and Texas is
very significant. "The recent occurrence of soybean rust in South Texas and
in the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosi late in 2005 may
very well be the first step in the pathogen becoming established, or
endemic, in the 'rust corridor,' which historically has been the pathway of
seasonal dissemination of a number of rust diseases from south to north,"
Krausz said. Environmental conditions will play a major role in influencing
the further establishment of the pathogen in the corridor, he said.
The soybean rust found in Texas on Valentine's Day 2006 was in a one-acre
research field plot in Weslaco that was part of an irrigation study.
Isakeit had checked the field in December 2005 and found no symptoms of the
fungus. "Infection must have happened after my visit in December, unless
plants were already infected but were not yet showing symptoms," Isakeit
said. Trying to pinpoint the source of the spores can be difficult, he said.
"Rust spores can be carried by wind currents hundreds or even thousands of
miles, even across oceans," Isakeit said. "They are eventually brought down
to earth by rain, and a leaf that's been wet for several hours is needed in
order for a spore to germinate and infect a plant." But once a plant is
infected, the fungus can multiply rapidly, Miller said. "That's why growers
need to be vigilant. There are fungicides that are registered for use on
soybean rust, but early detection and treatment are key," he said.
Resistant varieties of soybeans are being developed, but will not be
available to growers for several years, according to the American Soybean
Association's website. The field in Weslaco where the fungus was found has
been harvested and plowed under, but Miller said a "sentinel" plot of
soybeans will be planted to serve as an early-warning system for growers.
"A few rows of soybeans will be planted shortly which we'll be checking
throughout the spring," he said.
Isakeit said other bean crops grown in the area, including commercial green
bean and cowpea fields, also will be monitored. "Surveying these fields
will provide information to get the big picture of how this fungus behaves
in this part of the world," he said. "We know it's caused major losses in
Asia and other parts of the world, but we don't really know how it will
affect crops here. The weather and prevailing winds this spring will play a
big role in what happens, but if South Texas bean crops have a rough year
with soybean rust, there will be the potential for a bad year further north."
The US is the world's largest producer and exporter of soybeans, with a
farm value of USD 18 billion in 2003-04, according to USDA. Soybeans are
used in 90 per cent of the total US oil seed production and are grown
throughout the Midwest, with the heaviest concentration of the crop in
Illinois, Indiana and Iowa.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR)is caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_
and was introduced into the USA in 2004. It was detected in the crop plant
soybean (_Glycine max_) at the Texas A&M Experiment Station in Weslaco on
22 Feb 2006. This marks the most westerly detection of ASR in the USA to
date. The soybean field has already been harvested, so the infected plants
are now gone. It is significant that ASR was detected in October 2005 in
adjacent Tamaulipas, which borders the tip of Texas, and is the
northernmost Mexican state along the Gulf of Mexico (see map link in item
2). ASR was also detected in October 2005 in the state of San Luis Potosi,
Mexico, which borders the southwest corner of Tamaulipas (see map above in
item 2). This has led to discussion that these adjacent centers may become
an annual starting point for future epidemics of ASR, following the "rust
corridor" through southern, midwestern, and northern states in the USA and
also Canada. In addition to soybeans, cowpeas, green beans, and other
edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen, which causes
defoliation and yield reduction. Rust diseases of cereals caused by
_Puccinia_ spp. are examples of diseases that progress through the rust
corridor each year (see map below). The observations made in Weslaco, Texas
this week would become a landmark in the history of ASR in the USA were
this to happen.
ASR infections on kudzu were found in 2 additional counties in SW Alabama
this week. The confirmed reports of ASR in 2006 now include Texas with one,
Alabama with 3 and Florida with 11 counties as of 23 February 2006.
