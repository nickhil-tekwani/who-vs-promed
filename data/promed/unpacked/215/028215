A horse stabled in Montgomery County, Maryland, has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). The positive horse was discovered during a routine wellness examination by a private veterinarian and was confirmed positive on [9 Jul 2018] by the National Veterinary Services Lab, in Ames, Iowa. The infected horse will be euthanized.

The Maryland State Veterinarian's office has placed the farm under a 60-day investigational hold order. The department will do initial EIA tests on the remaining 42 equids on the farm. The animals will be tested again after 60 days, at which point the hold order will be released barring any positive test results.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to a noninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies, and more rarely through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia. There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed positive for EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards - approx. 183 m -- away from other unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

The Maryland Department of Agriculture's Animal Health Program will continue to monitor the situation closely and reminds all horse owners to remain vigilant in protecting the health of their animals--this includes routine disease testing.
