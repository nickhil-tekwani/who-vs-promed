Re: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in India
--------------------------------------------
Having had experience with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in
both Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Disease Early Warning System of the
WHO (World Health Organisation) Pakistan can provide guidelines in the
form of a PDF file which would assist case definition, hospital
management and infection control.

Additional details about about the use of the antiviral drug Ribavirin
in treatment of CCHF patients is available in a second PDF file.

[ProMED-mail regrets delay in posting Dr. Kakar's message due to an
unforeseen technical difficulty.

Those who are interested should contact Dr. Kakar directly as
ProMED-mail is unable to send attachments for security reasons. We
believe that these documents will be helpful for those involved in the
diagnosis of CCHF and for treatment of patients in regions where CCHF
virus infection is suspected. - Mod.CP]
