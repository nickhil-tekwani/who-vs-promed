Solving the mystery that hung over the recent outbreak of fevers
resembling Japanese encephalitis (JE) here, it has been confirmed that
several of these cases were that of the West Nile [WN] fever, an
illness categorized as a 'potentially serious' one across the world.

The exact details of the prevalence of the WN fever and its virus,
which has been found to be spreading slowly along the coastal belt,
are yet to be made public with the study still on. However, the
confirmation that the recent outbreak included cases of WN has been
done at the field station of the National Institute of Virology (NIV)
here.

According to State Health Services Additional Director N. Sreedhar,
there was no official information yet, though unofficial information
reaching him mentioned the presence of WN in Alappuzha. Terming the
fever 'a mild variant of JE', Dr. Sreedhar said an official report on
the situation was expected shortly.

Meanwhile, experts say there are strong reasons to believe that WN
virus could be getting more common in Alappuzha and parts of Kottayam
too, because strong suspicions were raised about WN prevalence back in
2006 itself, during the Chikungunya outbreak here.

It was the present assistant director of the Cherthala unit of the
National Centre for Control of Diseases (NCDC), R. Rajendran, who had
then pointed out the possibility of the WN virus being the main
villain in the fever outbreak that took a toll of 57 lives in
Cherthala alone that year. The present NIV study, which found 40 per
cent of the 208 cases they examined to be WN cases, has substantiated
what Dr. Rajendran said about the presence of the virus here.

The symptoms of WN are similar to those of JE and chikungunya [virus
infections], with patients complaining of high fever, tiredness and
joint pains apart from brain functions being affected. The carriers
are usually the _Monsonia_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes. The mortality rate
of WN, in severe cases, ranged up to 15 per cent. Dr. Rajendran told
The Hindu that WN was 1st noticed in India during an NIV study in
1956. The study, published in 1973, had mentioned presence of WN in
Kerala too. Later, in 1980, at the Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute for
Medical Sciences, Thiruvananthapuram, 856 serum samples were tested
and WN antibodies were found in 48.6 per cent cases. In another
instance, 4 out of 67 samples sent to NIV, Pune centre from the
Kottayam Medical College to check for JE, turned out to be WN.

Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, as the Leader of Opposition then, had
demanded that a public health research institution be set up in
Alappuzha to study water-borne, vector-borne and air-borne diseases
apart from a regional office for the National Institute of
Communicable Diseases. Both are pending, so are the demands to
strengthen the existing units of the NCDC and NIV, though Alappuzha is
turning out to be the headquarters for almost every disease reported
in Kerala.

[This is the 1st ProMED report of West Nile virus occurrence in India.
However, a report of West Nile virus occurrence in Assam published in
Emerging Infectious Diseases stated: "In India, antibodies against WNV
were 1st detected in humans in Bombay in 1952 (2). Virus activity has
been reported in southern, central, and western India. WNV has been
isolated in India from _Culex vishnui_ mosquitoes in Andhra Pradesh
and Tamil Nadu, from _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes in Maharashtra,
and from humans in Karnataka State".

With both Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus circulating
in India, diagnosing which of these 2 virus is responsible for a given
encephalitis case serologically will be a challenge due to cross
reactions between the 2 flaviruses. Virus isolation is more reliable.
