Salmonella strikes down 85 in Scotland
------------------------------
Food safety officers launched an investigation into hygiene at 3 Chinese
restaurants near Glasgow on Thursday after salmonella poisoning struck down
85 people, the Scottish Food Standards Agency said.
"We declared a national outbreak yesterday, and we are looking at 3 Chinese
establishments in the Lanarkshire region," a spokeswoman said.
Altogether 8 victims were in hospital, the spokeswoman said, although their
condition was not thought to be serious. Cases of the poisoning were found
all over Scotland from Dumfries and Galloway in the south to the Highlands
in the north, although most seem to be concentrated around Glasgow.
