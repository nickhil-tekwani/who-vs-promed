Of the 219 total cases of kala-azar reported in the fiscal year 2020-2021, around 21 were reported from Kalikot, a mountain district. Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis or black fever, is transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly, which in the past would not survive in areas above 650 metres [2133 ft]. Detection of kala-azar cases in unfamiliar places like Kalikot, where the elevation ranges from 738 metres [2421 ft] to above 4000 metres [13 123 ft], indicates that phlebotomine sandflies are moving up mountains because the earth is warming.

According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, cases of vector-borne diseases such as kala-azar and dengue have been reported from districts like Mugu, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla and Salyan, which are considered colder places.

A recent report of the United Nations "Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability" states that at least 6 major vector-borne diseases affected by the climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.

The report also shows increasing evidence that climate warming has extended the elevational distribution of _Anopheles_, _Culex_ and _Aedes_ mosquito vectors above 2000 metres [6561 ft] in Nepal. Of about 460 species of _Anopheles_, over 100 transmit malaria. Over 950 species of _Aedes_ spread dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever and West Nile virus. Over 1000 species of _Culex_ transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis and West Nile virus.

"Host animals in novel areas may be immunologically naive, therefore more vulnerable to severe illness," the report states.

Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal in hilly and mountainous areas. "The emergence of VBDs in the areas which were considered non-endemic in the past can pose a major public health challenge for Nepal," said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.

[It is well known from malaria, another vector-borne disease, that it can be transmitted at a higher altitude with a warmer climate. It is good to see that the change in geographical distribution has been picked up and the control program will be adjusted accordingly. - Mod.EP

Checking PubMED and the grey literature it appears as though this may be the 1st report of leishmaniasis expanding into higher altitudes, a probable impact of climate change. - Mod.MPP]
