Viet Nam takes urgent anti-bird flu measures
-----------------------------------------------
Amid recent outbreaks of bird flu in 11 localities, Viet Nam has just
tightened management of poultry transportation and trading and is
increasing the surveillance of fowl flocks nationwide.
According to the Department of Animal Health, since December last year
[2004], a relapse of bird flu has been seen in 25 communes in 11
localities, namely the southern city of Can Tho, the northern province of
Nam Dinh and the 9 southern provinces of Dong Thap, Tien Giang, Long An,
Bac Lieu, Ca Mau, Hau Giang, Tra Vinh, Binh Phuoc and An Giang, killing and
leading to the forced culling of some 28 700 fowl, mainly ducks and chickens.
Fearing that severe outbreaks of bird flu will happen during the Lunar New
Year Festival (early February 2005), when cold weather favors the
development of viruses and a larger number of fowl are transported and
traded, local veterinary forces are increasing surveillance of areas
formerly hit by bird flu, covering poultry farms, markets and
slaughterhouses. They attach great importance to monitoring transport and
trade. The country's veterinary forces nationwide early this week [1st week
of January 2005] resumed a 24-hour operation to monitor transport and
trade, an operation that was initially applied in early 2004, when bird flu
was at a peak in the country. Veterinary cadres are to go deeply into wards
and hamlets to monitor poultry flocks so that Viet Nam's Department of
Animal Health can have an updated report on new outbreaks and the number of
dead and culled fowl each day.
Many cities and provinces nationwide have just established hotlines in a
move to get the latest news out on the bird flu situation. The southern
city of Can Tho -- where nearly half of [the] samples from ducks raised in
the locality tested positive for the bird flu virus strain H5 -- has
publicized 3 such phone numbers.
Under the department's recent directive, large volume transport of poultry
must get approval from local veterinary agencies, and more quarantine
checkpoints must be set up along roads leading to centers of cities and
provinces. The capital city of Hanoi has just established 4 checkpoints,
raising the total to 12.
Some localities, such as Ho Chi Minh City, imposed even stricter rules on
the transportation of poultry. Fowl and their eggs that are not quarantined
by the agencies or are carried to the city by a simple means of transport,
such as bicycles and motorbikes, will be confiscated and then destroyed.
Additionally, the city assigns veterinary cadres to be present at all of
its 59 slaughterhouses. The cadres are to inspect fowl before they are
slaughtered and then packed into plastic bags.
To encourage residents to actively detect new outbreaks and prevent
[poultry] raisers from selling their sick chickens, some provinces have
offered cash rewards to informers and raised [the] level of financial
assistance to farmers. The northern province of Ha Tay presents VND 50 000
- 100 000 [USD 3.2 - 6.4] to each informer, while the southern province of
Tien Giang gives raisers VND 15 000 [USD 1] for each fowl culled, instead
of VND 5000 [USD 0.3] as it did previously.
In addition to policy measures, Viet Nam is intensifying propaganda via
mass media. Local residents are urged not to throw dead fowl away and not
to have direct contact with poultry. People with symptoms of fever, runny
nose, cough and exhaustion are advised to go to health care facilities as
soon as possible.
In late March 2004, Viet Nam declared an end to the bird flu that had
killed 17 percent of its poultry population and claimed at least 21 human
lives during the previous outbreak starting in December 2003. A total of
43.2 million fowl nationwide either died or were culled causing a total
loss of VND 1.3 trillion [USD 82.8 million] to the local poultry industry.

Bird flu outbreaks found in southern provinces
---------------------------------------------
As many as 22 outbreaks of bird flu were discovered in 7 provinces in the
Central Highlands and southern regions between 1 - 6 Jan 2005, according to
the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's (MARD) Veterinary
Department.
The Central Highlands province of Lam Dong, the southern provinces of Binh
Phuoc, Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An and Dong Thap, and Can Tho city, have
20 communes with the disease present.
In Can Tho city, tests on poultry samples taken from the Co Do poultry farm
in Vinh Thanh district, Phu Thu ward in Cai Rang precinct, Dinh Mon commune
in Co Do district and Trung Kien commune in Thot Not district showed that
ducks in these localities have contracted the H5 virus. The H5 virus was
also detected in serum samples of 460 other ducks in Tan Tao A ward, Tan
Binh precinct, on 5 Jan 2005.
More than 25 700 poultry have been culled as a precaution. The MARD is
instructing provinces to keep close watch on poultry flocks and immediately
cull infected chickens.
