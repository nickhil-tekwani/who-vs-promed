The Murang'a County government has embarked on massive vaccination of cows following an outbreak of lumpy skin disease [LSD]. 3 cows succumbed to the disease in Kiria in Mugoiri location, prompting authorities to order farmers in the upper region of the county to present their animals for vaccination. Teams have vaccinated animals in Kiharu and Gatanga to check against the possible spread of the disease.

Kiharu veterinary officer Mr George Wamenjo said the disease was first reported in Kiria village, Mugoiri location, Kahuro sub-County, where 15 cows contracted the disease. He said 1000 livestock have been vaccinated, with farmers paying Sh 100 [about USD 0.87] per animal.

In Gatanga sub-county, departmental head Moses Karanja said they were vaccinating 80 cows per day. Dr Karanja said no deaths have been reported in Gatanga sub-county.

[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is endemic in Africa. First seen in Zambia in 1929, it spread into Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa the same year, where it affected over 8 million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957 LSD entered Kenya; by 1974 it had spread into Sudan and west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana, and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia, and Cameroon, with reported mortality rates of 20% in affected cattle. The occurrence of LSD north of the Sahara desert and outside the African continent was confirmed for the first time in Egypt in 1988, followed, later, by spread within the Middle East. Between 2012 and 2022, LSD spread into south east Europe, the Balkans, the Caucasus, and further throughout Asia.

For decades, LSD was considered to be mainly transmitted mechanically by biting arthropods. Recently, non-vectorborne transmission has been studied in Russia. Contact transmission mitigates the factor of seasonality, which is linked to insect activity and widens the possibilities for spread regardless of the presence of biting insects (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7198617/pdf/41598_2020_Article_64029.pdf).

It has become clear that no efficient or reliable control program for LSD currently exists, which does not involve the use of live attenuated vaccines. To prevent or reduce losses, Kenya's cattle, in particular dairy cattle and European breeds and their crosses, should be kept immunized/vaccinated in any county potentially exposed to infection, disregarding the vaccination coverage elsewhere.

The economic impact of LSD in Kenya and vaccination's profitability considerations have been recently addressed (ref): Kiplagat SK, Kitala PM, Onono JO, et al. Risk factors for outbreaks of lumpy skin disease and the economic impact in cattle farms of Nakuru County, Kenya. Front. Vet. Sci. 2020; 7:259; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00259.
