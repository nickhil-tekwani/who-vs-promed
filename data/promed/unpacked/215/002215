A stray cat found in North Albuquerque Acres was confirmed to have died of plague, marking the 2nd recent death of an animal found in that area from the bacterial disease, city officials said today [10 Apr 2017]. The cat's death, after the recent death of a dog from plague, could indicate the reemergence of plague in a part of the city where it has not been observed since the late 1990s, said Dr Mark DiMenna, deputy director of the city's Environmental Health Department.

North Albuquerque Acres is in far Northeast Albuquerque west of Tramway NE, including neighborhoods both north and south of Paseo del Norte NE. The agency warned residents to call 311 to report sick or dead animals found in the area.

Cats are particularly susceptible to plague, which can spread among colonies of feral cats, the agency said in a written statement. People who work with free-roaming cats need to watch for plague symptoms in both animals and humans, it said.

Plague is a potentially deadly bacterial disease cycling between rodents and fleas. People usually get the disease from the bites of infected fleas, but it can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents and pets.

[Signs] of plague in cats can include swollen lymph nodes, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and the presence of abscesses, discharge or bloody sputum, the statement said. Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, and painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas.

[Plague is transmitted by fleas. There are several forms of plague in human beings: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.

Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat fight abscess. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Be sure to consult your veterinarian if you find a lump on your pet, as well as to get the best flea prevention treatment for your pet. It may be necessary to have your yard and/or home treated for fleas. Vacuum your home, including any bedding and furniture, and immediately upon finishing take the vacuum back outside, seal it in a plastic bag, and dispose of it. This type of cleaning will have to be repeated every week for 4-6 weeks to break the cycle of the flea in the home.

This disease should be taken seriously, so please be sure your pet is on some form of flea prevention. If you are hiking/biking/trekking/walking in the mountains or trails, then you will need some collars for your ankles and to check yourself carefully for fleas as well as note any abnormalities in your health. - Mod.TG
