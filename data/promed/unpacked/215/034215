Human coronavirus NL63 detected in children in Japan
-----------------------------------------------
[A few months ago, Dutch scientists announced they had identified a
previously unknown coronavirus that was associated with respiratory disease
in children and adults. The new coronavirus has been designated HCoV-NL63
and is clearly different from the 3 known human coronavirus species: _Human
coronavirus 229E_, _Humman coronavirus OC43_, and the _SARS coronavirus_.
These human coronaviruses (together with other mammalian coronaviruses)
belong to 3 phylogenetically distinct clusters of species within the genus
_Coronavirus_ of the family _Coronaviridae_. The precise evolutionary
relationship of this new human coronavirus to the established members of
the family has yet to be determined. HCoV-NL63 is associated with acute
respiratory tract disease, but not the severe pneumonia associated with the
SARS coronavirus. Evidence of infection of both children, adults and
immunocompromised individuals was described. ProMED-mail post
"Coronaviridae, new human pathogen - Netherlands 20040322.0803," or van der
Hoek L et al., Identification of a new human coronavirus, Nature Medicine
10, 368-73, 2004,. should be consulted for additional information.
Now a paper entitled "Detection of human coronavirus NL63 from children
with respiratory illness in 2003 - Sendai City" has appeared on the
Japanese National Institute of Infectious Diseases web-site
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/rapid/pr2935.html> entitled "Detection of human
coronavirus NL63 from children with respiratory illness in 2003 - Sendai
City". ProMED-mail is indebted to Dr. Akira Goto, and an anonymous Japanese
correspondent, for drawing attention to this paper and providing a synopsis
of its contents. The essential conclusion is that this novel human
coronavirus, like the novel human metapneumovirus also detected first in
The Netherlands, has been found also in patients in Japan, confirming its
probable prevalence as a world-wide respiratory pathogen - Mod.CP]
The Virus Center of the Sendai Medical Center, a WHO designated respiratory
disease center, has reported discovery of cases of respiratory illness in
children in Japan caused by the NL63 isolate of human coronavirus
(HCoV-NL63). RT-PCR tests (using a 1b gene probe derived from HCoV-NL63)
were carried out on 189 randomly selected specimens from 412 cases of
undiagnosed acute respiratory tract infection, in Sendai city, in 2003. 5
positive results (2.6 percent) were obtained. Clinical diagnoses of the
patients were "acute upper respiratory inflammation" in 4, and, "asthmatic
bronchitis" in one. 4 "specimens" were collected in mid-January through
early February 2004. It was predicted that the use of nested-set RT-PCR
might improve the sensitivity of the test and increase the number of
positive diagnoses.
