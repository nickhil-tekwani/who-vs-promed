A letter addressed to President Barack Obama contained a substance that preliminarily tested positive for the deadly poison ricin, authorities said on Wed 17 Apr 2013.

News that the letter to Obama was being investigated came as a flurry of other reports of suspicious letters and a package caused the evacuation of parts of 2 Senate buildings and set nerves in Washington on edge.

The letter contained "a granular substance that preliminarily tested positive for ricin," an FBI statement said. But the statement added: "There is no indication of a connection to the attack in Boston," where 3 people were killed in bombings at the Boston Marathon on Monday [15 Apr 2013].

The USA Secret Service said the letter to Obama was received at a mail screening facility on Tue 16 Apr 2013. The mail facility that received the letter was not located near the White House itself, Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said in a statement. "The Secret Service is working closely with the US Capitol Police and the FBI in this investigation," Donovan said.

Parts of the Russell and Hart Senate office buildings were cleared while officials investigated suspicious letters and a package, a Capitol Police spokesman said.

CNN read a statement from a spokesman to Senator Richard Shelby, saying that Capitol Police were investigating a suspicious package that had been delivered to their office.

Senator Carl Levin said one of his Michigan regional offices had received a suspicious-looking letter, but it was not opened. Authorities are investigating, Levin said in a statement.

On Tue 17 Apr 2013, USA authorities intercepted a letter sent to Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker that preliminary tests showed contained the deadly poison ricin.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the presumed ricin.

The following is extracted (citations removed) from: Lutwick LI, Gradon J, Zellen J: Category B Biotoxins. In Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds), Beyond Anthrax: Bioterror - The Weaponization of Infectious Diseases. Springer-Humana, New York, 2009, New York, pp. 181-206:

"Ricin is found in castor beans from the plant _Ricinus communis_ and is a residual product of the production of castor oil. The oil has applications as a purgative, an engine lubricant, and as a component of brake and hydraulic fluid. The industry is no longer active in the United States but the oil is produced in large quantities in other areas of the world. Importantly, the oil, if properly prepared, does not contain the toxin.

"One million tons of castor beans are used each year for producing the oil. The waste mash from the oil production process can have as much as 5 percent ricin by weight and is easily and inexpensively isolated via a simple process in a low technology setting using materials easily obtainable. Ricin is easily prepared in liquid or crystalline forms or as a readily aerosolized, lyophilized powder. The toxin is stable and can be poisonous in its native form in the beans.

"Ricin is a 66 kD [kiloDalton] globular protein with a toxic mode of action of inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The mechanism is due to the enzymatic removal of a single adenine residue from (amino acid 4324) close to the 3-prime end of 28S ribosomal RNA. The removal prevents elongation factor-2 from binding. Structurally it is made up of 2 approximately equal molecular weight subunits, the A and B chains, linked by a disulfide bond. The B chain facilitates binding to cell surfaces and entry into the cell through binding to terminal galactose moieties of cellular membrane glycolipids and glycoproteins.

"The clinical presentation of ricin poisoning depends on whether the exposure is parenteral, inhaled, or ingested. In mice, the dose found to be lethal to 50 percent (LD50) of animals was found to be 3-5 microg/kg in inhalation or intravenous exposures and 20-25 microg/kg in intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intragastric administration. The time to death in the mice was 60 hours for inhalation, 90 hours for intravenous, and 80-100 hours for the other exposures. It is important to note that there is a variation of as much as 2 logarithms [100-fold] in the microg/kg dose of ricin between animals, with the horse seeming to be the most sensitive and the frog and chicken the least.

"The 1st symptoms of toxicity generally occur 6-12 hours after exposure but can occur as early as 3 hours. This is longer than many of the chemical agents affecting the lung and more rapid than infectious agents. In humans, as seemed to have occurred in the Georgi Markov assassination, multiorgan failure occurred with a prominently elevated white blood cell count. [Markov was a Bulgarian communist defector who was killed in London in 2003 by a ricin pellet injected into his leg from a modified umbrella point -- see http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/01/07/terror.poison.bulgarian/index.html.]

"As a weapon of bioterrorism, ricin would most likely be dispersed as an aerosol although contamination of food and water supplies is also feasible. Although easily obtained, massive quantities of toxin are necessary to create a large scale effect. Because signs and symptoms are non-specific, detection of an attack would require a high index of suspicion based on clinical and epidemiologic factors. The finding of a geographic cluster of patients with acute lung injury should arouse suspicion of an attack via an aerosolized agent, although the list of potential culprits is extensive and includes chemical as well as biologic agents. Ricin cases do not exhibit mediastinitis, as with anthrax, and they do not demonstrate any response to antibiotic therapy as would be expected with an infectious etiology. Pulmonary edema may develop one to 3 days after ricin exposure, in contrast to staphylococcal enterotoxin B or phosgene where time to development of pulmonary edema is 12 and 6 hours respectively.

"There are limited data describing the outcome from an inhalation exposure. In the 1940s, sublethal and accidental exposures were said to have occurred and were manifest 4-8 hours after exposure with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and nausea. Studies in rodents suggest an inhaled ricin aerosol could lead to necrosis of the upper and lower airway, respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. Chest x-ray would be expected to show bilateral infiltrates. In animal studies death occurred in 36 to 72 hours and was dose dependent. In primates, symptoms and time to death were also dose related and associated with alveolar flooding, fibropurulent pneumonia, and necrotizing tracheitis. Death occurred 36 to 48 hours after challenge following a 8-24 hour preclinical period." - Mod.LL
