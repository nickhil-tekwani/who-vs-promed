Doctors rushed to tackle anthrax scare.
------------------------------------------------
The department of animal husbandry has sent a 2-member team to
Chittoor district to investigate 28 alleged cases of [livestock] anthrax
reported in a village. The team would consist of joint director (disease
investigation) M Ramakrishna Rao and additional director (health) Md
Nissar Hussain. Reacting to a report published in The Times of India,
director of animal husbandry R Mohana Rao said on Friday that the
department had sought a report on the scare by Monday.
Talking to The Times of India, Dr Rao said his department had
received the first report on the anthrax-affected sheep in Chittoor
district on 5 Jul 2002. Following this, doctors from the district office of
the animal husbandry department and the health department were
rushed to the affected villages.
The villagers were advised not to slaughter the goats and sell the meat.
But, apparently, after the teams left the villages, the advice was ignored.
Mohana Rao said consumption of the meat of diseased sheep, without
properly cooking it, could infect human beings.
He said the department had supplied 62 000 doses of [veterinary]
anthrax vaccine to 25 villages to prevent the spread of the anthrax
microbe. Dr Rao said there was no need for panic as 2-lakh [200 000]
doses were available with the state government.
He said anthrax was a curable disease. People should report to the
nearest hospital as soon as any symptom is noticed. Dr Rao appealed to
the villagers not to cut up dead sheep or goats and to ensure that they
were buried properly. The district wing of the animal husbandry
department had also launched a campaign to educate the people on
disposing of the carcasses.
