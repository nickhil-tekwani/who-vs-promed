Veterinarians have confirmed cattle deaths and production loss in dairy herds, caused by "severe outbreaks" of facial eczema in parts of eastern Australia.

Warm weather and rainfall have created ideal conditions for the fungal condition, which is spread through toxic leaf matter.

Dairy herds in Gippsland have been impacted and veterinarian Dr Helen Schaefer responded to 2 notable cases in the Bega Valley region of New South Wales in the past week. On one farm, 20 per cent of the herd was infected.

Dr Schaefer said the severity and spread of the fungus could be measured in a spore count. "When you get 100 000 spores per gram of pasture, the red flag goes up and says, 'this pasture is toxic'," she said.

"We've had counts at both of these properties in the millions of spores per gram. "One property had 2 paddocks well over 2 million spores per gram of pasture."

About 6 deaths were linked to the fungal infection, but Dr Schaefer said deaths in the short term were rare.

"You get a high morbidity but a fairly low mortality," she said. "The issue can be, though, you can have permanent production loss in those animals with severe liver damage."

Over a longer period, cows that are pregnant and lactating early can die from the added stress of the disease.

"Be aware that the repercussions can be ongoing," Dr Schaefer warned.

Although severe cases are few in number, Dr Schaefer said many more farmers would be facing mild cases that could spiral out of control very quickly.

Weather conditions create toxic grass. The root cause is dead leaf matter, which is present in a variety of forms across the region.

"Whether it's from perennial rye grass -- which is good at making its own -- whether you've been mowing, whether it's just accumulated through trash on the ground," Dr Schaefer said.

"That, combined with the incredible humidity we've had, the rain events and the heat we've had, has just led to ultimate conditions for this fungus to do its stuff."

Symptoms in cattle are fairly generic in nature, including diarrhoea, a lack of appetite, reduced milk production, and signs of photosensitisation.

"People can think that that's just a bit of acidosis or a bit of grain poisoning," Dr Schaefer said. "Actually, if you've got your radar up high enough, that can be a warning bell as to what's to happen a few days later."

Dr Schaefer advised farmers to seek multiple spore tests, warning that one farmer saw a 5-fold increase in just one week.

[Facial eczema is a type of sunburn (photosensitisation) affecting exposed areas of pale skin of sheep and cattle. It is caused by a poisonous substance called "sporidesmin", which is produced on pasture plants by the fungus _Pithomyces chartarum_. In Victoria, Australia, the disease has occurred mainly in East Gippsland between Rosedale and Bairnsdale. Major outbreaks occurred in sheep in 1956 and 1959, and in cattle on irrigated pasture in 1974. Sporadic cases, mainly in sheep, have been recorded in other parts of Victoria.

The disease in stock may be seen between 7 and 20 days of pick-up of the toxic spores from the pasture. The toxin is absorbed from the intestine and reaches the liver, where it causes severe damage, first to the bile ducts and then to the liver cells themselves. All the outward signs of facial eczema result from the liver damage caused by sporidesmin.

Sheep
-----
The signs range from mild photosensitisation to severe jaundice and death, depending on the amount of sporidesmin consumed. Sunburn is the most consistent sign, and usually affects the exposed areas of the skin of the face, ears, teats, and vulva. The skin over these areas becomes reddened, and then goes crusty and dark. It eventually peels off leaving large raw areas, which are susceptible to infections and fly strike (infestation with blowfly maggots). The sunburn is often accompanied by watery swelling of the underlying tissues, resulting in drooping ears and puffy eyes and face. Jaundice (yellowing of mucous membranes) is often seen at this stage. The animals lose weight rapidly. Most animals recover from the acute phase, but they may take many months to regain condition and wool growth. Some never recover, and either die or are culled.

Cattle
------
The signs are similar to those in sheep, but the sunburn also affects areas of skin lacking dark pigmentation (that is, areas covered by white hair) as well as exposed skin. In dairy cattle, the udder and teats are often severely affected, and milk production drops sharply. Loss of weight and general illness are often severe in cattle, and death, although uncommon, can occur up to months after the initial liver damage occurs.

The warning system is a guide only -- conditions vary between farms and between paddocks. However, an official warning generally means that the fungus is on the rampage, and that spore numbers are likely to be rising on many farms.

The basis of prevention of facial eczema is stock management. When a warning is issued, the following alternatives are available, all of which will help to minimise the intake of toxic pasture:
- Shift stock to the longest pasture possible, and try to avoid very close grazing.
- Avoid paddocks cut for hay or late-topped. These are likely to be more toxic because of greater quantities of pasture litter.
- In general, paddocks sheltered by windbreaks or hills are more dangerous and should be avoided.
- Feed hay or other supplements to preserve ground feed and minimise close grazing of pasture.
- Summer-growing crops are generally safer than pastures, and stock should be given as much access to these as possible where they are available.
- On irrigated farms, if pasture is short and grazing pressure is heavy, farm irrigation may be valuable if used immediately.

In New Zealand, where facial eczema is a regular annual problem, spraying of a fungicide is effective. For optimum effect, the fungicide must be sprayed before the danger period. In Victoria, even in East Gippsland, outbreaks are so uncommon that routine preventive spraying cannot be justified. However, researchers are continuing to, examine the possible use of spraying under Gippsland conditions.

Treatment involves getting the animals out of the sunshine, providing shade and removal from the infected pasture.
