Imported chicken meat products pose a higher risk of _Campylobacter_ infection in Estonia than domestic poultry, according to a study published recently. Researchers found that _Campylobacter_ prevalence and counts in fresh broiler chicken meat was significantly lower in samples of Estonian origin compared to those from Latvia and Lithuania.

In the study, 429 chicken meat samples of Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian origin were collected from Estonian retailers and analyzed between September 2018 and October 2019. _Campylobacter_ was isolated in 141 broiler chicken meat samples. Overall, 3, 49, and 89 of Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian origin samples, respectively, were positive.

Among positive samples, 62 contained _Campylobacter_ below 100 colony forming units per gram (CFU/g), and in 28 samples, the count exceeded 1000 CFU/g. A higher prevalence of _Campylobacter_ in fresh broiler chicken meat of Lithuanian and Latvian origin in Estonian retail was observed, according to the study published in the journal Poultry Science.

More than 1000 CFU/g were found in one Latvian and 27 Lithuanian fresh broiler chicken meat samples. The highest count of 1500 CFU/g in the Latvian sample was detected in February 2019. Among positive samples from Lithuania, high counts ranging from 1000 to 5000 CFU/g occurred throughout the year from October 2018 to August 2019.

In Estonia, 348 confirmed cases of campylobacteriosis were registered in 2019. This level is lower than the average in the European Union.

_Campylobacter jejuni_ genotypes found in both broiler chicken meat and human samples indicate that imported fresh chicken meat is likely the cause of campylobacteriosis in Estonia. Only isolates from Lithuanian chicken meat products overlapped with those from human patients in Estonia, said researchers. A comparison with previous studies revealed a decrease of _ Campylobacter_ prevalence in fresh chicken meat samples of Estonian origin from 15.8 in 2000 to 2002 to 1.8 in this study. Since 2012, the prevalence of Latvian and Lithuanian _Campylobacter_ in chicken meat has increased, from 25.8 to 36.8% and from 10.6 to 66.9%, respectively, but the number of samples taken varied.

Researchers said a possible explanation for the Estonian results is that strict biosecurity and self-control measures at farm, slaughterhouse, and meat industry levels are applied, plus risk-assessment-based control measures are implemented at all stages of production. Scientists said further research is needed to study other possible sources of _Campylobacter_ infections in Estonia.
