Re: ProMED-mail post Leprosy - India (02): (GJ) increased incidence
-------------------------------------------------------------------
It is disturbing, but not unanticipated, that leprosy continues to be prevalent and is increasing in many parts of India. Had the transmission been exclusively human-to-human (anthroponotic), one would expect the disease to disappear or at least continue to decline in a downward spiral when the prevalent cases are reduced to less than 1 per 10 000 population (elimination by definition) by multi-drug therapy of all detected cases. While it is true that leprosy bacilli are amplified in humans, there is no good evidence that transmission is anthroponotic.

There is a little-known alternative possibility of the organism amplifying in soil as saprophytes and getting transmitted to humans by soil contact (1,2). Wherever leprosy was known to occur, like in the USA, Japan and Scandinavia, occasionally new cases do appear de novo supporting the soil-transmission hypothesis. Armadillos and humans in the southern USA probably get infected from soil, and the interpretation that there alone leprosy is zoonotic (vertebrate-to-human transmitted) is unconvincing.

The bottom line is that the term "elimination" is misleading; complacency leads to misclassification and delays in diagnosis of new cases; leprosy control programs should not be wound up after reaching "elimination by definition".

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. John for his contribution that emphasizes the possibility of an environmental source for human leprosy. _Mycobacterium leprae_ has been shown to survive outside the human body for varying periods of time under different environmental conditions that occur in regions where the disease is endemic (Desikan KV, Sreevatsa. Extended studies on the viability of _Mycobacterium leprae_ outside the human body. Leprosy Review 1995; 66(4):287-295. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8637382). In this study, viability was verified by multiplication in the footpads of normal mice. _M. leprae_ survived after drying in the shade for up to 5 months and on wet soil for 46 days.

DNA and RNA from _M. leprae_ has been found in soil, but is found mostly in soil samples from areas where patients with leprosy were living. In addition, _M. leprae_ from the environment and the patients has been found to exhibit the same genotype (Turankar RP, Lavania M, Singh M, Siva Sai KS, Jadhav RS. Dynamics of _Mycobacterium leprae_ transmission in environmental context: deciphering the role of environment as a potential reservoir. Infect Genet Evol. 2012 Jan;12(1):121-6. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22101333). Did some of the patients acquire their infection from contact with soil, or did the patients incidentally contaminate the soil?

The following is the abstract from Dr. John's reference 2:

"Leprosy has ceased to be a public health problem world wide, after the successful implementation of effective chemotherapy (MDT) [multidrug therapy] and use of control measures. However, new cases of leprosy continue to occur. _Mycobacterium leprae_ cannot be grown in any acceptable culture medium and besides the wild armadillos, there is no known animal reservoir for leprosy. The transmission of leprosy is believed to be due to a large extent by droplet discharge of bacilli through nose and mouth and to a lesser extent by direct contact of susceptible host with a patient for long duration. The exact role of the environment in the transmission dynamics is still speculative. In the present study, we have tried to detect viable _M. leprae_ from soil samples in endemic areas by using molecular methods. Eighty soil samples were collected from villages of this area, DNA and RNA of _M. leprae_ extracted and identified using specific _M. leprae_ primers. PCR amplification was done and real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viable _M. leprae_. DNA targeting the 16S region of _M. leprae_ was detected in 37.5 percent, whereas _M. leprae_ RNA targeting the same region was detected in 35 percent of these samples. Of the total 80 samples, 40 were collected from residential areas of leprosy patients whereas 40 samples were from no-patient areas. 55 percent positivity for 16S rRNA of M. leprae was observed from the "patient" area in comparison to 15 percent positivity from the "no-patient" area (p less than 0.001) [probability very significant]. This study thus provides valuable information of the presence of viable _M. leprae_ in soil specimens, which would be of use in investigating the transmission dynamics in leprosy." - Mod.ML
