Diagnosis: samples have been sent for analysis to the Lyon Veterinary

Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the probable origin of infection
was the importation of infected pigs slaughtered or alive from an adjacent
country.
B. Mode of spread: direct, by contact with free-ranging pigs and by infected
or at-risk pigs sold cut-price; indirect, through carcases thrown into the
Nokoue Lake.
C. Other epidemiological details: most of the infected subprefectures, such
as Cotonou, are adjacent to the Nokoue Lake, and are situated in a 30-km
radius of the capital city, in Atlantic and Oueme departments (south -
southeast of the country).
[Benin has borders with Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger & Nigeria. Nokoue Lake
extends eastwards into Nigeria - Mod.JW]
Control measures during reporting period: The technical services of the
Ministry of Rural Development (Animal Production Directorate, Bohicon
Veterinary Diagnosis Laboratory, Atlantic and Oueme Regional Centres for
Rural Development) are mobilised to control the disease. The farmers and
the population are made aware by the Press (newspapers, radio and
television), and by visits and workshops, of the methods to be followed in
order to control the disease. Epidemiological screening and surveillance are
carried out within and around the outbreaks by emergency national and
departmental committees.
