Abstract
We report a case of vertical transmission of Tonate virus in a pregnant woman from French Guiana. The fetus showed severe necrotic and hemorrhagic lesions of the brain and spinal cord. Clinicians should be made aware of possible adverse fetal outcomes in pregnant women infected with Tonate virus.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our findings illustrate the possibility of vertical transmissibility of TONV and strongly suggest its neuroteratogenic effects, even in asymptomatic women. The virus's potential ability to spread beyond current endemic areas makes it critical that diagnostic tools become widely available to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and to provide more data about the potential danger of TONV for pregnant women.

Tonate virus (TONV) is within the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus complex. The above report notes that "in 1973, subtype III-B, the Tonate virus, was isolated in birds from French Guiana (4). It has since been found in neighboring countries and in South Dakota and Colorado in the United States (5,6). The wild cycle of TONV is still poorly understood. Transmission by Culicidae insects has been observed during the rainy season (4). Birds and bats are the only identified vertebrate hosts (7)."

Teratogenic effects of TONV virus when infection occurs during the 1st trimester of pregnancy is not surprising since similar in utero effects have been documented for fetal infections with the closely related VEE virus subtypes. It is likely that cases of TONV infections are under-diagnosed. It would not be surprising if febrile cases due to TONV virus infection were clinically diagnosed as dengue cases, especially if they occurred during a dengue outbreak. Similarly, it is likely that mild cases due to TONV virus might be misdiagnosed as one of the other subtypes of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. The authors in the above report call for inclusion of TONV in diagnostic testing when similar teratogenic cases are encountered in the Americas is prudent. It would be wise to include TONV in diagnosis of febrile disease as well. - Mod. TY
