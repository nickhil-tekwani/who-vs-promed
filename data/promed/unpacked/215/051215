The following is a summary of the current situation relative to a finding
of an atypical TSE in sheep in Vermont.
On 10 Jul 2000, 4 sheep from Vermont flocks tested positive for a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). These 4 positive results,
plus 2 suspicious results, were obtained on a Western blot analysis. The
samples were processed as described in the following publication:
Rubenstein, et al., Arch. Virol. (1994) 139:301-311. The antibody used for
the analysis was the polyclonal antisera derived from the rabbit anti-C57BL
mouse PrP antibody, referred to as rabbit anti-CMPrP8 in the following
publication: Kascsak, et al., Brown, F. editor, Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies - Impact on Animal and Human Health, Dev. Biol. Stand.,
Basel, Karger (1993) 80:141-151. This is a validated recognized test,
performed at a USDA cooperating laboratory.
Between May and December 1996, two shipments of sheep from Belgium were
imported into the United States. These shipments included primarily East
Friesian milk sheep, which originated both from Belgium and the
Netherlands. A total of 65 sheep were imported. The imported sheep were
originally consigned to two farms in Vermont. These sheep have been in
these milk-production flocks since their import, and at this time the
majority of the imports are between 4-5 years of age. Most of these
original sheep imports also have progeny. At this time, of the 65 original
sheep imports, 48 are still alive.
In 1996, the first indications about the experimental transmission of BSE
to sheep were published. In late 1997, both Belgium and the Netherlands
reported their first cases of BSE in native cattle. Subsequent to these
findings, the European Union's Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) issued
an opinion in 1998 that stated it is highly likely that European sheep were
exposed to feed contaminated with the BSE agent.
The combination of all of these factors led USDA to the conclusions that
the sheep in Vermont could possibly have been exposed to BSE while in
Europe and therefore a decision was made by the State of Vermont, at the
request of APHIS, to quarantine these flocks. Subsequent to the quarantine,
APHIS obtained information that the flocks of origin in Europe had been fed
concentrates prepared at local mills. This practice has been shown as the
most likely route of BSE exposure for the infected cattle in Belgium.
The two flocks of sheep imported in 1996 and their offspring have been
under State quarantine in Vermont since October 1998. These sheep and their
progeny are prohibited by the State quarantine from entering either the
human or animal food chains. If any of the sheep became ill or died,
tissues were collected for diagnostic purposes and the carcasses were
incinerated at APHIS, expense.
Several different tests have been performed on the tissues which have been
collected as described in the previous paragraph. A number of these
animals had microscopic changes in the brain that are indicative of a
degenerative neurological condition. Such changes can be associated with
TSE's, but these changes are not diagnostic for one specific disease.
Additional tests [performed have included immunohistochemistry, Western
blot, and capillary electrophoresis.
With the exception of the histological changes mentioned, all previous
tests had demonstrated no evidence of a TSE in these sheep. On 10 Jul
2000, four of the progeny were reported positive for a TSE by Western-blot
analysis on brain tissue, as previously described. One imported animal and
another progeny were reported as suspicious on the same test.
The Western blot cannot differentiate between scrapie and BSE. The only
known method to differentiate between these two diseases requires a series
of mouse bioassay systems, which takes at least 2-3 years for completion.
These sheep could possibly have been exposed to BSE in Europe. If they are
actually infected with BSE, this would present a significant animal and
human health risk. This possibility warrants the conservative actions USDA
has taken to minimize any potential risks.
The flocks were originally placed under quarantine in 1998 due to the
possibility of exposure to BSE that could have occurred prior to their
importation. The quarantine allowed for increased monitoring and
surveillance of these animals. This increased surveillance had not
previously shown any definitive evidence of a TSE agent. Throughout this
period, the USDA had been trying to negotiate with the flock owners to
voluntarily sell the sheep to the USDA so that the risk could be removed.
Without the new definitive evidence - i.e., the positive Western blot
results - the USDA did not have the authority to move forward. At this
time, with the confirmed evidence of a TSE agent, we are moving forward
with more stringent actions.
BSE in sheep has the potential to spread from animal to animal and
contaminate the environment, as it appears to behave like scrapie. BSE in
cattle behaves very differently and is spread primarily through feed
contamination. Since BSE in sheep could be spread laterally, i.e., animal
to animal, feed bans would not effectively contain or prevent new
infections of BSE in sheep. The most prudent course of action, considering
the greater potential of spread for BSE in sheep coupled with the
devastating effect to the U.S. livestock industry should BSE become
established in the United States, is to take these extraordinary measures,
even without confirmation of which TSE agent is involved.
USDA/APHIS, in cooperation with the Vermont Department of Agriculture,
Foods and Markets, is working with the sheep owners to purchase the flocks
that include the imports and their progeny. The sheep will be euthanized,
samples will be taken for further diagnostic studies, and the carcasses
will be incinerated. There are no other known susceptible TSE species on
the premises.
There are some indications in research that the scrapie agent, and perhaps
the BSE agent in sheep, can contaminate the environment. USDA is exploring
options to address these concerns. The samples collected from the animals
will provide additional information that can be used to help determine the
extent of any possible contamination of the farms. This information will
assist in USDA's attempt to make an informed decision of what precautions
must be taken in regard to the environment on these farms.
