[There are no clinical signs listed here, so it is difficult to suggest what toxic agent may be causing the illness or whether it is due to an irritant causing gastrointestinal distress.

Any further information from knowledgeable sources regarding the clinical signs, whether a toxic agent has been identified, how widespread the illness is, or any other information of note would be helpful. - Mod.TG]
