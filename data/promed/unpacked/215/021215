Four new strangles cases in Michigan
------------------------------------
A yearling paint colt in Otsego County, Michigan, presented with a fever on [2 Jun 2022] and the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) reported a positive test on [14 Jun 2022]. The horse is currently recovering in voluntary quarantine and has an unknown vaccination status.

Two horses in Genesee County, Michigan, also tested positive. The 1st, an unvaccinated 6 year old thoroughbred gelding, presented with a fever, cough, lethargy, nasal discharge, and enlarged lymph nodes on [4 May 2022] and was confirmed positive on [9 Jun 2022], according to the MDARD. A 10 year old quarter horse mare on the same premises presented with a fever and nasal discharge on [3 Jun 2022] and tested positive on [13 Jun 2022]. She was also unvaccinated. Both horses are recovering in voluntary quarantine, and a 3rd horse on the property was exposed and is suspected positive.

Lastly, an unvaccinated stallion in Van Buren County, Michigan, presented with enlarged lymph nodes on [16 May 2022] and the MDARD confirmed a positive diagnosis. He's in voluntary quarantine and is recovering.

About strangles
---------------
Strangles in horses is an infection caused by _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ and spread through direct contact with other equids or contaminated surfaces. Horses not showing clinical signs can harbor and spread the bacteria, and recovered horses remain contagious for at least 6 weeks, with the potential to cause outbreaks long-term.

Infected horses can exhibit a variety of clinical signs:
- Fever
- Swollen and/or abscessed lymph nodes
- Nasal discharge
- Coughing or wheezing
- Muscle swelling
- Difficulty swallowing

Veterinarians diagnose horses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with either a nasal swab, wash, or an abscess sample, and they treat most cases based on clinical signs, implementing antibiotics for severe cases. Overuse of antibiotics can prevent an infected horse from developing immunity. Most horses make a full recovery in 3 to 4 weeks.

A vaccine is available but not always effective. Biosecurity measures of quarantining new horses at a facility and maintaining high standards of hygiene and disinfecting surfaces can help lower the risk of outbreak or contain one when it occurs.
