Colombia: outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE)
----------------------------------------------------------
In February [2003], one case of human VEE was reported to national
authorities in Colombia, involving a soldier who had been in the Yondo
province (Department of Antioquia). As a result, subsequent investigations
and active surveillance were conducted in epidemiological week 20 [11-17
May 2003]; 8 cases were found, 7 of which were IgG positive (past contact
with the virus) and one that was positive (current contact with the virus).
On 18 June [2003], a sentinel center was created in Yando in order to
maintain active surveillance.

[As can be seen below, cases of equine encephalitis-- presumably also VEE--
were still occurring in July 2003. - Mod.JW]

[The mosquitoborne viruses of eastern and Venezuelan equine encephalitis --
the report does not specify which is involved here -- are endemic in
Colombia, and pose a risk to travelers to the infected area. There are
vaccines for horses, but no vaccine for either disease has been approved
for humans other than laboratory workers or for military use. The website
of Panaftosa, given above, is a source of up-to-date data on foot and mouth
disease, vesicular stomatitis, equine encephalitis, brucellosis, bovine
tuberculosis & rabies -- principally in livestock -- in South America. -
