CDC and FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] have identified the bacteria and fungi cultured from unopened vials of preservative-free MPA [methylprednisolone acetate (a corticosteroid used for injecting inflamed joints)] from Main Street Family Pharmacy (MSFP) in Newbern, Tennessee. These findings are important reminders that healthcare providers should ensure that all recalled products from MSFP are no longer in use. In addition, complaints from patients exposed to products from MSFP should be taken seriously and should be reported promptly to both FDA MedWatch and the health department.

In addition to the findings above, 4 of the 26 cases meeting the CDC case definition (a person who developed a suspected infection associated with injection of a product, labeled as sterile, that was distributed by the Main Street Family Pharmacy [Newbern, Tennessee] since 1 Dec 2012) have had bacteria or fungi detected from wounds: 2 patients had _Enterobacter cloacae_ and _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, one had mixed bacterial culture not otherwise identified, and one had fungus highly suggestive of an _Aspergillus_ sp., although further studies are needed for confirmation. Although bacteria and fungi have been isolated from unopened vials of MPA from MSFP, it is not possible to determine which infections are due to this contamination event versus other factors including improper handling and/or administration of medications at the injection facility.

Clinicians are reminded that they should 1) use individual containers of compounded or preservative-free medicine for a single patient only, and 2) promptly report to MedWatch any infection that might be related to a medication or medical device, even absent a recognized outbreak, as these reports can allow for early detection of a possible contamination event.

As of 10 Jun 2013, CDC is reporting 25 cases from 4 states -- Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, and North Carolina.
