Croatia Investigates Dialysis Deaths
----------------------------------
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Police were investigating what health officials
Sunday called an alarmingly high number of patient deaths during dialysis
-- 21 over 48 hours -- and the government ordered hospitals to stop using
equipment by a U.S. company.
All the patients who died had received treatment from machines made Baxter
International Inc., Health Minister Ana Stavljenic Rukavina said. Use of
the machines were halted pending results of the investigation.
Representatives of Baxter, based in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield, were
said to be on their way to the country. Calls to Baxter's offices in
Deerfield for comment were not immediately returned Sunday.
The 21 deaths occurred Friday and Saturday and represent the total number
of patients who died during or shortly after undergoing dialysis in
Croatian hospitals and clinics, the Health Ministry said. Deputy health
minister, Rajko Ostojic, called the numbers "shocking and unbelievable,"
adding there had been no further deaths since the Baxter equipment was
pulled Saturday afternoon. The ministry has taken all measures and dialysis
patients now are "completely safe," he said late Saturday.
The usual death rate for dialysis patients in Croatia is 3 to 6 per week,
Rukavina said, calling on the state prosecutor to start a probe. Police had
already launched an investigation.
The Baxter equipment was distributed by Croatian pharmaceutical company
Pliva. "A real tragedy happened," Pliva CEO Zeljko Covic was quoted as
saying in the daily newspaper Vecernji list.
Dialyzers made by Baxter were also used in Spain, where 10 kidney patients
died in August. An independent investigation found no link between the
deaths and the equipment, but the Spanish government said Wednesday it was
waiting for results of its own tests. It was unclear whether identical
equipment had been used in Croatia and Spain.
[Checking on the above-mentioned episode in Spain in the end of August, I
was unsuccessful in finding official information. I did come across the
below news wire reports of the incident. More information on the ongoing
problem in Croatia and/or the investigations into the problem in Spain
would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

Baxter recalls certain dialyzers after deaths in Spain
------------------------------------------------------
U.S. medical device firm Baxter International Inc. said on Friday that it
has recalled 2 batches of dialysis products after 6 patients at a health
center in Spain died while having kidney dialysis treatment.
Tanya Tyska, spokeswoman for Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter, told Reuters
that the patients who died in Valencia, Spain were receiving treatment
using different dialysis products and equipment, some of which were
manufactured by Baxter.
"Initial studies conducted by Baxter showed no malfunction of its products,
and have not revealed any evidence linking the Baxter product to the
unfortunate deaths of these patients. However, as a precautionary measure,
we have initiated a voluntary recall of 2 batches of the A-18 dialyzers,
one of the dialysis products used by that center," Tyska said.
"We are working with the hospital and the medical authorities to help
clarify the facts. In the meantime, we will do everything we can to assist
the center an ensure patients' safety and continuity of care," she added.

Spanish health ministry believes first control detected leaks in filters
linked to deaths
-----------------------------
The Spanish health ministry is investigating the possibility that the
filters linked to the deaths of 12 patients after dialysis sessions in
Valencia, Madrid and Barcelona did not pass a first quality control.
Health inspectors have informed the Valencian regional government that they
were surprised that the supplier of the filters, US company Baxter, only
distributed 460 units of the lot linked to the deaths, when other lots
include 10 000 units. According to a report by the Valencian regional
government, the health ministry believes that the filters did not pass the
first control, though they did pass other controls after leaks were sealed.
The filters were then distributed by Baxter.
