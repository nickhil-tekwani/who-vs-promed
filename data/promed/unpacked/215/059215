In the south zone of Morelos [state], Health
Jurisdiction II is carrying out a cleanup in
facing an outbreak of 58 cases of classical
dengue in the southern area of the state,
announced the head of this agency, Maria del
Rosario Avila Abarca. In facing the risk from the
coming rainy season, which favors the mosquito
vector of dengue [virus], the official of the
health sector, Avila Abarca, insisted that
efforts with the current municipal governments
would be redoubled for prevention. She said that
regarding trash removal and keeping patios clean,
"it is important that every house does not have
things that retain water or rain water, which
could be tires among other containers, that could
be a perfect home of the mosquito _Aedes
aegypti_." She said that "if we do not understand
the aquatic cycle for mosquito reproduction that
we are creating in our houses, we will have many
more mosquitoes and, of course, more people ill from dengue."

She indicated that so far this year [2009], the
cases have been classical dengue and hopes not to
have DHF, which could put peoples lives at risk.

[Involving local residents in elimination of the
water catchments that are breeding sites of
_Aedes aegypti_ in and immediately around their
houses and other buildings is the most effective
way to halt dengue virus transmission, but is
also among the most difficult measures to accomplish.

Brazil continues to lose the war against dengue,
to the point where more than 2000 new cases are
reported daily, while attention is focused
fundamentally on influenza A [H1N1], according to
the numbers published this Sunday [17 May 2009] in the newspaper O Globo.

No less than 14 state capitals are on alert
status, facing an avalanche of dengue cases, and
in the 1st 100 days of this year [2009], health
authorities have recorded 226 500 cases
distributed over practically the entire country.

Since the 1st day of 2009, there have now been 46
dengue deaths registered in all of Brazil,
although the numbers in recent years indicate an
increasing trend: 158 dengue deaths in 2007 and 448 in 2008.

The situation is most critical in Bahia state
(northeastern Brazil), in which a 3rd of the
recorded dengue cases [nationally] this year
[2009] have been concentrated. In this state, 2
cities, Itabuna and Camacari, are considered to
be of high risk for indexes of infection. Between
January-April 2009, the number of cases in Bahia
increased 300 percent compared to the same period
last year [2008], according to local authorities.

Beyond the increase in the number of cases and
the area where they have been recorded, the
numbers show that the velocity of propagation of
the disease is 2 times higher than that
registered just a decade ago, according to the
experts responsible for the studies.

The newspaper reported that the Coordinator of
the National Program for Dengue Control, Giovanni
Coelho, stated a week ago before the senate that
the scenario could become worse if a new dengue
[virus] type came into the country. According to
Coelho, the so-called dengue [virus] serotype 4
is predominant in Venezuela, a country with which
Brazil has intense movement of people. Because of
this, the arrival of [dengue virus type 4] is just a question of time.

[Preventing the entry and establishment of dengue
virus serotype 4 will be extremely difficult, and
Coordinator Coelho is probably correct; its arrival is just a matter of time.

ProMED-PORT posted the original O Globo report (in Portuguese) of 16 May 2009

followed by the comment from Mod.LJS saying: "Sad
but true. What is sad is not the fact this
occurs, but rather we are seeing assertion of the
good news that the number of cases is 49 percent
lower than the previous year. We are not living
with a competition in which the best score is
given to the lowest number of cases, and so are not confronting dengue."

The situation room of the NEA [northeastern
Argentina] reported that as of today [18 May
2009], there are 10 379 confirmed individuals ill
with dengue since the beginning of the epidemic,
with 16 reported this Friday [15 May 2009] in the
province and 2193 [cases] under study. They
reported that the great majority of the reported
cases since the beginning of the epidemic are
resolved, regaining their health and without
[further] possibility of transmission of the disease [virus].

"The reports are declining in an accelerated way.
From 170 cases a week ago, we [now] have 30
cases as of yesterday [17 May 2009], " the
Minister of Health, Francisco Baquero, confirmed
in the meeting of the provincial Crisis Committee
for influenza H1N1. Along these lines, and as a
consequence of the statements of Governor Jorge
Capitanich, he stated that "the [epidemic] curve
is going down. We are very alert. We continue
with the Committee functioning very well, and we
are working to install a vector control program,
" the provincial official concluded.

In the week ending 9 May [2009], 5 deaths due to
dengue fever were recorded, bringing to 48 the
number of people who have died of the disease so
far this year [2009]. Director General of Health
Tan Sri Dr Mohd Ismail Merican said there was
also a rise in the number of dengue fever cases
in the country during that week, to 874 from 870
in the previous week, ending 2 May [2009]. "The
number of cumulative cases so far this year is 19
275 compared to 13 891 with 33 deaths in the same
period last year," he said in a statement Thursday [14 May 2009].

He said 7 states recorded an increase in the
number of cases so far this year [2009], with
Kedah registering 9, Kelantan 8, Johor 23, Penang
22, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya 20, Melaka 3 and Perak 13.

Up to 9 May [2009], 63 hotspots were reported,
with 57 of the localities in Selangor, 4 in Kuala
Lumpur and Putrajaya and the rest in Johor, he
said. "The people in these localities are advised
to keep their houses and surroundings clean and
destroy breeding places of the _Aedes_ mosquito,
carrier of the dengue virus," he said.

Dr Mohd Ismail said 579 compound fines totaling
RM 68 850 [USD 19 451] were imposed and 201
clean-up notices were issued nationwide in the
week ending 9 May [2009] to owners of premises
found to harbor _Aedes_ breeding places and
potential breeding places. He said 71 percent of
the houses and shops inspected were found to
harbor _Aedes_ breeding places, as well as 19 per
cent of factories, 17 per cent of burial grounds
and road dividers, and 14 per cent of
construction sites. "This shows that a large
number of people are not yet sensitive to the
danger of _Aedes_ breeding places in their houses
and surroundings. The gotong-royong (self-help)
activities have not achieved their target,
because only 70 percent of the targeted 76
activities could be undertaken last week," he said.

[Since this is the monsoon season, an outbreak of
dengue infection is ongoing in Viet Nam, with
recent reports of more than 13 000 cases and 11
fatalities from southern provinces (see prior
PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (05)
20090510.1736). There has been an increase in
admission of dengue patients to hospitals in Ho
Chi Minh City since February 2009 due to
unseasonable rains (see prior PRO/MBDS posting
Dengue - Viet Nam (04): Ho Chi Minh City 20090416.1443).

Swine flu might have taken the world by storm,
but Saudi health officials say they have treated
72 people for the potentially lethal
mosquito-borne tropical dengue fever in the past
week [week of 3 May 2009]. The patients were
treated in Jeddah, Saudi daily Arab News reported
on Tuesday [12 May 2009]. The newspaper did not
say what condition the patients were in.
