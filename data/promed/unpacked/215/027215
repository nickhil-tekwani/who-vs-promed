Below please find an update on the Pilchard Mortality Event in Australia,
provided by Dr. Gardner Murray, Australian Chief Veterinary Officer.
PILCHARD MORTALITY AUSTRALIA - UPDATE - 9 Dec 1998
Update of spread:
-----------------
On December 2nd, there were reports of new mortalities in Western
Australia, 450 km east of Esperance, 150 km off shore. Sightings were of
freshly dead, mature pilchards floating on the surface; trawlers fishing
further west of this area have not reported any dead fish to date.
In Victoria, hundreds of dead pilchards were sighted west of Lakes
Entrance, just east of the Wilson's Promontory, approximately 20 nautical
miles offshore, as of December 2nd. Commercial fisheries assisted in
sampling dying and dead animals for laboratory examinations.
There were no new reports of pilchard mortality in South Australia. There
have been no additional reports received by 9 Dec 1998.
Control measures:
----------------
Fisheries Victoria continued their arrangement with commercial pilchard
fisheries on a voluntary closure of the Victorian pilchard fishery until an
official Fisheries Notice can be issued.
Western Australian fisheries will remain open until mortality reaches an
area where pilchards are normally caught.
The South Australian pilchard fishery remains open in the absence of
mortality. Schools of small pilchards were sighted and a 30 tonnes catch of
commercial size pilchards was taken in the southern part of Spencer Gulf.
Public health:
--------------
Victorian Fisheries have advised the public not to take dead pilchards from
the beach for consumption, bait or use as pet food.
Diagnostic testing:
-------------------
Staff from CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong
are working with researchers from laboratories in Western Australia, South
Australia and Victoria to determine the cause of death.
Electron microscopy conducted at AAHL has visualised the pilchard
herpesvirus associated with gill lesions in adult and juvenile pilchards.
Histopathology suggests a less acute disease process when compared with 1995.
On the basis of comparison of a 140kbase pair sample, the pilchard
herpesvirus purified from South Australian pilchards dead in this 1998
event appears closely related to the 1995 pilchard herpesvirus.
Investigations are continuing to determine the relationship of the 1998
virus with the 1995 virus, as well as the virus identified in the 1995
pilchard mortality event in New Zealand.
At this stage, the pilchard herpesvirus appears to be closely associated
with the mortality event; however, there is no proven evidence that the
virus is the causative agent of the disease. Transmission studies are
planned to elucidate this issue.
As part of a comprehensive diagnostic research project, AAHL is currently
trying to establish primary cultures from various pilchard tissues as a
means to propagate the pilchard herpesvirus (which does not grow in the
commonly used fish cell lines). Purified virus is also being used to raise
antisera for a range of immunodiagnostic techniques.
Multidisciplinary scientific consultations:
-------------------------------------------
The Joint Multidisciplinary Pilchard Scientific Working Group - established
under, and reporting to, CCEAD (see below) -- had their third meeting on
November 17th.. A research program was developed, addressing five
objectives, i.e. to
1. Determine the cause of the mortalities;
2. Determine the origin of the pathogen;
3. Determine the trigger for the onset of mortalities;
4. Develop diagnostic tools;
5. Develop a clear understanding of the epizootiology of the mortality
episode.
Four specific high priority research projects have been proposed to
progress the objectives, including on-going examination of small fish
survivors and fish not impacted by the mortality event; pilchard virus
transmission studies; generation of diagnostic reagents for pilchard herpes
virus; and the development of a model of the pilchard mortality in southern
Australian waters.
Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases:
---------------------------------------------------
The pilchard mortality is handled under Australia's Consultative Committee
on Emergency Animal Diseases CCEAD. In this aquatic animal emergency event,
CCEAD links States/Territories Directors of Fisheries and
States/Territories Chief Veterinary Officers with Commonwealth authorities
and the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory. CCEAD is chaired by the
Australian Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Gardner Murray.
CCEAD met per telephone conference on 30 Nov 1998, inter alia to address
the research plan designed by the Scientific Working Group. The plan and
the high priority projects were endorsed.
Next steps:
-----------
Fisheries authorities cooperate closely with commercial fishing industries
to monitor the spread of the mortality east and west.
The Scientific Working Group will reconvene on December 15th to finalise
the research project proposals and funding issues.
We will advise of further developments.
