Philippines Continues Battle Against Foot And Mouth Disease
---------------------------------------------------
"We may have survived this disease, but we shouldn't stop here. The funding
we've been getting from Australian Aid may end this year, but we should
move forward with the right information that would continuously protect us
from FMD," said National FMD Task Force Head Victor Atienza.
It has been 9 years since the country started the battle against the deadly
virus affecting hogs in the Philippines.
The National FMD Task Force, a network of government and non-government
offices, has also implemented the 4 program components of the disease:
surveillance, public awareness, animal movement management, and vaccination.
Nationwide, the number of cases significantly decreased from 1995's 1553 to
2004's 122.
The National Capital Region (NCR) had the largest outbreak in 2004 with 45
cases, while Region 4 had 44 cases. These regions, along with Region 3
(Central Luzon), are classified as still suffering from FMD.
On the other hand, Mindanao, Visayas, Palawan and Masbate are
internationally recognized FMD-Free by the World Animal Health Organization
[OIE] in Paris, France.
The said areas have been closely guarding their ports and territories for
any unscrupulous trading and bringing in of animal and meat products from
FMD-affected areas.
Region XI FMD Coordinator Maria Teresa Bacayo reported during the
Communications Management Workshop held in Cagayan de Oro City 12-14 Jan
2005 that authorities closely monitored quarantine inspections in
designated FMD Quarantine Checkpoints.
"Any meat products that reach our desks and test below the required
standards are immediately burned by my staff," Bacayo said.
Humans are considered one of the potential carriers of this virus, since it
can stay in the throat or nose for 24 hours without causing harm. It can
also be transmitted through footwear, clothing, kitchen utensils, or a
contaminated environment. This is why quarantine activities include
footbaths in transport areas. Travelers are educated and enjoined to step
in footbaths and are discouraged to bring any meat products into the
FMD-Free areas.
The NFMD Task Force has also been targeting general consumers, reminding
them of their right for healthy meat.
In 2004, NFMD gave birth to the latest super hero in the supermarket, Super
Pig. The embodiment of a disease-free pig, it reminds consumers not to buy
"Hot Meat" or "double dead meat," to make sure that the slaughtered animals
have undergone thorough meat inspection. ["Double dead meat", a term used
in the Philippines, describes meat derived from an animal that died before
being slaughtered and bled. Obviously, such animals have not undergone the
required ante-mortem inspection, have not been bled, and might have died of
infections. - Mod.AS]
As the Task force is about to end its contract with the foreign donor, it
seeks to strengthen connections with other governmental and
non-governmental agencies that could help sustain the campaign for an
FMD-free Philippines.
