Six more people have been infected with anthrax at Shahjadpur upazila
[subdistrict] in Sirajganj, increasing the number of such patients in
the district to 57 over the last 2 weeks. Sanitary inspector of
Sirajganj civil surgeon office Ram Chandra Saha told on Wednesday [8
Jun 2011] bdnews24.com that the infected people were from Hasakhola
village under Habibullahnagar union council and they were being
treated at Shahjadpur Upazila Health Complex.

Civil surgeon Dr Nazim Uddin told bdnews24.com that they were
campaigning in the affected areas urging people not to get panicked
with anthrax as the disease was under control.

[Today is Friday -- the Muslim Sabbath -- so it is probable that
further human and/or livestock cases will not be reported until Sunday
(12 Jun 2011).

My colleague Susan Baekeland has pointed out that we are getting
anomalous reports of human cases. This says "57"; previous reports out
of Dhaka have said 60 human cases, which with these 6 would total 66
cases. Either way a distressing number and indicating a persistent
habit of slaughtering and butchering sick animals, in spite of public
advice to desist.

Animals do not demonstrate immunity to anthrax until 8 days after
vaccination so there will be a lag between vaccination and any
possible drop-off in human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
