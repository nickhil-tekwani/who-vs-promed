Dengue fever killed 8 people in the past 2 weeks, an alarming figure which should put the public on alert to prevent a outbreak like the one in 2007, government officials said yesterday [26 Jun 2012]. The death toll now stands at 38 through the 1st 25 weeks of the year [2012], and public health facilities have reported 8843 dengue cases in the Kingdom, with 1642 cases in the past 2 weeks alone.

The updated numbers came from National Dengue Control Program director Ngan Chanta, who had received updated records and described weeks 24 to 27 of the year [2012] as a "big peak of dengue", pointing to spikes in both cases and deaths.

"This year [2012] has the same pattern as 2007," he said, but added that a similar outbreak remains unlikely. In 2007, the country experienced a particularly severe dengue epidemic, with 39 861 cases, and a fatality rate of more than one per cent. About 20 000 of the cases were reported in the 1st half of the year.

But this year [2012], according to Ngan Chanta, fewer cases are being reported because of the success of the national campaign to kill larvae, and the dengue death rate has been cut to below 0.5 per cent.

This year [2012], 140 tonnes of larvicide have been distributed, and another 150 tons are planned for July and August. This represents double the amount applied in 2007. "Because of the efforts we make to fight dengue, this year's [2012] death rate is much lower [than in 2007]," Ngan Chanta said.

The official added that delays in data collection may have distorted the numbers, and the public can expect to see a drop in new cases after the 28th week.

[According to the newswire above, a total of 8843 cases and 38 deaths due to dengue infection were reported in Cambodia during the 1st 25 weeks of 2012. Of these, 7201 cases and 30 deaths were reported in the 1st 23 weeks of 2012 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Cambodia (07) 20120626.1451).

In Cambodia, 2 major epidemics of dengue occurred after 1997: there were 16 260 cases in 1998 and 39 618 in 2007. At present, there is no vaccine to protect against dengue. The method to control or prevent the transmission of dengue virus is to combat vector mosquitoes through several actions. For example, preventing mosquitoes from accessing egg-laying habitats by environmental management and modification (see:
