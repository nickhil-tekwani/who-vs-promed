Ebola outbreak kills 13 in Gabon
--------------------------------------
An outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease in Gabon's remote
northeastern jungles appeared to be spreading Tuesday as the death toll
climbed to 13.
Health authorities have identified 19 suspected cases, World Health
Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl said in Geneva.
Ogooue Ivindo, a jungle area inhabited by pygmies and hunter tribes, is
one of the most sparsely populated regions in Gabon. Ebola last struck
there in 1996-97, killing 45 of the 60 people infected.
The latest outbreak has killed 10 members of an extended family and a
nurse who treated one of the victims.
The first death was recorded 2 Dec 2001 in Ekata, about 5 miles from
the Republic of Congo border. Other cases were reported in 3 nearby
villages and 2 towns, Hartl said. There were no immediate reports of
any suspect fever outbreaks in the neighboring country.
