Indonesia: suspected human avian influenza cases increase across country
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suspected avian influenza cases are being detected in the country at an
alarming rate, with more people falling sick in Surakarta in Central Java,
Madiun and Malang in East Java, and Batam in Riau Islands province.
A 12 year old girl suspected of having contracted avian influenza died on
Wed night [1 Mar 2006] after being treated at the Moewardi Hospital in
Surakarta. Her body has been sent to her hometown in Boyolali, Central
Java, for burial, hospital director Mardiatmo told Antara. Blood tests for
the victim have been sent to a Jakarta laboratory for confirmation.
Another seriously ill suspected avian influenza patient is being treated in
isolation at the hospital. "Clinical symptoms, including coughing and a
high fever, indicate that he is bird flu-positive. The patient also used to
live near large-scale quail breeding centers," Tri Lastiti, the deputy
director of the hospital, told The Jakarta Post. The 31 year old man was
believed to have been infected by the carcasses of dead birds, which had
been dumped in the area during the past month. "Thousands of quail died
every day and their remains were just thrown away into a nearby river," the
man's wife said.
In Bandung, the number of suspected bird flu patients rose by 11 to 66 as
of Wed 1 Mar 2006. The latest patient was admitted to the city's Hasan
Sadikin Hospital on Wednesday.
In Madiun, East Java, the condition of a 12 year old patient from Singkil
village, Ponorogo, who is believed to be infected with the virus, remained
serious. "The patient is still in intensive care by our team of doctors,
and cannot be visited yet," a hospital spokesman said on Thu 2 Mar 2006. A
sample of the patient's blood has been sent to Jakarta for testing and the
results would be available within a week, the spokesman said.
In Malang, a 7 year old boy was admitted to the intensive care unit at the
Saiful Anwar Hospital with suspected avian influenza symptoms. However,
Gatoet Ismanoe, a doctor of the hospital, said the boy, who had earlier
been treated at the Muhammad Saleh Hospital in Probolinggo, was still under
observation to determine his illness.

[Although all these cases rank only as suspected cases at the present time,
Indonesia is currently the "hot spot" for human avian influenza cases and
it is likely that in due course one or more of these patients will be
confirmed as avian influenza cases by independent testing. At present 27
cases (20 of which have been fatal) have been confirmed by an external
WHO-collaborating laboratory. - Mod.CP]
