The Health Protection Agency is aware of a significant increase in reports
of cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in Northern Greece. To date, there have
been 164 cases and 14 deaths reported in Greece, most of which have
occurred in the last month.

There have also been 7 confirmed and 3 probable cases with 2 deaths seen in
Romania and 3 cases in Hungary. Cases have been reported in these countries
in previous years.

Cases of WNV [infection] are rare in people in Europe. The infection is
spread through mosquito bites, and it is not transmitted directly from
person-to-person. The majority (80 per cent) of people infected with WNV
will have no symptoms at all, and the remainder may experience a mild
influenza-like illness (fever, headache, body ache). A small proportion
(less than one per cent) will have more severe disease and may develop
inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the membrane
around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Most deaths have been
reported in those over 50 years old, who generally suffer more severe
disease. There is no human vaccine available against WNV.

The current outbreak in Greece does not involve any popular tourist
destinations, and the risk of catching this virus during travel to Greece
remains very low, as is also the case anywhere else in Europe. However, in
the light of the current outbreak, travellers to Greece should take
particular note of measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The advice
to people travelling in Europe, particularly where WNV has been reported,
is that they should take the usual appropriate anti-mosquito precautions.
These include: Wear loose fitting, lightweight clothing that covers up skin
as much as possible; limit outdoor exposure during peak times of mosquito
feeding, usually the hours from dusk to dawn. People are usually exposed in
the early morning and evening times. The safest course is to use repellents
when outdoors. Apply insect repellents to exposed skin and clothing. Always
follow manufacturers' directions for use. Repellents that contain DEET are
considered the most effective.

Indoors, mosquito bites can be reduced by air conditioning, insect-proof
screens on windows and doors and spraying the room with insecticide. Bed
nets and cot nets can be used if necessary. Mosquito coils can be burned or
vaporizing mats used in enclosed areas if needed. Avoid areas where there
are likely to be large concentrations of mosquitoes or other biting insects.
