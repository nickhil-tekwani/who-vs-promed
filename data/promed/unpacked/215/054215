Two cases of West Nile virus were registered in Astrakhan; one of the
individuals, an elderly woman, died as a result.
Older people in general are very vulnerable to the disease, which is
associated with a weakened immune system. To prevent new cases of disease,
preventive measures are being conducted in Astrakhan, mainly fumigating the
areas of mosquito concentration, specifically near water pools, in
basements, and in terrain with high grass.
In 2005 there were 73 cases of West Nile disease registered in total in
Astrakhan; 3 cases were fatal.
West Nile virus was identified in 1937 in a woman suffering with fever in
the West Nile region [of Africa], the source of its name.
It has caused outbreaks among people and animals in Europe and in the USA.
The virus can be transmitted to people and animals as a result of a
mosquito bite.

[I quote from Mod.CP's comment in posting 20051007.2927: "The Astrakhan
region is located in the extreme southeast of the European part of Russia.
The region occupies an area of 44 000 sq km. The Astrakhan region borders
the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Turkmenistan, and the Islamic
Republic of Iran. Within the Russian Federation the Astrakhan region
borders the Volgograd region and Republic of Kalmykia. West Nile virus
infection of humans and mammals (horses in particular) throughout its
African and Eurasian ranges is sporadic and rare."
West Nile virus is once again causing human cases in Astrakhan, although
there is no indication of whether these 2 cases have been confirmed in the
laboratory. ProMED would appreciate any additional information that might
become available relating to these or other cases. - Mod.TY]
