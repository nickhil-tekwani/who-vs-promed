In the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record No.40 of 3 Oct.1997, p.304, is a
Notification that Indonesia reported 28 confirmed cases of cholera for the
period 1 Jan. to 30 June 1997, location not given.
Since specimens from most cases of cholera are not sent to the laboratory
for confirmation, the number of cases was certainly much greater. It is
important to know whether this is _V. cholerae_ type O1 El Tor, or the new
type O139, and also to know the location of the outbreak(s), presumably in
the western islands and in Irian Java (see references above).
It is encouraging to see Indonesia notifying these cases at last. Since
the end of 1994 the country had not officially notified a single case, in
spite of evidence that the disease was still occurring there. The current
pandemic began in 1961 in the Celebes (Sulawesi), Indonesia.
