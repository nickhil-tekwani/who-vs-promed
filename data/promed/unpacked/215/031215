[A PowerPoint (PPT) presentation with the EFSA (European Food Safety Authority), ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and EURL (European Union Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza) scientific reports on the latest epidemic of avian influenza, presented on 7 Apr 2022 at the ScoPAFF (Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food, and Feed) meeting to the European Commission, mentioned that:

"HPAI A(H5) continues to be maintained in wild bird populations in Eurasia, including detection in resident wild birds in Europe, and was detected in a wider range of other wild bird species; this enlarged host range of HPAI A(H5) in wild birds indicates an increasing and changing risk for virus incursion into poultry farms.

"The dynamics of the current HPAI epidemic indicate that an elevated environmental pressure of infection will likely persist in the coming months, posing a risk for further virus introduction and spread in the poultry sector.

"The frequent occurrence of HPAI A(H5) virus incursions in commercial farms where birds are kept indoors, including poultry production types considered at low avian influenza risk, raises concern about the capacity of applied biosecurity measures to prevent virus introduction."

The full PPT presentation is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2022-04/reg-com_ahw_20220406_ai_efsa.pdf.
