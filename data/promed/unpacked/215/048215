RECENT ABNORMAL CALVES: RFI
===========================
I have had a (retired) DVM visitor from Missouri, whose observations over
the years I have come to trust. He has a herd of some 230 red angus cows.
This calving season he had three calves born two weeks early and which were
some 40% to 50% overweight, ie birth weights around 120 lbs instead of
80lbs. These calves were all unable to suckle (ie "dummies") and were either
unable to rise or very slow to do so. He has not seen such an abnormality
before. A couple of his neighbours have noted the same phenomenum as well as
a veterinary extension officer friend of his in central Kansas.
While the suckling and rising signs probably relate to anoxia during a
possibly prolonged calving, has anyone noted anything similar? Any
explanations for such large premature calves?
