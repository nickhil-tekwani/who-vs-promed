Indonesia confirmed its 4th human death from
avian influenza on Friday [16 Sep 2005] amid
growing global alarm that the virus would mutate
and become a pandemic. Speaking in New York on
Thursday [15 Sep 2005], World Health Organisation
Chief Lee Jong-wook said the virus was moving
toward becoming transmissible by humans and that
the international community had no time to waste
to prevent a pandemic.
The H5N1 [avian influenza virus] has killed 64
people in 4 Asian countries since late 2003 and
also spread to Russia and Europe [i.e. European
Russia - Mod.CP]. A senior Indonesian health
official said tests had shown [that avian
influenza virus infection was responsible for the
death of] a woman who died last week in a Jakarta
hospital after she was admitted suffering from
pneumonia and flu-like respiratory problems.
"It's positive for H5N1," I Nyoman Kandun,
Director-general of disease control at the Health
Ministry, told Reuters. Indonesia's health
minister is expected to hold a news conference
later on Friday to discuss the results, which had
been confirmed by a laboratory in Hong Kong.
The woman, 37, died last Saturday [10 Sep 2005].
She lived in south Jakarta near a chicken farm,
although health officials have not said how she
may have [contracted the infection]. "Our task
now as the government is to make sure the public
do not panic. Just like when we get a bomb
threat, we need to avoid panic. Up until now,
there is no proof that there is human-to-human
transfer," Kandun said.
But in a stark warning, WHO Chief Lee, a South
Korean doctor, said it was only a matter of time
before the virus mutated. "Human influenza is
coming, we know that, and no government, no
leaders can afford to be caught off-guard," Lee
told a news conference. "We must pounce on human
pandemic outbreaks with all medicines at our
disposal and at the earliest possible moment."
Most of the people killed in Asia since 2003
[contracted] the virus from infected birds.
Health experts say the greatest worry is that the
highly pathogenic strain of the [virus] known as
the H5N1 avian influenza A virus could mutate and
become transmissible between people. Lee said
H5N1 "will acquire this capability -- it's just
an issue of timing."
Countries distant from heavily hit Southeast
Asian states would not be safe, because the
disease [i.e. the virus] was spreading through
migratory wildfowl, Lee added. Besides Indonesia,
avian influenza has killed 44 people in Viet Nam,
12 people in Thailand and 4 in Cambodia. U.S.
President George W. Bush unveiled a plan at the
United Nations on Wednesday under which countries
and international agencies would pool resources
and expertise to fight avian influenza.
U.N. health authorities have said more cases
could be expected in Indonesia, the world's 4th
most populous nation. The government has launched
a vaccination drive for poultry, but carried out
only limited culling because it does not have
enough money to compensate farmers, and more than
half of all chickens in Indonesia are kept in
backyards.
The WHO says the preferable approach is mass
culling. The virus has spread to 22 provinces out
of 33 in the sprawling Indonesian archipelago,
killing more than 9.5 million poultry since late
2003.
In July 2005, Indonesia confirmed its 1st human
casualties of H5N1 avian influenza -- a father
and his 2 young daughters in Tangerang on the
outskirts of Jakarta. But authorities could not
pinpoint the source that infected the family.

Avian influenza - situation in Indonesia - update 29
-----------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has today
confirmed a fatal case of human infection with
H5N1 avian influenza. The case occurred in a
37-year-old
woman who resided in Jakarta. She developed
symptoms on 31 August, was hospitalized on 3
September, and died on 10 September.
The positive test results were received from a
WHO reference laboratory in Hong Kong.
The government has launched investigations,
assisted by WHO, aimed at identifying the source
of the woman's infection and tracing her close
contacts, including family members, neighbours,
and hospital staff engaged in her treatment.
The woman lived in an area with multiple
opportunities for exposure to chickens and ducks.
No recent poultry deaths have been reported in
the area. Poultry samples have been taken by
agriculture authorities as part of the ongoing
investigation.
This is the countryï¿½second laboratory-confirmed case.
In July 2005, a cluster of 3 deaths in one family
was investigated. H5N1 infection was confirmed in
the 38-year-old father but laboratory test
results for his two daughters did not meet
criteria for acute H5N1 infections. WHO reports
only laboratory-confirmed cases.
Investigation of the July family cluster was
unable to determine the source of exposure.
Testing and monitoring of more than 300 close
contacts failed to
detect any further cases.

[There is only limited evidence deduced from
experiments with laboratory mice that the H5N1
avian influenza virus is undergoing progressive
mutation towards direct transmissibility between
humans. The circumstances in which the 1st 3
human cases in Indonesia acquired infection are
still unclear. Proximity to a farm/slaughterhouse
appears to be the relevant factor in the 4th case
described above. Overall it is surprising that
there have not been more confirmed cases in
Indonesia, in view of the high density of the
human population in the Indonesian archipelago
and the extent of uncontrolled H5N1 avian
influenza disease in domestic and farmed poultry.
