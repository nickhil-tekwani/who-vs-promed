Pietermaritzburg - The blood samples taken from cloven-hoofed livestock
within the 10km radius quarantine zone at Camperdown in KwaZulu Natal
have so far tested negative for Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) since a
positive case last week.
The FMD control center said the positive case was an extension of the
original outbreak, not a new one, as it occurred well within the 10km
zone.
Veterinary teams believe the risk of further infection has fallen
significantly with the culling of several thousands of pigs, which
excrete the virus at 3000 times the rate cattle do.
However, surveillance is still being done on cloven-hoofed animals in the
10km quarantine zone where the disease broke out last month on a pig
farm.
