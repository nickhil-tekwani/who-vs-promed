[TBE regularly causes thousands of cases every year in Russia in
the summer. We would be interested to know if 1999 was an
exceptionally bad year. The tick season has presumably ended for
this year with the onset of winter in Siberia.
We are happy to receive this report. We would be glad to receive
more such reports on emerging infectious disease outbreaks from
the Russian Federation & the NIS/CIS - Mod.JW
