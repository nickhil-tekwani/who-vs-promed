New Oregon Study: Parasite Causing Whirling Disease Could be
Transmitted Via Fishing Waders
-----------------------------------------------
A new study has found that a parasite that causes deadly "whirling
disease" in juvenile trout and other salmonids may be transmitted
from one fishing hole to another -- and from one stream to another --
on fishing boots and waders.
The spread of whirling disease within the United States over the past
half century has primarily been through the movement of infected fish
through hatcheries, researchers say. But increasingly, whirling
disease has begun to show up in streams not stocked with infected
fish, and researchers have discovered that its transmission is not
accomplished directly from fish to fish.
"The bottom line is that we've found that the spores that eventually
infect the fish and lead to whirling disease can survive out of water
for 8 hours on the soles of waders," said Paul Reno, a microbiologist
with the Coastal Oregon Marine Experiment Station at Oregon State
University. "In laboratory tests, we found that these spores can
indeed attach themselves to the bottom of boots and waders and become
viable when reintroduced into clean water containing trout."
Whirling disease is a neurological disorder caused by the parasite
_Myxobolus cerebralis_, which primarily affects juvenile trout,
causing severe deformities of the skeleton and skull, and can lead to
mortality rates as high as 100 percent. It also can affect Atlantic
salmon, steelhead and possibly other salmonids, though there have
been fewer impacts on those species.
"Characteristically, it affects little fish -- the fry -- which then
swim around in circles and, if the infection is severe enough,
eventually most will die," Reno said.
"After the spores enter through the skin, the parasite eventually
works its way through the fish and imbeds into their skulls and
skeleton, degrading the cartilage. Originally, it was thought to
affect the equilibrium of the fish, but a few years ago an anatomist
found that the degraded cartilage was actually pinching their nerves
and causing deformities.
"If the fish are big enough, they seem to be able to withstand the
effects," added Reno, who is a professor in OSU's College of
Agricultural Sciences. "That may explain why it hasn't caused as many
problems with salmon and steelhead."
The disease was 1st recorded in U.S. waters in the mid-1950s in
Pennsylvania, and it slowly made its way west, appearing in Colorado
in the early 1980s and in Montana's blue-ribbon trout rivers in the mid-1990s.
In Oregon, whirling disease has been identified over the past 2
decades in tributaries of the Grande Ronde system in the northeastern
part of the state and more recently in Clear Creek on the Clackamas
River system.
The life cycle of the parasite causing whirling disease is complex,
Reno said. Once established in the skull of an adult fish, _Myxobolus
cerebralis_, which is only about 10 microns, or .01 millimeters in
size, is released into the water after the fish dies and decomposes.
These microscopic parasites are then devoured by tubifex worms that
live in the mud of freshwater streams and lakes, he added.
"These worms act as a 2nd host for the parasite, which metamorphoses
into these 300-micron monsters that are shaped like a river anchor," Reno said.
Then known as triactinomyxon, or "TAMs," the parasites remain in the
mud-dwelling worms until they are excreted into the lower water
column. Nearby trout redds are particularly vulnerable to the
parasite, which can attach to the skins and shoot spores into the
juvenile trout, penetrating their skin, beginning the cycle once again.
Interestingly, the TAMs only live in certain strains of host tubifex worms.
"Susceptible strains of tubifex worms are found pretty widely across
the state, as are strains that are more resistant," said Jerri
Bartholomew, a microbiologist with OSU's Center for Fish Disease
Research. "There is no obvious reason why whirling disease hasn't
become established in other places in Oregon, except that tubifex
densities are often fairly low."
In their studies, Reno and his colleagues at OSU's Hatfield Marine
Science Center in Newport wore waders and stepped into a water tank
that contained mud with tubifex worms at the bottom.
They found that stepping in the mud containing infected worms
released the spores, which then attached to the waders. Wearing the
waders into a separate clean tank with healthy rainbow trout was
enough to infect the fish.
Conversely, when dead infected trout were used as a source of the
parasite, the spores adhering to the bottom of the waders could
infect the worms. Even after the waders were left to dry for several
hours, enough infectious material remained to infect new hosts.
Reno said the OSU researchers also tested whether the parasite could
be passed through birds -- especially mergansers, mallards and crows
-- that might feed on the juvenile fish or worms, but results were
inconclusive.
Rainbow trout appear most susceptible to whirling disease, Reno said,
and European researchers are developing strains of fish that are more
resistant to infection.
The OSU study was funded by Montana State University.
About OSU's Hatfield Marine Science Center: The center is a research
and teaching facility located in Newport, Oregon on the Yaquina Bay
estuary, about one mile from the open waters of the Pacific Ocean. It
plays an integral role in programs of marine and estuarine research
and instruction, as a laboratory serving resident scientists, as a
base for far-ranging oceanographic studies and as a classroom for students.

[Largemouth bass virus was determined to be moved by fisherman. It
seems that this particular disease is no different in that regard.
The question is what type of disinfectant will kill the spores? Once
that has been determined, then the public will need to be educated on
how to disinfect their waders and boots, and with what disinfectant. - Mod.TG]
