Hundreds of ostriches culled
-------------------------------
Hundreds of ostriches are being culled after an outbreak of avian
influenza near Mossel Bay, the Western Cape's veterinary chief said
on Wednesday [19 Jul 2006]. "At least a couple of thousand will be
culled," said Dr James Kitching. He said the number was [relatively]
small, about the same number a single abattoir handled in a week.
Earlier in July 2006, the Department of Agriculture placed an ostrich
farm near Mossel Bay under quarantine when the flu was detected. The
department said the outbreak was not related to the deadly H5N1
strain, which has caused human fatalities in other parts of the world.
Local ostrich meat remained safe for human consumption.
Ostriches were killed with the assistance of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, with birds stunned with an electric
shock before being shot. "We hope to be done by the end of the
week," Kitching said, adding that farmers were compensated for their loss.
A precautionary European Union ban, in place since early July 2006,
on the import of ostrich meat and meat-related products remains in force.
