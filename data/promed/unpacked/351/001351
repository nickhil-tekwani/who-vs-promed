Honduras, Central America's largest coffee exporter, has reduced its 2020/21 coffee shipment projection by 8.3% due to deeper than initially estimated rust damage to crops, said Napole√≥n Matute, Honduran Coffee Institute (IHCAFE).

He explained that the humidity caused by the devastating floods from hurricanes late last year [2020] encouraged the spread of rust, damaging coffee crops. "More than 25 days of rainfall created a degree of humidity on farms and spurred the disease," he said.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), CLR affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance. No coffee cultivars resistant to all races are currently available. Furthermore, fungal spores that are wind borne or can easily be carried on travellers' clothes, as is the case for CLR, pose a very high biosecurity risk.

New fungal strains adapted to higher-altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, have emerged in Central America (for example, see ProMED posts 20170515.5038218, 20140604.2518313, 20120920.1301244) and South America (recently Colombia, ProMED post 20210504.8343204) making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. Central America, including Honduras, mostly produces arabica beans.
