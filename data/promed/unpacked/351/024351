[Case confirmations continue to trickle in. Given the history of 2 cases in 2 consecutive days in young individuals (ages 28 and 30) with a history of contact with known other cases, one begins to further suspect there may well be an outbreak ongoing in Riyadh or contact tracing is finding more secondary cases... (there have now been 16 newly confirmed cases reported in Saudi Arabia since 28 Jun 2015 of which 10 were reported from Riyadh). Repeating yesterday's comment..."So a logical question here is whether there may be another healthcare-facility-associated outbreak ongoing in Riyadh."
