Italy leads Europe in cases of hepatitis C, with 3 per cent of the population infected, more than half of whom suffer from the most difficult variety to treat, leading experts said on Tuesday [11 Jun 2013].

Some 1.6 million people carry the liver infection in Italy, and 55 per cent of them are afflicted with genotype 1, a particularly infectious strain of the disease, said doctors at the Premio Giornalistico Riccardo Tomassetti conference on virology in Milan. "At least one million Italians are chronic carriers of the infection," said Massimo Colombo, director of special treatments and organ transplants at Milan's Maggiore hospital. "1/3rd of these people have developed or are developing serious liver infections."

The majority of patients contracted the virus in the 1970s and 80s, Colombo said, through infected blood transfusions or from health instruments such as hypodermic needles that were not sterilized. "But another 200 000 -- 300 000 contracted the disease due to risky behaviour such as unprotected sex, piercings and tattoos. "In addition, we should include a substantial number of migrants who come from areas with high levels of hepatitis C."

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the commonest viruses that infect the liver.

Hepatitis C is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic infection are Egypt (15 per cent), Pakistan (4.8 per cent), and China (3.2 per cent). Thus, Italy ranks high in the global scale.

The incubation period for hepatitis C is 2 weeks to 6 months. Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). About 75-85 per cent of newly infected people develop chronic disease, and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C. (See: WHO Fact Sheet: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).

Hepatitis C does not always require treatment. There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, and they may respond differently to treatment. Careful screening is necessary before starting the treatment to determine the most appropriate approach. Of the various genotypes of hepatitis C virus, genotype 1 is one of the least responsive to the standard interferon and ribavirin-based therapy and thus most in need of novel treatments. However, new drugs are becoming available that can control genotype 1 infections. Boceprevir (Victrelis) is an inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein NS3-4A serine protease and is used in combination with pegylated interferon (peginterferon)-alpha and ribavirin in the treatment of adults with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection and has proven to be an effective and generally well tolerated treatment for treatment-naive or previously treated adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection. The drug is associated with higher sustained virological response rates in these patients, in whom treatment with interferon and ribavirin alone may not be successful. Thus, Boceprevir in combination with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is a valuable new treatment option for use in patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection (From: Garnock-Jones KP. Boceprevir: a review of its use in the management of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection. Drugs. 2012 Dec 24;72(18):2431-56). - Mod.CP
