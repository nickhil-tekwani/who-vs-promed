Home-preserved sea snails were behind an outbreak of botulism in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown. The shellfish were part of a meal shared by 4 people at one of their homes in the Bay of Plenty area, Toi Te Ora Public Health's Dr Neil de Wet said. All 4 had to be admitted to hospital in May [2020], a notifiable disease report from ESR says. Botulism is rare but can be very serious, said de Wet.

Sea snails are a staple street food in Vietnam, with an entire street dedicated to them in Ho Chi Mi [Ho Chi Minh City? - Mod.SH]. For generations, Oc, or sea snails, have been an integral part of Vietnamese nhau culture, which refers to the social gathering of eating and drinking in a lively atmosphere.

Botulism is caused by a nerve toxin produced by a bacterium called _Clostridium botulinum_. The toxin is able to cause symptoms ranging from double vision to muscle weakness, or trouble swallowing, talking, or breathing.

Tests on the leftover shellfish confirmed botulism was present in what the group had eaten, de Wet said."There were no other bottles of this prepared, given to or shared with others, and so there is not a further risk to anyone else," de Wet said.

"In this age group, botulism occurs when people eat food that has been kept in an environment where the [spores of the bacterium can germinate and] bacteria can grow and produce the neurotoxin," the Ministry of Health said. "This most commonly occurs with preserved vegetables, meat and fish."

It can also develop if a wound is infected with the bacterium. Initial symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, but it can then cause paralysis of the eyes, mouth and throat, then other muscles, the Ministry of Health said.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Type E is often associated with food from marine sources. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). Many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish (2).
