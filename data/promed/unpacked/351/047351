Cattle keepers in Umutara Province [Rwanda] are once again in a quagmire,
after the outbreak of the lethal foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the area.
The epidemic, which had earlier erupted in the province in 2003, has hit
the Mucucu and Nyagashanga areas of Gabiro District, after several cows
were reportedly infected.
This has forced district authorities to quarantine the area in an attempt
to vaccinate infected herds of cattle and bring further spread to a halt.
According to Manasseh Gahima, the Gabiro District Mayor, the epidemic was
only reported in his district, adding that the inquiries were ongoing to
find out the source of the disease for effective elimination.
"We have quarantined the area and contacted top authorities in charge of
livestock for general vaccination of cattle in the province," said Gahima,
adding that the outbreak had led to a total ban on trading in cattle
products in the district.
When contacted for comment on the vaccination arrangements, Dr. Theogene
Rutagwenda, the head of the task force for livestock promotion with the
Rwanda Animal Resource Development Authority (RADRA) at Rubilizi, confirmed
the outbreak and said that they had secured blood samples from the infected
herds and sent them to Nairobi-Kenya for laboratory testing.
"It is from the Nairobi laboratory testing that we will be able to identify
the appropriate treatment for the already infected herds and for the ring
vaccination of all cattle in the province," Rutagwenda said, adding that
the virus causing the epidemic has to be identified 1st before conducting
mass vaccination. However, he said that milk and other cattle products from
other districts would continue to be consumed.

[Foot and mouth disease does not infect human beings except in very rare
situations of intense virus concentrations, such as those experienced by
laboratory workers, in which case any resulting illness is a mild cold.
Meat may be cooked and eaten without fear of the disease.
Because of the lesions on the udders, affected animals will be difficult to
milk, and milk production drops dramatically. Often, these animals are
prone to mastitis, which affects the milk quality and quantity. - Mod.TG]
