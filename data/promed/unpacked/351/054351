A diphtheria outbreak has killed 73 people in war-torn Yemen since August [2017], according to the World Health Organization (WHO) on [Mon 12 Mar 2018]. In a statement, the UN agency said some 1294 suspected cases of diphtheria have been recorded in 20 of Yemen's 23 provinces. It listed Ibb and al-Hodeidah provinces in central and western Yemen as the hardest-hit by the disease.

Diphtheria spreads as easily as the common cold through sneezing, coughing, or even talking, according to health officials. Mainly affecting children, diphtheria can cause devastating epidemics if left unchecked.

Yemen has been racked by violence since 2014, when Houthi rebels overran much of the country. The conflict escalated in 2015 when Saudi Arabia and its allies launched a devastating air campaign aimed at rolling back Houthi gains. The ongoing violence has devastated basic services, including water and sanitation systems, prompting the UN to describe the situation in Yemen as one of "the world's worst humanitarian disasters in modern times".
