A previously unseen type of measles [see comment below] is spreading
in Istanbul, where 24 cases have been reported since the start of the
year [2011], the Istanbul Provincial Health Directorate has announced
in a warning issued to the public. According to the directorate, the
"foreign-origin virus [was] unseen in Turkey" and thus has been able
to spread very rapidly. In response to the new threat, the Health
Ministry has announced that it may vaccinate people born between 1975
and 1990 if they request inoculation. The number of measles cases in
Istanbul has increased from 2 to 24 over the last 3 months, according
to a report in the Radikal [newspaper].

Deputy Istanbul Health Director Serap Gencer said 2 of the
hospitalized people were released on Tuesday [22 Feb 2011], and the
remaining ones' were "generally in good condition." Gencer said all of
the ill are Turks. "The genetic analyses of the isolated viruses taken
from the samples point to a foreign origin." She said they could not
determine a direct origin but are sure this is a virus previously
unseen in Turkey. Gencer said the ill people, including 4 health
service employees and 4 infants, are either recovered or recovering,
and there is no risk of fatalities. There is no risk of an epidemic,
since vaccinations are standard at schools. "Since children of school
age have been vaccinated twice, there is no need for parents to
panic," she said.

Mustafa Sulku, a member of the Istanbul branch of the Practicing
Physicians Association who spoke at a press conference held in
Istanbul on Monday [21 Feb 2011] on the concerns of the "family
doctor" system, said although there are tendencies to present these
cases as coming from outside Istanbul, the 1st ones were detected in
residents living in Istanbul. Sulku said the most recently identified
cases belonged to people living in other Turkish cities. Sulku also
said the number one cause of the problem is "neglecting 1st-step
health services." Negligence caused this situation just as Istanbul
was about to eliminate measles for good.

Members of the Istanbul Medical Chamber attributed the failure to
identify and isolate measles cases in the city to the improper
functioning of the "family doctor" system and said that other worse
consequences could follow for people unless authorities do not address
this system's concerns properly.

Professor Nurhan Ince from Istanbul University's Public Health
Department said the Health Ministry implemented a program that
vaccinated 8.5 million in 2003 and 9 million people in 2004. She added
that it was too early to say whether the disease was caused by a
domestic virus or not, as the virus should be examined in
laboratories. Ince said the ministry already vaccinates people in 2
doses, 1st when they are one year old and then during the 1st year of
elementary school. Meanwhile, Minister of Health Recep Akdag announced
that they might vaccinate people born between 1975 and 1990 if they
request a vaccination.

[Turkey has a commendable record in controlling measles virus
infection by vaccination, with 97 percent coverage of the population
by 2008, when no cases of measles were recorded.

Although measles virus is serologically monotypic, the genetic
characterization of wild-type viruses has identified 8 clades (A-H),
which have been divided into 22 genotypes and one proposed genotype.
Clades B, C, D, G and H each contain multiple genotypes (B1-3, C1-2,
D1-10, G1-3, H1-2) while clades A, E and F each contain a single
genotype (A, E, F) [1,2]. The sequences of the vaccine strains
indicate that the wild type viruses from which they were derived were
all members of genotype A (see: Review of the temporal and
geographical distribution of measles virus genotypes in the prevaccine
and postvaccine eras. Riddell et al. Virol J. 2005; 2: 87;
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1318492/>).

In 2005, genotype D6 was the genotype of measles virus present in
Turkey (Ceylan, A et al., Turk J Pediatr 2005 Oct-Dec;47(4):309-150).
It is presumed that measles virus of a different genotype is
responsible for the current outbreak in Turkey, and the suggestion is
that the virus has been introduced into Turkey from elsewhere.
