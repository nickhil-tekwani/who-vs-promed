[Please see Avian influenza (39): Mongolia (AR) wild
birds 20090528.1985 for informative comments from Martin Gilbert of
the Wildlife Conservation Society concerning last year's repeating
pattern of outbreaks covering multiple locations and countries in
central Asia. While we have not yet seen the as many OIE reports this
year concerning outbreaks in wild birds, outbreaks have occurred in
the last month or so in Mongolia and Tibet and now we have an nearby
outbreak in Russia.

Also, as was the case last year, Diann Prosser from the US Geological
Survey -- see Avian influenza (40): Mongolia, China, wild birds
20090529.1998 which points out that the importance of identifying the
species of birds in order to get a complete epidemiologic picture of
the pattern of ongoing transmission in a region. It is therefore
surprising (and the OIE epidemiologic notes points out) that no
species identification accompanies this report. Hopefully, it will be
included in follow up OIE updates. - Mod.PC]
