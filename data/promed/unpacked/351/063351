First report of _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ in Greece
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The presence of _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO A2 List) is reported for the first time in Greece. In mid-March 2014, a sample of shoots (canes and leaders) of _Actinidia deliciosa_ [kiwifruit] showing red-rusty cankers and brown discoloration of the vascular tissues underneath the bark, was sent by a grower for examination. This sample originated from an orchard with 5 year old plants located in Northern Greece. In this orchard, almost all plants exhibited symptoms.

Laboratory and pathogenicity tests confirmed the presence of the bacterium in the sample. A nationwide survey is underway to determine the extent of the affected area.

Field experiments conducted in Italy from 2011 to 2013 showed that _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (EPPO A2 List) could be transmitted to healthy plants of _Actinidia deliciosa_ via infected pollen. Although further pollination experiments are needed to confirm this preliminary study, the results obtained strongly support the hypothesis that infected pollen can be a pathway for introducing and spreading the disease.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn.

Data on epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected. Research in New Zealand found live Psa bacteria associated with pollen from closed kiwifruit flowers and further evidence is provided in item 2 above. Spread with infected fruit cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available.

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen), and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a new streptomycin resistant strain is currently emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

An outbreak of Psa in Italy in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa-V. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa-V. Strains from China and New Zealand appear to be more similar to each other than to strains from Italy. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206). Strains identified in Greece have been partially sequenced and assigned to the 'European population' of Psa.
