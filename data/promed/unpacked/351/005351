Queensland citrus farms clear of canker
-----------------------------------------
Inspectors have declared that 42 citrus farms in Queensland are free of any
trace of citrus canker. The farms had received budwood from a nursery in
the quarantine area in central Queensland. Authorities still have to check
areas around the orchards before the Gayndah-Mundubbera region is declared
canker-free, thus enabling growers to resume interstate trade.
A major South Australian citrus exporter is hoping the concerns of southern
growing regions won't be forgotten amidst the turmoil in Queensland.
Riverland-based packer Lochert Brothers says that, since the canker
outbreak, new quarantine protocols have grounded its USD 1 million export
program to New Zealand. Dennis Hodson, a spokesman for the company, has
called for authorities to start clearing other affected regions in order to
resume their exports.
Meanwhile, the Federal Agriculture Minister, and his Queensland
counterpart, continue to quarrel over who is to blame for failing to
finding the canker sooner.
