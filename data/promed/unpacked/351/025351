A horse in Ontario, Canada has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), Equestrian Canada reported on 15 Sep 2016.

"On 12 Sep 2016, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of a positive test result for West Nile virus in a horse from the Toronto area," a statement posted on the Equestrian Canada website said. "The horse displayed signs of fever, muscle tremors, gait abnormalities (ataxia), and weakness. The horse is recovering under veterinary medical supervision."

According to the OMAFRA Equine Neurological Disease Surveillance webpage, this is the 1st equine WNV case reported in Ontario this year [2016].

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flu-like signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rates can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

Three horses have been diagnosed with West Nile virus in Okanogan County since the beginning of September 2016.

The prognosis for one horse was very good, but the other 2 have been euthanized, according to Okanogan County Public Health. None of the horses had been vaccinated against the virus. All 3 horses were reported to have acquired the infection in Washington State.

West Nile is a virus carried by mosquitoes that feed on an infected bird. Once infected, the mosquito can infect people, horses and other birds. Scientists do not believe the virus is spread from person to person or from animal to person, according to public health.

No human cases of West Nile virus have been reported in Okanogan County this year [2016], but the infection of local horses means that the virus may be present in the county.

West Nile virus affects horses, mules and donkeys more often than other animals, according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Most horses infected with the virus do not become ill or show any signs. Those that do become ill may have a loss of appetite, loss of coordination, confusion, fever and muscle tremors. About a third of horses that become ill will die.

The risk for a person to become infected with West Nile virus is very low, according to the state Department of Health. Most people infected with the virus do not get sick, but one in 5 have mild symptoms such as fever, headache and body aches.

One in 150 people have more severe symptoms, which can include high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should contact a health care provider. There is no human vaccine for the virus.

Public health recommends people take precautions to prevent mosquito bites, including staying indoors at dawn and dusk, using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, and using window screens. People should reduce mosquito breeding areas by emptying anything that holds standing water, such as old tires, buckets and toys. People should also change water in birdbaths, wading pools and animal troughs at least twice a week; make sure roof gutters are not clogged; and fix leaky outdoor faucets and sprinklers.

West Nile virus 1st appeared in the United States in New York City in 1999 and has spread rapidly throughout the country. The 1st human cases in Washington were reported in 2006, according to the Department of Health. This year [2016] in Washington, there have been 6 confirmed human cases, 16 cases in horses, and one in birds. All cases have been in eastern Washington, with the human cases in south eastern Washington.

The Department of Agriculture recommends that horse owners talk to their veterinarians about the vaccine for the virus. Report suspected cases of West Nile virus in horses to the state veterinarian at (360) 902-1881 or <ahealth@agr.wa.gov>.

The 1st positive case of West Nile virus [infection] in an Ohio horse has been confirmed.

Testing on samples taken from a 7 year old standardbred in Tuscarawas County confirmed the positive WNV diagnosis to the Ohio Department of Agriculture on 12 Sep 2016.

The horse's veterinarian 1st examined the animal on 29 Aug 2016. The animal was euthanized after exhibiting significant clinical signs, including shaking, agitation and thrashing. The horse had not been vaccinated.

Infection with WNV does not always lead to signs of illness in people or animals. WNV is endemic in the United States, and Ohio has reported 3 positive cases in horses each of the last few years.

In addition to vaccinations, the agriculture department said horse owners also should work to reduce the mosquito population and eliminate possible breeding areas. Recommendations include: removing stagnant water sources; keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening; and using mosquito repellents.

[Vaccination cannot be over emphasized. It is the single best way to prevent this disease in your animals.

Although West Nile virus (WNV) became an endemic disease in the United States many years ago, it is sad that animals suffer and may end up dead because a vaccine was not given. Prevention is a simple vaccine.

"WNV is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 per cent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental United States, most of Canada, and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans, and a number of other mammals. West Nile virus is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is about 33 per cent. Data have supported that 40 per cent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6 months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for West Nile virus is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.

There are 3 challenge models that have been used to license currently available vaccines. The mosquito and needle challenge were the 2 models used in early studies. These challenge models result in 90 per cent of non-vaccinated control horses developing viremia, while only 10 per cent of these horses demonstrated clinical disease. More recently, the intrathecal (infection in the atlanto-occipital space) challenge model has been employed. In this model, 70 to 90 per cent of non-vaccinated control horses become viremic and 90 to 100 per cent develop grave signs of encephalomyelitis.

West Nile virus vaccines are licensed either as 1) an aid in prevention of viremia; 2) an aid in reduction of viremia, encephalitis, and clinical disease; 3) an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis; or 4) an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality, and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Vaccines
--------
There are 4 USDA licensed vaccines currently available (2 are inactivated whole WNV vaccines; one is a non-replicating live canary pox recombinant vector vaccine, and one is an inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine):

Inactivated whole virus vaccines with an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 6 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. These products are labeled as an aid in prevention of viremia or as an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain canary pox vector which does not replicate in the horse. The vaccine contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 4 to 6 weeks apart, followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. The product is labeled as an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain yellow fever virus vector and contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 4 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. This product is labeled as an aid in reduction of disease, encephalitis and viremia.

All of the current WNV vaccine products carry 1 year duration of immunity, with challenge, consistent with their respective label claims.

Vaccination schedules
---------------------
Adult horses previously vaccinated: Vaccinate annually in the spring, prior to the onset of the insect vector season.

For animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed revaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. For instance, juvenile horses (younger than 5 years of age) appear to be more susceptible than adult horses that have likely been vaccinated and/or had subclinical exposure. Geriatric horses (older than 15 years of age) have been demonstrated to have enhanced susceptibility to WNV disease. Therefore, more frequent vaccination may be recommended to meet the vaccination needs of these horses.

Booster vaccinations are warranted according to local disease or exposure risk. However, more frequent vaccination may be indicated with any of these products depending on risk assessment.

Adult horses previously unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history:
Inactivated whole virus vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 4 to 6 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses with a 4 to 6 week interval between doses. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 3 to 4 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Pregnant mares:
Limited studies have been performed that examine vaccinal protection against WNV disease in pregnant mares. While none of the licensed vaccines are specifically labeled for administration to pregnant mares at this time, practitioners have vaccinated pregnant mares due to the risk of natural infection. It is an accepted practice by many veterinarians to administer WNV vaccines to pregnant mares as the risk of adverse consequences of WNV infection outweighs any reported adverse effects of use of vaccine.

Pregnant mares previously vaccinated:
Vaccinate at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

Pregnant mares previously unvaccinated:
Initiate a primary vaccination series (see adult horses previously unvaccinated) immediately. Limited antibody response was demonstrated in pregnant mares vaccinated for the 1st time with the originally licensed inactivated, whole virus vaccine. It is unknown if this is true for the other products. Vaccination of naïve mares while open is a preferred strategy.

Foals:
Limited studies have been performed examining maternal antibody inference and inhibition of protection against WNV disease. The only data currently available is for the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus product in which foals were demonstrated to produce antibody in response to vaccination despite the presence of maternal antibody. No studies have been performed evaluating protection from disease in foals vaccinated in the face of maternal immunity.

Foals of vaccinated mares:
Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus vaccine; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. There should be a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

There are no data for the recombinant canary pox vector vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4-6 months of age. There should be a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

There are no data for the inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Foals of unvaccinated mares:
The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season.

Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed product; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered:
Recovered horses likely develop life-long immunity, but this has not been confirmed. Consider revaccination if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection or at the recommendation of the attending veterinarian. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
