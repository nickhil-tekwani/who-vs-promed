The Role of Bird Migration in the Spread of West Nile Virus in North America
--------------------------------------------------
The human cases of West Nile virus infection reported in 2003 (thus far)
for the USA & Canada show a conspicuous pattern: most of the reported
cases in Canada have occurred east of the Rocky Mountains, but in the USA
they have occurred west of the Mississippi River.
More than 85 percent of reported U.S. cases (from data summarized on
ProMED-mail) have occurred in a vertical column of 8 states: Texas, New
Mexico, Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming, North Dakota, and
Montana. In Canada more than 90 percent of reported cases have been in the
3 prairie provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, & Manitoba. The Rocky
Mountains seem to be an important boundary for this year's human
infections, if one contrasts the case reports in New Mexico with those in
Arizona, Colorado versus Utah, and Montana and Wyoming versus Idaho.
The states and provinces with the most West Nile virus cases are on major
migratory routes for birds traveling north as far as Canada. Compared with
human West Nile virus infections in earlier years, it appears that in 2003
the disease moved not merely west, but to a different set of migration
routes. The role of migratory birds in West Nile virus transmission has
been discussed in the past on ProMED-mail, but 2 general questions have not
yet been addressed adequately in scholarly publications, online reports,
announcements, or discussion group e-mail (such as ProMED-mail and
westnilevirus-l).
(1) To what extent has the U.S. distribution of human West Nile virus cases
been predictable or constrained by major bird migration "routes" and the
timing of migrations in each year of cases? For example, in 2003, after
taking into account effects of population distributions, have the Texas
cases been particularly prevalent in western Texas, and have the Colorado
cases been particularly prevalent east of the Rockies? There have been
excellent discussions of how migratory "species" are likely to be involved
in long-range transmission of West Nile virus (1, 2), but these should be
supplemented by quantified analysis of route effects, for example relating
cases (or case probabilities), after appropriate time lags, to
concentrations of migratory bird species in the same locales. Routes and
the timing of their use may be essential to study in addition to bird
species because (a) any list of identified transmission species may long
remain seriously incomplete, and (b) transmission may depend on the
populations of certain mosquito species along migration routes at the
"right" times.
(2) What explanations have been proposed (and possibly tested) thus far
for the 2003 shift of West Nile virus cases from the eastern USA & Ontario
to the states and provinces of the central plains? For example, if there is
a link with bird migration routes and timetables (perhaps in conjunction
with the size of local mosquito populations), can the shift to more western
routes be related to climate patterns in 2003, such as daily temperature
ranges and averages, rainfall patterns, and the timing of changes in these
seasonally? There has been debate on ProMED-mail about whether droughts
may concentrate mosquitoes and (migratory) birds at the same water sources,
but how the timing of weather conditions can bring birds and mosquitoes
together may need a closer look.
Information relevant to these questions might be very helpful for states
and provinces trying to prepare for next year's West Nile virus outbreak.

[Richard Wilsnack is extending a thread from last fall -- see refs below.
Charles Calisher, a former moderator, comments: "One problem I have with use
of the term 'migratory' is that it is often confused with 'movement.'" Birds
born in non-West Nile virus areas obviously fly in and become targets for the
virus, but that problem will soon disappear, as West Nile virus spreads
further south in this hemisphere. The big question here is timing, as
Richard points out. If West Nile virus-infected birds are migrating
northward in the spring, wouldn't that virus become diluted in all the
other West Nile virus that is already there?"
Perhaps equally important factors in the spread of West Nile virus in North
America are the range and behavior of the mosquito vectors. In "West Nile
virus update 2003 - USA (27) 20031002.2477", Dr Lyle Petersen of the CDC
characterized the 2003 outbreak as different from previous U.S. onslaughts
because the virus has sharply affected rural areas. Previous outbreaks were
spread by mosquitoes that tended to live near homes and buildings. The
reason is the type of mosquito responsible for passing the virus in Western
states, _Culex tarsalis_, lives among farmland, travels far, and is "the
most efficient vector of West Nile virus ever discovered," - Mod.CP]
