We have just put "on line" an article giving the details on how to use
histological sections of amphibian skin to diagnose infection with
_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, the amphibian chytrid fungus. Follow the
link at the Amphibian Diseases Home Page
<http://www.jcu.edu.au/school/phtm/PHTM/frogs/ampdis.htm>. The article is
an original one, available at the moment only on the World Wide Web. We
have made it available as a step in assisting others to gain the skills to
diagnose chytridiomycosis.
The article is Berger L, Speare R, Kent A. Diagnosis of chytridiomycosis in
amphibians by histologic examination. URL:
