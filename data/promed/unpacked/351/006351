Massachusetts horse dies of EEE
-------------------------------
Massachusetts health officials say the
mosquito-borne disease Eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) has been detected in a horse
in the state for the 1st time this year,
increasing the risk that it will spread to humans.

The state Public Health Department announced
Thursday [24 Sep 2009] that the 1-year-old horse
from Peabody fell ill on 18 Sep 2009 and died the
next day.

State epidemiologist Dr. Alfred DeMaria says the
fact a horse fell ill with EEE means that humans
are at increased risk.

Horse in Acton identified as victim of EEE virus
------------------------------------------------
Officials in Acton, Maine, learned last week
[week of 14-18 Sep 2009] that a horse that fell
ill recently was a victim of Eastern Equine
Encephalitis (EEE). Over the last few weeks, 14
cases of EEE in animals have been confirmed by
the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Lab in
Augusta, Maine. The cases are spread across the
state, from South Berwick in York County to as
far north as the town of Newport in Penobscot
County. Cases have also been confirmed in
Cumberland, Kennebec, and Waldo counties. All the
animals were euthanized.

The majority of the cases involve horses that had
not been vaccinated or had an incomplete or
questionable history of vaccination, according to
the Maine Center for Disease Control (CDC). While
most of the affected animals have been horses,
tests confirmed this week that several pheasants
that died last week in South Berwick tested
positive for the EEE virus, according to Anne
Sites, manager of the state's Infectious Disease
Epidemiology Program. The pheasants were part of
a flock of several hundred birds on the South
Berwick farm.

The EEE virus is transmitted by mosquitoes that
are infected by feeding on infected birds.
Although the risk of contracting EEE from one
mosquito bite is very small, Maine CDC officials
are particularly concerned because recent cases
indicate that the virus is more geographically
widespread in the state than previously thought.
EEE is especially associated with wetland and
coastal areas, and some of the recently infected
horses resided near bogs and other wetlands,
according to the CDC.

The disease was 1st confirmed in Maine in 2005
when 2 horses in York County became ill.
Mosquitoes and birds also tested positive for EEE
that year.

The virus is highly fatal to horses, with
mortality approaching 100 percent, according to
the CDC. Infected horses can exhibit signs of
illness within 3-10 days of being bitten. Signs
include "lethargy, unsteadiness, erratic
behavior, head pressing, circling and a marked
loss of coordination."

There is no effective treatment for the disease,
according to the Maine Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), and coma and seizures
resulting in death usually occur within 48-72
hours of the 1st symptoms of illness. The horses
infected in Maine have exhibited "an extremely
rapid progression of clinical signs from normal
to recumbent and comatose within 24-48 hours."

Although there is no treatment or cure for horses
infected with the EEE virus, there is a vaccine
to prevent them from contracting it. There is no
vaccine to protect humans and other animals from
contracting the disease. Alpacas and llamas are
also at risk of EEE, however there is not yet a
vaccine for those animals.

In the fall of 2008, a man from another state who
spent time in Cumberland County died from EEE. As
of 22 Sep 2009, there have been no confirmed
cases this year of the virus infecting humans in
Maine.

About one-third of the humans who have symptoms
of encephalitis will die, according to the Maine
CDC, and approximately half of the survivors will
have permanent disabilities. Many people infected
with the EEE virus will not show signs of
illness, but those who develop symptoms will
usually do so in 3 to 10 days of being bitten by
an infected mosquito. Symptoms are similar to the
flu and can range from mild illness to seizures,
coma and death.

People most at risk of contracting EEE are those
who live, work or visit wetland areas or other
areas where the virus has been identified, and
people over the age of 50 and under the age of
15. Humans cannot be infected by infected horses.

The Maine CDC recommends several precautions
people should take to protect themselves from
EEE. They include:
- Using an insect repellent on exposed skin
and/or clothing. The repellent should contain
DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon
eucalyptus.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks
when outdoors and, when taking infants outdoors,
put mosquito netting over infant carriers.
- Limit outdoor activities in the early evening
hours (dusk) or reschedule outdoor group
activities so that people can be indoors one hour
before sunset.
- Eliminate all unnecessary standing water -- in
rain gutters, buckets -- to reduce mosquito
habitats.
- Make sure window and door screens are in good condition.

[Horses seem to be the sentinel animal for
Eastern equine encephalitis. Birds are also
susceptible to the disease. Chickens have been
known to be stationed around some municipalities
as sentinel animals, as birds are sensitive
indicators as well.

Horse owners cannot acquire the disease from
their horses, but rather from mosquitoes. Horse
owners are encouraged to vaccinate 2 or 3 times a
year, as immunity to this disease wanes quickly
in the horse. The vaccination is a small
investment versus the life of the animal and
impact it has on owners, especially children.

The Eastern states of the US have had an
abundance of rain, allowing for mosquitoes to
grow in abundance in this areas. Mosquito control
measures include eliminating any standing water
around homes and barns that may be mosquito
breeding sites. Municipalities may choose to
conduct aerosol spraying. The recommendations
above regarding protective measures for people is
appropriate. Â– Mod.TG]
