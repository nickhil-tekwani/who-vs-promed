David Strickland knew his honeybees were in trouble when the yellow helicopter flew over his dining table at the North Beach Bar and Grill on Tuesday [20 Jun 2017] night.

He hadn't received the usual warning that Mosquito Control would be spraying that day, so his bees were out foraging instead of safely inside the hive. Thousands of them were sprayed. By the next morning, dead bees covered the porches of the 4 hives he keeps on the roof of his Fort Screven home on Tybee. He has 7 hives in all.

"Our hives will live, but we lost bees out of each," he said. "The largest had a couple thousand dead."

As a hobby beekeeper, Strickland had registered with Mosquito Control to receive notification about spraying so he could protect his bees. Usually he puts a screen over the exit of each hive several hours before the scheduled spraying to keep the bees inside. But he didn't receive the notification this time.

Mosquito Control and other Chatham County officials became aware of the missed notifications Wednesday [21 Jun 2017] after Strickland posted about his dead bees on Facebook.

Jeffrey Heusel, director of Chatham County Mosquito Control, said the problem appeared to be a clerical error in which the 9 Tybee registrants were inadvertently omitted from that round of automated calls. Mosquito Control revised the format of its list to avoid repeating the problem, he said.

A county press release issued Wednesday [21 Jun 2017] indicated county officials would contact Strickland, but that hadn't happened as of late Thursday afternoon. County spokeswoman Catherine Glasby said the legal department would consider compensation.

Strickland's hives produce about 50 gallons of honey a year, with each season having a distinctive taste depending on the flowers his Italian honeybees have been visiting.

"Fall is the best. It's dark and spicy," Strickland said.

The hives are worth up to USD 500 each, he estimated, but his loss wasn't really about the money.

"They're like our little pets," he said. "We love them. This is our lifestyle."

The county has used the automated call program for 3 years without a similar problem that Heusel was aware of. The countywide call list comprises 364 residents. Tybee has been sprayed 3 times so far this year [2017].

Before it instituted the automated calling, Mosquito Control relied on an office assistant to call everyone on the list before spraying. That system failed Strickland before. Many area beekeepers -- like those at the Coastal Empire Beekeepers Association, which has more than 100 members and monthly meetings at Oatland Island Wildlife Center -- have similar stories, he said.

After they were sprayed, Stickland's bees tried to clear away the dead.

"Other bees will come and pick them up and try to fly them away from the hive," he said. "It's damaging for the bees' morale."

Mosquito Control avoids the use of its helicopter-applied Naled spray as much as possible, Heusel said, because it's expensive and reducing its application reduces the possibility of mosquitoes developing resistance. His department instead reduces mosquito habitat by ditching areas where water pools -- especially on islands -- to allow the tide to flush out standing water. It also applies growth inhibitors in storm drains, dredge sites and on the islands using a bacterial compound, _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis, as well as a synthetic hormone, methoprene, that prevent larval mosquitoes from developing into adults.

"Everything is geared toward as little spraying as possible," said Heusel, whose Mosquito Control operates on about a USD 4 million a year budget. [One third] of that is spent on pesticides.

Naled, an organophosphate, is meant to target adult mosquitoes and not other insects. It's applied here at the lowest effective dose of 0.6 ounce per acre [approximately 44 milliliters per hectare] in microdroplets, about the same width as a human hair, Heusel said. The flights are timed for around dusk when mosquitoes are more active and other insects like honeybees are winding down.

"We're trying to minimize any type of unintended impact," Heusel said.

But the bees are evidence it doesn't always work out that way.

Effingham County beekeeper Harold Ward, who was removing unwanted bees from a Landings house on Thursday [22 Jun 2017], said he had had good experiences with Mosquito Control warning him in advance about upcoming spraying. But he could still see the environmental impact of the pesticide program. Neighboring counties don't have aerial spraying programs.

"If you go up to Effingham, Bulloch or Screven, you see dragonflies and fireflies, but you don't have those in Chatham County," he said. "It's because of Mosquito Control."

In a study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a Florida-based researcher found in 2015 that Naled and permethrin, even when used properly, harmed butterflies and caterpillars. Miami has since instituted limits on where it sprays to protect endangered butterflies.

Heusel's focus is on preventing mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis as well as emerging problems such as Zika.

"The bottom line is our primary mission is to try to protect the citizens of Chatham County," he said. "If we can do that without affecting anything else, that's what we're going to do."

It's the "anything else" that worries beekeepers like Strickland.

"I don't like getting bit either, but there has to be a better way than dumping pesticides over the whole county," he said.

Mosquito Control offers a courtesy call for anyone in the county who wants advanced notice of spraying. Sign up online at http://mosquitocontrol. chathamcounty.org/Service- Request.

[While Mosquito Control offers a courtesy call, this article illustrates that the system has flaws and that back-up plans and double-checks for accurate working of the system do not seem to be in place.

This is devastating to a bee keeper and can impact the productivity of the entire hive. While this person states his hives will survive, that may be a premature statement. The workings of a hive can be tremendously affected by such a high death loss of its members. A bee keeper deeply feels for the loss of his bees, the hive productivity and his income. I have many bee keepers as friends, and they almost go into mourning when a hive is so adversely affected as this article describes.

Naled is an organophosphate distributed in microdroplets. This delivery system is excellent for mosquitoes, but also makes it extremely deadly to a bee. They are unable to clean themselves of microdroplets, and especially microdroplets of an organophosphate.

People who are sensitive to chemicals in general, perhaps including household chemicals, could experience effects such as skin, eye and nose irritation.

According to the EPA: https://www.epa.gov/mosquitocontrol/naled-mosquito-control, "Some people who are especially concerned may choose to take some of these steps to help reduce exposure even more. This may include people who are sensitive to chemicals and those with pre-existing respiratory problems.

- Stay indoors with the windows closed during spraying.
- If you are outdoors during spraying operations and you can see the spray, avoid contact with it. If you can't avoid contact, rinse your skin and eyes with water.
- Wash fruits and vegetables from your garden before storing, cooking or eating.
- Cover outside items like furniture and grills while the spraying is occurring. Bring pets and items like pet food dishes and children's toys indoors. Rinse any items left uncovered outside before using."

If the EPA is so concerned about this pesticide as to recommend rinsing your skin and eyes and to even to rinse uncovered objects outside, it indicates that there is a reason to be concerned about toxicity, regardless of your perceived sensitivity. Microdroplets can absorb much faster and may cause more serious problems in the correct quantity.

EPA even states (on the same website as above): "Decisions about where and when to spray will be made by local officials. Listen for announcements in your community with the dates, times and locations of upcoming sprayings. They are usually announced a day or 2 before they are scheduled to occur."

This kind of notice indicates the town may have failed more than just the bee keepers.

Even though this bee keeper says his hives will survive, taking the payment may help him start another hive in the event this hive is weakened to the point winter may cause it to fail completely.

City officials need to find multiple ways to warn citizens and bee keepers, especially of this spray or any other spraying. - Mod.TG]

[Integrated results from empirical and theoretical research found that bee colony collapses are caused by interacting stress factors that affect the balance between pathogens and host immunity. Pesticides are one of these interacting stressors. - Mod.PMB
