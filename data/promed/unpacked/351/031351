A study found that there could be as little as only 1 million wild rabbits left in Scotland as a result of the latest form of haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV).

Researchers from the James Hutton Institute (JHI) in Invergowrie near Dundee are fearing that the new strain could prove as big a killer as myxomatosis -- a fatal disease that causes swelling to rabbits' membranes.

Experts suspect there are less than 4 million wild rabbits in the whole of the UK due to the latest highly contagious RHDV strain. During the height of myxomatosis in the 1950's figures fell to a similar level.

The new research monitored 5 farms across Scotland and England over 30 years and found significant decline in numbers sighted and shot. On one site, numbers were down from more than 300 rabbits to just 15.

Researchers said that findings from the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust between 1995 and 2009 suggest declines of up to 90 percent.

Although the type 2 variant was not reported in Scotland until 2014, JHI fear it is the reason behind the downward trend. Unlike myxomatosis, RHDV shows no signs therefore animals can drop dead at any time even when appearing healthy.

The figures are thought to be good news for farmers who lose millions of pounds a year due to crop damage caused by rabbits. However, the decline threatens the survival of their predators including buzzard and stoat.

The British Trust for Ornithology reported a 20 percent fall in the number of buzzards in Scotland between 2003 and 2013.

JHI research associate Dr Brian Boag said: "The numbers could be similar to those seen after myxomatosis, where numbers of buzzard, stoat, and fox fell."

He added that the decline "may have already hit predators in Scotland.

In Spain, the Spanish Imperial eagle and the European lynx are now endangered as a result of reduced rabbit numbers.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. The incubation period varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute infection and are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present. There is primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.
