The Andalusian Health Ministry, through the Granada Provincial
Delegation, has pointed to "poor maintenance" of food as a possible
cause of food poisoning that affected 76 young Italians this Sunday
[14 Aug 2011], members of a group attending the World Youth Day (WYD),
which was housed in the sports complex located in Otura municipality
of Granada. Results of epidemiological analysis performed on the food
[samples] are awaited.

According to information from sources at the Granada Health Delegation
given to Europa Press, although the exact causes of the incident are
unknown, the 1st hypothesis suggests that the cause was a "poor
maintenance" of a tuna, mayonnaise, and egg sandwich the affected
individuals had consumed. In addition, the same sources stated that
they distributed the catered food to the 300 young people located in
the sports complex, of which a group of 76 who spent the day at the
beach began with moderate symptoms of food poisoning, after eating
tuna sandwiches.

Also, the same sources explained that the findings led to the health
services taking samples of food for analysis, the results of which are
pending. Similarly, they have ruled that the cause of the poisoning
was in the general Otura community as there have not been any local
residents affected by this outbreak. Meanwhile, according to municipal
sources from the Otura City Council authorities are also considering
the hypothesis that the victims suffered from the so-called
"traveler's diarrhea," caused by an infection by a bacterium, virus or
parasite, and that the mode of transmission of the disease "could have
been" by ingesting contaminated food or beverages. They have also
reported that those affected are in stable condition, resting, and
receiving hydration.

[The evaluation of clusters of illness suspected to be foodborne
requires a combination of clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory
evaluations. The incubation period, from ingestion of the meal until
onset of symptoms, can be quite useful in elucidating the etiology
especially when combined with clinical data such as the presence or
absence of fever, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Short incubation periods,
such as those less than 6 hours, are usually due to preformed
bacterial toxins or contaminating poisons. In this cluster, the tuna
sandwich with mayonnaise and egg seems to precipitate a short
incubation illness, which was likely to be nausea and vomiting without
fever. If this was the scenario, staphylococcal enterotoxin illness is
likely the etiology. The diagnosis can be strongly suggested by
culturing _S. aureus_ for the alleged vehicle and confirmed by the
identification of one of the staphylococcal enterotoxins in the food.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food
poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products;
salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery
products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate
eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that
require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at
slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently
involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL]
