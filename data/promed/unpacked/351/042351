--------------------------------------------
While the Moderator may well be right that this could be a case of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), it is pertinent not to exclude
dengue haemorrhagic fever. The latter is endemic and active in south west
Saudi Arabia, and the reported signs by Dr Waseem -- the patient is
bleeding from the nose and gums and has high fever and body rash -- are
also associated with dengue fever.

Additionally, Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever should also be considered: it is
presently under recognised and may be missed out in initial diagnostic work
up (1). Like dengue fever, it is caused by a flavivirus, and clinical cases
include some of the symptoms recounted here. In situations where ELISAs are
used to diagnose dengue, one cannot rule out that Alkhurmah is not
involved, as there is the possibility of cross-reaction, both of them being
flaviviruses. Molecular tests (RT-PCR) are best used to detect Alkhurma
(2). In fact, the 1st cases of Alkhurma reported by Zaki were initially
thought to be dengue fever (3), and the case series in that report are
symptomatically similar to dengue as well as matching Dr Waseem's descriptions.

A high index of clinical suspicion may assist the clinicians to elicit the
required history. These 3 arboviral diseases are known to be geographically
limited to the south western region of the country.

A history of exposure to mosquito bites in the known dengue endemic areas
of Saudi Arabia should make dengue to be more suspected. Dengue reports
have been substantial this year [2009].

A history of occupational exposure to animals (it is possible he was a
driver involved in the movement of livestock) with the infected hard ticks
known to harbour CCHF virus may point towards CCHF. This could also be true
if he was involved in slaughtering a viraemic animal. Unlike dengue, CCHF
incidence for the past few years has been rare.

With Alkhurma haemorrhagic fever, there is the challenge that case history
associated with clinical cases often overlaps with that of CCHF animal
contact, butchering. Molecular analysis has shown that the Alkhurmah
haemorrhagic fever virus is tickborne. Additionally, it has only been
detected in the cryptic soft tick _Ornithodorus savignyi_ in the endemic
area of Jeddah (2). These soft ticks are attracted to animals (including
humans) resting/sleeping in the desert, from whom they suck blood in a
hit-and-run manner: hence it may be difficult to elicit a history of soft
tick bite from the driver.

In summary, the aforementioned may help elicit a case history that assists
in determining the exact aetiology. In terms of risk of transmission to
fellow passengers as rightly mentioned by Mod.CP, it should be highest with
CCHF and least with Alkhurmah; evidence available indicates Alkhurma may be
refractory to human to human transmission (1).

[ProMED-mail thanks Shamsudeen Fagbo for this helpful analysis of the
situation and for identifying 2 other viruses -- dengue hemorrhagic fever
virus and Alkhurma virus -- that should be considered in the investigation
of the aetiology of the case of suspected hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan
imported from Saudi Arabia. - Mod.CP]
