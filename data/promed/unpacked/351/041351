TOXIC KIDNEY FAILURE - HAITI (2)
================================
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 96 14:35:00 EST
From: "Herrington, James E." <jxh7@CIDVBI1.EM.CDC.GOV>

This problem is reminscent of a similar one in 1991 in Nigeria, as reported
by CDC epidemiologist Richard Spiegel, DVM, MPH.
Drums of diethylene glycol were stolen from a Shell Oil warehouse,
relabelled as glycol, and sold to unsuspecting missionary hospitals that
mixed their own liquid
acetaminophen. As I recall, over 100 children died from kidney failure that
was caused by ingesting the contaminated liquid acetaminophen.
