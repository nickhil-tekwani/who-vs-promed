Gabon 2 March 1997.
No further cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever were detected during the 42 days
of intensive surveillance and monitoring of contacts since the last patient
died on 18 January 1997. As this represents more than twice the maximum
incubation period of the disease, the Gabonese health authorities have now
declared the outbreak over. A total of 60 cases and 45 deaths [case-fatality
rate 75%] were recorded between 13 July 1996, when the first fatal case
occurred, and 18 January 1997.

[We now await the next appearance of an Ebola virus, but at least this
outbreak appears to be over. In six months there were 60 cases in this
Gabonese outbreak; slow but steady. -- Mod CHC]
