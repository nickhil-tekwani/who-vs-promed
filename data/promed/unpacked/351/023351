Trichinellosis, Repulse Bay, Nunavut
---------------------------------------------
After a significant outbreak of trichinosis in Repulse Bay, Nunavut's
department of health is establishing a program to test walrus meat
for the parasite that causes the disease. John Raven, an
environmental health officer based in Rankin Inlet, said that after
16 people contracted the disease in Repulse Bay in December, the
department decided to use that community in a pilot project.
Hunters will soon be able to send the tongues of walrus they harvest
to the lab in Rankin Inlet and find out within 24 hours whether the
meat is infected or safe to eat. "The tongue has the highest
concentration of trichinosis," Raven explained. "A walrus can have
light infection, moderate, heavy, whatever, and if there's any
infection in a walrus it will appear in the tongue." Raven said
hunters from other communities can also submit walrus tongues to be
tested, but the department is focusing its efforts on Repulse Bay
this year. Because of the outbreak there, he said, people in the
community are very sensitive to the seriousness of the disease and
want to stop any further spread. Raven will be travelling to meet
with residents in early February to explain the program.
When infected, uncooked meat of a carnivore, such as a polar bear,
walrus, or pig, is eaten, a number of cysts are ingested with it. The
only way to ensure the parasite is rendered harmless in meat is to
cook it, but because of the traditions of eating country food, Raven
said there are outbreaks of the disease every year in Nunavut. "I
found it pretty amazing that the Keewatin has the highest rate of
trichinosis in Canada and even the entire United States. We have more
trichinosis in Nunavut than the United States does." The cost of one
case of trichinosis in an individual is also extremely high.
Medication can cost more than $800 per infection.
The department is getting a helping hand in setting up its program
from scientists at the Nunavik Research Centre, who struggled to
organize their own program in the 1990s. The centre's Dr. Bill Doidge
said after persuading the federal government that trichinosis was
indeed a public health issue in Nunavik, a specific test for walrus
meat was developed.
"Walrus is where there's a health issue. Trichinella worms are also
in polar bear, but the traditional knowledge is that you need to cook
polar bear meat so it's not really a health issue," he said.
Scientists initially tested about 100 seals and didn't find any
positive samples, he said, so it doesn't seem to be a problem,
although it has been reported in scientific literature.
In 1995 they decided to centralize a testing lab in Kuujjuaq, even
though many of the cases were coming from Salluit. 7 years later,
Doidge said, almost all walrus harvested in Nunavik are tested for
the infection. "This year we did 53 walrus for Nunavik and the year
before it was 54," he said. "2002 was a good year for walrus hunters,
in that only one of the 54 walrus were infected, whereas in 2001,
there were more like 7 infected. The program itself has been quite
successful in greatly reducing the cases of human trichinellosis."
Work is continuing on finding out how walrus, which are mainly
bottom-feeders, catch a parasite that is only transmitted by
ingesting raw infected meat, and where the hot spots for the
infection are.

[Trichinella infection in walrus is well known in the arctic, and the
first outbreak in Canada due to walrus meat was reported in 1982 with
42 cases; another in 1999 included 62 cases [source: Gideon]. Walrus
is also a well-known source of trichinella infection in Greenland.
The posting states that seals are not an important source of
infection, but even with a low frequency of infection in seals, they
may still be a source of infection in communities where seals are a
major food source and are traditionally eaten without cooking. -
