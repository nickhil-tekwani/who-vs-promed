According to a spokesman of the Ministry of Health of the region 12
students of gymnasium No.5 in Saratov [city] have been diagnosed with
swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) virus infection]. Between 21 and 28 Dec
2010 4 classes were closed because of a high incidence of viral
respiratory infections. In 12 out of the 57 students tested influenza
A/(H1N1) virus infection was confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. The
infections were of mild severity and all the students were kept under
surveillance by local clinics.

In addition, 2 other schools were also closed for several days as a
precautionary measure. The health care authorities of the city have
reported that currently the influenza incidence in the general
population is 2.9 percent below that observed in any previous year.

of whom were registered at the beginning of the year and 12 in December.
