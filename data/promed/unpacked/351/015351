A South Australian [SA] man has died of Murray Valley encephalitis
(MVE). The Riverland man, 27, was taken to hospital with the
mosquito-borne disease [virus] in March [2011]. "2 confirmed cases of
MVE have been reported in South Australia this year, the 1st reported
cases of locally-acquired MVE since 1974," SA Health chief medical
officer Professor Paddy Phillips said in a statement. "It is with deep
sadness that we announce that one of the people who contracted MVE has
died."

Professor Paddy Phillips said MVE is spread by mosquito bites and is
not transmitted from person to person. He said most people infected by
MVE experience no or mild symptoms, but in about one in 1000 cases
symptoms can worsen to include neck stiffness, tremors, and seizures.
Professor Phillips recommended people avoid exposure when mosquitoes
are most active, cover up and use insect repellent.

MVE has also recently been detected in Victoria and New South Wales.
"SA Health continue to work with local councils on mosquito control
programs but the best protection against MVE and other mosquito borne
diseases remains not getting bitten by mosquitoes," Professor Phillips
said.

[Unfortunately, the unusually wet conditions in southern and western
Australia have created situations ideal for transmission of Australian
mosquito-borne viruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus
[MVE]. Australian health authorities have been warning the public
about the increased risk of these virus infections. The 31 Mar 2011
ProMED-mail post (archive no 20110331.0997) cited such a warning:
Australian Medical Association SA president Dr Andrew Lavender said it
was likely
there would be a number of further cases of people being infected
with MVE in regional SA. "Infections are most likely to be in areas
surrounding wetlands and large bodies of water such as Lake
Alexandrina," he said.
