The lumpy skin disease [LSD] virus, which has been detected in cows and buffaloes in Viet Nam since mid-October [2020] has continued spreading in Viet Nam. To date [9 Mar 2021], Viet Nam [sic. Presumably should say LSD. - Mod.SH] had hit 163 communes in 65 districts of 18 cities and provinces in Viet Nam, affecting 2200 cows and buffaloes with 300 culled.

By 1 Mar 2021, the disease had attacked roughly 1000 cows and buffaloes in many districts of the Ha Tinh province [North Central Coast region] and has tended to rise. The province is seeking the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development for the import of 5000 doses of vaccine for the disease.

Meanwhile, the disease has also appeared in the Nghi Loc Commune, situated in neighboring Nghe An [Vietnam's largest province by area, similarly in the North Central Coast region]. Initially, 6 cows of 4 households were diagnosed with the disease.

Lumpy skin disease virus is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is a member of the capripoxvirus genus of Poxviridae and is not infectious to humans. It is believed that arthropod vectors, direct contact, contaminated feed and water and iatrogenic means (for example, repeated use of needles on different animals) can all spread the disease.

The incubation period is between 4 and 14 days postinfection. The infection rate among cows and buffaloes is around 10%-20% with 1%-5% [case fatalities].

Under the ministry's instructions, all animals tested positive for the disease have to be culled. Meanwhile, all cattle which have not yet been hit by the disease need to be quarantined to ensure safety.

Areas which have been affected by the disease have to set up stations for the cattle transport control.

[Viet Nam's immediate notification of LSD, reporting the first 4 outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 1 Nov 2020 (20201103.7911552). Reportedly, the event started on 13 Oct 2020. According to the report, the said outbreaks were identified and reported from 2 provinces -- Lang Son (3 outbreaks) and Cao Bang (1 outbreak). Both provinces share their northern borders with China.

LSD was first reported in Asia and the Pacific region in 2019 in north west China; since then, the disease has been reported from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR-PCR), India, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, and Viet Nam (https://rr-asia.oie.int/en/projects/lumpy-skin-disease-lsd/).

For Viet Nam's illustrated report on its first 93 LSD outbreaks since October 2020, presented during a regional OIE webinar of 21 Dec 2020, including clinical and epidemiological data as well as the control measures applied, please refer to https://rr-asia.oie.int/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-201221_lsd_vietnam_update_oie_meeting.pdf. - Mod.AS
