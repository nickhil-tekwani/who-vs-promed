Porroca is a lethal disease of coconut (_Cocos nucifera_) emerging in
Central America. Previously known only from Colombia, it has spread
rapidly across the Isthmus of Panama in the last decade. Porroca is
characterized by the production of stiff, dwarfed leaves, usually
followed by the death of the palms within 2 years. We describe the
long-distance spread of the disease as determined from regular
censuses of more than 200 000 coconut palms in the indigenous Comarca
of Kuna Yala [autonomous territory in Panama, formerly San Blas, near
El Porvenir] and the Republic of Panama. Spread is temporally and
spatially variable, with the disease moving across the landscape as
much as 40 km (25 mi) per year. Porroca may represent a significant
new threat to coconut production in the Caribbean Region.

[Porroca [an indigenous word for "little leaf"] is an emerging disease
of coconut palm with unknown aetiology but severe impact on affected
areas. It was first noted in the 1970s in the region [Colombia] as a
new disease. Symptoms include extreme dwarfing of new fronds, rigidity
of leaflets retaining normal green colour, usually some necrosis
giving leaflets a "burnt tip" appearance, tapering of the trunk, and
occasionally some streaks or discolouration on petioles. Within 2 to 3
years, a palm is left with only a tuft of very small leaves. Onset of
symptoms is abrupt giving affected palms a typical silhouette with a
sharp transition from healthy to symptomatic fronds. Fruit production
ceases quickly and the tree may either die or enter a phase of
recovery after months of producing reduced fronds.

A phytoplasma has been found in porroca-affected palms, but a causal
relationship to the disease has not been established. The speed of
spread may vary, and mode of transmission is yet unknown. Eradication
of affected palms is not considered effective in halting the spread,
and no means of control are known at present. Recently, the spread in
Central America has been very fast, and the disease is considered a
serious threat to coconut palms, which are a most important crop in
the region (see link below).
