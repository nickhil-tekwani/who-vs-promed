[1
A special panel set up by Maryland to investigate _Pfiesteria_ may
recommend reducing nutrients in farm runoff. Critics are afraid farms will
suffer and are being unfairly targeted. The panel has also been encouraged
to examine how farms can reduce runoff and other forms of pollution.

[2

A coalition of organic farmers and environmentalists is urging Maryland
Governor Parris N. Glendening to impose a moratorium on the construction of
new poultry houses. The group hopes such a move will limit the production
of chicken manure, which is blamed for outbreaks of _Pfiesteria piscicida_
in the Chesapeake Bay area.
[Chicken manure is good, organic, fertilizer. Chemical fertilizers pose
similar problems of runoff and excess leaching into the water table, and
the nutrients are often present at higher concentrations. If we want to
eat, farmers need to spread fertilizer. Let us hope that reason prevails
in this situation. -Mod. ES
