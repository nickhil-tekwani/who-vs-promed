Another sample taken from a Chinese meat product intercepted by customs officials has tested positive for African swine fever [ASF], the Council of Agriculture (COA) said yesterday [Fri 21 Dec 2018], as it reaffirmed its resolve to prevent the virus from entering Taiwan. The sample in question came from confiscated yanpi, a type of wonton wrapper made from pork that is popular in China's Fujian Province, COA deputy minister Huang Chin-cheng said. Among 602 Chinese meat products sent for testing, it was the 7th sample confirmed to contain the virus, he said.

Port of Taichung officials on Sunday [16 Dec 2018] intercepted a Taiwanese traveling from Fujian by ship, Huang said, adding that the yanpi was just one of the illegal products they were carrying. The other 6 samples that tested positive for the virus were confiscated from 31 Oct to Thursday [20 Dec 2018] and came from sausages produced in China's Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan provinces, as well as Macau [see comment], council data showed.

Although China as of yesterday [Fri 21 Dec 2018] was said to have reported 99 cases of ASF across 23 provinces, the number seems "meaningless", given that China tends to conceal facts, Huang said, adding that the actual number might be 100 times more.

1st-time offenders caught with pork from virus-infected areas face a fine of NTD 200 000 [USD 6494, while those who are repeat offenders face a maximum fine of NTD 1 million [USD 32 466], the council said.

No Europeans, Americans, or Japanese have been caught carrying illegal meat products, said Huang, who earlier this week [week of Mon 17 Dec 2018] told reporters that most of those caught have been Chinese or Vietnamese spouses traveling on Republic of China (Taiwan) passports.

The council earlier this month [December 2018] said that Taiwan would join the World Organization for Animal Health's (OIE) East Asian task force for combating the spread of the disease and that the 1st meeting could be scheduled "at the beginning of next year [2019]". The council has not yet received any notice confirming the meeting's venue and time, Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine deputy director-general Tu Wen-jane said. However, the meeting would be an important occasion for officials from Taiwan and other Asian countries to exchange information about the disease, she added.

[The information on the detection of ASF virus in pork products introduced from Macau, a territory so far not named to be ASF-infected, should not surprise. The disease has been recently reported from a slaughterhouse in Zhuhai, Guangdong province (20181219.6216012). Zhuhai is a modern city in China's southern Guangdong province, just on the border with Macau; map at https://tinyurl.com/ycud2jg5.

Earlier, infected pork products from China were also intercepted in South Korea, Japan, and Thailand. Customs, regulatory and quarantine services worldwide, should be equipped to effectively intercept illegal/unregulated foodstuffs and other hazardous materials at international airports, seaports, and border crossings. Confiscated materials should be destroyed or disposed of safely and not dumped within reach of scavengers (animals and humans). Past events suggest that particular attention should be paid to the proper disposal of waste food from aircraft, ships, or vehicles from infected countries, preferably by incineration or, if available, by rendering.

In the meantime, China has stiffened its own measures to prevent human-borne spread of the virus. A recent media report informed the arrest of a man suspected of illegally feeding the pigs on his farm unsterilized kitchen waste sourced from other provinces, leading to an outbreak of ASF in Shanghai; see https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1812227104 (thanks to Kunihiko Iizuka for the submission). - Mod.AS
