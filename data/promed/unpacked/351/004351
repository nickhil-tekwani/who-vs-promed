An update on the leptospirosis outbreak.
The Springfield Dept. of Public Health, the Illinois Dept. of Public
Health, and the CDC are working to investigate the large lake outbreak of
leptospirosis. This lake is huge, 4,040 acres with a shoreline of 57 miles
and a storage capacity of 17 billion gallons; this is exceedingly unusual
in the history of leptospirosis outbreaks. The watershed is also large
providing many possibilities for animal reservoirs. We are exploring a
number of possibilities including wildlife, livestock and other domestic
and exotic animal testing.
At this point no source is being singled out. There is an extensive
wildlife preserve area, which is basically woods ideal for wild animal
habitat, esp around the area of greatest concern in the lake. We are
awaiting convalescent titers in the humans to more clearly establish the
serovars that are involved in the outbreak which might help in focusing on
a particular animal reservoir. Both triathletes from a June 21 event and
community cases have been confirmed with leptospirosis. We have not yet had
a positive culture from a human isolate which would be necessary to match
up using subtyping with any animal or water isolates which might occur.
It may be that we will not establish the source of this outbreak despite
our efforts. There was a heavy rainfall before the day of the triathlon
which may have led to ideal environmental conditions for this outbreak to
occur. This lake has not previously had any known leptospirosis cases
associated with it. Triathlons have been held for 10-15 years with no
problems.
This is a unique outbreak and we will hopefully learn much more about this
rare disease through the cooperation of the triathletes involved and the
work of many investigators.

Officials are leaning more and more toward the theory that the source of
Lake Springfield's leptospirosis contamination was raccoons or other wild
animals, or domesticated animals such as cattle, according to the city's
special medical advisor on leptospirosis, Dr. Donald Graham. And Sugar
Creek is most likely the place from which the contamination spread into
Lake Springfield, Graham said.
He offered those comments in response to a question during the city's
second electronic town meeting Monday night, at which Springfield Mayor
Karen Hasara and other officials for the first time tackled a specific
subject: the leptospirosis outbreak linked to the lake.
Graham, Hasara, and representatives of City Water, Light and Power and the
Springfield Department of Public Health fielded more than a dozen questions
from TV viewers. Among the answers:
- Contamination of Sugar Creek with human waste and other contaminants is a
problem, but not connected to leptospirosis, Graham said.
- Garbage and trash near the lake are not a source of leptospirosis.
- Lake Springfield's large Canada goose population is not a likely source
of leptospira contamination. Birds are not known to harbor the bacteria.
- Workers at the city's power plant are not at risk of infection from lake
water pumped through the plant, Skelly said
- Lake water used to irrigate lawns poses minimal risk of infection, said
Graham, but he warned against using lake water to make a sprinkler system
for children to play in.
- Graham reassured a caller that pets such as dogs and cats could drink
safely from the lake. (Tony Cappasso)

[Interesting set of answers. Don't rats & raccoons hang out near garbage --
near the lake -- and if they urinate? If humans are discouraged from
swimming in the lake or kids playing in the sprinkled water, why is it safe
for dogs & cats to drink the lake water? But try stopping them, of course.
