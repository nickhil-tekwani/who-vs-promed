EQUINE INFECTIOUS ANEMIA: RESOURCES AVAILABLE

We would like to make the moderators and ProMED-mail readers aware of
a couple of informational products on equine infectious anemia (EIA).

There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA:APHIS:VS Equine
Diseases page at this URL:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf>.

There is an option to order an educational video at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/eia-video-form.shtml>.

One other item of note: While EIA can certainly be transmitted by
large biting flies such as tabanids and also by shared needles or
blood transfusions, to the best of our knowledge, the virus is not
transmitted by mosquitoes.
