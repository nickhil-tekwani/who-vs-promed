Zanzibar, one of the world's largest producers of seaweed, is unable to increase production because of a mystery disease thought to be caused by warming oceans. About 24 000 households grow seaweed on the island.

Juma Ali Juma, Zanzibar fisheries ministry, said, "Because of climate change, the water temperature is heating yet the seaweed needs cool water. So it has developed a sort of disease for which we are now undertaking research."

The world's oceans are warmer than at any point in the past 50 years, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.

[Seaweed species are used in many maritime countries as a source of food, for industrial applications, and as a fertiliser. The major utilisation of these plants (for example, _Porphyra_ and _Chondrus_ species) as food is in Asia where seaweed cultivation has become an important industry in some areas. Seaweeds, both farmed and collected from the wild, can form an important part of the diet in tropical coastal communities and are eaten cooked as vegetables, fresh as salad components, or dried and ground to a meal.

Seaweeds can be affected by viruses, bacteria, parasitic algae, and fungal infections (for example _Pythium_, _Petersenia_ and _Phycomelaina_ species). Little is known about their diseases, but recently a bleaching disease ('ais-ais'; see ProMED-mail post 20090309.0978), sometimes likened to coral bleaching, has been reported from several areas. It is thought to be due to a number of normally benign bacteria (including species of _Alteromonas_, _Aquimarina_, and _Agarivorans_; see links below) becoming opportunistic pathogens. Physiological stress due to changes in salinity, ocean temperatures and light intensity results in weakening of hosts and may make the plants susceptible to normally harmless microorganisms. It is possible that the report above refers to this condition.
