Veterinarians have euthanized a 3-year-old Arabian-cross gelding in Sumter County, South Carolina, after he tested positive for Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). Clemson Livestock Poultry Health stated that this is South Carolina's 3rd case in 2019. Clemson officials announced the state's 1st confirmed case, in Chesterfield County, on 23 Jul 2019.

Only one horse in South Carolina, also in Chesterfield County, was confirmed positive for EEE in 2018.

EEE is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to equids by infected mosquitoes.

Clinical signs in horses include
- moderate to high fever;
- depression;
- lack of appetite;
- cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing);
- behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness);
- gait abnormalities; and
- severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The disease can progress rapidly, with death occurring 2-3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care in some cases. Fatality rates can reach 75-80%. Equids that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Studies have shown that vaccines can help significantly reduce the risk of a horse contracting EEE. Horses vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot; in areas with a prolonged mosquito season, veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually, one in the spring and another in the fall. Horses unvaccinated in previous years or those with an unknown vaccination history should receive the initial 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6-week period. Immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce the mosquito populations and possible breeding areas and horses' exposure by
- removing stagnant water sources;
- dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use and fly masks, sheets, and other gear.

Recent testing shows Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was found in Otter Tail County, Minnesota. Eastern equine encephalitis is spread by mosquitoes and is a risk to horses and people.

"This is a high-risk time of year for horses to become infected with this disease," said Dr. Courtney Wheeler, Board of Animal Health equine program director. "We strongly encourage all horses be vaccinated against EEE."

The infected horse was euthanized.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) is reminding residents to protect themselves from mosquito bites following the confirmation of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the state.

Two cases of EEE have been confirmed in horses in Kalamazoo and St. Joseph counties. Neither horse was vaccinated against EEE, and both animals have died. There is an EEE vaccine available for horses, but not for people.

"These equine deaths indicate that EEE virus activity is increasing and provides warning that human cases could also occur," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, MDHHS chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health. "Michigan residents are urged to take precautions and protect themselves from mosquito bites."

The southwestern region of the state has experienced outbreaks of this mosquito-borne disease in horses and people in the past, with the most recent outbreaks occurring in the early 1980s, mid-1990s, and 2010.

EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the US, with a 33% fatality rate among humans who become ill and a 90% fatality rate among horses that become ill.

People can be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus. The disease is not spread by horse-to-horse or horse-to-human contact. In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches.

EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases.

Residents can stay healthy by following steps to avoid mosquito bites:
- Apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved product to exposed skin or clothing, and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites.
- Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside.
- Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused kiddie pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs.
- Use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas.

Additionally, West Nile Virus activity in Michigan has increased. Health officials have identified 8 infected birds and 12 positive mosquito pools in the Lower Peninsula. Mosquito-borne illness will continue to be a risk in Michigan until late fall when nighttime temperatures consistently fall below freezing.

Lastly, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development recommends that residents protect their horses by
- talking to their veterinarian about vaccinating horses against the disease;
- using fans in barns and bringing horses indoors from early evening until after sunrise when mosquitoes are most prevalent;
- using an approved insect repellant on the animals; and
- contacting a veterinarian if their animal shows signs of illness.

According to the Equine Disease Communications Center website, New York reported the state's 1st case of Eastern equine encephalitis in 2019. The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets confirmed a case of EEE in Oswego County. The horse was euthanized.

The yearling filly was vaccinated but on 10 Aug 2019 exhibited the clinical signs of ataxia, blindness, and dullness.

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile Virus infection. EEE infections in horses are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses (like humans) are considered to be "dead-end" hosts for the mosquito-borne virus.

[This article provides little detail on the situation with the filly. Presumably she was euthanized, but a bit more detail would have been handy. Were there other horses on the premises? Have they now been vaccinated? Are they using horse-approved mosquito repellent on the horses? - Mod.TG]

A horse in the town of West Monroe died 13 Aug 2019 of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, the Oswego County Health Department reported today [Fri 16 Aug 2019]. The diagnosis was confirmed in tests conducted by the state Department of Health.

The county health department plans to conduct an aerial spraying of the Toad Harbor Swamp area this evening, Fri 16 Aug 2019. The schedule will depend on the weather.

Aerial spraying is a temporary control measure to reduce the population of mosquitoes that carry the Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, a rare but serious disease that is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito. A horse cannot transmit EEE to a person, but infected mosquitoes pose a risk to both humans and horses. EEE vaccine is available for horses. The health department recommends horse owners talk to their veterinarian for advice on having their horses vaccinated.

So far this summer, 15 samples of mosquitoes collected from the towns of West Monroe, Hastings, and Constantia have tested positive for EEE.

The area to be sprayed is within these boundaries: US Route 11 in Central Square to the west; NYS Route 49 to the north, up to but not including the village of Constantia to the east; and the shoreline of Oneida Lake to the south. Pesticide will not be applied over the open waters of Oneida Lake.

Aerial spraying is dependent on weather conditions. Residents within the spray area will be notified of the spraying by the Hyper-Reach Broadcast Notification Service through Oswego County's E-9-1-1 Emergency Communications Department. If spraying is postponed due to weather conditions, residents will be notified through the news media, and information will be posted on the Oswego County website at <www.oswegocounty.com>.

The health department received permission and permits required to conduct aerial spraying from the state departments of Health and Environmental Conservation. The product Kontrol 30-30, which contains permethrin, will be applied in a diluted form. The county has contracted with Duflo Spray-Chemical from Lowville to conduct the aerial spraying.

A copy of the pesticide label and safety data sheet (SDS), including warnings and fact sheets about permethrin aerial spraying, can be found on the Oswego County website at <www.oswegocounty.com/health/index.html>, or obtained by calling the Oswego County Health Department at 315-349-3564 weekdays between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. On weekends and evenings, call 315-341-0086.

People in the spray area should stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed between 6 and 10 p.m. People are also advised to
- keep pets indoors;
- close the vents on window air conditioners so that outside air doesn't enter the home for one hour;
- remove outdoor toys, outdoor furniture, and clothing from the clothesline. Items left outdoors should be washed thoroughly with soap and water before using;
- close car windows and vents if they are driving through an area while spraying takes place; and
- cover gardens and rinse homegrown fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cooking or eating.

Oswego County Public Health director Jiancheng Huang said it is imperative that people take steps to protect themselves against mosquitoes in areas across Oswego County. Aerial spraying can be effective in reducing mosquito populations, but it does not eliminate all mosquitoes.

"Aerial spraying is a temporary control measure," said Huang. "It is still very important for people throughout Oswego County to continue their efforts to prevent exposure to mosquitoes."

People should limit their outdoor activities around dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active; use insect repellents and wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts, shoes, and socks when outdoors; and eliminate standing water around the home.

Repellents containing DEET are the most effective but should be used with caution and according to label instructions. Products containing picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are also effective.

Oswego County residents who would like to receive community alerts by wireless phones, text messages, and TTY may register for the Hyper-Reach Broadcast Notification Service through Oswego County's E-9-1-1 Emergency Communications Department at https://secure.hyper-reach.com/comsignup.jsp?id=12481, or they may contact the E-9-1-1 administrative office at 315-349-8215 or 1-800-679-3911 and request a registration form. Landline phone customers don't need to register because their numbers are provided to the E-9-1-1 department by the telephone companies that serve Oswego County.

To reduce mosquito habitat around the home, residents are reminded to
- repair or replace window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside and reduce or eliminate all standing water;
- dispose of old tires. Used tires are a significant mosquito breeding site and are accepted at Oswego County transfer stations. Call the Oswego County Solid Waste Department at 315-591-9200 for details;
- empty or dispose of pails, cans, flowerpots, and similar water-holding containers;
- drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers kept outdoors;
- clear roof gutters and be sure they drain properly;
- turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use;
- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs, and drain pool covers;
- change the water in birdbaths and horse troughs twice a week;
- remove leaf debris from yards and gardens and clean vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds; and
- use landscaping to eliminate standing water that collects on your property.

For more information about protecting your family against mosquitoes, call the Oswego County Health Department at 315-349-3547 or visit https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/index.html.

[While human health is important and human and animal health are linked, this article seems to have used the case as a springboard to warn people of the dangers of mosquitoes. There is very little in this article about the disease in horses but rather lots of information about mosquito spray that will be deployed around the area. - Mod.TG]

[One can tell from these reports that it is clearly mosquito season and also the time of year we learn who failed to vaccinate for EEE to protect their horses from this disease.

EEE is often combined in a vaccine along with Western equine encephalitis and West Nile virus, and tetanus. It is a 2-injection series separated by about 3 weeks and then annually thereafter if it is kept up to date. Those along the Gulf coast and the Eastern seaboard, where mosquito concentration may be higher and more active, are advised to vaccine approximately every 4 months, as the immunity to EEE wanes the fastest. - Mod.TG
