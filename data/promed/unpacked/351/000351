UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - POLAND (02): MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE

We would like to present some information about the last report
concerning cases of fatal sepsis in Poland (in a military unit in
Warsaw as well as in the civilian population). In a Warsaw military
unit, there was an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease. The
strain responsible was _N. meningitides_ group C, belonging to the
ST-11/ET-37 clonal complex.
Two recruits, who developed severe meningococcal septicemia, died
after 13 and 16 days in hospital, respectively. All people staying in
the unit were under special observation. More than 40 people from the
unit with signs of infection (fever, severe headache etc.) were
admitted to a hospital and received antimicrobial therapy. Blood or
serum collected from 13 of them gave positive results in PCR
detecting meningococcal DNA and/or latex tests for the presence of
group C/W135 meningococcal antigen. All of them recovered and were
discharged from the hospital last Fri 19 Jan 2007. People in the
military unit received chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of
ciprofloxacin (500 mg). To this point, no other cases have occurred
in this unit.
There were also some deaths among children with meningococcal
disease. These cases were caused by different strains of meningococci.
All information about meningococcal disease in Poland can be obtained from:

[Note that the initial outbreak report (see ProMED ref.
below) carried the following ProMED comment:
"...it is tempting to try to speculate something like meningococcal
septicemia which has been observed in military
recruits, and of course might be part of a larger outbreak ongoing in
the community." - Mod.MPP]
