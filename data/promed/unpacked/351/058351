[1] Cambodia - Inapparent infection suspected

Bird flu infection may go undetected in children
------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu infections in some children may be going
undetected because the virus causes mild or no
symptoms, researchers in Cambodia found,
indicating more human cases have probably
occurred than have been officially recorded.
A study of 674 people exposed to the deadly H5N1
avian influenza in 2 villages in Cambodia found 7
had developed antibodies against the virus,
indicating prior infection. All of the cases
occurred in people aged 4 to 18, the researchers
said in a study being presented at a conference
in Bangkok Thursday [24 Jan 2008].
The finding indicates more people, particularly
children and adolescents, may be contracting the
virus without developing the high fever and
severe pneumonia that's the hallmark of H5N1 in
people. A total of 3 of every 5 reported human
cases worldwide have been fatal. Higher rates of
milder disease might indicate the virus has found
a way to spread more efficiently in human.

[This is an interesting observation, but
difficult to interpret in the absence of
quantitative data. The analysis is limited by the
fact that there have been few human cases of H5N1
avian influenza in Cambodia (since the beginning
of 2005 only 7 and all fatal). The study would
have been more productive if conducted in a
country with greater exposure to the disease.
The 100 percent fatality rate in Cambodia and the
occurrence of a low frequency of inapparent
infection in children is compatible with some
degree of inherent resistance of the majority of
the population to the H5N1 virus. - Mod.CP]

Experts probe high bird flu mortality rate in Indonesia
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Medical experts are worried about how death rates
for H5N1 bird flu have shot up in places like
Indonesia, and studies are being carried out to
see if victims require higher dosages of drugs.
Although the H5N1 has only infected 352 people
since 2003, it has killed 219 of them, with
mortality rates rising to more than 80 percent in
places like Indonesia in the past 2 years.
"It could be they are treated later, or the virus
is different, more virulent. There are many
maybes, including differences in susceptibility
of [to?] the virus," Menno de Jong, a doctor who
has treated bird flu victims in Viet Nam, told
Reuters on the sidelines of a bird flu conference
in Bangkok. He said a major concern was the H5N1
variant in Indonesia appeared to be less
susceptible to oseltamivir, the antiviral used to
combat the disease. "It's not a (drug) resistant
virus, it's just that a bit more drug (may be)
needed to inhibit these (H5N1) clade 2 viruses,"
he said, referring to the sub-category that
Indonesia's H5N1 virus has been classified under.
Studies are being conducted in Thailand, Viet Nam
and Indonesia to see if H5N1 patients need to be
given higher dosages of oseltamivir.
Indonesia is the worst hit of the 14 countries
where H5N1 has infected people since 2003. On
Thursday [24 Jan 2008], a 30-year-old man became
98th Indonesian fatality from the disease, the
health ministry said. Although bird flu remains
an animal disease, experts fear the virus could
mutate into a form easily passed from human to human and kill millions.
But details emerged on Thursday [24 Jan 2008] on
how the virus had been passed from mother to
foetus in the case of a pregnant 24-year-old
Chinese woman who died of the disease in 2005.
Jiang Gu, a leading scientist at Beijing
University, said the virus was detected in most
organs of the foetus, including the brain. "It is
capable of penetrating the placental barrier and
infecting the foetus. (This is the) 1st evidence
of such human-to-human transmission," Gu said.
