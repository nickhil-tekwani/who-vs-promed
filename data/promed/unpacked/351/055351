Up to the time I left Kenya all the evidence for BT [blue tongue was
entirely clinical being based on the distinctive clinical, pathological and
epidemiological criteria, established over many years in Kenya and
Tanzania. In Kenya, the clinical reports were provided by private
practitioners and farmers; clinical cases were seen, and necropsies
performed at the Central Veterinary Laboratories, Kabete, by several
scientists who know the disease well. Antibody assays available would of
course provide little information of any diagnostic value in a BT endemic
area. The Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright Laboratory, have kindly
supplied reagents and protocols for immunocapture ELISAs for BT and EHD
[epizootic haemorrhagic disease viruses, which I took with me to Kabete
[last month.
The samples from Gerenuk in which orbivirus disease was suspected were
detained at Porton Down [UK pending testing for RVF. Again, this needs to
be followed up to see if it has been possible to release them, or at least
some extracted RNA, to Pirbright for analysis.

Just a quick reminder. The bluetongue viruses -- there are approx. 24
antigenically distinct serotypes worldwide -- are not transmitted by
mosquitoes. The primary vectors are biting midges of the genus
_Culicoides_, family _Ceratopogonidae_. The primary and only vector of the
4 US serotypes are _C. varipennis_ subspp. _sonorensis_. In Africa, the
primary vector is _C. imicola_.

[I sometimes get the feeling that Charlie and his friends are not going to
let me forget that I allowed a posting out saying that the BT vector was
mosquitoes. Remember, it is midges. This sub-thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ
