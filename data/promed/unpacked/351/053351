Wheat killer detected in Iran - dangerous fungus on the move from
East Africa to the Middle East
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new and virulent wheat fungus, previously found in East Africa and
Yemen, has moved to major wheat-growing areas in Iran, FAO reported
today [5 Mar 2008]. The fungus is capable of wreaking havoc to wheat
production by destroying entire fields. Countries east of Iran, like
Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and
Kazakhstan, all major wheat producers, are most threatened by the
fungus and should be on high alert, FAO said.

It is estimated that as much as 80 percent of all wheat varieties
planted in Asia and Africa are susceptible to wheat stem rust
(_Puccinia graminis_). The spores of wheat rust are mostly carried by
wind over long distances and across continents. "The detection of the
wheat rust fungus [strain Ug99] in Iran is very worrisome," said
Shivaji Pandey, director of FAO's Plant Production and Protection
Division. "The fungus is spreading rapidly and could seriously lower
wheat production in countries at direct risk. Affected countries and
the international community have to ensure that the spread of the
disease gets under control in order to reduce the risk to countries
that are already hit by high food prices."

The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has informed FAO that
the fungus has been detected in some localities in Broujerd and
Hamedan in western Iran. Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence
of the fungus. Iran said it will enhance its research capacity to
face the new infection and develop new wheat varieties resistant to
the disease.

The wheat fungus [strain] first emerged in Uganda in 1999 and is
therefore called Ug99. The wind-borne transboundary pest subsequently
spread to Kenya and Ethiopia. In 2007, an FAO mission confirmed for
the 1st time that Ug99 has affected wheat fields in Yemen. The Ug99
strain found in Yemen was already more virulent than the one found in
East Africa. Ethiopia and Kenya had serious wheat rust epidemics in
2007 with considerable yield losses.

Disease surveillance and wheat breeding is already underway to
monitor the fungus and to develop Ug99 resistant varieties. However,
more efforts are required to develop long term durable resistant
varieties that can be made available to farmers in affected countries
and countries at risk. FAO urged countries to increase disease
surveillance and intensify efforts to control the disease.

FAO warning over virulent wheat fungus
--------------------------------------
The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has
asked the authorities of Pakistan and 5 other wheat-producing
countries, located east of Iran, to be on high alert, following a
report that a new and virulent wheat fungus has moved to major
wheat-growing areas in Iran. According to FAO, countries in the
predicted, immediate pathway grow more than 65 million hectares
(approx. 161 million acres) of wheat, accounting for 25 percent of
the global wheat harvest.

Quoting M. E. Tasneem, Chairman of the Pakistan Agriculture Research
Council, the FAO said: "If we don't control this stem rust threat, it
will have a major impact on food security, especially since global
wheat stocks are at a historic low".

"If we fail to contain Ug99 it could bring calamity to tens of
millions of farmers and hundreds of millions of consumers," says
Nobel Laureate Borlaug. "We know what to do and how to do it. All we
need are the financial resources, scientific cooperation, and
political will to contain this threat to world food security." The
Global Rust Initiative (GRI) will support countries in developing
resistant varieties, producing clean quality seeds, upgrading
national plant protection and plant breeding services, and developing
contingency plans. The BGRI was founded by Norman Borlaug (Cornell
University, USA), the International Centre for Agricultural Research
in Dry Areas [ICARDA, Syria], the International Maize and Wheat
Improvement Centre [CIMMYT, Mexico], and the FAO.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. It occurs worldwide throughout wheat producing areas.
Symptoms are dark orange pustules on the stems and also on the
leaves. Stems can be completely girdled by the pustules damaging the
conducting tissue and preventing grain fill. Yield losses of up to 70
percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. If stem
rust arrives early in the growing cycle, losses are higher. The
fungus is spread by wind and with infected straw.

New pathogen races are emerging with increased virulence against
genes previously used for resistance breeding. Considered most
dangerous at present is strain Ug99. It can infect and cause disease
in many commonly grown stem rust "resistant" wheat lines. In much of
the world, resistance to stem rust in wheat is based at least in part
on the gene Sr31. High levels of stem rust infection were observed in
Uganda on wheat lines containing the Sr31, Lr26, and Yr9 genes for
rust resistance, and Ug99 was identified as a new strain with
virulence to Sr31.

Recurring epidemics in Kenya and then Ethiopia followed, and Ug99 has
recently spread to Yemen. It may also be present in Pakistan, Sudan,
and Tanzania and appears to be moving on prevailing winds.
Furthermore, an even more virulent variant of Ug99 able to overcome
additional resistance genes has recently emerged in Kenya. This
increases the threat posed by Ug99 to global wheat production
further. International screening programmes for germplasm with
resistance to the new strains are being set up under the GRI.
