The country's Health Minister said that 9 people have died in Benin from Lassa fever, a viral disease common in West Africa with symptoms similar to Ebola. An outbreak of Ebola is pummeling the 3 West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, and some cases have turned up elsewhere, but so far, no Ebola cases have been confirmed in Benin, Health Minister Dorothee Kinde Gazard told reporters late Tuesday [25 Nov 2014].

Authorities will double-check those results with more tests, said Youssouf Gamatie, the representative for the World Health Organization in the country.

The Lassa fever deaths happened in Tanguieta, 370 miles (600 km) north of the capital, said Gazard. In all, 15 cases of Lassa have been detected, and Gazard said she thought the outbreak would be quickly contained. Authorities are monitoring 170 people who had contact with the sick for signs of Lassa.

In West Africa, there are about 100 000 - 300 000 cases of Lassa fever each year and about 5000 deaths. The Lassa virus is carried by rodents and is transmitted to humans through contact with their urine or droppings. It can also be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, though that is rarer.

Lassa fever is in the same virus family as Ebola, which has killed 5400 people in the current outbreak, the 1st to hit West Africa [This is incorrect. Lassa fever virus is in the arenavirus family, and Ebola virus is in the filovirus family. Mod.TY].

[This is now the 2nd report of Lassa fever that ProMED-mail has posted for Benin. The number of reported cases has increased from 2 confirmed fatal cases on 21 Nov 2014 to the 15 cases (9 of which were fatal) reported above. The occurrence of Lassa fever virus infection in Benin is not surprising. Benin adjoins Nigeria in West Africa. As noted in the 2014 ProMED-mail post on Lassa fever in Nigeria cited below, Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country. It is safe to assume that Lassa fever virus is also endemic in Benin.

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Because elimination of these rodents is not possible currently, reduction of risk of human infections can be accomplished, but eradication of the virus in these endemic areas cannot.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
