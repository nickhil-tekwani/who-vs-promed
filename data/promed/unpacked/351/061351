Bird flu detected in Belgian farms
----------------------------------
Emergency measures have been taken after an outbreak of bird flu was
detected in 2 farms in northern Belgium, Belgian media reported on
Tuesday [23 Dec 2008]. Control tests showed last Friday [19 Dec 2008]
that some ducks and geese in a farm in Bocholt, which borders the
Netherlands, were infected with the H5 bird flu virus. The same virus
was also detected in a farm in Buggenhout in the province of East
Flanders.

The H5 virus is not dangerous to human beings and is different from
the H5N1 variant, which has killed more than 200 people since it
surfaced in 2003 [see comment].

The Belgian Federal Food Agency, which supervises the safety of the
food chain, has ordered emergency measures to be taken in the 2 farms
and surrounding areas. Some 5000 animals had to be slaughtered as a
precautionary measure and all poultry within a radius of one km of
the farms must be kept indoors. Transport of poultry is forbidden for
21 days.

[According to the Dutch agricultural daily Agrarisch Dagblad, the
affected holding in Buggenhout (25 km west to Mechelen) is a (free
outdoor) goose farm. The breeding animals did not show clinical signs.

The 2nd holding is a commercial trading operation of ornamental
poultry in Bocholt (adjacent to the Dutch border, about 10 km
south-east of Weert).

In both cases, H5 has been detected within the routine surveillance
activities and is of low pathogenicity. See
<http://www.agd.nl/1067285/Nieuws/Artikel/Twee-gevallen-vogelpest-in-Belgi.htm>.

The Web site of the Belgian Food Safety Agency includes an official
news release of 23 Dec 2008, with similar information. It further
states (in Flemish, translated) that "though the exact virus strain
is not yet identified, certainly this is not the high pathogenic
H5N1, but a low pathogenicity strain, H5N2 - to N9. See in Flaemish at
<http://www.favv.fgov.be/persberichten/_documents/2008-12-23_influenza_nl.pdf>
and in French at
<http://www.favv.fgov.be/communiquesdepresse/_documents/2008-12-23_influenza_fr.pdf>.

H5N1 has not been reported from Belgium in the past (excluding a
transit case; see ref).

Belgium has submitted on Wed, 24 Dec 2008, an "immediate
notification" to the OIE, addressing the above 2 outbreaks. It
included the following epidemiological comments:

"Low pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 is responsible for the outbreak
in Bocholt. For the outbreak in Buggenhout, the neuraminidase has not
been identify yet, but we are certain that H5N1 is not responsible,
but rather another H5 serotype (other than N1).

Avian influenza cases were detected as part of the routine monitoring
for the screening of seropositive birds for avian influenza.

There is no commercial poultry farm located in a 1 km zone around the
farm where the outbreak started."

More avian flu found in Bangladesh poultry
------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials in Bangladesh said today [23 Dec 2008] that
they have detected another H5N1 avian influenza outbreak on a farm,
the country's 5th one since the virus reemerged in poultry flocks in
October 2008.

Salahuddin Kahn, livestock department spokesman, said the outbreak
occurred on a farm in Kurigram in the northern part of the country
and that 100 birds were culled to control it, according to a report
today from Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Kahn told AFP that Kurigram is the 5th district to be hit by the
virus since October. 2 states in western India that share borders
with Bangladesh-Assam and West Bengal have also battled recent H5N1
outbreaks.
