China: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 5
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has reported a new case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Jiangsu Province.
The case was confirmed by the national laboratory on Thu 6 Dec 2007.

The 52-year-old male is the father of the 24-year-old man who died
from H5N1 infection on Sun 2 Dec 2007. He is one of the close
contacts placed under medical observation by national authorities. He
developed symptoms on Mon 3 Dec 2007 and was sent immediately to
hospital for treatment.

Of the 27 cases confirmed to date in China, 17 have been fatal.

[This is the official confirmation by WHO of the 2 most recent cases
of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in China.

A ProMED correspondent has drawn attention to a discrepancy between the
WHO statement and a local press account (see: Avian influenza, human
(155): China (Jiangsu) 20071207.3945) wherein it appears likely that
the father was not hospitalized until 5 Dec 2006, 2 days after he
developed pneumonia rather than "immediately" as stated in
the WHO report. The text of the local press account stated that,
"After their son's sudden death, his father and mother were
devastated. On the 6th day after eating chicken, when the father
developed fever he did not have the heart to seek treatment. Only
after others begged him did he go to the Nanjing Municipal Infectious
Disease Hospital where the diagnosis of avian influenza was made." - Mod.CP]
