The young man who has been battling the Blackwater Creek hantavirus [see
comment on name at end. - Mod.JW] is making more and more progress every
day. He has been taken off the ventilator and dialysis. He is off all pain
medication and antibiotics. He is sitting up watching television and is
very alert. His family says by all accounts he is on the road to recovery.
He may require some physical therapy due to 3 weeks of inactivity, but is
otherwise looking forward to returning home.

[When] he got back from a Mardi Gras [5 Feb 2008] skiing trip to
Breckenridge [Colorado] with 3 of his closest friends, "He thought he had
the flu, then all of a sudden, it just snow-balled on him. He had to be
medivaced to the hospital in Houston," his friend Alex Radford said. It
wasn't the flu. He has been diagnosed with Blackwater Creek hantavirus.
"Originally we thought it came from Colorado, from the mouse-droppings in
our condo [apartment. - Mod.SH], but now, the doctors changed their minds
and say he probably got it in a duck blind [a cover device for hunters]
here [in Louisiana]," said Radford, who along with the other 2 boys who
went to Colorado, have had [diagnostic] blood work done just in case.

[A good place to start is genotyping. Hantavirus strains are fairly
location specific, so that should sort out whether it was a Colorado mouse
infested condo/hotel or a Louisiana duck blind; very different rodent
species involved. - Mod.MHJ

ProMED-mail virus disease moderator emeritus Charlie Calisher comments:
"There is no such thing as Blackwater Creek virus. There is a Black Creek
Canal virus, but it seems to be limited to Florida and hispid cotton rats
(_Sigmodon hispidus_). Another hantavirus, Muleshoe virus, has been
isolated from cotton rats in Texas. These viruses usually have long
incubation periods. I expect it would be tough to acquire a rodentborne
virus at the altitude of Breckenridge [base elevation 9600 feet (2926 m). -
Mod.JW]

"(Hantaviruses in the US are of low prevalence at altitudinal extremes) and
particularly in the winter, unless there was an infected mouse in his condo
[the report mentions mouse droppings - Mod.JW] (or in a rental car's air
conditioner, in which case the other 3 companions might also have become
infected).

"If diagnosis was made using a serologic test and no virus was isolated
(the usual situation unless the patient dies), then no genetic comparisons
can be made. If he acquired the infection in Louisiana, he might very well
have been infected with Bayou hantavirus, particularly around Lake Charles.
The rodent reservoir of Bayou virus is a rice rat [_Oryzomys_ sp. -
Mod.JW]. Given that the antigen used by the Houston (?) lab is not stated,
my guess is that they used Sin Nombre hantavirus antigen. The nucleocapsid
protein of most hantaviruses, particularly New World hantaviruses,
cross-react, so one cannot tell which of them was the infecting agent. The
other 3 boys probably are safe, as infections with hantaviruses usually are
not symptomless."

The patient was sick on return from a skiing trip of probably no longer
than a week in Colorado. Since hantavirus incubation periods are usually 2
to 4 weeks, perhaps he was hunting ducks in Louisiana before he went skiing
(the duck-hunting season in LA runs from November to February).

For the location of the 2 states, see

rectangle almost in the center of the map. Louisiana (LA) is the blue state
on the Gulf (southern) coast. - Mod.JW]
