Bluetongue virus [BTV] serotypes 8 and 4: situation as of 7 Feb 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Several departments have informed us about numerous cases of calves born blind and dying within a few days.

These cases would have started to appear concomitantly in mid-December [2018] (at least 1 department had found such clinical signs on calves since 2016). [On affected farms], 2-15 percent of the newborn calves were affected.

According to the analyzes carried out in departmental laboratories (positive PCRs on blood samples from calves) and Maisons-Alfort's LNR-ANSES (positive PCR on calves' spleen), it is very likely that these symptoms are attributable to serotype 8 of the BTV.

The detection of PCR positive calves, less than one week old, born during the non-vector season and virus inactivity, seems to be indicative of intrauterine infection of these calves.

Appendix 1 of Technical Instruction DGAL/SDSPA/2018-851 published on 20 Nov 2018 "Surveillance and control measures regarding bluetongue (BTV) in metropolitan France" proposes a commemorative sheet that includes, for calves, blindness as a clinical sign. These cases are therefore suspicions that can be investigated and supported by the DDPP [Departmental Directorate of Population Protection]. The instruction should be modified to make this point clearer, because currently blindness does not fit into the strict definition of a clinical suspicion (1st page of Appendix 1), it is simply mentioned in the commemorative sheet (3rd page of Appendix 1).

When such clinical suspicion is investigated and confirmed, it becomes the subject of an official declaration to the European Commission (ADNS). For the record, a breeder can only export animals to Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco if no clinical BT case has been recorded in the herd during the last 6 months.

BTV8 has been circulating [during 2018] in all French departments. BTV4, however, remained confined, it seems, to the Savoie region.

Faced with this wide circulation of BTV8 with a health impact becoming apparent, we encourage breeders to vaccinate their stock, with special emphasis on dams. Vaccination should preferably be applied at least 60 days before breeding.

[GDS-Poitou-Charentes, the animal health protection group of Poitou-Charentes, is an association of breeders from 4 Departments (out of metropolitan France's 96 departments), located in West France (Charente, Charente-Maritime, Deux-SÃ¨vres, and Vienne).

The blindness in newborn calves, followed by their death within a few days, may be indicative of other congenital brain changes. They may be discovered, or excluded, if/when brains are subject to full-scale PM examinations, addressing gross- and histopathological changes. Congenital CNS changes in progeny of BTV-8 infected dams were reported during the major event in western Europe, 2006-2008. (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01034.x).

Additional details from field and laboratory will be useful.

It will be interesting to note if similar cases have been observed recently in the other countries which have been experiencing BTV-8 circulation and infection, namely Switzerland and Germany.

Hopefully, sufficient quantities of the killed BTV-8 vaccine are kept available in stock in the affected and at-risk countries.

Footnote: in the circulated version of our previous BTV-8 posting, 20190201.6290247, the start of the (Swiss) event and its confirmation were given as 19 Oct 2018 and 23 Oct 2018; the correct dates were 19 Oct 2017 and 23 Oct 2017, respectively. This mistake has already been corrected in the website version. - Mod.AS]
