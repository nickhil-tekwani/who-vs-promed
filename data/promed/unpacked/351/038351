The Georgia Department of Agriculture has confirmed the 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in Brooks County.

This is the 4th case of EEE found in an animal in the South Health District in 2013, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health. Officials suggest protecting yourself from mosquito bites using the "5- D's" of prevention:

- Dusk/Dawn: Mosquitoes usually bite at dusk and dawn. Limit outdoor activity during those hours.
- Dress: Wear light, loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin.
- DEET: Cover exposed skin and clothes with an insect repellent containing the chemical DEET. It is the most effective repellant against mosquito bites.
- Drain: Empty any containers (buckets, barrels, kiddie pools) holding standing water to prevent breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
- Doors: Make sure doors, windows and screens are in good condition and fit tightly to keep out mosquitoes.

Horses should be vaccinated against EEE annually at a veterinarian's office. More information on EEE or any other mosquito-borne disease can be found at http://www.cdc.gov.

[Georgia seems poised to have a heavy summer of EEE. This and other cases of mosquito borne disease are opportunities to remind equine owners to vaccinate their horses.

There is a vaccine for horses, and it is recommended to be given every 6 months and preferably every 4 months. The immunity to EEE is short-lived, and vaccination must be repeated. Generally, EEE vaccine is combined with western equine encephalitis (WEE) vaccine. Some combination vaccines also include West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine. Vaccination is a cheap way to protect your horses.

While this disease cannot be transmitted from the horse to the owner, owners can be bitten by mosquitoes and acquire the disease. Mosquito control is critical for the health of equines but also for the health of humans.

[For a map of Georgia showing counties, see http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/georgia.shtml. Brooks county is in the south of Georgia bordering with the state of Florida, another state where there has been EEE activity in prior years, and where the 1st human case of EEE infection in 2013 was reported this year in Hillsborough county (see Eastern equine encephalitis - USA: (FL). Hillsborough county is on the south-central Gulf coast - not near to the Georgia border - and can be seen at http://www.digital-topo-maps.com/county-map/florida.shtml). - Mod.MPP]
