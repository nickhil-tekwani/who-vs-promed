Virus Is Seen as Suspect in Death of Honeybees
----------------------------------------------------
Scientists sifting genetic material from thriving and ailing bee
colonies say a virus appears to be a prime suspect -- but is unlikely
to be the only culprit -- in the mass die-offs of honeybees reported
last fall [2006] and winter [2006-2007].
The die-offs, in which adult bees typically vanished without
returning to hives, were reported by about a 4th of the nation's
commercial beekeepers. The losses captured public attention as rumors
swirled about causes, like climate change, cellphone signals and
genetically-modified crops. Scientists have rejected those theories.
Now, one bee disease, called Israeli acute paralysis virus, seems
strongly associated with the beekeeping operations that experienced
big losses, a large research group has concluded, although members of
the team emphasized that they had not proved the virus caused the die-offs.
"I hope no one goes away with the idea that we've actually solved the
problem," said Jeffrey S. Pettis, an entomologist with the Department
of Agriculture and co-director of a national group working on the
puzzle, which has been given the name colony collapse disorder.
The project involved an unusual partnership between entomologists and
scientists working at the leading edge of human genetic research. It
employed the same technology being used to decode Neanderthal DNA and
the personal genome of James Watson, a co-discoverer of the structure of DNA.
The research was described yesterday [6 Sep 2007] in Science Express,
the online edition of the journal Science. Details are available at
<http://www.eurekalert.org/bees>.
Even with the caveats, the possible identification of a virus
involved in large bee die-offs is "exceptionally important," said May
Berenbaum, who heads the entomology department at the University of
Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and was not involved in the study. "Among
other things, figuring out where this one came from will help us
prevent future problems."
Dr. Berenbaum, who led a 2006 National Academies study of problems
with bees and other pollinators, said that finding ways to swiftly
home in on novel diseases is ever more important in a globally linked
economy. She noted that the 1st reports of the latest bee die-offs in
the United States came in 2004, the 1st year the country allowed the
import of honeybees -- from Australia in this case -- since 1922. The
new study found evidence of the virus in some Australian bee samples,
although that country has not reported die-offs like those seen in
the United States.
Dr. Pettis said that even if the virus were involved, it was likely
that more than one factor had to align for a hive to collapse, with
another possible influence being poor nutrition. Most of the colonies
that had big losses last winter [2006-2007] were in areas that
experienced drought a few months beforehand, and thus a lack of
nectar in flowers, he said.
Another factor, Dr. Pettis said, could be the stress that comes from
the increasingly industrial-style beekeeping operations in the United
States, in which truckloads of hives crisscross the country to
pollinate California almonds or Florida orchards each season.
But the virus stands out as a top suspect. While 7 viruses and a host
of bacteria and parasites were identified in the genetic screening,
only the Israeli bee virus, 1st identified in 2004, was strongly tied
to the samples taken from keepers who reported the collapse disorder.
While the virus was first identified by scientists in Israel, it
appears to exist in many parts of the world, said W. Ian Lipkin, an
author of the new study and director of the Center for Infection and
Immunology of Columbia University. In Israel, the virus also seems to
produce bee symptoms not reported in the United States, including a
pattern of finding dead bees near hives.
Dr. Lipkin, whose focus is human disease, became involved because the
quest for a cause for the beehive collapses employed new genetic
sifting techniques that he said might also prove useful in
investigating outbreaks of human diseases. One hint of the
involvement of an infectious agent, he said, was the recent finding
that abandoned hives sterilized with radiation could be repopulated
with healthy bees.
The study initially examined bees from 4 beekeepers who reported
die-offs, as well as healthy bees from Hawaii and Pennsylvania.
Genetic material was extracted and analyzed with a machine from 454
Life Sciences, a company immersed in the race to make gene sequencing
a fast, cheap technology.
Statistical analysis showed that a colony with the Israeli virus was
65 times more likely to have had the collapse disorder than one
without it. To try to clarify cause and effect, the researchers said
they were preparing a new suite of tests in which isolated bee
colonies would be intentionally infected with the virus, both with
and without possible secondary causes like certain parasites.

Puzzling Decline of U.S. Bees Linked to Virus From Australia
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers have found an imported virus that may be associated with
the sudden disappearance of honey bees in the United States, known as
colony collapse disorder (CCD). This baffling syndrome, which earlier
this year [2007] made headlines around the world, may have afflicted
as many as 23 percent of beekeepers in the United States and caused
losses of up to 90 percent of hives in some apiaries.
The identification of a suspect is an important step, says Nicholas
Calderone of Cornell University. "Before, we didn't even have
circumstantial evidence."
The suspect is a pathogen called Israel acute paralysis virus (IAPV).
A team of researchers reports online in Science this week
(<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1146498>) that they
found the virus in most of the affected colonies they tested, but in
almost no healthy ones. If the virus proves to be the cause of CCD,
it could have international economic implications, for the
researchers point to Australia as a possible source. Since 2005, U.S.
beekeepers, especially those struggling to keep up with the
insatiable demand for almond pollination in California, have imported
several million dollars' worth of bees from Australia. The
researchers report that they have found IAPV in imported Australian bees.
The investigation is still in an early stage, and there are skeptics.
Another group has not found any link between IAPV and CCD. "This
paper only adds further to the confusion surrounding CCD," argues
Denis Anderson, an entomologist with the Australian Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Canberra,
who has not participated in either group.
The abrupt loss of bee colonies in the United States, 1st reported
last fall [2006], has been a big mystery. Although some scientists
aren't convinced that the phenomenon -- based largely on anecdotal
reports from beekeepers -- is really any different from past declines
in bee populations (Science, 18 May, p. 970), bee researchers from
around the country met in Florida in January [2007] and formed a
working group to track down the culprit. The co-chairs, entomologists
Diana Cox-Foster of Pennsylvania State University in State College
and Jeffery Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee
Research Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, acquired samples from
collapsed colonies and asked molecular biologist W. Ian Lipkin of
Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health to help in the
search for pathogens.
Hazardous import?
The sudden loss of honey bees, particularly among trucked hives, has
been linked to a virus that may have arrived with bees from Australia.
Lipkin initially pooled samples from 4 beekeeping operations that had
been struck with CCD and, for comparison, he lumped together samples
from 2 operations that had remained healthy. When the group ran the
samples through a gene sequencer, they found an array of
microorganisms. All the bees had a rogue's gallery of pathogens, but
the samples from the CCD operations tended to be more disease-ridden,
with 2 viruses and 2 micro-sporidian parasites especially prevalent.
Next, the team went back and analyzed samples from individual hives.
IAPV turned up in 25 of the 30 sick colonies but in just one of the
21 healthy colonies.
"It's a good marker," says Mady Hornig of Columbia University. Others
note, however, that bees in hives suffering from CCD tend to
accumulate all sorts of secondary diseases, so IAPV infection could
be a consequence rather than a cause of the disorder.
"It's a chicken-and-egg problem," says bee virologist Joachim de
Miranda of the Sveriges Lantbruksuniversitet in Uppsala, Sweden.
Jerry Bromenshenk of Bee Alert Technology in Missoula, MT, doubts the
link to CCD. His collaborators at the U.S. Army's Edgewood Chemical
Biological Center in Maryland have spotted more than a dozen known
and new viruses, including IAPV, in bees from Florida, California,
and Australia, but none is associated with CCD. "We've got lots of
pathogens but no clear pattern yet," Bromenshenk says.
Evidence in the paper points to Australia as the source of IAPV. All
of the operations infected with IAPV had either imported bees from
Australia or stored their hives close to other operations with
Australian bees. None of the CCD-free beekeepers, located in Hawaii
and Pennsylvania, had Australian bees. Moreover, the team ordered
bees from Australia and discovered IAPV in most of them. Samples of
bees collected in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in 2004 -- before the
importation of bees began -- turned out negative.
But some researchers point out that this limited testing doesn't rule
out the possibility that IAPV may have already been in the country
before U.S. beekeepers began importing Australian bees. And Anderson
notes that IAPV does not seem to be causing harm in Australia.
Ilan Sela, a plant virologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem
who first isolated IAPV in 2002 from dead bees taken from Israeli
colonies, says IAPV is far from harmless. In experiments reported in
the 5 June [2007] issue of Virology, Sela and colleagues show that,
when injected, IAPV causes paralysis and death in 98 percent of bees
within days. If fed to the bees, they survive just a few days longer.
"IAPV kills," he says.
So why is there no CCD in Australia, even though IAPV is presumably
there? One reason could be that, unlike the United States, Australia
remains free of the varroa mite, which spreads pathogens and weakens
the immune system of bees. But that can't be the whole story, Pettis
notes, because CCD also appears to be absent in Canada and Israel,
where varroa mites are a problem and beekeepers have imported
Australian bees for years.
Pettis says other stresses in the United States such as poor
nutrition and long-distance trucking may make IAPV lethal. Within the
next few weeks, the team will begin a complicated set of experiments
intended to test whether IAPV can cause CCD either by itself or in
combination with 3 other pathogens and stresses. In the meantime,
Cox-Foster says, beekeepers should keep their bees as healthy as
possible and not reuse hives from collapsed colonies.
If IAPV does turn out to be a cause of CCD, there is encouraging news
from Israel. Sela has found that some bees can resist the virus.
About a third of bees sampled in Israel have incorporated the virus
into their genome. In his experiment, almost 20 percent of these bees
survived when injected with IAPV. Sela says that raises the
possibility of breeding IAPV-resistant bees.
