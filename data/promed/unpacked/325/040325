Two cases of cutaneous anthrax which started on the right forearm and progressed are described in a case report published online [12 Dec 2017] in the International Journal of Dermatology.

Hai-Ling Yuan, from Lanzhou General Hospital in China, and colleagues present 2 cases of human cutaneous anthrax that began in the right forearm and progressed. The patients were both bitten by mosquitoes -- one while in contact with a sick cow and the other while slaughtering infected cattle.

The authors note that the 1st patient had a red pustule on his forearm, which swelled and blistered. After admission, he received penicillin G; magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate was added following elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The edema on the patient's hand did not totally regress at the 4th week of therapy and a black eschar remained. The 2nd patient developed a small erythema lesion with itching, which worsened to a wound, causing swelling and multiple bullae. He received cephalosporin antibiotics. Following further testing that revealed elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and AST and ALT, the patient was given penicillin G, levofloxacin, and methylprednisolone; glycyrrhizin was also added. The edema on the patient's arm completely resolved after treatment for 4 weeks, but there was still edema on the hand.

"Clinical and experimental comparative studies are needed for steroid therapy and the duration of antibiotic therapy in complicated cases of naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax," the authors write.

In fact, both men suffered a mosquito bites while butchering sick cows. They were not walking past the farm. The extent of their arm lesions were not singular, as in an infected bite, but very extensive and severe. While mosquitoes can carry an infective dose of _Bacillus anthracis_ and thereby infect a bite -- this has been well described by Mike Turrell -- with these men the onset was rapid, 3 days, and all in all more typical of a standard cutaneous infection from the infected bovine blood entering via cuts on the forearms. Albeit they probably took advantage of the mosquito bite entries and scratching by the men while working. But keep in mind that anthrax can follow from insect bites, whether from injecta, contaminated mouthparts, or the scratching induced. - Mod.MHJ
