[The following information is sourced from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Report No. 6: 6 Mar-26 Mar 2020, World Animal Health Information and Analysis Department, available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/HPAI_asof26032020_Final.pdf:

"This report presents an overview of HPAI disease events (in poultry and non-poultry including wild birds) reported to the OIE's early warning system by its members, as well as non-member countries, during the period 6-26 Mar 2020 through the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS). The stable situations reported in the 6-monthly reports by 2 countries, namely, Egypt and Indonesia, are not described in this report, as these data for the 2nd semester 2019 will be collected throughout the 1st and 2nd semesters of 2020.

"Asia: Chinese Taipei and the Philippines reported respectively 5 and 1 new outbreaks (H5, H5N2, H5N5 and H5N6) in poultry. Ongoing outbreaks are still present in Afghanistan, China (People's Rep. of), Chinese Taipei, India, Korea (DPR), Philippines and Viet Nam in poultry (subtypes H5, H5N1, H5N2, H5N5, H5N6 and H7N9) and Afghanistan, China (People's Rep. of) in non-poultry (H5, H5N6 and H7N9).

"Veterinary authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity.

"The OIE Standards, and the transparency of reporting through the OIE's World Animal Health Information System, provide the framework for veterinary services to implement effective surveillance, reporting, and controls for avian influenza. Wild bird surveillance can indicate periods of heightened risk, and at these times measures to improve on-farm biosecurity may reduce the likelihood of exposure of poultry". - Mod.CRD
