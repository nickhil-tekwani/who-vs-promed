India: Increase in Number of Dengue Cases in Kochi
--------------------------------------------------
The district-level expert committee that met under Johnson K. George, ADM,
at the Collectorate here, has cautioned all sections of the public against
epidemic outbreaks. It was decided at the meeting to include the Kochi
Corporation health officer in the expert committee that already includes
district officers from the departments of panchayat, education, and water
authorities, and also to request the Kochi Mayor to instruct health
officials under the Corporation to concentrate on works related to checking
the spreading of epidemics.
The number of Dengue fever cases had risen to 71 this year from 25 cases
last year, and the chances of fatality were greater on repeated infection,
said V. K. Krishnankutty, Deputy District Medical Officer in charge of
contagious diseases. The meeting also decided to form a squad of 5 members
for every 50 houses in wards of village panchayat and councils in the
corporation to make door-to-door visits and destroy potential mosquito
breeding points.

Thailand: Dengue Alert for Travellers from Shanghai to Bangkok
------------------------------------------------
With dengue fever once again causing a health scare in Thailand, residents
[of Shanghai] planning to visit the country should take steps to prevent
mosquito bites, officials with the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and
Quarantine Bureau warned yesterday. In January 2003 alone, health officials
in Thailand discovered some 800 cases of dengue fever in and around
Bangkok, according to the Xinhua news agency. Health authorities in Bangkok
are predicting more people could catch the disease this year than in 2001,
when fear of dengue fever caused panic among Shanghai people who planned to
travel to the country.
The fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, is a viral infection causing skin
rash, headaches, fever and extreme pain. But a more dangerous version of
the disease, dengue hemorrhagic fever, can be [fatal]. "So far the state
entry-exit bureau has not issued a warning especially for this epidemic
yet," said Lu Feng with the Shanghai bureau. Unlike in 2001, when many
local residents canceled their trips to Thailand, this year's outbreak has
caused no cancellations, according to 3 local travel agencies contacted by
Shanghai Daily. "We have received no cancellation or questions from
customers so far," said Liu Xiaojun with the Shanghai China Youth Travel
Service Co. "Few locals have changed their plans probably because they know
little about the epidemic situation," said Liu.
Officials with the bureau warn that people who have travelled to Thailand
recently should go to the hospital immediately if they get a fever or
headache, while people who are going to the country should wear long-sleeve
clothes and carry mosquito repellent.

Thailand: Increase in Dengue Cases in Phuket
--------------------------------------------
The rising number of people contracting dengue fever has prompted Phuket
Public Health Office (PPHO) Chief Dr Wanchai Sattayawutthipong to issue a
public health warning and to implement a mosquito culling program. Speaking
at a press conference at Phuket Provincial Hall on Tue 18 Feb 2003, Dr
Wanchai said, "About 10 people in Phuket had dengue fever in February of
2002, but almost 30 people have contracted it in February 2003." Dr Wanchai
pointed out that all the reported cases of dengue fever this year have been
Thais and that last year less than 5 percent of all reported cases were
foreigners. However, the Phuket Gazette has learned of one case this year
involving a foreigner. An Australian man who stayed for 5 weeks in Patong
was diagnosed with dengue fever after his return home at the end of January
2003, says his wife.
To prevent an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease, volunteers and public
health officers from the Arbovirus Infectious Diseases Center in Phang Nga
are inspecting households for uncovered stagnant water, where mosquitoes
lay eggs. Depending on what the officers discover, they will mark the house
with a red, green, or yellow sticker. Red indicates mosquito larvae have
been found, yellow indicates uncovered water without mosquito larvae, and
green indicates no uncovered water and no mosquito larvae found. If
mosquito larvae are discovered, a team of PPHO officers will spray the site
with chemicals and will return 7 days later to spray a second time, to kill
off any surviving larvae.
The project began yesterday and will continue until Fri 7 Mar 2003. Today,
households in Kamala were inspected and sprayed. Other areas marked for
inspection are Koh Kaew, Rassada, Wichit, Chalong, Karon, Rawai,
Srisoontorn, Cherng Talay, Pa Khlok, Patong, and Kathu.

Ecuador: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Reaches Epidemic Levels
-------------------------------------------------
Dengue hemorrhagic fever has reached epidemic levels in Ecuador, as heavy
rains pound the Pacific coast and make it tough to control the deadly
disease, a health official said on Wed 19 Feb 2003. This cash-strapped
Andean nation declared a sanitary emergency a week ago in a bid to channel
funds to fumigate coastal regions and treat patients with the potentially
lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever.
National Health Director Javier Carrillo told Reuters that the disease had
already reached epidemic proportions with 22 cases so far this year. [This
figure represents an increase in 8 cases since Thu 13 Feb 2003 and exceeds
by 2 the total number of cases recorded during the whole of 2002. - Mod.CP]
Dengue is endemic to Ecuador's coastal region and flourishes during the wet
months of December through April. The disease's main symptoms include
fever, headache, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and rash. Patients with
dengue hemorrhagic fever also may experience internal bleeding.

Mexico: Dengue Fever Outbreak in Puerto Vallarta
------------------------------------------------
As the tourists relax and sip margaritas around the hotel pools, the
hard-working residents of this balmy vacation spot are engaged in a far
different activity to restore their peace of mind. The hotel maids and
margarita servers are being encouraged to clean up the patios of their
hillside homes, which overlook the famous strip of beach resorts. As
mundane as that sounds, it actually could be a matter of sickness or
health. At least according to Mexican health officials trying to contain an
outbreak of dengue fever -- or what is more descriptively known as
"breakbone fever" -- that has killed 2 and immobilized hundreds in the
resort city's poorer neighborhoods in recent months.
To contain the mosquito-borne virus, health officials have determined that
the best strategy is not expensive fumigating or hunting for an elusive
vaccine. Rather, it's persuading city dwellers to get rid of or cover up
the old tires, cases of empty soda bottles, bird baths, and collectibles
that clutter many yards. That eliminates the standing water in which
mosquitoes breed. And that, residents are told, reduces the spread of the
incredibly painful and sometimes fatal malady that strikes more than a
million people worldwide each year. Judging by the new tidiness of yards in
the poor Jardines neighborhood here, residents appear to be responding to
Operation Clean Patio, a campaign health workers have waged street-to-street.
In Mexico in 2002, more than 3700 people were hit by symptoms of aching
joints and searing headaches, and at least 4 of the victims died. Dengue
fever was thought to have been mostly wiped out in the 1970s. But patches
remained in Venezuela and the Caribbean, and with the help of the fever's
host mosquitoes, it has been making a comeback. Health officials say the
risk of dengue spreading into the United States is low because of North
Americans' more indoor, air-conditioned lifestyle. But there have been
outbreaks along the US-Mexico border, and a suspected 200 cases were
reported around the city of Matamoros last year.
The Puerto Vallarta area had not had a case of dengue in 3 years. But since
the fall, health officials have treated 346 cases, including 32 cases of
the potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever. 2 people died in the city,
while 2 others died in the Gulf Coast state of Quintana Roo. Health
officials said the cases were isolated until Hurricane Kenna struck the
Puerto Vallarta area in late October, inundating the city with heavy rains
and a massive wave surge that dumped sailboats in back yards, filled hotel
pools with beach sand, and left pools of water everywhere. Health officials
said the outbreak did not affect tourist areas, mostly because of better
sanitation precautions around the hotels. But there have been cases of
American tourists contracting the virus in Mexican resorts and bringing it
home with them.
