Niger 2nd in Africa with H5N1
-----------------------------
Ilaria Capua, chief of the laboratory in Padua, Italy said the tests were
confirmed Monday [27 Feb 2006] and the government of the impoverished West
African country had been informed.
The H5N1 strain had earlier been confirmed in Nigeria, Niger's southern
neighbor, and officials had said in mid-February 2006 they were
investigating whether it had surfaced in Niger. Experts have been
particularly concerned about the spread of H5N1 to Africa, which is
unprepared for such a health crisis because of its weak infrastructure.
The virus is believed to have spread unchecked in Nigeria before it was
identified, and Nigeria's efforts to contain it have been hampered by a
lack of resources and information.
Further tests were being carried out to determine how closely the strain
found in Niger matched the H5N1 strain detected elsewhere in the world.
Capua, speaking at a bird flu conference in France [see comment], said she
feared the arrival of the virus in a 2nd African country was "just the
start" of the virus becoming endemic on the continent. She offered a
glimmer of good news though, saying tests on birds from Senegal had come
back negative.

[Exact location, species involved and further epidemiological details,
which could enable estimating the extent of the animal spread in Niger,
would be welcomed.
A meeting on highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Europe was planned
to be convened at the OIE Headquarters in Paris on 27-28 Feb 2006. The
chief veterinary officers of almost 50 European countries, as well as from
neighboring countries like Iran, Azerbaidjan, and Syria, were expected to
attend the conference in order to assess the current situation, to discuss
a common strategy for the European region and to discuss funding strategies
for HPAI control in Europe and neighboring countries. - Mod.AS]

Pak orders culling of chickens after detection of H5 virus
----------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan today [27 Feb 2006] ordered the culling of chickens and
quarantined some farms in North West Frontier Province (NWFP), following
detection of a low pathogenic strain of bird flu virus which does not
affect human beings.
Initial tests have confirmed the presence of H5 virus, which does not
affect human beings, Pakistan Animal Husbandry Commissioner, Dr Afzal Ahmad
told reporters here. The tests were carried out yesterday [26 Feb 2006],
after several chickens were found dead in farms in Abtabad and Charsadha in
the NWFP.
The virus of the H5 strain was less pathogenic than the H5N1 that could
spread to human beings, Ahmad said, adding that there was no confirmation
yet about bird flu cases. The samples have been sent for testing to
Britain, however, and the results were expected by the weekend, he said.
As a precautionary measure, owners of the 2 chicken farms have been advised
to cull their birds. The news of the detection of H5 virus came as some
local newspapers reported that several chickens were found dead in the
farms in Abtabad and Charsadha.
Ahmad said Pakistan, which banned imports of poultry from India, China,
France and various other countries, has taken all precautionary measures to
deal with the spread of the deadly virus if it was reported in any part of
the country.
About 25 response teams have been constituted to deal with the virus, and
the situation was being closely monitored in all the 4 provinces. Ever
since reports of the detection of the virus in Maharastra, Pakistan has
banned poultry imports from India and instructed customs to prevent any
poultry items being brought into the country via bus and train services to
India.

France starts poultry vaccination as bird flu spreads
-----------------------------------------------------
France began vaccinating more than 300 000 geese and ducks against avian
flu on Monday [27 Feb 2006], while Niger became the 2nd West African
country to be hit by a virus that is spreading among birds at unprecedented
speed.
Tests on domestic ducks from Niger have shown positive results for the H5N1
bird flu virus, the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) said.
Neighboring Nigeria has already been hit by bird flu in poultry. [Map at

The Black Sea state of Georgia said it had found the H5N1 strain in wild
swans, as the virus, which is endemic in birds in parts of Asia, extends
its sweep across the globe. As many as 18 new countries have reported
outbreaks in birds over the past month.
Ilaria Capua, a top European expert on avian influenza with the OIE, said
the spread of the virus to the wild bird population has meant the situation
in Europe was now akin "to living under machine-gun fire ... And the spring
migration from Africa will make us even more exposed," she said. "This is
the 1st time in history that it (bird flu) has been widespread in wild
birds," she added.
France started the vaccination campaign in the department of the Landes, in
the south west of the country, one of the areas deemed to be at risk from
the spread of the virus by migratory birds. France is Europe's biggest
poultry producer and has a confirmed case of H5N1 bird flu at a turkey farm
in the east, the 1st farm in the European Union to contract the virus. The
bird flu outbreak could deal a heavy blow to France's poultry industry,
worth 6 billion euros (USD 7 billion) per year.
Opinion is divided over whether vaccination helps to support trade or makes
the situation more difficult, with some markets shunning meat from
countries with vaccination programs.
Japan has banned poultry imports from France due to the bird flu outbreak
and has threatened similar action against the Netherlands because of its
vaccination program. The Netherlands also has plans to vaccinate some of
its backyard and free-range poultry. Under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the World Trade Organization's basic rule book, it is left open
for any member country to impose restriction on imports from others that it
fears could spread disease among humans or animals.
Britain has criticized the use of vaccines in poultry, saying they could
mask the effects of the disease and make it more difficult to tackle its
spread among flocks.
Experts fear the virus could spread rapidly in Africa, where chickens live
in millions of homes and health, veterinary and laboratory services are
often poor. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, has reported bird flu
in 6 states. Niger, one of the poorest countries on earth, shares a 1500 km
(900 mile) border with Nigeria. An OIE spokeswoman said there were 2
outbreaks, one of which was close to the border with Nigeria.
"We've been officially informed that the presence of the virus has been
notified on the sample from Niger, but we are waiting for official
documents to know ... what type of strain it is," Niger's government
spokesman Mohamed Ben Omar said.

Georgia finds H5N1 bird flu in wild swans
-----------------------------------------
Georgia has found the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in wild swans, the head of
the veterinary department at Georgia's Agriculture Ministry said on Monday
[27 Feb 2006]. "A laboratory in Georgia has established (the existence of)
the H5N1 bird flu virus," Jambul Maglakelidze told Reuters, after tests on
wild swans found on its Black Sea coast, near the border with Turkey.
The announcement confirms the 1st case of bird flu in Georgia, which
borders Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. The swans were found in a
village in Adzhara, a semi-autonomous region not far from the Turkish city
of Trabzon.
President Mikhail Saakashvili has declared a state of emergency in the
area, and domestic birds were being culled in the area around the village
where the swans were found.

Bird flu virus kills 15 swans in France
---------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus has killed 15 wild swans in south eastern
France, agriculture officials said on Sunday [26 Feb 2006], raising fears
the lethal strain could spread in the European Union's leading producer of
poultry. The news of the dead swans came a day after French authorities
confirmed that a nearby turkey farm of more than 11 000 birds had been
contaminated, the European Union's 1st outbreak of deadly bird flu in
commercial poultry. The dead swans were found around the numerous ponds
that dot the south east area.
In India, thousands of workers in the poultry industry have lost their jobs
amid plunging demand for chicken, after the country reported its 1st case
of bird flu last week, an official said Sunday [26 Feb 2006]. India's
poultry industry has reported losses totaling about USD 1.1 billion since
bird flu was detected last week, the Hindu Business Line newspaper
reported. In the northern Uttar Pradesh state, among India's largest
poultry producers, more than 60 per cent of the state's 2.5 million poultry
workers have lost their jobs, said Mukesh Singh, a poultry company
executive. Although experts say bird flu cannot be contracted from eating
properly cooked food, millions of people in India have stopped eating
chicken and eggs because of fears of the disease, threatening to derail
India's fast-growing USD 13.6 billion poultry industry.
