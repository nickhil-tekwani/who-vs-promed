"Before SARS Erupted in Guangdong, There Were People with Antibodies"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[ProMED-mail has received from a correspondent the following
translation of an extract from an article in a Chinese newspaper. In
the absence of information on the nature of the tests and the
reagents employed, it is difficult to comment on this report in any
detail. Nonetheless, it provides invaluable data on the presence of a
SARS coronavirus-like agent in asymptomatic humans approximately one
year before the appearance of SARS in Guangdong. However, the report
does not indicate whether any of the 16 positive samples originated
from Guangdong. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
Beijing Military District Air Force General Logistics Department
studied 1621 samples of cryopreserved blood from healthy youths in
169 counties in China. Blood had been drawn between 2001 and 2002.
After conducting 4 tests at 3 "authoritative" institutions, it was
determined that 16 samples had a positive reaction to the SARS virus
antigen.
