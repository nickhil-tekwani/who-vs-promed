Foot & mouth disease kills dozens in Balochistan
-----------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease [originating] in hoofed animals is causing havoc in
Balochistan, as dozens of persons have died of a mysterious disease that is
spreading via goats. According to reports, large numbers of people, mostly
shepherds, have been affected by the deadly disease.
Many shepherds, and their family members, have been admitted to local
hospitals. Health experts have connected this disease to foot and mouth
disease, because the victims are carrying germs of a similar type.
The deadly disease is spreading like wildfire in Balochistan, and the
Federal Ministry of Food Agriculture and Livestock has imposed a ban on the
intra-provincial supply of goats from Balochistan.
A scientist from the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council anonymously
told [Pak Tribune] Online that the public should immediately stop consuming
meat acquired from sheep and goats, fearing that large numbers of people
could be affected.
For the time being, no cure for the deadly disease has been found, and
experts fear the death toll could rise.

[Foot and mouth disease virus only rarely causes disease in humans, and the
outbreak of disease described in this report is unlikely to be caused by
foot and mouth disease virus. In the outbreak of foot and mouth disease
that occurred in the UK in 2001, the largest outbreak recorded so far,
there was no confirmed case of human disease. It is likely that the cases
of human disease described in this report are caused by infection with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne virus
responsible for a highly-lethal infection that is endemic in this region.
An outbreak of suspected CCHFV infection was reported in Baluchistan in
mid-June 2004 (see: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever- Pakistan (Bal) (05):
susp. 20040621.1657). These cases of presumptive CCHFV infection indicated
either an expansion of a focal outbreak, or, alternatively, reflected a
seasonal increase of tick activity over the whole region.
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever can be contracted both by tick-bite and by
direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected domestic animals,
such as sheep and goats, or of human patients. Consequently, nosocomial
infection is not uncommon, especially where the disease is not recognized,
and, where there are no facilities for precise diagnosis. Domestic animals
exhibit few signs of disease, and it may be that there is also a concurrent
outbreak of foot and mouth disease in domestic stock in the region. - Mod.CP]
[FMD is endemic in Pakistan, reportedly caused, during 2003, by 3
serotypes: A, Asia1, and O. Official data on the situation regarding both
of the diseases currently prevailing in Baluchistan will be helpful. - Mod.AS].
