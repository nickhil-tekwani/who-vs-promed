France: case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever imported from Senegal
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Institut de Veille Sanitaire (National Institute for Public
Health Surveillance) in France was informed yesterday [Tue 23 Nov
2004] of a case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) diagnosed
in a French hospital in a patient returning from Senegal. The patient
had stayed in Saly and Dakar, Senegal. The Saly area is a known
transmission area for CCHF. The mode of inoculation remains unknown,
but investigations are ongoing.
The patient became ill on 4 Nov 2004. She was successively hospitalized in 2
hospitals in Dakar, Senegal. Her clinical condition was typical of CCHF,
associating fever (40 C), petechiae [tiny spots of bleeding into the skin],
gum bleeding, diffuse hematomas [bloody bruises] on the limbs, and
hematemesis [coughing up blood]. She did not receive ribavirin [an
antiviral]. She was referred to an infectious diseases intensive care unit
in France by private ambulance plane, arriving on Sun 14 Nov 2004. Her
clinical status improved rapidly, and she was transferred to a
hospitalization ward on Tue 16 Nov 2004. She recovered and was discharged
from the hospital on Mon 22 Nov 2004.

Tests performed on a blood sample taken on 18 Nov 2004 were positive
for anti-CCHF virus IgM antibodies, negative for IgG [indicating recent
infection]. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests were negative [for CCHF
nucleic acid], but a nested PCR was positive for CCHF virus (results
released 22 Nov 2004).
The case investigation team is documenting and tracing contacts, with
clinical follow-up until day 12 after the last contact. The French
Ministry of Health has informed the Ministry of Health in Senegal.
Medical officers in charge of all the hospitals and transfer services
in France and Senegal have been informed personally by the case
investigation team [so they can watch themselves for fever indicating
possible contamination by the patient's body fluids. - Mod.JW].
