The dengue outbreak in Perak has badly hit the
blood supply in hospitals [in Ipoh, Malaysia] and
in Manjung district, which recorded the highest
number of dengue cases.

Health, Environment and Human Resource Committee
chairman A. Sivanesan urged the public to donate
blood at Hospital Raja Perempuan Bainun [in Ipoh]
and at Seri Manjung Hospital. "The blood bank is
depleted. The situation is bad," he said.

Sivanesan pointed out that the supply of blood
was normally low during festive seasons because
of road accidents. "But coupled with the
increasing number of dengue cases in the state,
the supply is badly hit," he said.

It had been reported that Perak recorded 4 dengue
deaths in the 1st 9 months of the year with all
cases reported in Manjung district. The district
also recorded the most number of dengue cases in
the state.

In a circular distributed recently to
non-governmental organisations urging the public
to donate blood, Hospital Raja Perempuan Bainun
said those who contracted dengue haemorrhagic
fever [DHF] needed blood for transfusion.

The incidence of dengue is declining, with only
38 deaths reported from across the country
compared with last year's [2007] 69. The number
of cases is 2808 as against 5634 last year.

The highest number of 14 [dengue] deaths has been

With about 2500 domestic breeding checkers (DBCs)
[staff that check on _Aedes_ dengue virus
mosquito vector breeding sites] on strike, MCD
[Municipal Corporation of Delhi] says dengue
cases are on rise in the city. On Thursday [25
Sep 2008], 20 new cases were reported, taking the
toll to 478, including 2 deaths. To make up for
the shortage of DBCs, MCD has decided to engage
600 new DBCs from Friday [26 Sep 2008].

"We don't have the required strength of DBCs, so
we are not able to keep a close watch on
breeding. With these 600 new DBCs joining from
Friday [26 Sep 2008], we will have nearly 2500
DBCs. We are also expecting 200 odd DBCs, who
went on strike, to join work," said Dr NK Yadav,
MHO [municipal health officer], MCD.

According to the MCD officials, the dengue cases
are more than what were reported in the past 3
years. "With 20-25 cases every day, this years'
[2008] dengue situation is quite different. Due
to early monsoon, the breeding season started
early and will continue till November," said a
senior MCD health official.

Over 1000 cases of dengue fever have been reported around the country.

Director of Curative Health Services Dr Ami
Chandra said majority of the cases are reported
in the Central Division, adding the public should
assist the Health Ministry in the clean up and
spraying campaign and destroy mosquito breeding
places and the mosquito population.

Meanwhile, senior health inspector Waisale Delai
said they are yet to receive response on the
success of their campaign.

Senior doctors are currently attending a Cooperative Planning Workshop.

After having confirmed the occurrence of 50 new
dengue cases, for a total of 265 infected people
thus far this year [2008], with 4 DHF (dengue
hemorrhagic fever) cases, and with the majority
[of dengue cases] identified in the Guadalajara
metropolitan area, Norma Elizabeth Jacobo
Hernandez, director of Vectors and Zoonoses of
the Jalisco Secretariat of Health, considered
that despite these [cases], these figures are
much lower than those of past years. "There have
been [dengue] outbreaks more important for the
state, such as in Puerto Vallarta. The current
outbreak is not different, except that it is in
the Guadalajara metropolitan area. In 1988 there
were 4508 laboratory confirmed [dengue] cases in
the metropolitan area, the same as in Zapopan,
one of the affected areas," she pointed out.

In addition to this, when there is comparison
with figures from last year [2007], by this same
date in September more than 500 dengue cases had
been identified.

Against this background, Jacobo Hernandez insisted that nothing will
be enough if you do not have social support. "If you look at ... a
neighborhood that is adjacent to one that previously has had [dengue]
cases, [and think] that we are [not] seeing risk ... for us, does not
recognize the fact that the mosquito does not respect [political]
boundaries," she said.

Actions to clean up and spray mosquito breeding
sites will continue, especially in the Zapopan
municipality, which up to today [27 Sep 2008] has
had a total of 185 [dengue virus] infected
patients, of whom 3 had DHF, the most dangerous
form of the disease. "Outbreak control depends on
citizen activity and participation. As for the
Jalisco Secretariat of Health, we will continue
actions to combat the mosquito [virus vector] and
abate the outbreak."

The Sonora Secretariat of Public Health (SSP)
declared a red alert in the state after the
confirmation of 6 cases of classical dengue in
the municipalities of Benito Juarez, Cajeme, and
Navojoa, due to the rains caused by tropical
storm Lowell, for a cumulative number of 23
affected [people] in the area this year [2008].

In a press conference, the secretary of public
health, Raymundo Lopez Vucovich, assured [the
public] that the "clean patios" strategy would be
reinforced for the "Everyone Against Dengue"
campaign in the region to avoid the spread of the
disease, and issued a call to the community to
help cleaning up their patios and streets of
[water] recipients which could serve as breeding
sites for the mosquito vector, reducing the risk
of [dengue virus] transmission to the populace.

To date, the SSP has confirmed 7 [dengue] cases
in the municipality of Navojoa, 5 in Navojoa
[town], 5 in Guaymas, 3 in Hermosillo,
2 en Benito Juarez, and one more from the
adjacent state of Chihuahua, which requested
medical assistance from Navojoa, for a cumulative
total of 23 [cases] in 2008.

Lopez Vucovich explained that blood samples have
been tested from 450 [individuals], of whom 23
people have been confirmed to have had the
disease, but that 49 [samples] are still under
study, the results of which will be ready on
Tuesday, [30 Sep 2008].

In Mexico, samples from 55 000 febrile [disease
cases] have been tested, of whom 23 000 have
been positive for the vector [sic: virus], with the
states of Guerrero, Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Chiapas
being the most affected.

[Lopez Vucovich] indicated that the SSP promotes
responsible community participation with the
elimination of [water] receptacles, which can
serve as breeding sites for [dengue virus] vector
mosquitoes, and the application of abate in stored
water for human consumption. In case another
epidemic develops, he considers that there will
not be [enough] health or municipal workers
capable of containing it, and because of this he
reiterated his call for citizen co-responsibility
for [preventive] self health care.

The Ministry of Health in Guyana has indicated
that there are reports that approximately 300
people are affected by dengue in that country.

The Kaieteur News newspaper stated that, having
been alerted by the outbreak of the fever in
neighbouring Trinidad and Tobago, the ministry
has intensified its surveillance and discovered
the large number of individuals affected.

It is the highest number of dengue cases in the Republic since 1998.

A statement from the Ministry of Health said that
the Health Department would ensure that an
adequate standard of treatment was given to those
affected and that steps were being taken to
prevent others from being infected.

The Mosquito Control Programme is also expected to be revamped.
