[This is in response to an RFI on the techniques applied in Wales for the diagnosis of neospora abortions in cattle (also termed "abortion storms"), submitted by Prof Fabio Del Piero, as included in the above posting].

I write as the veterinary lead of the Cattle Expert Group, for the Animal and Plant Health Agency which has responsibility for scanning surveillance in England and Wales and works collaboratively with the SAC who carry out an equivalent role in Scotland (http://apha.defra.gov.uk/vet-gateway/surveillance/scanning/index.htm; https://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120107/veterinary_services). Together, we contribute to the Veterinary Investigation Diagnosis Analysis (VIDA) database (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/veterinary-investigation-diagnosis-analysis-vida-report-2016). VIDA has clearly defined case definitions, diagnostic and testing criteria to ensure consistency and quality of investigation of scanning surveillance submissions to our network of laboratories and surveillance partners across GB. This includes bovine neosporosis. Diagnosis of neosporosis forms part of a defined bovine abortion investigation protocol which requires evidence of the presence of the parasite (usually by PCR) and histopathological evidence of pathology associated with its presence. BVD [bovine viral diarrhea virus] investigation is part of the abortion investigation protocol.

The source quoted arose as part of a campaign in Wales to raise awareness of the contribution of dogs to the spread of neosporosis, in part as a consequence of a small number of serious cases reported over the last 2 years to NFU [National Farmers' Union] Cymru by their members.

The GB scanning surveillance network has not detected a significant increase in neospora diagnoses recently in Wales.

[We are grateful to Dr Hateley for the above response to our RFI. The text applied in the cited media report (20180706.5891156), to which he referred, was: "In recent months, NFU Cymru has received increasing reports of outbreaks of neospora in cattle. These are coming from all areas in Wales."

As apparent from Dr Hateley's response, the above statement was somewhat excessive, arising as part of an (apparently, commendable) campaign in Wales to raise awareness of the contribution of dogs to the spread of neosporosis. Factually, no significant increase in neospora diagnoses has been noted recently in Wales nor "abortion storms".

This case may serve as a platform for an essential reminder of ProMED-mail's modus operandi. Reports detail infectious disease outbreaks with geotags and links to related media articles and other ProMED posts. There are 45 moderators for ProMED stationed throughout the world. Moderators review reports submitted within their region of oversight, drawing on their knowledge of the region and infrastructure to provide accurate descriptions of the outbreak event. Our sources of information include media reports, official and unofficial reports, online summaries, local observations, scientific publications and others.

Informal reports, in particular when media-sourced, may include inaccuracies or lacunae. Our moderators exercise their best to ensure the validity of the published information in each report. The moderators' commentaries may include interpretations of reports, confirm their contents or otherwise, indicate the inaccuracies, make corrections, raise questions, add relevant information from other sources or provide their references, and request additional information or clarifications when needed. The commentary is an essential part of the posting; skipping commentaries or parts thereof may lead to misleading information. Subscribers are strongly advised to read the commentaries, and encouraged to respond if necessary; please don't hesitate.

As ProMED-mail is an independent program of the non-government, nonprofit organisation International Society for Infectious Diseases [http://www.isid.org], this ensures the avoidance of delay or suppression of disease reporting by governments for bureaucratic or strategic reasons. - Mod.AS
