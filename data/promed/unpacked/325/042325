Cholera outbreak feared in northwest Cambodia
Sat, 27 Jun 1998 7:59:39 PDT
PHNOM PENH, June 27 (AFP) - Cambodian health authorities voiced fears
Saturday of a cholera outbreak after at least two people died in the
northwest over the past week. "All the ingredients for a cholera outbreak
are present," said Maurits van Pel, the country coordinator for Medecins
San Frontiers (MSF - Doctors Without Borders), describing conditions in the
town of Poipet on the Thai border. "We are dealing with a weak and
malnourished population of migrant workers in a densely populated slum
area, people who are therefore prone to become sick," he said, noting the
lack of a health-care infrastructure in the town. MSF, in conjunction with
the Cambodian health ministry, said it was moving additional staff to the
area to deal with the possible problem.
Doctors are already battling an outbreak of dengue fever, and resources are
strained due to preparations for July's elections. MSF said laboratory
tests had confirmed that two people had died from cholera in Poipet, but
the real magnitude of the problem was hidden due to a "quasi-total absence
of public health care services
in the past," which inhibited those stricken from coming forward for
treatment. "It is too early for us to say whether the situation will get
worse because we cannot say whether people are sick or dying in their
homes," said Verena Carrara of MSF.
Cholera is endemic in Cambodia but there have been no cases reported since
1993.
