A new report details the investigation into a large outbreak of group B _Streptococcus_ in Singapore that was caused by a type of raw fish salad.

The 2015 outbreak sickened 238 people and was associated with consuming yusheng, a dish typically made from 2 freshwater fish species, Asian bighead carp and snakehead, Lee C. Ng, PhD, director of the Singapore National Environment Agency's Environmental Health Institute, and colleagues wrote in Emerging Infectious Diseases [1,2].

The discovery of group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS) as the cause of the outbreak led Singapore to ban the use of raw freshwater fish in ready-to-eat meals and to institute stricter rules governing the sale of ready-to-eat raw saltwater fish. The ban took effect in December 2015, several months before Chinese New Year, when yusheng is customarily eaten, authorities said.

According to Ng and colleagues, GBS is found in around 30 percent of healthy adults. The bacterium is a common cause of neonatal sepsis, and researchers recently estimated that it may cause almost 150 000 stillbirths and infant deaths globally each year. Ng and colleagues said the incidence of invasive GBS in adults has been increasing but that foodborne transmission had not previously been reported as a cause.

During and after the outbreak, Ng and colleagues tested fish (n = 997) and samples of fish tank water (n = 102) used for holding live freshwater fish for the presence of several pathogens. They found one clade of the GBS strain ST283 that was nearly identical to clinical strains from outbreak. They traced the strain to Malaysia but said it is probably prevalent throughout the region.

According to their report, GBS was detected all along the food chain, from ports where fish are imported, to fish markets where they are sold and food stalls that might typically serve yusheng. Ng and colleagues said people who ate yusheng were more likely to acquire GBS ST283 than those who did not.

Ng and colleagues isolated other pathogens from both freshwater and saltwater fish samples during their investigation, including _Aeromonas_ spp., _Vibrio cholerae_, _V. parahaemolyticus_, _Escherichia coli_ and _Staphylococcus aureus_. They said their findings "indicate the risk for contamination of raw freshwater fish and underscore the need for proper sourcing and handling of all fish for raw consumption."

"Our study complements the epidemiologic findings for this outbreak and illustrates the need for public health authorities and industries to remain vigilant regarding emerging pathogens."

[Reference 1. Abstract:
"An outbreak of invasive group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease occurred in Singapore in mid-2015. We conducted a case-control study of 22 adults with invasive GBS infections during June 21-November 21, 2015. Consumption of raw fish was strongly associated with invasive sequence type 283 infections, but not with non-sequence type 283 infections."

Reference 2. Abstract:
"We assessed microbial safety and quality of raw fish sold in Singapore during 2015-2016 to complement epidemiologic findings for an outbreak of infection with group B _Streptococcus_ serotype III sequence type (ST) 283 associated with raw fish consumption. Fish-associated group B Streptococcus ST283 strains included strains nearly identical (0-2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) with the human outbreak strain, as well as strains in another distinct ST283 clade (57-71 single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Our investigations highlight the risk for contamination of freshwater fish (which are handled and distributed separately from saltwater fish sold as sashimi) and the need for improved hygienic handling of all fish for raw consumption. These results have led to updated policy and guidelines regarding the sale of ready-to-eat raw fish dishes in Singapore."

The following has been extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Strep. Group B - Singapore (03): invasive, fish susp, update 20151110.3779860:

"Group B streptococci (GBS), also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_, are Gram-positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. They are classified into several serotypes based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45 percent and can cause chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery.

"GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (such as, decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

"GBS are also found in other animals including fish, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, were said to be usually biochemically, metabolically or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). However, GBS MLST ST-283, serotype III-4 has been detected both in fish and in adult humans with invasive GBS diseases in Southeast Asia, which suggested that there may be an epidemiological connection between the 2 host species, as previously described for a closely related streptococcal species, _Streptococcus iniae_ (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/41).

Group B - Singapore (02): fish susp, RFI 20150814.3577512) reported an outbreak of GBS infections in Singapore that was linked to consumption of GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers (food courts), where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger." - Mod.ML
