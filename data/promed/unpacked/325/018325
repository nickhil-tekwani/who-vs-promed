Poliomyelitis outbreak escalates in the Sudan
Case from Sudan reported in Saudi Arabia
-----------------------
A current polio outbreak in the Sudan, caused by an imported type 1
poliovirus (1), continues to escalate. 105 cases have now been confirmed
from 17 of the country's 26 states (as of 6 Jan 2005), since the 1st case
was identified in Darfur in May 2004. In addition, a 2-year-old Sudanese
girl from Dar Elneeem district, Port Sudan, experienced onset of paralysis
on 6 Nov 2004, 1 day after arriving in Saudi Arabia from the Sudan with her
family. Although genetic data on the virus isolated from the case in Saudi
Arabia are not yet available, almost all other viruses identified in 2004
in the Sudan are closely genetically related to polioviruses originating in
northern Nigeria and Chad.
The escalating outbreak in the Sudan and the polio case in Saudi Arabia
further underline the high risk posed to polio-free areas by the continuing
epidemic in west and central Africa. This risk is compounded by the growing
vulnerability of populations to polio globally, following the cessation of
preventive polio immunization campaigns in many polio-free countries in
2002-2003. Children globally will continue to be at risk of polio from such
importations until the disease is eradicated everywhere.
The Sudan is continuing its intensification of polio immunization
campaigns, with support from WHO, UNICEF and other polio partners.
Following 4 mass immunization campaigns in the Darfur region between July
and November 2004, and 2 nationwide campaigns in October and November 2004,
planning is currently under way for the next rounds of nationwide
immunization campaigns commencing on 10 Jan, 25 Feb and late March 2005.
The Government of Saudi Arabia is also implementing an emergency response
to the importation, including heightened disease surveillance throughout
the country, to ensure that any transmission of wild poliovirus in Saudi
Arabia is identified and stopped rapidly. WHO notified countries
neighbouring the Sudan of the high risk for further importations, and urged
a strengthening of surveillance for polio, high routine immunization
coverage of infants, and, if appropriate, supplementary polio immunization
campaigns. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by WHO,
Rotary International, the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and UNICEF. The poliovirus is now endemic in only 6 countries,
down from more than 125 when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was
launched in 1988. The 6 countries with indigenous wild poliovirus are:
Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Niger, Afghanistan and Egypt. Since mid-2003, 13
countries have suffered importations of wild poliovirus linked to virus
circulating in northern Nigeria. In 4 of these countries (Burkina Faso,
Chad, Cote d'Ivoire and the Sudan) wild poliovirus transmission has been
re-established (i.e. continued circulation for >6 months).

[2] Cote d'Ivoire

Children face growing risk of polio in Cote d'Ivoire
------------------
The number of recorded cases of polio in Cote d'Ivoire shot up to 17 in
2004 from just one the previous year, and the real situation on the ground
may be worse given that access to the rebel-held north of the country is
difficult, Health Minister Albert Mabri Toikeusse said.
"Polio has well and truly returned to Cote d'Ivoire," Toikeusse told a
press briefing last week. "It's crucial that routine vaccinations resume."
Instability in the West African country, which has been partitioned into a
government-run south and a rebel-held north since a failed coup more than 2
years ago, was the main reason behind the disruption of vaccination
campaigns, he said.
The most recent flare-up in the long-running conflict in early November
forced the Health Ministry to postpone 2 rounds of a national polio
immunisation campaign for 5.1 million children planned for November and
December.
Polio -- poliomyelitis -- is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus
that affects mainly children under 3 years of age. It invades the nervous
system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
Toikeusse said that 15 of the 17 cases reported during 2004 were in the
government-run south, but he added that the situation in rebel territory
was probably bleaker than the statistics suggested.
"We have an epidemiological silence is this part of the country because we
haven't be able to collect numbers. We know that the healthcare situation
in the centre, the north and the west is disastrous," Toikeusse said.
In its 2004 annual report, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
sounded the alarm that health care in the north was in tatters, with few
doctors and nurses and virtually no routine vaccinations.
"Cote d'Ivoire, which was polio-free in 2001, is really of great concern
because the cases aren't concentrated in one area. So the threat to
children is not localised, it's nationwide," Jeff Brez, the spokesman for
UNICEF in Abidjan, told IRIN on Tuesday.
"We've definitely seen an alarming rise. And the fact that surveillance is
so weak, also leads us to wonder whether there are not cases we are not
aware of in the north," he added.
Key to stopping polio in its tracks are comprehensive and coordinated
vaccination campaigns. Cote d'Ivoire borders 5 countries and populations in
the region are mobile, providing fertile conditions for the polio virus to
spread.
"Cote d'Ivoire is the economic magnet for the sub-region. Children are
travelling back and forth with their families, so the regional aspect of
the campaign is crucial," UNICEF's Brez said.
The pace at which polio can gain a foothold was brought into focus recently
when a 2003 immunisation ban in the northern Nigerian state of Kano helped
the virus spread across the wider region in 2004, infecting 12 west and
central African countries previously declared polio-free and derailing
international health experts' plans to eradicate the disease by the end of
the year.
Figures from the World Health Organisation show that as of 21 Dec [2004],
Nigeria had 748 cases of polio -- more than 2/3 of polio cases worldwide.

[From the most recent case counts available on the polio eradication
website, as of 4 Jan 2005, the 2004 reported cases from the African
continent included: Nigeria 760 cases, Sudan 105 cases, Central African
Republic 29 cases, Niger 25 cases, Chad 22 cases, Cote d'Ivoire 16 cases,
Cameroon 10 cases, Mali 9 cases, Burkina Faso 7 cases, Benin 6 cases,
Guinea 4 cases, Egypt 1 case and Botswana 1 case. Readers are reminded
that the countries considered endemic for polio in 2003 were Nigeria, Niger
and Egypt, and the cases in the other countries were related to the ongoing
outbreak in Northern Nigeria.
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml>)
The sobering information from the WER article is the last sentence: " In 4
of these countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire and the Sudan) wild
poliovirus transmission has been re-established (i.e. continued circulation
for >6 months)". These 4 countries had interrupted poliovirus circulation
prior to the re-seeding related to the outbreak in Nigeria.
The above WER article mentions an imported case in Saudi Arabia. As the
date of onset of symptoms was one day following entry into the country, one
hopes that there wasn't extensive contact with other individuals in the
country to establish local circulation of the wild virus. - Mod.MPP]
