A 4 year old girl, of Otis [Lincoln County, Oregon], died [Mon 8 Sep 2014] just 8 days after playing in the front yard with other kids at the start of the Labor Day weekend [30 Aug-1 Sep 2014]. Only one other person in a gathering of family and friends got sick, a 5-year-old boy who is now being treated in a Tacoma hospital for kidney failure. The parents don't know for sure what sickened the 2 children but they suspect food: the pair shared a turkey sandwich at an Otis restaurant that Saturday [30 Aug 2014]. "I know in my heart it's what they ate because everyone else is just fine," said the mother of the boy in the hospital.

Doernbecher released a statement [Tue 9 Sep 2014], saying the girl tested positive for _E. coli_ but that the state public health lab hasn't yet confirmed the strain. Officials from Lincoln County and the Oregon Public Health Division are investigating. Cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7, the likely culprit, are relatively rare in Oregon. Most people recover, though 5 to 10 percent develop a type of kidney failure known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Complications from _E. coli_ O157:H7 have killed 20 people in Oregon since 1992. The last child who died from the strain was in 2010.

The young and old are the most susceptible, said Dr Paul Cieslak, head of infectious disease at the Oregon Public Health Division. "Most deaths are kids under 5 and people over 80," Cieslak said.

In an _E. coli_ investigation, health officials look at exposure to high-risk foods, including undercooked meat, leafy greens, sprouts, raw milk, and unpasteurized cider. Tainted water has also caused outbreaks as have petting zoos.

The 2 children played in [the girl's] yard with other kids and her family's 2 dogs and then shared a turkey sandwich for dinner, the mother of the boy said. No one else ate a turkey sandwich, she added, and that's all the kids had. 2 days later, both complained of abdominal cramps and had low-grade fevers, Sutton said. Then came bloody diarrhea, a telltale sign of _E. coli_ O157:H7.

Last [Wed 3 Sep 2014], the girl's parents took her to the emergency room at the main hospital in Lincoln City. The hospital ran tests, but found nothing and told the family to take her home and keep her hydrated, said an uncle. But her symptoms got worse, he said. On [Sat 6 Sep 2014], her parents took her to the hospital in McMinnville and physicians there had her rushed to Doernbecher, the uncle said. "They put her on dialysis right away," he said, referring to Doernbecher. "She was doing better. She was responding."

Then Sunday afternoon, 7 Sep 2014, she suffered a stroke, he said. An MRI showed she had brain damage, he said. Within 12 hours, doctors pronounced her brain dead.

Health officials said 2 young girls have died and a boy was hospitalized in critical condition in the Pacific Northwest after becoming infected with _E. coli_ in 2 separate incidents. Investigations have been launched into the source and strain of the bacteria that killed a 3-year-old girl in Lynden, [Whatcom County,] Washington, and a 4-year-old girl in Otis, [Lincoln County,] Oregon. A 3rd child, a 5-year-old boy, has also tested positive for _E. coli_ and was being treated at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, Washington, a hospital spokeswoman said.

Medical officials believe the infections [of the 4-year-old girl who died and the 5-year-old boy] likely stemmed from the same source since the children were playing together and shared food at a restaurant in Oregon.

The 3-year-old in Washington, who was not named, had no connection to the Oregon exposures, but it was still unknown if a common food item was involved, officials said. "The thing we are trying to focus on is if there is a single source that we can pinpoint and the public is at risk," said Dr Greg Stern of the Whatcom County Health Department.

Cultures from the Lynden patient were being analyzed by state health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he said.
Medical authorities in Oregon have not yet confirmed what strain or source was involved, said Tim Prudhel, a spokesman for Lincoln County Health and Human Services.

Two of the cases are epidemiologically linked by swimming together and sharing a turkey sandwich from a restaurant. It is possible that the other case is connected by eating something that was part of the turkey sandwich. DNA fingerprinting of the strains can assist in this possible association. If the sandwich was the vehicle for transmission, unless the turkey was cross-contaminated, another part of the sandwich such as lettuce or sprouts may be the source. It is well known that fresh produce such as lettuce, spinach, and sprouts can be vehicles for transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, however, it has rarely if ever been associated with fowl. Doane et al (Doane CA, Pangloli P, Richards HA, et al: Occurrence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in diverse farm environments. J Food Prot 2007; 70(1): 6-10), however, have reported that 7.5 percent of turkeys may carry EHEC but only 0.9 percent of chickens. - Mod.LL]
