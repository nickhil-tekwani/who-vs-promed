Mysterious markings seen on Valley oranges
-----------------------------------------
As the Lower Rio Grande Valley's 1999-2000 citrus season slowly gets under
way with the harvesting of early oranges, reports are trickling in to local
scientists about mysterious markings on some fruit. Drs. Mani Skaria and Vic
French at the Texas A&M-Kingsville Citrus Center at Weslaco say the strange
blemishes started showing up about a month ago, and a few more have been
reported since.
The spots are about half a centimeter large and are yellow to orange in
color, covering up to 30 oil glands on the peel. They are permanent and show
up on only one side of affected fruit. To date, they have been found only on
oranges,but Skaria says grapefruit will probably also be affected.
"The first fruit with these spots that we saw were on N-33 Navel oranges
from the Mission area," said Skaria, "but they've come in from other areas
of the Valley since then. We've even found some in our own citrus research
blocks, and now we've also seen them on Marrs and Everhard oranges."
The taste of the spotted fruit will probably not be a problem, Skaria said,
but fresh fruit consumers may shy away nonetheless because the markings are
so obvious.
"These are unusual symptoms for any type of disease or insect damage we know
about, so it is probably something new," said Skaria, a plant pathologist.
"These symptoms are not described in textbooks we usually refer to."
Suspecting a fungus or bacteria might be involved, Skaria began taking cross
sections of the affected areas. He found no evidence of a disease pathogen
or signs of probing by insects that release toxins that can cause
discoloration. But he did find gumming, an indication that cell walls were
breaking down under stress.
"I have been in contact with a USDA scientist in California who suspects
that drastic weather changes, from extremely dry to very wet, for example,
could be causing these symptoms," said Skaria. "So this could be a
physiological problem, or an insect problem."
Skaria's colleague, entomologist French, has been looking into the
possibility of the culprit being the leaf-footed bug, an insect that can
show up in Valley orchards in any given year.
"A few years ago," French said, "leaf-footed bugs had heavily infested an
orchard in the Hargill area that even caused fruit to drop from the tree.
This insect probes into the fruit and causes gumming, or raised mounds of
gum just underneath the surface, like gum pockets. The affected fruit we've
seen has some of these raised gum mounds, but not all of them do. So at this
point, we're just not sure yet what's causing this."
French said among his many efforts to determine the cause, he is exposing
clean, fresh fruit to leaf-footed bugs to try and duplicate the symptoms.
"There are so many different things that can cause spotting on fruit that it
is sometimes very difficult to determine exactly what is causing it," he
said. "This is the time of year for leaf-footed bugs, so that could be the
problem. And there are also a lot of insects commonly known as green stink
bugs out there that could be causing this."
Skaria and French said they will continue studying the spotting and
encourage growers who see unusual symptoms to report them to the Citrus
Center.
