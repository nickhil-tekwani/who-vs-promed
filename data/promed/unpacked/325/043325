Bluetongue in France in the island of Corsica
----------------------------------------------
(Disease never previously reported)
Emergency report
Translation of a fax received on 31 Oct 2000 from Dr Isabelle Chmitelin,
Head, International Health Coordinating Mission, Ministry of Agriculture
and Fisheries, Paris:
Report date: 31 Oct 2000
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 18 Oct 2000
Epidemiological surveillance:
Taking into account the bluetongue situation in the Mediterranean Basin,
and in particular the proximity of confirmed outbreaks in the north of
Sardinia (Italy), an intensified epidemiological surveillance system has
been in place since 14 September 2000 in both departments of the island of
Corsica (Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud), potentially exposed to the risk of
spread of the disease.
These surveillance measures are aimed at:
- conducting regular clinical controls of sheep flocks;
- identifying species of vector (_Culicoides_ spp) currently present on the
island of Corsica;
- carrying out serological tests on a sample of the susceptible ruminant
population.
A preliminary mission to monitor vectors, conducted by CIRAD-EMVT, detected
the presence of large numbers of _Culicoides imicola_ (major vector of
bluetongue in Africa and recently recorded in Sardinia) in both departments
of the island.
As of 27 Oct 2000, clinical surveillance operations in the sheep flocks
identified as being at risk had covered 193 flocks (of the 713 recorded)
and 39 502 animals (of the 130 600 present in the departments of
Haute-Corse and Corse-du-Sud).
Situation:
On 18 Oct 2000, the Veterinary Services of Corse-du-Sud reported the
presence of 6 animals presenting clinical signs suggestive of bluetongue,
in a flock of 120 sheep in Arbellana district. By 29 Oct 2000, the
Veterinary Services of Corse-du-Sud had reported 24 suspicions involving 7
567 animals of susceptible species, with 334 sick (morbidity of 5.08%) and
272 dead (mortality of 4.14%). Virological tests carried out by AFSSA
(French Food Safety Agency) using PCR did not detect the presence of
bluetongue virus until 27 Oct 2000 in 9 of these outbreaks.
