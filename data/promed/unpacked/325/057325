[According to the report above, a total of 82 985 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, 11 newly confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours (23 May 2020) and no new deaths. All 11 cases are imported cases -- 10 into Inner Mongolia, 1 into Sichuan province.

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau also reported no newly confirmed cases. There has been a total of 1724 imported cases reported, an increase of 11 cases since yesterday (23 May 2020).

There were 40 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported cases, and the remaining 38 cases were locally acquired. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 396, and 28 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

In media reports submitted and translated by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver, there was mention that on 23 May 2020, there were 30 cases of asymptomatic infection identified in Hubei province. A total of 297 symptomatic infected individuals were still under supervision and there were no conversions to symptomatic. (http://www.cneb.gov.cn/2020/05/24/ARTI1590288042230269.shtml). In addition Sichuan province (Bazhong City confirmed an asymptomatic infection in an individual from Hubei (from ThePaper.cn), and Chongqing province (Yuzhong District) also confirmed an asymptomatic infection in an individual from Hubei province (http://henan.163.com/20/0524/14/FDDAPUO504398DMR.html). Interpretation: There is ongoing transmission in Hubei province that if not for extensive testing of individuals coming to other provinces, most likely would have been beneath the radarscope until a major "burst" of clinical cases, including severe cases requiring ICU management. A very "smart" virus that has a stealth mode for rapid transmission that is potentially undetected until it "explodes".

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and then ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 16 cases and one new death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (23 to 24 May 2020) when there were 25 newly confirmed cases and no deaths. A total of 11 206 confirmed cases and 267 deaths were reported today (24 May 2020), up from 11 190 cases and 266 deaths yesterday (23 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 50 consecutive days and below 50 for 43 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 15 days. In today's (24 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 13 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 3 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (6), Daegu (1), Incheon (1), Gyeonggi (4) Gyeongbuk (1). Imported cases were in Gyeonggi (2) and Quarantine (1).

On the English language page, notice 332 of 24 May 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has a pie chart showing the chain of transmission breakdown for the 2 preceding weeks:
Local clusters: 194 (61.4%)
Imported cases: 85 (26.9%),
Under investigation: 21 (6.6%),
Hospitals/nursing homes/etc.: 8 (2.5%),
Contacts of previously confirmed cases: 8 (2.5%)

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus. And the Korean CDC is encouraging no club, bars, or karaoke visits.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 229 858 cases, including 32 785 deaths, up from 229 327 cases and 32 735 deaths reported on 23 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 23 and 24 May 2020 was 531 newly confirmed cases, compared with 669 newly confirmed cases between 22 and 23 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are in a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 73.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 53.7% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 12 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (3 provinces reported no new cases), and another 7 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Liguria was the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but fewer than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of nonessential businesses. It is now 67 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 66 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

Iran on Sunday [24 May 2020] registered 2180 new COVID-19 infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 135 701 since its outbreak [began] in late February [2020]

Meanwhile, 58 new fatalities were confirmed over the past 24 hours, taking the death toll from the coronavirus to 7417, according the health ministry.

Kianush Jahanpur, head of Public Relations and Information Center of the ministry, said a total of 105 801 patients have recovered from the infectious disease, while 2615 are still in critical condition. So far, 800 519 lab tests for COVID-19 have been carried out in Iran, he noted.

[In the 24 hours from 23 to 24 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 133 521 to 135 701 total cases, an increase of 2180 compared with 1869 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (23 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7359 to 7417, an increase of 58 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 11th globally, behind the USA, Brazil, Russia, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, Turkey, and India (Worldometer data as of 24 May 2020 19:31 EDT (GMT-4).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature because daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2- to 3-week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. If there is heavy travel, there may be a significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the coming 2-4 weeks. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 686 436, including 99 300 deaths, an increase from 1 666 828 cases and 98 254 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York State, with 371 193 (22.0%) cumulative case reports and 1720 (7.9%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 195 452 as of 13:15 PM EDT on 24 May 2020, including 16 469 confirmed deaths and an additional 4747 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

With 99 300 cumulative deaths reported today (24 May 2020), and daily newly confirmed deaths exceeding 1000, it is highly likely that the USA will cross the 100 000 threshold tomorrow, on Memorial Day, in the USA.

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2508; 12.8%), California (1951; 10.0%), New York (1537; 7.8%), Massachusetts (1013; 5.2%), Maryland (818; 4.2%), Florida (740; 3.8%), Minnesota (728; 3.7%), Texas (681; 3.5%), New Jersey (671; 3.4%), and Georgia (660; 3.4%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, Florida, and Maryland.

The US military has confirmed 8950 cumulative cases, with 0 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 13 263 cumulative cases and 54 new cases today (24 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 4633 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (199 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 3189 cases (89 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Pennsylvania with 545 newly confirmed cases, North Carolina with 500 newly confirmed cases, Virginia and Ohio with 495 each newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, Indiana with 475 newly confirmed cases, Connecticut with 446 newly confirmed cases, and Wisconsin with 400 newly confirmed cases. A total of 31 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

There were 246 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 361 in the preceding 24-hour period (from 22 to 23 May 2020), bringing the PCR-confirmed cumulative total to 235 772 [285 852] cases as compared with 235 290 [282 370] confirmed cases on 23 May 2020. Total death reports note 28 752 deaths reported as of today (24 May 2020) and 28 678 deaths reported as of 22 May 2020, an increase of 74 deaths in 24 hours. This is an increase from yesterday's (23 May 2020) report.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 14.36, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 14.36 today (24 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd highest case count in Europe and is 4th globally behind the USA, Brazil and Russia in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 235 772 cases, an additional 86 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 3 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
