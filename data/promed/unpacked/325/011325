Floodwaters could be contaminated with a deadly microorganism found in the
urine of infected rats, which can cause an infectious disease called
leptospirosis, the health department said in an advisory.
The National Epidemic Sentinel Surveillance System has recorded 20
leptospirosis cases since January [1999, an almost 200 percent increase
compared to the seven cases reported during the same period last year.
Three of the 20 reported to be afflicted with the disease have died.
These cases represent only those admitted to the San Lazaro Hospital in
Manila. They are mostly male residents of Metro Manila. Majority are from
Tondo, aged 21-30. The youngest patient is 15 years old, and the oldest, 63.
Though the number of cases was higher than last year's, Dr. Lynette
Adorio-Arce said there was no reason for alarm as there was no clustering of
cases in one particular area.
Leptospirosis is an infectious disease of domestic animals, especially
cattle, swine and dogs. The most common source of infection are rats. The
disease is transmitted to humans through contact with the urine of infected
rats, through skin abrasions or wounds. This usually occurs when wading
through or swimming in water that is contaminated with the _Leptospira_
bacteria.
Infection can also occur when contaminated water is splashed into the eyes
or accidentally drunk. The disease can also be transmitted to humans through
ingestion of food contaminated by rat urine.
Leptospirosis is characterized by a sudden onset of fever with pain and
tenderness in the calf. The patient's eyes are bloodshot. An infected person
can also experience a reduction in the amount and frequency of urination,
which would indicate kidney failure.
The symptoms of the disease are manifested 7-10 days after infection.
The health department has advised that if wading in floodwaters cannot be
avoided, people should wear plastic boots and make sure they have no open
wounds in the legs and feet.
