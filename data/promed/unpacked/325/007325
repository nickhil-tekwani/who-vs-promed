[Regarding the role of SV40 virus in tumor development, it is known that
these viruses have a large T antigen which binds with the protein product
of a tumor suppressor gene, p53, and prevents the binding of p53 protein to
its sequence specific DNA. This inactivation of p53 is likely to cause
tumors as the cell cycle control system is lost, and the G1-S phase arrest
seen with DNA damage in normal cells fails to occur. Other oncogenic
viruses like Epstein-Barr virus, [and human papilloma virus are also known
to inactivate the p53 gene in a similar fashion.
