[According to WAHID's archived data, the epidemiological summary of the lumpy skin disease [LSD] epizootic since its start in southern Russia on [Mon 5 Jun 2017] is as follows:

Total outbreaks = 27 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 5857 / 77 / 0 / 1 / 0

Further details and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000024426_20170801_190653.pdf.

All 4 new outbreaks described in the above follow-up report no. 5 are located close to Kazakhstan's north western border. Similarly, earlier LSD in Russia was recorded in the proximity of the Kazakh border.

The mentioned proximity of LSD, an arthropodborne disease, to Kazakhstan, accompanied by recent rumors on suspected case in Kazakhstan's Uralsk oblast, warrant an update on the LSD situation in Kazakhstan (where LSD was recorded in July 2016). - Mod.AS
