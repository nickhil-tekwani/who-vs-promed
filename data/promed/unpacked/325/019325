More wild horses have died at a Bureau of Land Management (BLM) facility in Cañon City, pushing the death toll close to 110 as veterinarians and BLM officials blamed the deaths on a combined hit of influenza and a bacterial infection.

Twelve horses died Friday and Saturday [29 and 30 Apr 2022], bringing the death toll to 106 since 9 horses were found dead in 4 pens at Cañon City on 23 Apr [2022], the BLM and US Department of Agriculture Veterinarian Dr. Albert Kane said in situation reports.

The deaths were initially blamed on pneumonia caused by equine influenza, but subsequent lab tests and necropsies showed the horses also had a bacterial infection, the reports said.

What were initially thought to be neurological signs in the sick horses were later attributed to a lack of oxygen caused by severe pneumonia.

Severe illness has affected mainly horses rounded up last fall [2021] from the rugged West Douglas area, west of the town of Meeker in northwest Colorado, after a wildfire destroyed the horses' forage, they said.

Wild horses held in other areas of the Cañon City facility have shown only mild signs of respiratory illness, the reports said.

Some of the mildly infected horses had been scheduled to go to an adoption event over the weekend, an earlier report said. With the facility placed under quarantine, it was canceled.

There are around 2500 horses at the holding facility, which officially is able to house 3500 horses.

Wild horse advocates, a US lawmaker, and a woman who has adopted wild horses, including from Cañon City, said crowded conditions at the holding facility likely made it easier for a pathogen to spread rapidly.

"These horses are kept in close quarters; if they were not penned, it is entirely possible the pathogen would not have spread nearly as quickly," US Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., said at a hearing held on Capitol Hill and online Wednesday [27 Apr 2022]. The hearing was about preventing pandemics through wildlife-borne disease surveillance.

Holding wild horses in crowded areas made them "scared, stressed, and more vulnerable to illness," said Neda DeMayo, president of Return to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation, or RTF.

"Failing to make the needed changes to stop more wild horses and burros from ending up in overcrowded conditions is negligent and inexcusable," she said.

As of February [2022], the BLM was holding 21 784 wild horses and burros in large corral facilities like Cañon City at a daily cost to taxpayers of USD 6.19 per horse, according to RTF. [This totals USD 134 843 per day. - Mod.TG]

"Holding those same horses on leased or government pastureland would cost taxpayers USD 2.17 per horse, per day," the organization said.

The 1st West Douglas horses to die were either unvaccinated against flu, not fully vaccinated, or had received an influenza booster shot only about 10 days before the outbreak at Cañon City, despite being at the facility for around 9 months, BLM said Friday [29 Apr 2022] in its situation report.

"I think if the horses hadn't been rounded up, they would still be healthy," said Carol Walker, who last year [2021] adopted a horse from the Cañon City facility.

Wild horses have "no natural immunity to diseases affecting domestic horses, such as strangles," a highly contagious disease of the upper respiratory tract, she said.

She also questioned the standards of care at Cañon City, describing it as "terrible" without going into detail. "It doesn't surprise me something may have happened," she said.

Information included in the BLM reports raised "questions about conditions and care for wild horses at the (BLM) corrals," the American Wild Horse Campaign (AWHC) advocacy group said in a statement.

Documents obtained by the AWHC showed the BLM required the Canon City facility to be cleaned only twice a year, the group said in a statement.

The advocacy group also referred the Chieftain to an outbreak investigation report released 26 Apr [2022] in which Kane -- the USDA veterinarian -- said that, prior to his 1st visit, Cañon City was using the same loader to pick up hay for the horses and dispose of carcasses, although he noted different loader heads were used each time, and the equipment was disinfected with bleach between uses.

Responding to a request for comment on the allegations, BLM spokesperson Steven Hall said Sunday [1 May 2022] cleaning has been stepped up during the outbreak. More information could be provided during the workweek, he said.

As the death toll climbed rapidly last week, BLM Colorado Acting Associate State Director Ben Gruber said last week the agency will "review operations at the Cañon City facility to prevent future outbreaks like this from occurring."

"This tragic outcome was influenced by a population of horses that may have been particularly vulnerable given their time in the West Douglas area and their exposure to last year's [2021] wildfire, which prompted their emergency gather," he said.

[This is extremely sad for the horses as well as for all involved. While these horses likely had little immunity to the diseases, crowding and stressing and poor sanitary conditions did not improve the overall situation.

The cost per day is high, and one has to ask why are they not put on federal land? Are there no facilities? Is it not equipped for horses or for human caretakers?

Respiratory diseases will move more quickly through stressed and crowded animals. When the horses are rounded up, they are usually crowded, as it prevents attempts by the horses to jump out, possibly injuring themselves further. However, crowding and stressing when there is a disease, is largely a prescription for disasters such as we are witnessing.

It is sad, as well as surprising, to learn how infrequent the pen areas were being cleaned. Keeping the animals in filthy conditions only contributes to stress and disease spread. - Mod.TG
