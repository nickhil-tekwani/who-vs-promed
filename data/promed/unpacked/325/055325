[The epidemic situation for anthrax in humans and animals has
worsened in Kyrgyzstan over the last years. There were 17 human cases
in 2006, 23 in 2007, and [so far] 21 this year (2008). Since 1918
more than 1000 cases of animal anthrax have been registered in
Kyrgyzstan. There is a problem in proper surveillance of anthrax in
Kyrgyzstan; the places of animal burial were not registered, instead
local people were trying to remember infected areas. - Corr.BA

To date they have now had outbreaks in the following districts of
Jalal-Abad: Ala-Buka, Aravan, Nooken, and Suzak.
