Abstract
Background
_Mansonella perstans_ infection can be considered one of the most neglected tropical infectious diseases. Very few studies have reported on the clinical picture caused by infection with this nematode. Therefore, our study was aimed to describe the clinical patterns and treatment of imported _M. perstans_ infection by migrants from Africa.

Methods
The present study evaluated a large cohort of migrants who have been diagnosed, examined and treated for imported _M. perstans_ infection at a Spanish reference center (Hospital Carlos III Tropical Medicine Unit, Madrid, Spain) over a 19-year period. Most patients voluntarily attend the emergency unit or are referred from primary care or general hospitals in Madrid. Chi-square test was used to compare the association between categorical variables. The continuous variables were compared by Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test. The corresponding regression models were used for multivariate analysis.

Results
503 cases of migrants from tropical and subtropical areas with _M. perstans_ infection were identified. 264 patients were female (52.5%). The mean age (plus-minus SD) was 44.6 plus-minus 18.2 years (range: 16-93 years). The mean time (plus-minus SD) between the arrival in Spain and the 1st consultation was 8.6 plus-minus 18.0 months. The major origin of the patients was Equatorial Guinea (97.6%). Regarding the clinical picture, 257 patients were asymptomatic (54.7%) and 228 were symptomatic (45.3%); 190 patients had pruritus (37.8%), 50 (9.9%) had arthralgia, 18 patients had Calabar-like swelling (3.6%), and 15 (3%) had abdominal pain. 442 (87.9%) migrants had hyper-IgE, and 340 (67.6%) had eosinophilia. 195 patients had coinfections with other filarial nematodes (38.8%), and 308 migrants had only _M. perstans_ infection (61.2%). 437 cases (86.9%) had been treated with anti-filarial drugs; 292 cases were treated with one anti-filarial drug, and 145 cases were treated with combined anti-filarial therapy. Additionally, 20 (4%) cases received steroids and 38 (7.6%) cases received antihistamines.

Conclusions
A long series of _M. perstans_ infections is presented in sub-Saharan immigrants whose data indicate that it should be included in the differential diagnosis in patients with pruritus or analytical alterations such as eosinophilia or hyper-IgE presentation, and they also have a high number of coinfections with other microorganisms whose treatment needs to be protocolized.

[Three species of _Mansonella_, a vector-borne filarial nematode genus, are associated with human infections: _M. ozzardi_, and _M. perstans_ (_Dipetalonema perstans_), and _M. streptocerca_ (_Dipetalonema streptocerca_) (https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/mansonellosis/index.html). The nematode is transmitted by midges (genus _Culicoides_) or blackflies (genus _Simulium_).

_Mansonella perstans_ is endemic throughout West, East, and Central Africa, and is also highly prevalent in some neotropical regions of Central and South America, where it was likely introduced. There are more than 800 midge species worldwide from the tropics to the arctic. Only a few species have been implicated in the transmission of _Mansonella_ and only in tropical areas. Blackflies are also found worldwide but are only involved in transmission to humans of _Onchocerca volvulus_ and _Mansonella ozzardi_, both entirely in tropical areas.

Thus, the risk of local transmission in Spain is probably very low if at all possible due to the climate even if local midge or blackfly populations should exist. - Mod.EP
