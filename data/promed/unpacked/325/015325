The Ministry of Health (MINSA) detected and isolated 2 confirmed cases of a hantavirus infection in the Santa Rosa Hospital in Lima, whose infection was acquired during a tourism visit to Loreto department, reported the Chief of the National Institute of Health (INS), Cesar Cabezas today [26 Jan 2014].

This official indicated that, in addition, they knew of a 3rd probable case of this disease who is admitted at the intensive care unit of the Cuzco Regional Hospital.

He stated that the 3 patients participated in a tourism trip as part of a group of 8 people to the city of Iquitos, including a guided visit to the Amazonian region of the Mamon River in the Punchana district of Maynas province.

The route of this tourist circuit included a 2-night stay in a hostel that consisted of 24 "bungalow" rooms with wood walls and a thatched straw roof.

Cabezas explained that the patients are a 28-year-old male and a 25-year-old woman who are receiving specialized medical attention in the Pueblo Libre hospital, where they received a positive diagnosis of the disease. The 3rd case is a 26-year-old male who is interned in the Cuzco Regional Hospital as a probable case.

Given the occurrence of these cases, MIBSA assembled a national team (from the headquarters of Epidemiology and Human Health, as well as INS) to investigate this event in coordination with the technical teams of the Lima City DISA [Health Directorate], Loreto and Cuzco Regional Office of Health (DIRESA) [Regional Ministerial Health Directorate], and hospitals.

Also, an active search for cases who were in contact with the hospitalized patients was carried out, as well as surveillance for acute febrile syndromes that was done in hospitals in Lima, he stated.

In the Santa Rosa Hospital as well as in the Regional Hospital, a plan for control of infections for treatment of the cases was recommended, he said.

The INS chief explained that the hantavirus is present in wild rodents that are chronically infected. These viruses are excreted in urine and feces of these animals and when desiccated can form [virus-containing] aerosols (dust) that when inhaled by people can cause an infection.

He said that the 1st hantavirus [infection] cases were reported in Peru in 2011 (4 cases) in Loreto. In 2012 and 2013, 2 confirmed cases were reported. The occurrence of confirmed clinical cases to date are limited to the Loreto department.

Concerning the disease, he mentioned that the hantavirus reservoirs principally consist of (wild) field rodents, and humans are accidental hosts. Transmission is principally by contact with rodent excreta.

Cabezas recommended that one not enter closed environments that could be contaminated by rodent excreta. "Before [entering], one must clean with a damp mop, preferably with bleach, to avoid the creation of aerosols. Also, one must not leave leftover food near areas where people spend the night, because that can attract rodents," he said. "If a person has visited rural areas and later has clinical manifestations such as fever, general malaise, respiratory difficulty, among others, that person must go immediately to a health facility for a diagnosis and timely treatment. The person must not self-medicate," he stated.

[Diagnosed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Peru are relatively rare. The hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified. A hantavirus that causes HPS (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that is found in the Amazon basin is Araraquara, and its rodent host is the bolo mouse (_Necromys (Bolomys) benefactus_).
