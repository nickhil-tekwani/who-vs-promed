Rift Valley Province: Undiagnosed disease kills goats
-----------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of goats have died in Keiyo District following an outbreak of a
strange disease in the area.
According to livestock farmers led by the local county council chairman,
Mr Julius Chepkiyeng, the disease kills the animals within 10 hours of
infection [presumed to mean within 10 hours of exhibiting symptoms. - Mod.ES]
"Infected goats cough uncontrollably before succumbing to the disease
within 10 hours," Chepkiyeng said in Iten town.
The area deputy District Veterinary Officer, Dr Richard Kirui, confirmed
the outbreak of the disease and described its effects as devastating.
"We have carried out preliminary tests and established the disease is
linked to the contagious caprine pleuropneumonia. However, more tests
are to be carried out," he said.

[There are not enough clinical signs or tests to know what is really
happening. However, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a
_Mycoplasma _ biotype F38, which causes a highly contagious, lethal
disease in goats. It appears to be transmitted by infective aerosol.
Morbidity can be 100 percent and mortality 60 to 100 percent. CCPP
presents with a cough, weakness, anorexic and a nasal discharge
accompanied by an elevation in temperature.
It will be interesting to know what is happening as this could still be a
new or related biotype. - Mod.TG]
