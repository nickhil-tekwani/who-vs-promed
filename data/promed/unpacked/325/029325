The recent case [of meningococcal disease] involving a Colorado State
University student is connected to the other cases in Larimer County,
as health department officials suspected.

"The bacteria that caused invasive meningococcal disease in a CSU
student in early December 2010 match the organisms that caused other
cases in Northern Colorado over the last 8 months," the health
department announced Thursday [23 Dec 2010]. "The Colorado Department
of Public Health and Environment's lab has confirmed that the
bacteria that caused the recent infection were Group C meningococcal
bacteria (also called _Neisseria meningitidis_, serogroup C). In
addition, special molecular "fingerprinting" tests (called PFGE
[pulsed field gel electrophoresis] tests) allowed them to confirm 8
of these cases were caused by identical strains."

Four of the 8 cases reported in Larimer County since May 2010 have been fatal.

The most recent case was a CSU student who was hospitalized in early
December 2010 with a meningococcal disease. He was released from
Poudre Valley Hospital about a week later and is believed to be doing
well at his parents' home out of state.

The linked cases include illnesses that killed a Metro State College
[student] in April 2010; caused a disabling case of meningitis in a
CSU student in May 2010; led to 3 fatal meningococcal cases among 3
Fort Collins hockey players in June 2010; caused a less severe case
in a hockey player's child in August 2010; and killed a CSU student
in October 2010.

"We have looked at a number of connections between all the cases,"
said Dr. Adrienne LeBailly, director of the Larimer County Health
Department. "We know that for each case of meningococcal infection,
there are likely numerous symptom-free carriers of the outbreak
strain who never become ill but who can transmit the bacteria to
others, most of whom will also never become ill. This makes it
impossible to confirm exactly how the bacteria were transmitted
between individual cases."

Meningococcal vaccines provide protection against 4 meningococcal
groups (Serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135), health officials said.

Although the effectiveness of the vaccine is high for the 1st couple
of years, protection wanes quickly and is largely gone by 5 years
after vaccination. For this reason, CSU students were advised to be
revaccinated if it had been 3 or more years since they had received
the vaccine.

The signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease can include high
fever, headache, severe body aches, vomiting, disorientation, and a
characteristic skin rash, among others.

Meningococcal bacteria commonly cause meningitis -- an inflammation
of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord -- and
septicemia, or sepsis, an infection in the bloodstream.

Six of the 8 Larimer County meningococcal cases have been sepsis,
which generally has a higher fatality rate. All the 4 fatal cases in
Larimer County have been from meningococcal sepsis, rather than
meningococcal meningitis.

[The above news release adds 3 cases to the 5 previously reported in
a ProMED-mail post concerning a northern Colorado outbreak of
meningococcal disease due to a genetically identical strain of
_Neisseria meningitidis_ (Meningitis, meningococcal - USA: (CO) fatal
20100625.2115). Three cases involved students at Colorado State
University (CSU), which is located in the city of Fort Collins (the
county seat of Larimer County), and 4 cases were associated with a
Fort Collins hockey team. An 8th case apparently was a student at
Metro State College, which is located in the city of Denver, about 60
miles south of Fort Collins
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Collins,_Colorado>).

_N. meningitidis_ causes bacterial meningitis and sepsis and is
transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory
secretions, mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the
microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 percent of the
population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the
carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and
prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing and coughing on someone,
living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits,
students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc.) facilitates the
spread of the microorganism. The average incubation period for
meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>).

Each year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal
disease. The annual incidence generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.1 cases
per 100 000. The incidence peaks in late winter and early spring.
Most cases are sporadic; less than 2 percent occur in outbreaks
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>; updated at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a3.htm>). Outbreaks
tend to occur in semi-closed communities, such military recruit
camps, college dormitories, schools, and day-care centers.
Community-based outbreaks in towns, cities, and counties may also
occur among persons who are not close contacts of each other and who
do not share a common affiliation.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease in either an organization or
community is defined as the occurrence of 3 or more confirmed or
probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3 months,
resulting in a primary disease attack rate in the population at risk
(such as the hockey team in the outbreak in the news release above)
of at least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is about 10 times
greater than the normal occurrence
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>).

Chemoprophylaxis is given to close contacts whose risk for acquiring
meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than the general
population (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>).
Close contacts of patients are household members, day-care center
contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions.

Routine vaccination of college freshman, particularly those living in
dormitories, has been recommended for primary prophylaxis of
meningococcal disease (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/rr/rr5407.pdf>).
In an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the
meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the
outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5407.pdf>). Because available
vaccines are not effective against _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B,
vaccination is not considered during serogroup B outbreaks.

The northern Colorado outbreak is reported to be due to serogroup C.
A quadrivalent A, C, Y, and W135 meningococcal conjugate vaccine was
licensed in the United States in January 2005. The conjugate vaccine
induces a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune
response, providing long-lasting immunity and preventing
nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and thus reducing
bacterial transmission of this microorganism
(<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>).
