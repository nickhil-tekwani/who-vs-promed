a. Influenza A(H1N1) - update 11 -- 3 May 2009

As of 0600 GMT, 3 May 2009, 17 countries have officially reported 787
cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection.

Mexico has reported 506 confirmed human cases of infection, including
19 deaths. The higher number of cases from Mexico in the past 48
hours reflects ongoing testing of previously collected specimens. The
United States Government has reported 160 laboratory confirmed human
cases, including one death.

The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with
no deaths - Austria (1), Canada (70), China, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (1), Costa Rica (1), Denmark (1), France (2),
Germany (6), Ireland (1), Israel (3), Netherlands (1), New Zealand
(4), Republic of Korea (1), Spain (13), Switzerland (1) and the
United Kingdom (15).

Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO
website on a regular basis.

WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders.
It is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay
international travel and for people developing symptoms following
international travel to seek medical attention, in line with guidance
from national authorities.

Canada on [2 May 2009] reported the identification of the A(H1N1)
virus in a swine herd in Alberta. It is highly probable that the pigs
were exposed to the virus from a Canadian farm worker recently
returned from Mexico, who had exhibited flu-like symptoms and had
contact with the pigs. There is no indication of virus adaptation
through transfer from human to pigs at this time.

There is no risk of infection from this virus from consumption of
well-cooked pork and pork products.

Individuals are advised to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water
on a regular basis and should seek medical attention if they develop
any symptoms of influenza-like illness.

Influenza A(H1N1) - update 12 -- 3 May 2009

cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection.

Mexico has reported 506 confirmed human cases of infection, including
19 deaths. The higher number of cases from Mexico in the past 48
hours reflects ongoing testing of previously collected specimens. The
United States Government has reported 226 laboratory confirmed human
cases, including one death.

The following countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases with
no deaths - Austria (1), Canada (85), China, Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (1), Costa Rica (1), Denmark (1), France (2),
Germany (8), Ireland (1), Israel (3), Italy (1), Netherlands (1), New
Zealand (4), Republic of Korea (1), Spain (40), Switzerland (1) and
the United Kingdom (15).

Further information on the situation will be available on the WHO
website on a regular basis.

WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or closure of borders.It
is considered prudent for people who are ill to delay international
travel and for people developing symptoms following international

Update Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (3 May 2009) Vol. 6, No. 19
--------------
On [3 May 2009], two countries in the Region with confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1) were added: Colombia and El Salvador. To date, the
recorded total of confirmed cases is 821, affecting 6 countries of
the Americas (Mexico, United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia and
El Salvador).

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 226 human cases
of influenza A (H1N1): 1 in Alabama, 18 in Arizona, 26 in California,
4 in Colorado, 2 in Connecticut, 10 in Delaware, 3 in Florida, 3 in
Illinois, 3 in Indiana, 1 in Iowa, 2 in Kansas, 1 in Kentucky, 7 in
Massachusetts, 2 in Michigan, 1 in Minnesota, 1 in Missouri, 1 in
Nebraska, 1 in Nevada, 1 in New Hampshire, 7 in New Jersey, 1 in New
Mexico, 63 in New York, 1 in Ohio, 1 in Rhode Island, 15 in Carolina
del Sur, 1 in Tennessee, 40 in Texas, 1 in Utah, 3 in Virginia and 3
in Wisconsin. Other suspected cases are being investigated. One death
has been registered, a child of 22 months old. The age range of the
confirmed cases is from 22 months to 81 years.

From 17 Apr 2009 to 2 May 2009, Mexico has reported 506 confirmed
cases of influenza A (H1N1), including 19 deaths. The considerable
variation in the number of confirmed cases as of today is due to the
recent laboratory confirmation of samples collected in previous
weeks. The states with the highest number of confirmed cases are
Distrito Federal, Estado de Mexico y San Luis Potosi. . The majority
of these have occurred in previously healthy young adult people.
There have been few cases in individuals under 3 or over 59 years old.

In Canada, to date 85 human cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been
confirmed (15 in Alberta, 22 in British Columbia, 1 in New Brunswick,
31 in Nova Scotia, 2 in Quebec and 14 in Ontario) some of them with
recent trip history to Cancun, Mexico. All the cases developed a mild
form of influenza like illness. 2 of the cases presented, in
addition, gastrointestinal symptoms. All of them are currently
recovered and none required hospitalization. Laboratory tests were
conducted in Winnipeg, Canada. Indigenous transmission is not
discarded since not all the confirmed cases have trip history to
Mexico

On 2 May 2009, Costa Rica notified 1 confirmed case of influenza A
(H1N1) On 3 May 2009, Colombia reported 1 confirmed case of influenza
A (H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed cases of influenza A
(H1N1).

The press has reported information on suspected cases in several
countries of the Region; however this information has not been
confirmed.

Human to human transmission, Germany

Update, 3 May 2009
In addition to the 2 human-to-human transmissions in Bavaria, the
infection of a couple in Frankfurt/Oder in Brandenburg has been
confirmed to be A/H1N1. The couple was infected on a flight from
Mexico likely by the confirmed case in Hamburg.

There are now 8 confirmed cases of A/H1N1, 4 of which have
human-to-human transmission.

Another 20 cases are pending testing at the moment.

[Below are links to newswires with information on suspected cases (or
confirmed) in countries, and other events of potential interest. The
newswires are full of reports of suspected cases in many countries.
Reports have been filtered and discarded as more information becomes
available during the day. - Mod.MPP]

Americas:
USA - North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Louisiana have
confirmed cases bringing the total number of affected states to 34,
with a total of 245 cases.
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/SwineFlu/story?id=7491426&page=1

[To summarize the current situation, as of 3 May 2009 there have been
a total of 898 cases and 20 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection
officially reported to WHO coming from 15 countries, up from 658
confirmed cases and 17deaths from 15 countries yesterday (2 May
2009). (According to the PAHO daily update, cases have been reported
from an additional 2 countries not included in the WHO update --
Colombia and El Salvador, most likely officially reported temporally
after the WHO daily update was complete -- a function of the 6 hour
time zone difference between WHO HQ [GMT] and PAHO HQ [GMT -4]).

The USA has officially reported 226 laboratory confirmed cases and
one death coming from 30 states (compared with 160 cases from 21
states on 2 May 2009), and one death in a Mexican child visiting in
the USA. Canada has reported 101 cases from 7 provinces with no
deaths, up from 70 cases from 6 provinces on 2 May 2009. Mexico has
reported 506 confirmed cases with 19 deaths (compared with 443 cases
and 16 deaths on 2 May 2009). According to newswires there are 5
additional states in the USA that have confirmed cases since the
daily update was released [the USA daily update is as of 11 AM GMT
-4) -- North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Louisiana and Oregon.

Of interest, 48 percent of confirmed cases in Mexico are less than 20
years of age and 43 percent of cases are 20-49 years of age.
Comparing the age distribution of cases with the general age
distribution of the population in Mexico (based on 2005 census data),
it appears as though there the less than 20 year old population is
slightly over-represented proportionally and the 20-49 year old age
group is appropriately represented (43 percent of cases, and 43
percent of the population).

For a map of reported confirmed cases in the Americas, see
<http://new.paho.org/hq/swine_files/map.htm> - Mod.MPP]

[As in the US, the elderly in Mexico appear to be underrepresented
among cases, in contrast to seasonal influenza. It is not clear if
there is an epidemiologic or immunologic explanation for this. -
