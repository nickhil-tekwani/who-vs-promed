An _E. coli_ outbreak has sickened at least a dozen people in Ohio
and Michigan, including several students at Ohio State University and
the University of Michigan.

Health officials in both communities are running tests on samples
from 20 others and say they haven't identified a source of the
illness, which is often spread by contaminated ground beef or
produce, particularly leafy greens. The cases are considered to be
connected because lab tests revealed they're all of a less-commonly
recognized type of _E. coli_ and several have matching genetic fingerprints.

Investigators are surveying ill individuals to see what they have in
common, including what they've eaten. Several of the sickened Ann
Arbor residents ate at some of the same places and those were being
considered possible sources, said Susan R Cerniglia, spokeswoman for
Washtenaw County Public Health. Some food samples also were sent to
the state lab in Michigan, she said. In light of the newly-connected
Columbus cases, "now it's looking more like something broader, like a
food-distribution issue," Cerniglia said. She said there is no
indication at this point that anyone was sickened while traveling to
another city.

Columbus Public Health has identified 5 cases of _E. coli_ infection,
some of them in Ohio State University students, and is looking into 6
others that might be connected, said Dr Mysheika LeMaile-Williams,
the city's medical director. All are young adults who were sickened
starting in mid-April 2010, she said.

In Michigan, health officials have confirmed 7 cases in the Ann Arbor
area and are looking at 14 others. Everyone in that investigation
became ill between 9-15 Apr 2010, Cerniglia said.

Some people in both areas were hospitalized, but none has developed
hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS], a potential complication that
destroys red blood cells and can cause kidney failure and death,
health officials said.

The organism implicated in this outbreak is not _E. coli_ 0157:H7,
which is most commonly linked to food-borne illness, LeMaile-Williams
said. Instead, it's from a category broadly referred to as _E. coli_
non-0157. All types sicken people in the same way, she said. The
primary symptoms are bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps.

So far, the state lab has determined that 2 of the cases have genetic
fingerprints that match the outbreak in Michigan, LeMaile-Williams said.

[Without a history of travel between the 2 clusters, the common
factor is likely to be a food. ProMED-mail awaits the information
regarding what O antigen was found and the identification of the
common vehicle(s).

This outbreak once again underscores the relevance of non-O157
strains of verotoxin-producing _E. coli_. Other _E. coli_ serogroups
that have been associated with VTEC (verotoxin-producing _E. coli_)
disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and
non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can
be obtained from sheep and cattle and, although they cause as many as
30 percent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or
at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro
assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of
non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own
lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from
O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26,
O111, O128, and O103 (6), the former serotype being the implicated
strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme
immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4
strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody
stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom
duration. Five (18 percent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate
performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with
a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and
most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to
non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will
become over time is unclear.

Because of the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in VTEC
infections treated with antimicrobials (9), antimicrobials should not
used for known acute cases.
