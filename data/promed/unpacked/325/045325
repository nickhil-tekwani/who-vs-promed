Brazil: rabies death toll rises to 22 in Para State
---------------------------------------------------
A 58 year old man died of rabies in the University Hospital Joao de Barros
Barreto yesterday [19 May 2004], bringing to 22 the total number of rabies
deaths in Para state. 10 cases were laboratory-confirmed; the others were
clinically and epidemiologically compatible with the diagnosis of rabies.
16 were from Portel, Marajo Island; yesterday's case was the 6th from
Curupati, in Viseu township.
Six other patients were admitted to the same hospital with suspected
rabies, but have recovered. Doctors consider that they developed
psychosomatic symptoms resembling rabies after learning of the diagnosis in
relatives or neighbors.
