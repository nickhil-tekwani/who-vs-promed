DRC: Cholera Outbreak in Mbuji-Mayi "Alarming", Says Red Cross Federation
------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of cholera in Mbuji-Mayi in the province of Kasai-Oriental in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) "remains alarming", and the disease
continues to spread, according to the International Federation of the Red
Cross. A Federation update said 202 deaths had been reported since the
disease broke out in September 2002. Several hundred people in Mbuji-Mayi
town and the villages of Bakamba, Bakamaleka, Kambanga, and Tshilunde are
affected.
The population of Kasai-Oriental Province is about 4.2 million. The
Federation said most of those affected by the epidemic were residents of
the densely populated (over 1 million) mining city of Mbuji-Mayi.
The update quoted official sources as saying that some 3139 people had been
hospitalized between September 2002 and January 2003. According to
Federation, the highest numbers of cases were reported from the cholera
treatment centres of Dibindi (938 cases), Miabi (530 cases), Kansele (456
cases), Tshilengu√© (433 cases), and Bipemba (425 cases).
"The total number of cases and deaths may still be unknown because of lack
of access, nonexistent communications, and cultural norms; the epidemic may
therefore be affecting a greater number of people than formally recorded,"
the Federation said.
The Federation launched an appeal in November 2002 for support in combating
the disease, "but has received slow response, with about a third of the
required amount confirmed so far, thanks to contributions from the Swedish
and Finnish Red Cross. The outstanding needs remain high and is affecting
the implementation of planned activities such as construction of latrines,
sensitisation activities in sanitation, disaster risk mapping, water
collection activities, and the refurbishment of the Red Cross office and 2
local branches of Kasai-Oriental are not yet able to be carried out".

Cholera Epidemic Feared to Worsen
--------------------
The Mozambican health authorities fear a further spread of the cholera
epidemic that is now affecting 7 of the country's 11 provinces, including
Maputo city, as a result of the current rains, added to the poor sanitation
conditions, particularly in urban areas, reports Thursday's issue of the
daily paper "Noticias".
To face this threat, the health authorities have pledged to redouble their
efforts in educating the public on how to avoid the disease. But health
officials stress that, if cholera is to be prevented, the task should not
be left to the health services alone, but should involve other entities,
such as the municipal authorities and the water supply bodies, which should
cooperate in their specific areas.
The cholera epidemic has claimed about 40 lives countrywide since September
2002, when the first case in this outbreak was reported. The affected
provinces are Cabo Delgado, Nampula, and Niassa in the north, Manica and
Sofala in the center, and Maputo city and province in the south.
Maputo city health director Olivia Ferreira said that 70 patients are at
the moment hospitalised in the wards of the Cholera Treatment Centre, at
the Mavalane General Hospital. She explained that this centre is to serve
not only the Maputo city population, but also the neighbouring city of
Matola, where cases have been diagnosed from the suburbs of Machava,
Infulene, and Liberdade.
As for Maputo city, the most affected suburbs are Hulene, Chamanculo,
Mafalala, Aeroporto, and Jorge Dimitrov, where poor sanitary conditions are
coupled with defective water supply.
To deal with cholera cases, special wards have been set up in other
provinces, and activists are being trained for civic education against the
disease. The health authorities say that they are ready, in terms of
medicine and preventive actions, to face an eventual worsening of the
situation.

Cholera Death Toll Stands At 33
-----------------------------------
Cholera has claimed 33 lives in Mozambique since the first case of the
present outbreak was diagnosed in the northern province of Niassa in Sep
2002, reports Monday 17 Feb 2003 issue of the Maputo daily "Noticias".
The outbreak is now affecting 5 provinces, namely Niassa, Cabo Delgado, and
Nampula in the northern region, and Sofala and Manica in the center. Of
these, Sofala is the worst hit, with 715 cases diagnosed.
10 of the patients died, all in the districts of Maringue and Chemba. The
health authorities in Beira, the provincial capital, are now complaining of
shortage of staff for civic education campaigns in most of the city's
suburbs, where the situation is causing serious concern because of the
continuous degradation of the sanitation conditions. Caia district is
another part of Sofala that has been seriously affected by the disease,
with a total of 197 cases reported.
In Niassa, where the health authorities have reported, so far, 539 cases
with 16 deaths, the most affected areas are Lichinga, the provincial
capital, the town of Cuamba, and Lago district. In Cuamba, health
authorities told reporters that the number of cases is gradually dropping,
following regularization of the water supply.
As for Nampula, the disease has spread to the district of Erati, with 30
patients admitted to the local rural hospital during the first 3 days.
Previously, cholera cases had been notified in the districts of
Nacala-Porto, Nacala-a-Velha, and Memba, all blamed on the heavy rainfall
in the northern region of the country.
Health authorities are also paying special attention to the situation in
Zambezia and Maputo provinces, where there has been a growing number of
cases of acute diarrhoeas, raising fears of a cholera outbreak at any time.
The chief doctor for Maputo city, Nidia Remane, urged local communities to
get involved in awareness campaigns and civic education to prevent the
disease. "We have our attention on the situation, and we have reopened the
Cholera Treatment Center in Mavalane General Hospital, where we are sending
all cases of acute diarrheas. But we still think that cooperation from the
communities will be very necessary, because it is there where basic care
should be enforced", said Remane.

Cholera epidemic continues to ravage Rumonge
----------------------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic in Burundi's Rumonge District, Bururi Province, peaked
on Tuesday with 57 people hospitalized, according to the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
In a situation report for 17-23 Feb 2003, OCHA said 5 cholera-related
deaths had been recorded in the week under review. "A medical team from
Kamenge University Hospital took 5 samples for tests on 18 Feb 2003," the
report said.
According to OCHA, Medicins sans Frontiers-Holland undertook an evaluation
mission on 20 Feb 2003. "The International Rescue Committee [IRC] continues
to provide clean water and disinfectant powder to Rumonge hospital, clean
water to affected neighborhoods, and distribute soap and water-treatment
tablets," OCHA said, adding that the IRC had also begun spraying
neighborhoods and schools with disinfectant.
The health ministry officially declared the existence of a cholera epidemic
in Rumonge on 13 Feb 2003, following reports by humanitarian organizations
that 25 cases had been recorded in the district. The organisations blamed
the lack of safe drinking water for the outbreak in Rumonge. Rumonge has
recorded an increase in cholera cases since the late 1990s, with a team
from Medecins sans Frontieres and the World Health Organisation reporting
that from 24 May to 5 Jun 1999, a total of 89 cases with 6 deaths had occurred.

Cholera Outbreak Claims 14 Victims
---------------------------
Hundreds of villagers in the Tsomo, Cofimvaba areas of the Eastern Cape
have been struck by waterborne disease for the first time. An 11-year-old
girl is among scores of villagers from Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape who
were admitted to the Qhumanco clinic after contracting cholera. So far, 14
people have died of the disease. More than 800 people in the Oliver Tambo
and Chris Hani districts of the former Transkei have been treated for cholera.
This week a government delegation flew into the cholera-stricken area to
assess the situation and support the villagers. The delegation included
Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Ronnie Kasrils, Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, Public Works Minister Stella Sigcawu, Sports and
Recreation Minister Ngconde Balfour, and three Eastern-Cape MECs.
In a statement, Kasrils said his department, the Health Department, and
local authorities had established a joint task force to coordinate the
government's response to the outbreak. His department has provided bleach
for water purification and pledged R350 000 for an emergency water
sanitation programme, he said.
Kasrils said he would meet the district mayors of Chris Hani and Oliver
Tambo about how to improve the area's water supply. "We can only respond
to the priorities that are set by the local government and the Eastern Cape
provincial government ."
Kasrils said 6 million rural people in South Africa were still waiting for
clean water.
"These are only temporary measures. We want to put in place a permanent
water supply system here and in other similar areas to stamp out this
problem once and for all," he said.
The Health Department has provided R300 000 for emergency medical and
toilet facilities. It has also provided more than 10 bakkies to ferry
mobile toilets, water, and bleach to households.
The Tsomo and Cofimvaba clinics were notified that there was a massive
cholera outbreak in the area by the All Saints Hospital last Friday, said
area health manager, Nomonde Mbana.
She said: "They told us that they had already admitted more than 5 people
from the Qhumanco area with cholera. We visited their homes and found more
than 14 people seriously sick. We then undertook a house-to-house search
for more victims and discovered that there were many more people in the
area lying sick with similar symptoms."
More than 100 people suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting were admitted
for treatment last Friday and by the next day, the numbers had soared .
Johnny Douglas, task team head and director of health and social services
in the Chris Hani district municipality said: "We are baffled by the origin
of the bacteria. This is the first time in the history of this area that we
have cholera."
