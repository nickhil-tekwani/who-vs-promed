Nasal Spray Recalled
-----------------------
A nasal spray decongestant sold nationally is under recall because
officials have found it was contaminated with harmful bacteria, the
manufacturer said Friday.
Propharma Inc., based in Miami, issued the recall of 39 540 bottles of
Major Twice-A-Day 12 Hour Nasal Spray after a hospital in Colorado reported
infections and found [bacteria], _Burkholderia cepacia_, in the product. A
Food and Drug Administration analysis later confirmed it after finding the
[bacteria] in unopened bottles from the lot.
_B. cepacia_ can cause potentially life-threatening infections in persons
with compromised immune systems and individuals with cystic fibrosis. The
manufacturer said the only reports of infections were from the Colorado
hospital.
The recalled bottles are marked with the lot number K4496, Exp. 10/06, and
were distributed by Major Pharmaceuticals of Livonia, Mich. Bottles with
other lot numbers aren't affected by the recall.
Consumers can return the product to the place of purchase for a refund.
Those with questions can call a complaint line at Major Pharmaceuticals:
(734)743-6181.

[_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus,
formerly classified as _Pseudomonas_. Unlike _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _B.
cepacia_ is an organism of low virulence with limited ability to cause
infection in humans.
_B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments,
where it may persist for long periods even in distilled water and certain
antiseptic solutions such as the quaternary ammonium salts. It is often
susceptible to trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, cefepime, meropenem, or
imipenem, and has varying susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
The manifestations of the infections mentioned in the posting are not
characterized. More information about the specific infections would be
useful. The bacillus is generally a colonizer of the mucosal surfaces of
healthy individuals if introduced in the hospital setting from a
contaminated aqueous solution but may cause overt infection in compromised
hosts. Pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis-affected individuals is well
recognized. - Mod.LL]
