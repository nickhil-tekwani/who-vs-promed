[It has now been 22 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 8 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (25 Apr 2020) report, there were 5 new locally transmitted infections in Heilongjiang and 1 in Guangdong. With an additional 5 imported cases, the total number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours is 11. It has now been 32 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 20 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing, with no newly confirmed cases reported today [25 Apr 2020].

According to the report above, a total of 82 827 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 11 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (24 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, 2 cases were reported today [25 Apr 2020]. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 29 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 4 were in imported cases. There was one conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 983, and 150 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

From the English language outbreak report page of 25 Apr 2020 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030:

- As of 0:00, 26 Apr 2020, the total number of confirmed cases is 10 728 (including 1037 imported cases), of which 8717 cases have been discharged from isolation. Newly confirmed cases are 10 in total.
- Epidemiological links have been found for 80.8% of the total cases; 9.6% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 3.
- The case confirmed on 23 Apr 2020 in Daegu had visited Busan from 17 to 18 Apr 2020. Contact tracing from the restaurants and accommodations the case visited is complete. Further epidemiological investigation and contact tracing on around 480 people, who had visited the same night clubs and bars as the case, are currently underway.
- As of 0:00, 26 Apr 2020, retested-positive (or re-positive) cases are 263 in total. Viral culture tests on these cases are currently on-going, which normally takes 2 weeks at maximum. No virus was cultured from the initial 6 samples; 59 other samples are undergoing the test. Furthermore, contact tracing on these re-positive cases is also underway to identify possibility of secondary infection. No new case has yet been confirmed that resulted from exposure to the re-positive cases (during the period in which they were re-positive). The contacts are still under monitoring.
- Even though the number of new confirmed cases has been small lately, loosened social distancing could result in increase of contacts, which in turn leads to a rapid surge of confirmed cases. Nightlife entertainment venues are recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible. Such venues that remain operating must comply with infection prevention/control measures including checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms and disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly. People in their 20s should be more cautious about infection, considering that they show the highest number (27.4%, n = 2940) of confirmed cases and they are actively engaged with social life.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 195 351 cases, including 26 384 deaths, up from 192 994 cases and 25 969 deaths reported on 24 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 24 and 25 Apr 2020 was 2357 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3021 newly confirmed cases between 23 Apr 2020 and 24 Apr 2020, a slow, vacillating, but steady decline. Numbers of hospitalized cases and numbers of cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 78.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 30.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Five other provinces have reported more than 100 cases in the past 24 hours. Five provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 8 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

[4] Iran: 89 328 total cases, 5650 deaths

https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-health-officials-concerned-about-rebound-effect-of-relaxing-lockdown-while-death-toll-surpasses-5-600/30576427.html


Iran's official COVID-19 cases and deaths have been going down since early April 2020, but Iran's health officials are concerned that relaxation of lockdown may reverse the situation.

According to the latest official figures announced on Saturday [25 Apr 2020], the daily death toll has been at its lowest since 4 Apr 2020, with 74 more deaths in the past 24-hour period. The number of new cases has also dropped to 1134, bringing the total deaths and cases over the past 2 months to 5650 and 89 328, respectively.

Announcing the new numbers on Saturday [25 Apr 2020], the Health Ministry Spokesman Dr. Kianoush Jahanpur said that currently, 3096 COVID-19 patients are in a critical situation.

While some Health Ministry officials say the COVID-19 trajectory indicates that numbers are going down in most provinces, others warn about an increase in several provinces, including East and West Azarbaijan, Tehran, Khuzestan, Zanjan and Fars, all of which are among the most populated provinces of the country. They attribute the rebound in these provinces to the relaxation of lockdown.

Pointing out that every step in reducing lockdown will manifest itself in more hospitalizations after 2 weeks and in the death toll after one month, Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi on Saturday [25 Apr 2020] said that in comparison with early April 2020, the number of hospitalizations and deaths have gone down by 50% and 70% percent, respectively but warned about a rebound if social distancing is abandoned.

[In the 24 hours from 24 to 25 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 89 328 from 88 194, an increase of 1134 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 5574 to 5650, an increase of 76 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 25 Apr 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 8th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Turkey, having surpassed China. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

[Yesterday's [24 Apr 2020] update used the summation of the PCR- and antibody-positive as well as asymptomatic cases. Hence, the reported numbers in the table above are less than previously reported and reflect only cases confirmed by PCR.

Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 2944 newly confirmed cases by PCR and 1941 positive by serology/antibody assays (out of 17 854 tests conducted, 10.86%), a total of 4885 cases reported today (25 Apr 2020). That brings the total number of positive cases to 223 759 as compared to 219 764 reported on 24 Apr 2020. While the daily newly confirmed cases have continued in the 4000-5000 range until today [Sat 25 Apr 2020], the 14-day population-based rate is gradually decreasing as is the daily number of deaths.

As of today (25 Apr 2020) and as per the Spanish health webpage, 223 759 total cases and 22 902 deaths have been reported, up from 219 764 cases and 22 524 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (24 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 93.68, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 93.68 today (24 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 219 764 cases, approximately 78 516 (35.7% have been hospitalized and 7756 (3.5%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7269387,43. La Rioja, Madrid, and Castile and Leon are the most affected communities by population-based rates. La Rioja and Castile and Leon are located together in the northern part of the country. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Castile and Leon to its northwest and La Rioja to its northeast. - Mod.UBA]
