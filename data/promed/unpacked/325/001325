10 more cases of possible _Escherichia coli_ O157 infection are being investigated following the closure of a primary school. They are in addition to 3 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ which triggered the closure yesterday of Friarswood Primary School, in Newcastle-under-Lyme. 4 of the new cases among children are being treated as probable, with the other 6 still classed as suspected. Now all children and staff at the 153-pupil school are being tested for the bacterium over the next 24 hours.

The school is expected to be closed for at least 3 days with deep cleans of classrooms, toilets, desks, and chairs carried out to stop the bug spreading.

[To this point, the attack rate of the infection is as high as 13/153 or 8.5 per cent. This suggests that the acquisition of the EHEC could have been at the school, related to contamination of food. The organism does spread relatively easily from child-to-child, especially in small children with poorer bathroom hygiene. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this outbreak. - Mod.LL
