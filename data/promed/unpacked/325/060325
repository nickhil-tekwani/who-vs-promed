Swine Fever Devastates Dar Es Salaam
------------------------------------
The African Swine Fever epizootic is hitting the city of Dar es Salaam,
which apparently has an estimated pig population of 7200.
Since the outbreak sometime in May this year, around 400 pigs were reported
sick out of which 329 died. Director for Veterinary Services in the
Ministry of Water and Livestock Development, Reminiselle Kweka has said
here that owners were slaughtering them for fear of contracting the
disease. According to him, 59 sick pigs have been destroyed and 391 have
been slaughtered for fear of contracting the disease.
He has told the media here that following the situation, the UN food
agency, FAO has decided to intervene to rescue the remaining pigs. "FAO has
approved 97 000 US dollars for the next 6 months to control the disease.
The disease has devastated Dar es Salaam Region since May, this year," he
explained.
According to him, the money would be used for carrying out a detailed
epidemiological investigation to trace the possible origin of the disease.
"It will be used to strengthen the capacity for field surveillance for the
disease and enforce quarantine measures," the director elaborated.
