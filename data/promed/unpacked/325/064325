West Nile Virus Detected in Dead Bird in Massachusetts
------------------------------------------------------
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced today
identification of the first West Nile virus (WNV) positive bird of 2001 in
Massachusetts. Confirmatory laboratory assays were completed over the
weekend for a crow found on 8 Jul 2001 in Andover. The finding was not
unexpected, since WNV has been found this year in birds in New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Florida. [And as of 16 Jul
2001, also in Georgia. - Mod.CP. Additionally, WNV has been found in
mosquito pools in New Jersey and Delaware. [As of Tue 17 Jul 2001, the
Delaware claim has been withdrawn. - Mod.CP.
Last year, 6 of 7 birds submitted from Andover were positive for WNV. These
were among 449 WNV-positive birds identified in the state during 2000. The
State Laboratory has tested 290 other birds thus far this season; all were
negative. In addition, over 1400 mosquito pools have also been negative for
WNV and Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus.
The MDPH Arbovirus Surveillance Program will continue to work with local
cities and towns, Regional Mosquito Control Districts as well as the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on mosquito control and
surveillance efforts. The presence of WNV serves to remind the public to
take precautions to eliminate standing water near their homes and to avoid
mosquito exposure whenever possible, and consider using DEET-containing
repellents when outdoors in areas where mosquitoes are active.
