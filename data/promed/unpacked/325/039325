The Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency has confirmed 6 new recorded deaths in the yellow fever outbreak in the state which brings the total number of deaths to 22.

Recall that cases of yellow fever were recorded in Yankari Game Reserve in Alkaleri and Tafawa Balewa Local Government Areas of Bauchi State which led to the death of 3 people.

The 1st case [involving another person] was recorded when 4 students of the College of Education, Waka-Biu, in Biu Local Government Area of Borno State were confirmed dead while 12 were hospitalized after a field trip to Yankari Games Reserve in Bauchi. According to the report, those who lost their lives complained of abdominal pains after which they vomited blood [but were they confirmed yellow fever cases? - Mod.TY]

The Bauchi State Government on [5 Sep 2019] confirmed the outbreak of the killer disease in the state.

Speaking at a press conference on the Executive Secretary, Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency, Dr Rilwan Mohammed, said the Ministry of Health had confirmed a yellow fever case that was linked to the Yankari Games Reserve.

Giving an update of the disease while speaking to Journalists on [Mon 14 Oct 2019], the Executive Chairman of the Agency in the State, Dr Mohammed, disclosed that no fewer than 143 suspected cases of the disease were recorded out of which 24 cases were confirmed and 22 died saying all the cases were from Alkaleri Local Government Area of the state.

Mohammed further disclosed that 10 out of the 22 people that died of the disease were rangers working with the Yankari Game Reserve.

According to him, only 79 percent coverage was recorded in the ongoing immunization campaign against the vector that carries the disease.

The Primary Health Agency Executive Chairman lamented that some people were still declining to take the vaccine hence the deaths that are still being recorded.

He disclosed that besides the 500 000 doses of vaccine provided by the federal government, the state has received another batch of 600 000 vaccines.

He explained that the immunisation would now be extended to Kirfi Local Government in the state, oil exploration sites, and parts of villages in Gombe State.

[An 8 Oct 2019 WHO report indicated that there were 110 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases in Bauchi state (see Yellow Fever - Africa (17): Nigeria, WHO 20191012.6721138). The report above quotes the Minister of Health indicating that there are no fewer than 143 cases, indicating that active transmission is continuing. Curiously, the report mentions the 4 school girls that visited the game reserve and died but does not explicitly indicate that they had yellow fever. There were 12 other students who visited the game reserve and became ill and were hospitalized but the etiology of their illnesses has not been reported, so it is not clear if yellow fever was involved. The game reserve is a popular place for visitors. One hopes that all the visitors are vaccinated, and are not individuals who have purchased one of the stolen YF vaccination cards recently reported, without being vaccinated (see Yellow fever - Africa (18): Nigeria, theft of vaccination cards 20191012.6723916). - Mod.TY
