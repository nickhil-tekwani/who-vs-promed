[According to official information of the Rospotrebnadzor as of the
end of 2009, dirofilariasis has been registered in 24 regions of the
Russian Federation (Altai, Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk, Perm, Khabarovsk
regions, the republics of Bashkortostan, Kalmykia, Mari El, Tatarstan,
the Udmurt Republic, Belgorod, Volgograd, Voronezh, Kurgan, Kirov,
Lipetsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Omsk, Ryazan, Saratov, Tula,
Ulyanovsk, Moscow).

The most common symptoms are caused by localization of the worms under
the skin of eyelid - 30 percent, but cases where the worm has been
found in the mammary gland, upper and lower extremities also have been
recorded.

A case with atypical localization of helminth was reported from the
Udmurt Republic. The localization of the worm was in the mesentery of
the large intestine. During surgery for acute appendicitis a worm of
12 cm length was extracted. The problem is caused by the general
circulation of helminth in the environment and the lack of appropriate
measures to identify and de-worming of infected animals obligate
definitive host (dogs, cats)."

[Dirofilaria is a nematode and cause heartworm in dogs, cats, foxes,
wolves, muskrats and otters. The human infection is usually located in
the lungs but may be found in the heart and subcutaneous tissue. Of
the 11 cases originally reported from the United States (Beaver et al.
Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1965;14:1010-29), none were located in the
skin. Dirofilaria is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes from the
animal reservoir. It has been hypothesized that the geographic
distribution of the infection will increase with climate change
(Genchi C et al. Climate and Dirofilaria infection in Europe.
Veterinary Parasitology 2009;163: 286-292).
