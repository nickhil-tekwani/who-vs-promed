Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 86 / 16 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 965 / 77 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 7 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics (rates apparent, expressed in percentages)
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 18.60 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00
Sheep / 7.98 / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00
Goats / 0.00 / 0.00 / - / 0.00
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: In addition to the control measures mentioned, the following measures are being implemented:
- Crisis cells at national and regional levels,
- Burying of offal and bones between 2 layers of lime,
- Disinfection of vehicles leaving the affected governorates,
- Vaccination points of susceptible species at the entrance of livestock markets,
- Epidemiological investigation to determine the origin of the infection,
- Communication plan.

Control measures
Measures applied: Quarantine, Movement control inside the country, Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), Modified stamping out, No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures
Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Since the start of this epizootic, reportedly on 25 Apr 2014, 47 new outbreaks have been reported from almost all parts of Tunisia; see interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15183.

The accumulated total numbers of the affected animals, since the start of the event (47 outbreaks), are as follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1295 / 111 / 0 / 0 / 9
Sheep / 2742 / 295 / 0 / 0 / 1
Goats / 316 / 25 / 0 / 0 / 0

The relative low number of affected goat flocks can probably be explained by their relative population size. According to OIE's 2013 statistics, the total/national number of sheep was 6 998 630 in 274 000 establishments; this is about 5.5 fold the number of goats (1 282 080, kept in 141 000 establishments).

The extensive and rapid spread of the virus may reflect the susceptibility, to some degree, of Tunisia's livestock in spite of the annual mass vaccination policy applied in Tunisia for many years. According to Tunisia's annual report for 2013, FMD vaccinations were applied as follows:
Bov - 413 651 vaccinations (the cattle population was 655 730, kept in 112 000 establishments).
Ov/Cap - 3 731 517 vaccinations (sheep/goat population of 8 280 710, kept in 415 000 establishments).

Information on Tunisia's vaccination regime (minimal age of vaccinants, revaccinations, vaccine valencies) will be helpful.

We are informed that the virus strain, currently circulating in Tunisia, has been sequenced by the National Reference Centre for Vesicular Diseases -- Dept. Biotechnology -- IZSLER (Brescia, Italy) and found to be closely related to the 2013 Libyan isolates (homology 99 percent). The sequences are being loaded in GenBank, accession number to be provided later. A more extended analysis, by the WRLFMD at Pirbright, is expected; WRLFMD performed such analysis in relation to the Libyan strain; subscribers are referred to their summarising paper (see item 2 further). The genotyping of the Tunisian strain is of particular importance for the Maghreb countries, threatened by the current Tunisian event, as well as to the entire region.- Mod.AS]

Genome Sequences of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 Lineage from Outbreaks in Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Bhutan during 2013. B. Valdazo-Gonzalez, N.J. Knowles & D.P. King
--------------------------------
Abstract: The complete genomes of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) viruses recovered in Libya and Saudi Arabia in 2013 are described here. These viruses belong to an FMD virus lineage (Ind-2001, topotype Middle East-South Asia, serotype O) which is normally endemic in the Indian subcontinent. A contemporary virus sequence from Bhutan is also reported here.

Excerpts from the paper [For the full text and references, please refer to the source URL.]:

- The O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage was initially identified in the Indian subcontinent in 2001 as a group distinct from the predominant PanAsia lineage (WRLFMD). Since then, Ind-2001 has diverged into 4 sublineages (a to d) and become the predominant lineage in the region. Outside the Indian subcontinent, only a few sporadic outbreaks have been reported in various countries in the Middle East in 1997, 2001 to 2002, and 2008 to 2009.

- Here, we report 3 representative complete genomes of viruses from the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage causing outbreaks in BHU, SAU, and LIB during 2013.

- O/LIB/2/2013 and O/SAU/3/2013 share 99 percent nucleotide identity with each other and 97 percent with O/BHU/1/2013 [a reference vaccine strain].

- These viruses share 93 percent nucleotide identity with another contemporary virus within the Ind-2001 lineage from Bangladesh.

- No other complete genomes of members within the Ind-2001 lineage are available in GenBank, and the next closest (92 percent identity) viruses are within the O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2 lineage from the Middle East and Asia (Myanmar and Bhutan [2004], Israel [2007], and Pakistan [2008]).

- The appearance and transboundary spread of O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 reinforce the need to update genetic databases to understand the global epidemiology of FMDV and to develop specific molecular diagnostic tools and vaccines to use in outbreaks due to emerging FMD viruses.

[The final remark above underlines the status of the current epizootic caused by O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage virus strain (also called KAR-13), which has already spread to Saudi Arabia, Libya and Tunisia, as "emerging." These developments deserve caution and alertness regionally and beyond, ringing old bells reminiscent of the 2001 global spread of Type O Strain PanAsia, Topotype ME-SA, which started in eastern Asia and eventually reached West Europe, hopefully an event to remain unique.
