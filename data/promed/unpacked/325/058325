One child has died while 3 others are recovering after eating what is suspected to be poisonous cassava roots. 3 adults were discharged from the Outapi State Hospital after also eating the roots.

Cassava is often used to make a tropical delicacy in the form of a flour. However, if it is not properly washed or cooked, its roots contain a toxin called cyanide [see comment below] that is fatal to humans, even in small doses.

The incident took place at Ombonde-Yomutzegwondjamba in the Ruacana Constituency [Omusati Region] over the weekend [18-19 Feb 2012].

It is reported that the family ate the cassava, which was prepared by a 63-year-old grandmother, for lunch on Saturday afternoon [18 Feb 2012]. After lunch, the pensioner allegedly left the home and went to local cuca shops [unlicensed houses selling alcoholic liquor]. The younger members of the family went to get some more cassava, and cooked and ate it before their grandmother returned.

During the evening, [the woman] allegedly returned home complaining of stomach cramps and she was vomiting, only to realise that all her 6 grandchildren were complaining of similar symptoms.

By midnight, the condition of a 7-year-old girl worsened. She died around 00h30 at home. Police were called to remove the body and the rest of the family was taken to the Outapi State Hospital where they were kept overnight under doctor's observation.

Three adults, including the grandmother, a young man and woman, both 27, were discharged from the hospital on Sunday [19 Feb 2012]. By yesterday morning, 3 children (2 6-year-olds and a 4-year-old boy) were still at the Outapi State Hospital.

According to Omusati Regional Health director Loide Haipinge, the children were likely to have been discharged by yesterday afternoon [21 Feb 2012] as they were recovering well. According to Haipinge, it is difficult for her office to point to the exact source of poisoning, as investigations are still under way.

"We have sent officials to the village to investigate. The children are claiming that they ate roots of a certain plant while the parents were at the cuca shops. But they (the children) are too young to give reliable information," she said.

Haipinge said the autopsy on the deceased child and an investigation of the roots that the family claims to have eaten will determine the exact cause of death. According to Haipinge, there is a poisonous type of cassava, but at the moment it is premature to conclude that the family ate the roots of the poisonous plant

Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_, Crantz) is a root crop widely consumed in Africa and South America. Although it originated in Brazil (where it is called manioc), it was brought to Africa by Portuguese colonists, and is now an important crop there and in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is the principal source of nutrition for about 500 million people. Its leaves are edible, but the prize is its starchy root, rich in protein, minerals, and vitamins A, B, and C.

Cassava is used in a vast variety of cakes, snacks, and desserts and grows wild in many places, being tough and drought-resistant. In countries where hunger is an overt reality for many poor households, cassava is among those food crops that can make the crucial difference between starvation and survival. The cassava plant is the world's 3rd most important crop. Cassava enters the North American diet also, as it is made into tapioca.

Surprising for an important edible plant, cassava is quite poisonous without proper preparation. The toxin in cassava is called linamarin. When eaten raw or inadequately prepared, the human digestive system will convert this to cyanide. Even 2 cassava roots contain a fatal dose of poison. While the bitter variety (white cassava) of the plant has larger concentrations of cyanide than the sweet variety (yellow cassava), the sweet cassava is not without risk.

To prepare cassava, it should be peeled, grated, and soaked in warm water for several days. This allows the cassava's own natural enzyme (linamarase) to convert the cyanogen linamarin to sugar and cyanide gas, and the volatile gas disperses usually harmlessly. However, women -- who are usually charged with processing the plant -- can be sickened by inhaling cyanide gas. What remains after processing can be boiled and eaten, or more usually, dried and ground.

The shelf life of a cassava root is quite short once it is removed from the stem, so there is an urgency to get the food to market. Roots can turn to mush in less than a week. The rush to get cassava to the market may keep some batches of cassava from being processed properly.

Cyanide is normally converted in humans to the less toxic thiocyanate by the enzyme rhodanese, a mitochondrial enzyme which is widely present throughout the human body, with the highest concentrations in the liver and kidneys. Thiocyanate is the chief metabolite of cyanide. Thiocyanate itself has a goitrogenic effect if there is a shortage of iodine in the diet. The body uses sulphur-containing amino acids to render cyanide harmless. If the diet is deficient in protein, cyanide will be converted to cyanate, which induces neurodegenerative disease in both animals and humans. The cells which are most affected are Betz cells in the motor cortex. Tropical ataxic neuropathy can also be produced.

Konzo, a neurological disease characterized by an acute isolated and symmetrical hypertonic paraparesis, which is permanent but non-progressive, causing the inability to walk or at best, present with ataxia. To date, 2 large epidemics have been reported, each of more than 1000 cases. The 1st was in the Bandundu region in Congo (1936-37) and the 2nd in the Nampulla province of Mozambique (1981). Small outbreaks have been reported from Congo, Mozambique, Tanzania, and the Central African Republic. Sporadic cases of konzo also occur. The majority of cases of konzo occur in the dry season, chiefly during a long drought. Familial clustering is common.

Konzo begins abruptly, without prodromal signs. In 90 percent of cases the onset of symptoms takes less than a day. The initial symptoms are described as tremor, cramps, a heavy feeling, and/or weakness in the legs, a tendency to fall down, and difficulty remaining upright. There is a visible hypertonic gait when walking or running. Occasionally there will be lower back pain, blurred vision, speech difficulties, and/or paresthesia of the legs, but they disappear within a month. During the 1st 2 days the majority of patients have general muscular weakness and are confined to bed.

Hypertonicity is present from day one. Flaccid paralysis of the limbs does not occur. Later there is a slight partial improvement. Finally the affected person develops a stable hypertonic paraparesis, which persists for the remainder of life, or might improve a little. After onset the neurological signs remain constant or improve minimally if no further cyanide is ingested.

Prevention of konzo therefore involves avoiding a farming system dominated by bitter cassava (which contains higher cyanide levels), insufficient cassava processing, and a protein deficient diet.

In an effort to avoid this toxicity, it has been reported by Siritunga and Sayre (1) that transgenic cassava free of cyanogens can be produced. The investigators generated transgenic plants in which cytochrome oxidase enzymes that catalyze the 1st step in linamarin synthesis are inhibited. The plants showed a 94 percent reduction in leaf linamarin content and a 99-percent decrease in root linamarin levels. Additionally, the same group (2) has reported that transgenic cassava plants can be produced that overexpress the gene for hydroxynitrile lyase, facilitating cyanogenesis during processing and producing a final product with less risk. The tubers of cassava do not have this enzyme, and processing relies on spontaneous conversion. Combining these methods could further decrease the risk of cyanide poisoning from cassava.
