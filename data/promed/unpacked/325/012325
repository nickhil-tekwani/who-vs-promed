Shevyreva M.P. The development of information technologies and
social-hygienic monitoring system -- P.8.
The development of information technologies and a social-hygienic
monitoring system in the Russian Federation (RF) is carried out according
to "The Development of the State Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Service in
the Russian Federation in 1996-2000" Program in order to realize
"Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Well-Being of Population" Law.
The program includes an elaboration and introduction of modern technologies
and
development of the infrastructure of information provision in two trends:
1) creation and development of the Automatized Information System of
Sanitary-and-Epidemiological well-being of the population in RF
(AIS-San-Epid);
2) development and introduction of a social-hygienic monitoring system.
The Perm, Sverdlovsk districts (oblasts) and Moscow City are selected as
base areas for AIS-San-Epid elaboration.
The AIS-San-Epid is intended for san-epid service users of all levels,
enterprises, organizations and citizens. The PC equipment of San-Epid
Surveillance Centers is intensively developing (>5,000 units). However, up
till now 15 regions have no access to computer networks.
Special attention is given to elaborating the data bases and software
products for prognosis of the epidemiological well-being of the population.
In some RF regions the following data bases are made on:
- infectious morbidity (since 1995);
- estimation of incidence rates at administrative regions in dynamics
(since 1983);
- harmful substances [toxic] waste (since 1996);
- morbidity and environment (since 1994);
- trachea and lung cancer etiology (since 1994), etc.
>From 1993 to 1997 the number of departments on investigation of public
health and environment in State San-Epi Surveillance Centers increased
twofold (from 200 to 389).
San-Epid information streams are formed on three main trends:
- public health status;
- environmental status;
- the state san-epid surveillance activities.
