Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever outbreak in Uganda Shows no sign of Let Up
------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Ebola hemorrhagic fever cases in Uganda's northern district of Gulu
will continue to increase for the next 2 to 3 days before the
situation stabilizes, a senior health official said Saturday. Director Of
Health Services, Sam Zaramba, said volunteers and health workers have
identified about 200 people who had close contacts with Ebola patients and
these were being monitored. Over the last 48 hours up to Saturday, 28 new
cases were reported with 10 deaths in Lacor and Gulu district hospitals,
bringing the cumulative number of infections to 139 and 51 deaths since the
outbreak of the deadly disease in Uganda. [As of Sun 22 Oct 2000, the number
of cases had risen to 149 with 54 deaths. - Mod.CP. Zaramba attributed the
increase to the active case search of patients in the villages.
Out of the 88 patients still alive in the 2 hospitals, Zaramba said about
40 are already cured and waiting to be discharged, but simply kept for
observation. He said 48 patients are in different stages of recovery.
According to Zaramba, reports from all other districts in Uganda indicate
that there are no cases of Ebola other than in Gulu district. "The reported
suspected cases from Kakira hospital, some 80 km east of Kampala, and
Kajansi, near the capital city, are being investigated," he explained.
The virus has been identified as a strain last seen in southern Sudan in
1979. "This type is called Ebola Sudan. But this does not necessarily mean
it came from the Sudan. It has the same characteristics as it occurred in
the Sudan in 1979," Zaramba said.
Many people were already blaming the outbreak on returning Ugandan troops
from the DR Congo, which was hit by Ebola in 1995, but scientists say that
was a different strain. Another speculation is that the virus could have
been brought to Gulu by rebels of Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, allegedly
operating from southern Sudan. The rebels have regularly raided areas in
Gulu, in their 13-year-old war against the Ugandan government.
According to World Health Organisation statistics, the disease has killed
793 0f its 1100 known cases, representing about 72 percent of the victims.
Scientists say the fatality rate of the disease in Uganda stands at 38.5
percent compared to between 50 and 90 percent fatality rate in the Sudan and
Congo.

Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever - Uganda: A Comment
-------------------------------------------
Allow me to point out that the designation of the virus presently causing
Ebola fever in Uganda, "Ebola-Sudan", does not at all indicate that the
source of the virus is Sudan. In spite of the index case having been traced
to the Sudan border, and the molecular characterization of the virus
indicating that it is close to prototype Ebola-Sudan virus, these are not
guarantees that the virus was imported from the Sudan. We simply do not know
enough about the distribution of Ebola-Sudan -- or the other Ebola strains
--in Africa.
One would not assume the source of Japanese encephalitis virus always is
Japan, or that a West Nile virus is from the Nile Valley, or that yellow
fever virus must turn someone yellow -- these simply are names.
Identification of the etiologic agent of Ebola fever in Uganda was done by
molecular genetic assays but the epidemiology, especially the origin of this
particular strain, remains to be determined. Part of the problem is the
nomenclature of the ebolaviruses. By naming them Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Sudan,
Ebola-Cote d'Ivoire, etc. confusion was produced with regard to whether
these are distinct viruses (types) or subtypes of a single type (virus).
Either these things are the same virus, being variations on a single theme
(need one name plus a suffix), or they are distinct (need different names).
Bad enough that we have viruses that are numbered (bluetongue 1, bluetongue
2, etc., dengue 1, dengue 2, etc.), having many viruses all called "Ebola
virus" likewise is not clarifying.
In spite of the clear molecular basis for distinguishing between
ebolaviruses, classical serologic studies have not been done, so we really
do not know much about cross-protection or even antigenicity in general; at
least I do not. As Ogden Nash said, "Progress is a great thing but I think
it has gone on too long."

[As Dr. Calisher rightly points out the nomenclature of the filoviruses is
in a state of flux. The nomenclature adopted in the 7th Report of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is likely to be
provisional pending further elucidation of the relationships of the
different viruses, is that the currently named filoviruses be ranked as
virus species with the following designations (and their abbreviations):
Marburg virus (MARV), Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus (CIEBOV), Reston Ebola virus
(REBOV), Sudan Ebola virus (SEBOV), and Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV). - Mod.CP
