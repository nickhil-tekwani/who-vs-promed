Already 109 people -- 49 in hospital -- have tested positive for
pneumonia caused by a bacterium called _Legionella pneumophila_,
detected on Fri 2 Jun 2006 in the old quarter of Pamplona/Iruna.
All those affected are making "satisfactory progress," as the Health
Department of the Government of Navarre has confirmed. In a
statement, the Health Department pointed out that, out of those 100
people affected, 44 are being treated at home. Likewise, it noted the
64-year-old woman admitted to the Intensive Care Unit is also making
satisfactory progress. Thus, at the moment, there are 49 people in 3
different hospitals.
The Health Department added that 30 refrigeration plants were
checked, out of which 4 contained _Legionella_, but the rest had no
presence of the bacteria.
This is not the 1st time a Legionnaires' disease outbreak has been
detected in Pamplona/Iruna. In 2001, 6 people died, and the outbreak
affected other 16 people who worked at the City Council and the
Education Department.
