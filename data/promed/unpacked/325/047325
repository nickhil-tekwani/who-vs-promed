Between 26 Jan and 5 Mar 2015, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) of the Federal Ministry of Health of Nigeria notified WHO of 652 suspected cases of meningococcal disease, including 50 deaths. Cases have been reported in 10 local government areas of 2 states, Kebbi and Sokoto. Laboratory tests have confirmed the predominance of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C in the affected areas, with no other serogroups being identified. In Zamfara state, there has been a recent emergence of suspected cases of meningococcal disease; however, an outbreak has not yet been confirmed.

A national task force was activated to manage the outbreak. WHO and partners, including Medecins Sans Frontieres and UNICEF, are closely monitoring the situation, and providing support to the government of Nigeria for the implementation of a mass vaccination campaign and other emergency control measures. The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has released 204 850 doses of vaccine, with the support of the GAVI Alliance, as well as 5000 antibiotic vials to respond to the outbreak. Case management and social mobilisation activities are also ongoing.

Cerebrospinal [bacterial] meningitis is caused by several microorganisms; among these, _N. meningitidis_ (Nm) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis. The disease is highly contagious with seasonal epidemics in many African countries. Since the introduction of the Men A conjugate vaccine (MenAfrivac), which protects against the most prevalent type of Nm (serogroup A) the occurrence of the disease has declined significantly. From 2011 to 2014, the government of Nigeria conducted mass campaigns with the type A vaccine in all states at risk, including Kebbi state. Still, the risk of other types of _N. meningitidis_ persists, as evidenced by the current Nm C outbreak. The disease can be cured with antibiotics and prevented with vaccines.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the current information available on this outbreak.

[At least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described. Meningococcal disease is most commonly due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, W135, and sometimes X. In the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, designated the WHO African meningitis belt, large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. The African meningitis belt extends from Ethiopia in the East, to Senegal in the West and includes Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/travel-static/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf).

Serogroup A meningococcus has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, outbreaks have also been caused by other _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, such as serogroup C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17334579), X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains. Since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, to be replaced by other serogroups.
