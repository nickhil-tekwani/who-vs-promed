Detection of orange rust of sugarcane (_Puccinia kuenii_) in Mexico
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Service for Plant Health, Safety and Agri-Food Quality
(SENASICA) has confirmed the presence of orange rust of sugarcane in
municipalities of the States of Chiapas, Quintana Roo, and Veracruz.

The Plant Health General Directorate has established a working group
to review strategies for specific surveys and for the establishment
of measures to mitigate risk of spreading orange rust [of] sugarcane.

Thanks to reports from other countries where the disease has been
previously detected, such as Guatemala and Australia, it is
considered that this disease can cause significant economic losses to
susceptible varieties in sugarcane producing states in Mexico.

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has
the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop.
Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an
orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules
occur on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf
base. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool
autumns, and by rain.

A related species, _P. melanocephala_, causes brown or common rust.
Colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and
development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain. Both rusts are
rapidly spread by wind, and disease management includes fungicides
and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in
2000 a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most
widely grown sugarcane cultivar. The disease was reported for the 1st
time in the western hemisphere in 2007 from Florida, USA (see
ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457), and it is not clear whether this was
a similar scenario with emergence of a new strain, or whether the
pathogen was actually introduced at that time.

Orange rust has been reported since then from additional countries in
the Americas (see ProMED-mail posts listed below), but it has not yet
been clarified whether these reports represent the spread of the same
fungal strain or are due to separate incursions or mutation events
detected as a result of increased vigilance in the region.
