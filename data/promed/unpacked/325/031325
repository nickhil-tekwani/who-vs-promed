Potato crops have been affected by over 50 per cent in Bardiya [district]
this year [2008] due to a cold wave and fungal diseases caused by cold,
fog, and lack of sunshine. Almost all farmers in Bardiya grow potato as the
main crop. The potato plants have dried up this year. All farmers will
suffer huge losses. They said that no matter what pesticide they used, it
did not work.

The district agriculture development office said potato has been cultivated
on 2550 hectares of land in the district, and over 75 per cent of the crop
has been affected by late blight, a fungal disease. Agriculture technicians
said potato production has been hit by over 50 per cent in the district.
Crop protection officer Rohini Yatri said teams had been mobilized to
control the disease but to no avail.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. It is spread
by contaminated plant and other material, wind and water. It also affects
tomato; solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Disease development is favoured by cool, moist conditions.
Fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total
tuber breakdown. Disease management includes preventative fungicide
treatment of seed tubers and additional fungicide applications to the crop.
Infected seed potatoes are often a problem, and an outbreak has recently
also been reported from northern India (ProMED-mail post no.
20090103.0018). Cultivars with reduced sensitivity to PLB are being
developed, but these efforts are being counteracted by the adaptability of
the pathogen. PLB is considered an increasing threat worldwide because new
and even more virulent strains continue to emerge. For more information on
PLB, see links and previous posts below.
