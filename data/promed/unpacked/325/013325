Since mid-December [2016], dead swans have been observed in Ruicheng County [located in the Yuncheng prefecture of Shanxi province in China. See map at http://tinyurl.com/h3hbntj].

The accumulated number of recorded dead swans became, as of 21 Dec 2016, 20. On 30 Dec 2016, the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory identified HPAI H5N8 virus in a dead swan, of which samples were received from Shanxi.

At present, the veterinary department of Shanxi Province has been following the wild bird situation in conjunction with the forestry sector in the Ministry. This is done in accordance with the relevant emergency plans and technical control specifications, including disinfection and monitoring activities. The investigation is showing that no abnormalities have been found in local birds.

[The reported detection of HPAI H5N8 in China's east-central province of Shanxi preceded the recently reported spread/introduction of this strain into Italy, Spain and Slovenia (see OIE notifications in 20170112.4760583). The virus is thus circulating throughout Asia, from east to west, as well as in the Middle East, Europe and at least 3 African countries (Egypt, Tunisia and Nigeria; the situation in Uganda is yet to be clarified).

HPAI H5N8 was reported earlier from China (Liaoning province) on 24 Oct 2014. According to the immediate notification, there were 2 events: one involved an environmental sample collected according to the national surveillance plan in the Wetland of Liao river and tested positive. The other one involved a duck, sampled in the Liuhe slaughterhouse, Dawa, Panjin, Liaoning, similarly, according to the national surveillance plan, testing positive. The report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16378 (see post 20141026.2898069). No additional H5N8 events have been reported in China since October 2014 until December 2016; the event is regarded as "continuing".

Genotyping of the new isolate will show whether it belongs to the H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4, which is responsible for the intercontinental panzootic currently circulating, and if it is different from the 2014 strain. - Mod.AS
