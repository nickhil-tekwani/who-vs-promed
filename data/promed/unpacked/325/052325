Rabies Situation aggravated in Southern Urals
-----------------------------------------------
In the Kizilskiy district [in the Chelyabinsk region], a rabid fox
bit a cow. Persons who came into contact with the sick cow were
vaccinated. Already, 7 foci of rabies have been registered in the
territory of the Chelyabinsk region this year [2007]. The management
of a veterinary facility in the Chelyabinsk region sent all municipal
heads a letter that discusses the necessity of regulating the number
of wild animals in the area. Special brigades of hunters have been
created for this purpose in the districts, and municipal services
have been directed to catch homeless cats and dogs.
Physicians advise avoiding contact with wild and homeless animals and
seeking medical assistance if bitten.

7 cases of rabies among animals recorded for the week in the Rostov region
-----------------------------------------------
From 5-11 Feb 2007, 7 cases of rabies among animals have been
registered in the Rostov region.
On 6 Feb 2007, a dead fox was found in northern Rostov. The animal
was infected with rabies.
An infected cow was found on 7 Feb 2007 on one of the farms of the
Zavetinskiy district of the Rostov region. The animal was probably
infected by a fox noticed on a farmstead in January of this year
[2007].
On 7 Feb 2007, a rabid wolf was killed in the Salsk district of the
Rostov region.
Rabies has also been found in dead vagrant dogs in the city of Belaya
Kalitva and in 3 foxes shot in the Zymovnikovskiy, Myllerovskiy and
Kujbyshevskiy districts.
According to the regional veterinary service, in total from 1 Jan to
12 Feb 2007, 18 cases of rabies among animals were recorded in the
region (from 1 Jan to 1 Mar 2006, only 12 cases were recorded). The
relative frequency of this disease among animals has grown by a
factor 2.
The acute growth of cases of rabies in the beginning of 2007 is
connected with unusually warm weather, which raises the activity of
animals.

[The Chelyabinsk region is in the center of Russia at the border of
Europe and Asia, at the southern foothills of the Urals and the
adjoining plain. In the north, the Chelyabinsk region borders the
Sverdlovsk region, in the east on the Kurgan region; it also has
borders with the Orenburg region in the south and with the Republic
of Bashkortostan in the west. The southeastern part of the region's
border with the Republic of Kazakhstan, which is about 730 km,
coincides with the state border of the Russian Federation.
Dagestan is located on the western coast of the Caspian Sea, about
1000 miles south of Moscow. Dagestan borders the Russian republic of
Chechnya, Georgia and Azerbaijan
There are several inconsistencies in the report about rabies in
Dagestan. There is no information about laboratory investigation and
confirmation of rabies. How can people can apply for medical aid with
symptoms of rabies after several days since the deaths of cattle? It
is an unusual, very short incubation period. Vaccination for people
with symptoms of rabies is useless.
The Rostov-on-Don Region is located in the southern part of the
East-European plateau and partly in the North Caucasian region,
covering a vast territory in the basin of the Don River and coastline
of Taganrog Bay in the Sea of Azov. The distance between Moscow and
Rostov-on-Don is 1226 km. It borders on Stavropol and Krasnodar
territories in the south, Ukraine in the west and northwest, Voronezh
Region in the north, Volgograd Region in the northeast and east, and
the Republic of Kalmykia in the east, southeast, and south. - Mod.NP]
