Health Experts Urge Further Research on Smallpox
------------------------------------------------------
Experts have recommended further research on the deadly
smallpox virus before the world's only known remaining stocks in the United
States and Russia are destroyed, the World Health Organization said Friday.
In a statement, the United Nations agency said the research would be
"carried out under the very careful control of WHO.''
The recommendation was made by WHO's advisory committee on variola virus
research, composed of 16 experts from all regions, who ended four-day
closed-door talks at WHO. "In their deliberations, the experts defined the
following areas in which research could usefully be conducted before the
end of 2002: sequencing more completely the DNA of the smallpox virus;
devising tests to detect smallpox infection in humans; and developing drugs
to treat human smallpox infections, should they reappear,'' the agency said.
"WHO will approve and review all future research on variola virus,'' it
added.
The advisory committee will "outline an inspection schedule to confirm the
strict containment of existing smallpox virus stocks and to ensure a safe
and secure research environment for the investigations,'' according to the
statement.
Last May, the WHO's 191 member states voted to delay destruction of the
smallpox virus stocks to 2002 at the latest.
The deadly stocks, kept in high-security laboratories at the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta and at the Russian State Center for Research on
Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, were to have been destroyed last
June 30 [1999. The timetable was laid out in a WHO assembly decision after
the
scourge was declared eradicated globally in 1980.
Both the United States and Russia were among 30 states at WHO's annual
assembly in May who sponsored a resolution calling for more international
research into antiviral agents and improved vaccines.
President Clinton announced last April [1999 that he would seek a delay in
destroying the stocks because of fears the disease may be revived or spread
through terrorist attacks.
