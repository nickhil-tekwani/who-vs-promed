China on [Tue 17 Oct 2017] confirmed an outbreak of bird flu at broiler chicken farms in a central province, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a statement.

Flocks are particularly vulnerable to avian flu during the drier winter months, following which outbreaks usually die down.

The outbreak in Hexian, a city of about 500 000 people in the province of Anhui, was caused by the H5N6 strain of virus, and has been brought under control, the ministry said on its website.

The local government culled 30 196 fowl after the outbreak, which infected 28 650 broiler chickens and killed 15 066 of the birds, it added.

The last bird flu outbreak, also of the H5N6 strain of the virus, killed 9752 birds on quail farms in the southwestern province of Guizhou, the ministry said in August [2017].

[HPAI H5N6 was initially reported from China to the OIE on 1 Sep 2014 (outbreak started 23 Aug 2014). Since that time a total of 41 outbreaks have been reported. A map showing the locations of the 40 outbreaks reported between Aug 2014 and Mar 2017, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15957.

The most recent outbreak, which reportedly started [Thu 10 Aug 2017] in Guizhou (south-west China), was covered in an immediate notification of [Mon 28 Aug 2017] (see, including map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=24607).

The current outbreak is yet to be reported to the OIE.

HPAI H5N6 of poultry has reportedly infected humans since 2014; according to the WHO risk assessment, A/H5N6 poses a relatively low risk for human to human transmission. However, every human case is an opportunity for the avian viruses to evolve and potentially adapt to humans.

This strain has been recorded from several east Asian countries, including Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, in poultry and in wild birds. - Mod.AS
