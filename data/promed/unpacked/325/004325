Swollen shoot disease threatens Ivorian cocoa area
--------------------------------------------------
Swollen shoot disease is slashing cocoa output from part of top grower
Ivory Coast [official name Cote d'Ivoire. - CopyEd.MJ], and could
reduce output more significantly if it spreads to major growing
regions nearby, farmers and agronomists said. The affected area around
the central towns of Bouafle and Sinfra grows a small part of the
country's crop, but the adjacent Daloa region grows around a quarter
of the country's cocoa.

"It spreads very quickly. Look at the damaging effects in Bouafle,"
state agronomist Michel Botti said. "Signs of the disease were
discovered at Bonon and there is a risk that in 2 to 5 years we will
see the disease in Daloa. This would be a catastrophe because a good
part of production could be destroyed."

Bonon is about 50 km (31 mi) east of Daloa on the main road to
Bouafle, where swollen shoot has had a devastating effect. "Since
2004, the disease has infected most of the trees. I used to produce
3.5 tonnes of cocoa per year, now it's only 100 to 200 kg," said a
farmer in the area. Ivory Coast's October-March [2008/09] main crop
has proved disappointing, and pod counters said this week the smaller
April-September [2009] crop would produce only 200 000-290 000
tonnes, lower than the expected 350 000 tonnes.

The deputy manager of a Bouafle-based farming co-op said the area's
2007/08 season output was half of 5 years ago. "Every year, the
amount of cocoa here lowers because of swollen shoot," he said. The
National Agronomist Research Centre has recommended farmers plant
hybrid seeds which are more resistant to disease, but farmers say
many of the new trees have barely lasted two years before being
infected by swollen shoot.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot
virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and can lead to severe crop losses.
CSSV is thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African
forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains from severe
effects on shoots and roots to no symptoms at all. The virus is
spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also
be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed
transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean plant
material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected
trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and
native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Breeding programmes for
virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties have been initiated. (For
more information on CSSV please see previous posts and links below.)

In 2008, Cote d'Ivoire launched a 2-year project to fight swollen
shoot (see ProMED-mail post no. 20080302.0860). The risks to the main
southwestern and western growing areas were thought to be lower
because of recent replanting and rejuvenation programmes. However,
expectations that recent plantings of new hybrids would be more
resistant to CSSV appear to have been too optimistic.

A westward spread of CSSV in Ghana led to a serious outbreak in 2008
(ProMED-mail post no. 20081030.3416) with the possibility of the
involvement of a new viral strain. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and Cote
d'Ivoire have signed an agreement to tackle the disease.
