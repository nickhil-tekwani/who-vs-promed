One in 3 greenfinches killed by pigeon disease
----------------------------------------------
Numbers of the popular garden bird declined rapidly after
trichomoniasis, normally associated with pigeons, began to affect
finches in 2005. Other birds such as the chaffinch, whose numbers
fell by a fifth in some places, were also affected.

The study, carried out by scientists from the Garden Bird Health
initiative, found that outbreaks of the disease have continued to
occur each year since its emergence in 2005.

The disease is caused by a parasite that is thought to be transmitted
through birds feeding another with regurgitated food during the
breeding season or through food or drinking water contaminated with
saliva. The findings, published in the online journal PLoS ONE, show
that most birds died in the summer and autumn.

Dr Rob Robinson, an ecologist at the British Trust for Ornithology,
told the 'Independent': "These findings demonstrate that virulent
infectious diseases can cause sharp population declines in common
wild birds in just a short period of time."

The team of scientists relied mainly on public observation data but
also looked at post-mortem examinations of hundreds of birds
collected from gardens across the country.

Becki Lawson, a wildlife vet from the Zoological Society of London
and another lead author of the study, said: "This citizen science
project highlights the valuable role that volunteers can play in
helping us learn more about wildlife diseases, even by just watching
birds in their gardens for a couple of hours each week."

The Garden Bird Health initiative was launched in 2003 to develop
guidelines about how best to feed garden birds and to recognise new
and emerging diseases.
