Both government and private hospitals in Vijayawada [Andhra Pradesh] are flooded with hundreds of typhoid cases which are being registered after a series of continuous rains lashed the city from past 2 weeks. More than malaria and dengue, it is typhoid fever that are on the rise due to the consumption of polluted water and improper food. The general pediatric ward of new Government General Hospital [GGH] in the city is filled with patients suffering from viral fevers.

At present, over 712 typhoid cases have been registered in both government and private hospitals in Krishna district [Andhra Pradesh]. Currently, 62 typhoid cases are being treated in the new GGH. Similarly, most of the private hospitals are flooded with patients inflicted with viral fevers. Doctors cite that typhoid fevers are increasing day by day due to unhealthy lifestyle as a majority of the people consume outside food and impure water.

"Many people, inflicted with typhoid, are found to be neglecting their health. It is a serious fever which disturbs the immune system and intestines. In order to avoid these complications, everyone must maintain hygiene while taking food and always consume purified or warm water. Especially during monsoon rains, the water gets polluted easily and one must consume water after boiling it," said Dr K Neeraja, a senior physician.

TVSN Sastry, Krishna district Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) said, "Monsoon always comes with a package of seasonal fevers and typhoid is one among them. Even for typhoid, we say prevention is better than cure. One must avoid consuming outside food for the entire monsoon season as the water gets polluted easily. As far as other viral fevers caused by dengue and malaria are concerned, the district is on the safe side with zero deaths."

[Typhoid fever is the classical human infection caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi. Unlike most salmonellae, _S._ Typhi is not zoonotic, being a pathogen only of humans, and may cause constipation and not diarrhea.

As a reminder, the term abdominal typhus is still used in some places to refer to typhoid fever, since typhus (caused by _Rickettsia prowazekii_) and typhoid fever (caused by _Salmonella_ Typhi) present quite similar symptoms, such as the fever pattern, the rash, and the cloudy mental state (also called coma vigil).

For travelers to the developing world, especially VFRs (visitors to friends or relatives), there are 2 basic modalities to avoid this infection:
- avoidance of risky drinks and foods and
- vaccination.

CDC summarizes these modalities on its website at https://www.cdc.gov/typhoid-fever/index.html:
"1. "Boil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it"
- if you drink water, buy it bottled or bring it to a rolling boil for 1 minute before you drink it. Bottled carbonated water is safer than uncarbonated water;
- ask for drinks without ice unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water;
- avoid popsicles and flavored ices that may have been made with contaminated water;
- eat foods that have been thoroughly cooked and that are still hot and steaming;
- avoid raw vegetables and fruits that cannot be peeled. Vegetables like lettuce are easily contaminated and are very hard to wash well;
- when you eat raw fruit or vegetables that can be peeled, peel them yourself. (Wash your hands with soap first.) Do not eat the peelings;
- avoid foods and beverages from street vendors. It is difficult for food to be kept clean on the street, and many travelers get sick from food bought from street vendors.

2. Vaccinations
If you are traveling to a country where typhoid is common, you should consider being vaccinated against typhoid. Visit a doctor or travel clinic to discuss your vaccination options.

Remember that you will need to complete your vaccination at least 1-2 weeks (dependent upon vaccine type) before you travel so that the vaccine has time to take effect. Typhoid vaccines lose effectiveness after several years; if you were vaccinated in the past, check with your doctor to see if it is time for a booster vaccination. Taking antibiotics will not prevent typhoid fever; they only help treat it.

The chart below provides basic information on typhoid vaccines that are available in the USA.
Vaccine name / How given / Number Doses / Time between doses / Booster
Ty21a / 1 capsule orally / 4 / 2 days / 5 years
Typhim Vi / Injection / 1 / N/A / 2 years
(The old parenteral heat-phenol-inactivated vaccine -- manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst -- has been discontinued)."

Regarding typhoid immunization, an important report has been published online recently (28 Sep 2017) in Lancet: Jin C, Gibani MM, Moore M, et al: Efficacy and immunogenicity of a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in the prevention of typhoid fever using a controlled human infection model of _Salmonella_ Typhi: a randomised controlled, phase 2b trial. Lancet http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32149-9.pdf.

An excellent accompanying editorial (Nicholas A Feasey NA, Levine MM: Typhoid vaccine development with a human challenge model. Lancet (http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32407-8.pdf) is reproduced below (the references cited can be found at the original URL):

"Experimental human typhoid fever challenge was first described in 1896 by Wright, who vaccinated 2 men against typhoid fever and challenged one with what was then known as _Salmonella typhosa_ [1]. While challenge models are sometimes controversial, they offer enormous potential to study the pathogenesis of disease and to accelerate vaccine development, particularly in human-restricted pathogens such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi. The Maryland typhoid human challenge model, which ran from 1952 to 1974, led to insights into typhoid fever and facilitated the development of live attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a [2, 3]. A 21st-century typhoid challenge model has been developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group [4].

In The Lancet, Celina Jin and colleagues [5] report results from challenging 3 groups of healthy adults from Oxford, UK, who were randomly assigned to receive Vi-conjugate vaccine, unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide vaccine, or control vaccine (ACYW135 meningococcal conjugate) with wild-type Quailes strain _S._ Typhi. Results of this volunteer challenge have been awaited with much anticipation by the public health community interested in control of typhoid fever in endemic areas of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where _S._ Typhi is increasingly antibiotic resistant and few treatment options remain. Vi-conjugate vaccines that have been in development represent a new instrument to help to control typhoid. The most advanced conjugate vaccine, Typbar-TCV (Vi-polysaccharide [Vi-PS] conjugated to tetanus toxoid, Vi-TT, Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India), is licensed in India where it has been shown to elicit robust serum Vi antibody responses after only 1 dose, even in Indian infants as young as 6 months [6]. In toddlers, older children, and adults, Typbar-TCV was shown to be significantly more immunogenic than the unconjugated Bharat Vi-PS [6]. Bharat Biotech has submitted an application to WHO for pre-qualification of their Vi-TT. If approved, this would allow the vaccine to be procured by UN agencies. However, despite evidence of safety and immunogenicity in Indian children and adults, heretofore, there has been no evidence of actual efficacy of the vaccine in diminishing the attack rate of typhoid fever upon exposure to virulent _S._ Typhi compared with the control participants. Importantly, the authors provide the first data documenting that Typbar-TCV is protective.

112 participants were enrolled in this observer and participant-blinded, randomised controlled trial, which showed that the Vi-TT is well tolerated, achieved 100 percent seroconversion of Vi antibody (versus 89 percent for Vi-PS), and stimulated significantly higher geometric mean titres than did unconjugated Vi-PS. Most importantly, Jin and colleagues document that Vi-TT recipients had a significantly lower attack rate for the primary aim endpoint diagnosing typhoid fever than control recipients. With the primary endpoint used in this ambitious trial, the attack rate for typhoid diagnosis was 24 (77 percent) of 31 in control participants, 13 (35 percent) of 37 in Vi-TT recipients, and 13 (35 percent) of 35 in those who received Vi-PS. This translates into vaccine efficacies of 54.6 percent (95 percent CI 26.8-71.8) for Vi-TT and 52.0 percent (23.2-70.0) for Vi-PS.

As the authors suggest, the field efficacy of Vi-TT vaccine might be higher; for example, a well designed and executed field trial of an unlicensed Vi-conjugate produced by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) in Vietnamese pre-school children showed an efficacy of 89 percent (95 percent CI 76-97) over 46 months of follow-up. [7] One possible explanation lies in the primary endpoint of so-called typhoid infection used by Jin and colleagues [5] (persistent fever of 38 deg C or higher for 12 hours or longer or _S._ Typhi bacteremia), which arguably is better suited to studying typhoid pathogenesis than assessing the efficacy of typhoid vaccines. Using slightly different endpoints such as fever 38 deg C or higher followed by a positive blood culture, similar to surveillance in a field trial and to endpoints used in the Maryland challenge model, Jin and colleagues [5] report that the efficacy of Vi-TT was 87.1 percent (95 percent CI 47.2-96.9), while efficacy of Vi-PS was 52.3 percent (-4.2 to 78.2). Although future typhoid challenges based on this as a co-primary endpoint would require larger sample sizes, the information gained might be more relevant and predictive of the efficacy that might be noted in a randomised controlled field trial. This highlights the need for the phase 3 and 4 trials, the first of which is expected to be initiated in Asia in late 2017 by the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), a partnership between the University of Maryland, the University of Oxford, and PATH funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. However, because it will be some years before these field trials are reported, Jin and colleagues' challenge study results are timely and engender optimism that an effective new instrument has become available to help to control typhoid in hyperendemic populations."
