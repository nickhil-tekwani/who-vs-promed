4 more H5N1 cases reported in Egypt
-----------------------------------
A recent flurry of human H5N1 influenza cases in Egypt continued with at least 4 more over the past 5 days, along with 2 deaths, according to media and government reports.

Two cases involved a 6-year-old girl from Giza governorate who was in critical condition and a 45-year-old man from Menoufiya governorate who was on a respirator, according to a machine-translated Egyptian Ministry of Health (MOH) statement that was posted 1 Jan [2015] on the infectious-disease blog Avian Flu Diary (AFD).

The 2 cases raised Egypt's H5N1 count for 2014 to 29 cases, with 11 deaths, the MOH said.

The 45-year-old man apparently died of his illness, as a 3 Jan [2015] English-language report from Ahram Online noted the death of a 45-year-old Menoufiya man that day. It said he had had pneumonia and had been on a ventilator.

Two additional cases, both in Minya governorate, were revealed today [5 Jan 2015] in a machine-translated AhramOnline report posted on AFD (with a note that a subsequent MOH statement matched it). They involve a 30-year-old man in "medium" condition and an 11-year-old boy in critical condition.

The other death involved a 3-year-old child from Giza governorate, according to a story today [5 Jan 2015] in the Jerusalem Post, citing the MOH. The description matched that of a case-patient reported by the MOH on 31 Dec [2014]. It was not clear today whether the 3-year-old Giza child had any connection with the 6-year-old Giza girl whose case was reported 1 Jan [2015].

CHP notified of human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhaoqing [Guangdong province]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [7 Jan 2015] closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Zhaoqing notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province (GDHFPC), and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the GDHFPC, the male patient, aged 56 with underlying illnesses, was hospitalised for management in critical condition.

To date, 458 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (141 cases), Guangdong (115 cases), Jiangsu (59 cases), Shanghai (42 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (23 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (8 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Shandong (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

All boundary control points have implemented health surveillance measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The DH's Port Health Office has enhanced body temperature checks by handheld devices. ... -- more

"Abstract
---------
The majority of influenza virus-specific antibodies elicited by vaccination or natural infection is only effective against the eliciting or closely related viruses. Rare stem-specific heterosubtypic monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) can neutralize multiple strains and subtypes by preventing hemagglutinin (HA)-mediated fusion of the viral with the endosomal membrane. The epitopes recognized by these hmAbs are therefore considered promising targets for the development of pan-influenza vaccines. Here we report the isolation of a novel human HA-stem-reactive monoclonal antibody, mAb 1.12, with exceptionally broad neutralizing activity encompassing viruses from 15 distinct HA subtypes. Using mAb 1.12 and 2 other monoclonal antibodies, we could demonstrate that neutralization by hmAbs is virtually irreversible but becomes severely impaired following virus attachment to cells. In contrast, no interference by human anti-influenza serum antibodies was found, indicating that apically binding antibodies do not impair access to the membrane-proximal heterosubtypic epitopes. Our findings therefore encourage development of new vaccine concepts aiming at the induction of stem-specific heterosubtypic antibodies, as we provide support for their effectiveness in individuals previously exposed to influenza virus."

"Abstract
---------
From November 2009 to December 2013, 15 influenza C viruses were isolated, using MDCK cells, from specimens obtained from children with severe pneumonia and influenza-like illness (ILI), in the Philippines. This is the 1st report of influenza C virus isolation in the Philippines. In addition, from January 2008 to December 2013, 7 influenza C viruses were isolated from specimens that were obtained from children with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Sendai city, Japan. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemaggultinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein showed that 19 strains (12 from Philippines and 7 from Japan) were similar to the reference strain C/Sao Paulo/378/82(SP82). Phylogenetic analysis of the HE gene showed that strains from the Philippines and Japan formed distinct clusters within an SP82-related lineage. The clusters including the Philippine and Japanese strains were shown to have diverged from a common ancestor around 1993. In addition, phylogenetic analysis of internal genes showed that all strains isolated in the Philippines and Japan had emerged through reassortment events. The composition of the internal genes of the Philippine strains was different from that of the Japanese strains, although all strains were classified into an SP82-related lineage by HE gene sequence analysis. These observations suggest that the influenza C viruses analyzed here had emerged through different reassortment events; however, the time and place at which the reassortment events occurred could not be determined." - Mod.LK]
