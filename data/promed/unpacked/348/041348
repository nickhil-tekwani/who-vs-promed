Strangles may have come from Cambridge
--------------------------------------
New Zealand's South Island may have got a gift from the Harness Jewels in
Cambridge [Waikato, North Island, NZ] it was not expecting, and did not
want, with the current outbreak of strangles in all codes across the country.

Strangles is a highly contagious virus not too much different in some of
its aspects to equine influenza but hopefully with better outcomes. The
virus is believed to have traveled south on a horse float. The Canterbury
harness stable which has been affected does not have a high turnover rate
of imports and exports and believes it might have been carried there by one
of its contenders for the Harness Jewels. The outbreak is believed to be
the worst since a similar one in the early 1980s.

Inoculation is a strong defence unless the animal has already caught the
virus. "Where the virus is already incubated it is in some cases not
effective and can be harmful," said Christchurch veterinarian Bill Bishop.
A horse already infected could become a carrier if it was inoculated and
showed no signs of the disease. The equine influenza virus can also be
spread by horses which have been inoculated post-infection.

An outbreak 1st surfaced in the Waikato about 8 weeks ago though swift
action has limited its dangers there. Young horses including foals are
often the most vulnerable. The average horse will fully recover in about 20
days following a discharge in the throat area from a burst gland after a
buildup of matter. Lack of appetite and a dull manner are giveaway signs as
are discharges but it is crucial that the virus be isolated as soon as
possible in a stable.

From 2 per cent to 5 per cent of horses are estimated by research to have
more serious complications which can be permanent. A Canterbury trainer,
who did not wish to be named, said that modern technology had helped
considerably in fighting the virus which had affected his stable. "Now they
can quickly identify which strain of the virus it is and you can give the
right treatment more quickly. The last time the virus hit badly here you
could not take swabs from some areas where the strain is now identified.
That is crucial to managing it in a stable."

All horses, not just racehorses, can be infected and authorities urge that
all horses on the property be treated. A course of 3 injections is usually
sufficient to contain the virus.

[Harness Jewels is one of the largest harness races in New Zealand. It
consists of 9 races. Generally the runners, and usually the winners, in the
9 races will be leading stake earners throughout the racing season, within
their specific age group.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by
abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The
causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_ , is highly host-adapted and
produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram
positive, capsulated beta-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an
obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3 to 14 days and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106 DEG F [39.4-41.1 DEG C]). Within 24-48 hr of
the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles,
including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and
submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node
involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise
(compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck.
Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal
form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation
in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with
dilute (3-5 per cent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until
discharge ceases. NSAID can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and
fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation
of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary
clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the
course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy
is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and
severe lethargy/anorexia. Administration of penicillin during the early
stage of infection (less than or equal to 24 hr of onset of fever) will
usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial
treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering
horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, IM,
bid) is the antibiotic of choice.

Postexposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses,
and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of
antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of
strangles is reduced by 50 per cent in horses vaccinated with IM products
that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody
requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a
live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal
immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive
(inactivated by core body temperature), like the intranasal influenza
vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at
subsequent IM injection sites (live culture), submandibular
lymphadenophathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.
