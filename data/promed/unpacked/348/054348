Sri Lankans Warned of Spreading Dengue Fever
-----------------------------------------------
Sri Lanka's Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has warned of the
spreading of dengue fever which has left 5 people dead and hundreds of
others hospitalized so far
this year, press reports said Thursday.
People should make a joint effort by taking preventive measures to control
the spread of the disease, the Daily News quoted the minister as saying.
The minister said the Health Ministry alone cannot combat the disease
without community participation as the only way to eradicate dengue is to
eliminate reeding places of mosquitoes.
The Health Ministry has identified industrial establishments in urban areas
as the most vulnerable places which provide breeding grounds for mosquitoes
transmitting the disease.
The Health Ministry had identified 95 positive cases so far this year while
around 600 suspected cases had been reported from several parts of the
country.
In Colombo alone there were 304 suspected cases. Colombo's Lady Ridgeway
Hospital Director Dr. Wimal Jayantha said an average of about 7 children
were admitted every day with suspected dengue.
