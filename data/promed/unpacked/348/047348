A Comment on the Isolation of Neurovirulent Vaccine-derived Strains
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Central Virology Laboratory of the Israel Ministry of Health Public
Health Laboratories has been conducting monthly analysis of sewage from
20-36 sentinel communities in Israel and the Palestinian Authority since
1988, when the last outbreak and cases of poliomyelitis occurred in this
area. In 1998 we recovered a highly diverged, Sabin 2-derived isolate from
one of these routine sewage screenings [see reference and abstract below.
In 1999, 4 additional highly diverged, Sabin 2-derived isolates were
recovered. Sequence analysis of 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and capsid
protein VP1 indicates that while they represent separate lineages with
divergence of up to 10% between themselves and type 2 oral poliovirus
vaccine (OPV), they shared a high number of substitutions in both the 5'UTR
and VP1, suggesting that they were related to the same initial
epidemiological event and that they had been in circulation for at least 6
years. It is important to note that these isolates were detected in the
absence of any paralytic poliomyelitis in communities with very high OPV
coverage. We believe that these isolates represent virus shed by
individuals entering these communities rather than endemic circulation.
Sequence analysis also indicated that these 5 isolates had reverted at the
neurovirulence attenuation sites. Of these 3 were found to be highly
neurovirulent, and one mildly neurovirulent in transgenic mice containing
the human poliovirus receptor. The remaining one is currently being evaluated.
The presence in the environment of a highly evolved, neurovirulent
OPV-derived poliovirus in the absence of polio cases has important
implications to the strategies for the cessation of immunization with OPV
following global polio eradication. It appears unlikely that the presence
of a neurovirulent, highly diverged Sabin 2 derivative currently presents
any significant increased risk to a well-immunized community over that
already presented by the frequent excretion of neurovirulent OPV-derived
strains by normal OPV recipients. However, the evidence presented on type 2
OPV-derived cases in Egypt and now type 1 OPV-derived cases in Dominican
Republic and Haiti clearly bears out our warning of the potential dangers
of such OPV-derived isolates in communities with either poor or spotty OPV
coverage and in any communities after cessation of immunization.

others (2000). A Highly Evolved Derivative of the Type 2 Oral Poliovaccine
Strain Isolated from Sewage in Israel: Molecular and Antigenic
Characterization. J. Clin. Microbiology 38: 3729-3734. The abstract of this
paper reads as follows: An unusual, highly diverged derivative of the Sabin
type 2 oral poliovaccine (OPV) strain was recovered from environmental
samples during routine screening for wild polioviruses. Virus was
cultivated in L20B cells and then passaged on BGM cells at 40Â° C RCT
(reproductive capacity at supraoptimal temperature) to select against most
OPV strains. All but 1 of 25 RCT-positive OPV-derived environmental
isolates were antigenically and genetically (>99.5% VP1 sequence match)
similar to the respective Sabin strains. However, isolate PV2/4568_1/ISR98
(referred to below as 4568-1) escaped neutralization with Sabin 2-specific
monoclonal antibodies and cross-absorbed sera, and had multiple nucleotide
substitutions (220 of 2646; 8.3%) in the P1 capsid region. [14 of the 44
associated amino acid substitutions in the capsid mapped to neutralizing
antigenic sites. Neutralizing titers in the sera of 50 Israeli children 15
years of age were significantly lower to 4568-1 (geometric mean titer
[GMT, 47) than to Sabin 2 (GMT, 162) or to the prototype wild strain,
PV2/MEF-1/EGY42 (GMT, 108). 2 key attenuating sites had also reverted in
4568-1 (A481 to G in the 5'-untranslated region and VP1 amino acid I143 to
T), and the isolate was highly neurovirulent for transgenic (PVR-Tg21) mice
expressing the poliovirus receptor. The extensive genetic divergence of
4568-1 from the parental Sabin 2 strain suggested that the virus had
replicated in one or more people for ~6 years. The presence in the
environment of a highly evolved, neurovirulent OPV-derived poliovirus in
the absence of polio cases has important implications to the strategies for
the cessation of immunization with OPV following global polio eradication.
