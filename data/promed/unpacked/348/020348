The ongoing measles outbreak in the United States has reached a record for any year since the disease was eliminated in this country 14 years ago.

The largest measles clusters are in Ohio, California and New York, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost all -- 97 percent -- have been brought into the country by travelers, mainly Americans, who contracted the infection abroad. About half of the infections were picked up in the Philippines, where a large measles outbreak has affected more than 32 000 people, according to the CDC. In this country, the biggest outbreak is centered in the Amish community in Ohio, where many residents are unvaccinated.

"This is a wake-up call for travelers and parents to make sure vaccinations are up to date," said Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that generally affects young children, causing fever, a runny nose, a cough and a distinctive rash all over the body. This year [2014], however, more than half the people who have come down with it are 20 years old or older, according to CDC data.

About one in 10 children with measles also gets ear infections, and one in 20 develops pneumonia. A person with measles is contagious for as long as 4 days before symptoms appear. Parents and even doctors who have not seen measles in years may not be aware of the early signs. In the past 20 years, a public health campaign, especially targeting lower-income families, has made measles outbreaks rare in the United States. But an estimated 20 million people are infected in Europe, Asia, Africa and elsewhere each year, and 122 000 die. In the United States, the number of people who choose not to be immunized for religious, philosophical or personal reasons has begun to become a public health problem, Schuchat said. Others are unaware of, or are unable to get, vaccinations before they arrive in the United States.

A small number of adults can lose their immunity over time and may need to be revaccinated. Authorities are not sure how the disease entered the Amish community in Ohio, but Schuchat said they believe that people traveling to conduct faith-based work abroad are involved. According to the CDC, 40 importations were attributed to unvaccinated U.S. travelers returning from abroad.

Although the vaccine generally is not given to children before the 1st birthday, infants as young as 6 months old who are being taken abroad can be inoculated with one dose, Schuchat said. Those born before 1957 are likely to have had the measles and should be immune, she added. The vaccine became available in 1963.

State health officials say 2 cases of measles in the Wichita area are linked to a recent outbreak in the bistate Kansas City metropolitan area.

The Sedgwick County cases reported Thursday [11 Jul 2014] involve an unvaccinated adult and an infant who is too young to be vaccinated. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment says the state has now had 5 cases of measles this year [2014]. Officials did not disclose the relationship between the Wichita-area cases and those in Johnson County, Kansas, and nearby Clay County, Missouri.

Four Clay County residents were diagnosed with measles in mid-May 2014, including an unvaccinated infant who had traveled abroad with family members. In early June 2014, an adult and an unvaccinated child in Johnson County contracted measles after having contact with some of the Missouri patients.

http://clermontsun.com/2014/07/09/measles-outbreak-raising-concerns-for-surrounding-counties/


The Ohio Department of Health has confirmed a case of measles in southwest Ohio. The Highland County Health Department stated that an infant less than 6 months old has contracted the virus. Their family traveled in mid-May 2014 to north-central Ohio, where 6 counties are now experiencing a measles outbreak.

The state's measles outbreak is the largest outbreak in the United States since 1994, with experts stating that a lack of immunizations is the main cause. "Contracting measles is especially serious for infants younger than 12 months old," said ODH State Epidemiologist Dr. Mary DiOrio. "Parents with infants too young to be vaccinated should consider not traveling with them to areas where measles outbreaks are occurring."

Due to this case, and many others, Governor Jon Kasich has authorized pharmacists to give the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine to adults 18 years and older in order to prevent the further spread of the outbreak.

Since January 2014, there have been 298 reported cases of measles and 419 cases of mumps in Ohio. So far, Clermont County has not seen any measles cases; the county is working hard to take preventative measures. The state of Ohio is also encouraging all individuals of proper age and health to get vaccinated. Today, death from measles is rare in the U.S., with an average of one per year thanks to vaccines.

A 2nd measles case was confirmed Wednesday [9 Jul 2014] in Pierce County, and Health Department officials are trying to alert people who might have been exposed.

The infected woman visited a Tacoma Albertson's grocery store and Tacoma General during the 4th of July [2014] weekend, the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department said. The young woman, who had been in close contact with the county's 1st case, was in the following locations while infectious with measles:

- 3 Jul 2014, Noon-2:30 p.m. Albertson's, 111 S. 38th St., Tacoma
- 3 Jul 2014, 5-11:30 p.m. Tacoma General Hospital Emergency Department
- 4 Jul 2014, 2 a.m.-3 p.m. Tacoma General Hospital Emergency Department

People who visited these locations during those times should contact their regular health care provider to let them know they were exposed to the measles, Health Department officials said.

The 1st Pierce County case was exposed to one of the King County cases in a Pierce County emergency department on 10 Jun 2014. The Health Department announced the 1st case on 27 Jun 2014. Pierce County residents should check their vaccination records to ensure they are up to date on the measles vaccination and other important vaccinations.

The King County cases are in a community from the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), where a large measles outbreak is occurring, health officials said. The 1st Pierce County case was exposed to one of the King County cases in a Pierce County emergency department on 10 Jun 2014.

[Subsequently, Washington state health officials reported on Thu 11 Jul 2014 the highest number of measles cases since 1996 and urged residents to seek vaccinations against the preventable disease during the state's 3rd outbreak of the virus this year [2014] (see: http://whbl.com/news/articles/2014/jul/11/measles-cases-hit-18-year-high-in-washington-state/). Washington has been hit with 27 cases of measles so far in 2014, up from 5 last year [2013], and more than were reported in the state during the past 5 years combined. The outbreaks in Washington have coincided with a slight decline in the number of residents receiving a vaccination that also protects against mumps and rubella, said Kelly Stowe, spokeswoman for the Washington State Department of Health. - Mod.CP]

Over the past few months, 5 News has been alerting you to the measles outbreaks that have been happening across the nation, but did you know our state has one of the lowest rates around? This May 2014, measles was at a 20 year high in the U.S. The CDC said there were almost 300 identified cases. What's even worse is this contagious disease was considered to be completely gone about 14 years ago.

In our state though, it's a different story. There hasn't been a measles outbreak in our state since 1994. Experts said that's because our state doesn't allow children to enroll in kindergarten without getting their full roster of vaccines, no matter what their parents' personal or spiritual beliefs may be. The only exception is for rare medical cases. One retired Marion County school teacher said she remembers just how strict the school system is about vaccinations. "I taught middle school in Marion County. The rules are there, and I didn't ever have any students that had measles. Our state's vaccination rate is at about 96 percent, which is above the national average of 94.5 percent.

http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2014/20140708/en/


Mongolia is officially measles free. The Government received a measles-elimination certificate from the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific. Mongolia joins Australia, Macao SAR (China) and the Republic of Korea as the only countries and areas in the Western Pacific that have a 95 percent population immunity level against the disease.

"This is an important step towards measles elimination in the Western Pacific Region," said Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO Regional Director for the Western Pacific. "It demonstrates that measles elimination is not only theoretically feasible, but also achievable in middle- and low-income countries and areas of the Western Pacific."

At a ceremony in the Mongolian capital, Prime Minister Norovyn Altankhuyag noted the success of the country's measles immunization efforts over the past 40 years and congratulated health-care workers and parents, as well as WHO, UNICEF and other partners for supporting its measles immunization campaigns.

"Mongolia's achievements in eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases are due to its strong immunization programme and the government's commitment," said Dr Mark Jacobs, Director of Communicable Diseases at the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific.

"This certification recognizes Mongolia's regional leadership in the fight against measles. From 1920-1950, basically every child in Mongolia used to fall ill with measles, and in 1960s-1980s, measles was still the leading cause of death among children from 0-4 years of age," explained Dr Jalkhaa Kupul, advisor to National Centre of Public Health at Mongolia's Ministry of Health. In 1973, the introduction of a WHO-provided measles vaccine proved vital. After the successful pilot programme, Mongolia started receiving measles vaccines from WHO in 1974.

The press service of the Omsk Region Rospotrebnadzor has reported that the epidemiological situation with regard to measles virus infection remains precarious. Thus, 19 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded during the period from 7 May to 7 Jul 2014. Of these cases, one was a child aged 11 months, and 18 were adults aged 18 to 52 years, including 6 students, 2 medical workers, one railway worker, 5 employees of other organisations and 4 unemployed. In the area, there are 1252 children vaccinated against measles. 60 percent of the cases were due to parental failure to ensure protective vaccination of their children.

Measles is a severe infectious disease characterized by 100 percent susceptibility, and the further development of complications can subsequently lead to death. Priorities for emergency vaccination are children and adults with no age limit who have been in contact with a patient during the 1st 3 days of infection and no previous history of vaccination. Children under the recommended age of vaccination should receive immunoglobulin.

Vaccinations are free of charge at clinics, at places of residence, or at work.

United Nations relief agencies and their partners working amid the ongoing turmoil and massive population displacement in Iraq are scaling up their healthcare responses, with a major polio vaccination campaign in Baghdad, and efforts to help relieve the "immense burden" on the existing healthcare system in Kurdistan.

Speaking to the press in Geneva today [4 Jul 2014], Dan Epstein, spokesperson for the UN World Health Organization (WHO), said the agency and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) are cooperating on polio vaccination in Iraq. "Sub-regional vaccination campaigns in Baghdad and 2 other Governorates have just been completed, and according to the monitoring of the Iraqi Red Crescent, 95.5 per cent of children under 5 had been reached," he said, adding that a campaign had also been carried out in 9 Governorate districts, where more than 23 000 thousand children had received polio vaccines.

Regarding communicable diseases, he said 5 suspected cases of measles have been recorded among internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Anbar, and water quality is being tested to reduce to the risk of diarrhoeal diseases. There is a risk assessment mission going to various IDP areas, and public health experts from the WHO have trained local health officials.

"WHO is working with Kurdish health authorities on an early warning electronic system; [our] goal is to cover 600 out of the 1000 health facilities in Kurdistan," Mr. Epstein concluded.

[Anbar Govermorate, covering almost all of western Iraq, is Iraq's largest governorate but also the most sparsely populated. The governorate borders Saudi Arabia, Syria and Jordan. Between 2003 and 2005, the city of Falluja was the scene of continued confrontations between the Multi National Forces in Iraq (MNF-I) and armed groups in which many civilians were killed. Following an improvement in the security situation since 2007, security control in Anbar was handed over to the Government of Iraq in September 2008. Two years of drought have had a negative impact on the rural population's lives and livelihoods. Over a quarter (27 percent) of children in the governorate are chronically malnourished.

Health authorities have declared a measles outbreak in Alabel town in Sarangani Province due to the increasing cases of the highly contagious measles virus disease in the area.

The Alabel Municipal Health Office (MHO) chief said Tuesday [8 Jul 2014] that they already had recorded a total of 189 "clinically-confirmed" measles cases and 2 fatalities as a result of its complications in 9 of the town's 13 barangays [districts]. He said that the majority of these cases were detected in the last 3 months, starting from the 2nd week of April 2014.

"The increase was very unusual and quite significant. So far, almost all our barangays are already affected by the outbreak," he told MindaNews in a telephone interview.

The Director said the outbreak predominantly affected parts of Barangay Pag-asa, which posted 110 cases in the months of May and June 2014 alone. The other measles cases were detected in barangay Domolok with 44; Alegria with 16; Poblacion with 9; Datal Anggas with 4; Bagacay and Kawas with 2 each; and, Paraiso and Ladol with one each, he said. He said the 2 fatalities, who were all children, came from Barangays Pag-asa and Alegria, which recorded the initial measles cases.

The official said they earlier took blood samples from the patients and sent them to the Department of Health's (DOH) Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Alabang, Muntinlupa City, but it has yet to release the results. The DOH and the World Health Organization consider a single confirmed or positive case of measles by way of serological examination as an outbreak. But the Director said they declared the outbreak even with the absence of the test results from the RITM, noting that measles could easily be detected and confirmed clinically.

Last year [2013], the Alabel MHO only recorded a single case of measles within the town's 13 barangays. It listed 7 cases in 2012 and 33 in 2011. No fatality case was recorded in the area out of the confirmed measles cases from 2011 to 2013. To address the problem, Fabio said they have intensified their disease surveillance and measles immunization activities in the entire municipality.

Health authorities said today [9 Jul 2014] a person recently arrived in Cairns (Queensland) from Papua New Guinea on flight Air Niugini PX98 had been identified as carrying the highly contagious disease. This follows a case confirmed last week also involving a traveller on flight PX090 from Papua New Guinea on 29 Jun 2014.

The new case arrived in Cairns on Sunday [6 Jul 2014] and attended a GP clinic and the Callana Pharmacy on McLeod St on Monday [7 Jul 2014].

Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair said people who were unvaccinated, particularly those born during or after 1966, should visit their GP for a 2nd dose of the measles vaccine. Anyone on the flight or in Cairns displaying those symptoms should contact their GP before making an appointment to avoid infecting other people attending medical clinics.

Waikato District Health Board's Population Health service has to date (8 Jul 2014) been notified of 101 confirmed measles cases; of these, 53 are laboratory confirmed; the rest are close contacts of a confirmed case with a clinically compatible illness.

Over one quarter of the confirmed cases are household contacts of a confirmed case and were already placed in quarantine before they were unwell. Approximately 80 per cent of cases are between 10-20 years of age. The other 20 per cent are aged under 10 years and are close contacts of confirmed cases in quarantine as they were not vaccinated. Nine cases have been hospitalised but are now well.

Of the 101 cases, only 4 have been immunised with 2 documented doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 4 cases have received one documented dose of MMR (not fully immunised for dates).

Approximately 70 cases with a clinical illness like measles have been investigated and were found not to have measles.

[13] The argument for compulsory vaccination
Date: 8 Jul 2014
From: Richard Gould <richard.gould@cdha.nshealth.ca> [edited]


From The Encephalitis Society Fact Sheet: "Measles causes encephalitis in around one in 1000 children. Measles encephalitis caused the death of Roald Dahl's daughter Olivia in 1962. He became an ardent supporter of measles vaccination as a result of the tragic loss of his daughter. He wrote a letter to parents encouraging them to get their children vaccinated [reproduced below]. He dedicated James and the Giant Peach and the BFG to Olivia."

"Olivia, my eldest daughter, caught measles when she was 7 years old. As the illness took its usual course, I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it. Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn't do anything. In an hour, she was unconscious. In 12 hours she was dead.

The measles had turned into a terrible thing called measles encephalitis, and there was nothing the doctors could do to save her. That was 24 years ago in 1962, but even now, if a child with measles happens to develop the same deadly reaction from measles as Olivia did, there would still be nothing the doctors could do to help her.

The ideal time to have it done is at 13 months, but it is never too late. All school-children who have not yet had a measles immunisation should beg their parents to arrange for them to have one as soon as possible."

Incidentally, 2 of Roauld Dahl's classic books for children, "James and the Giant Peach," and "The BFG," are dedicated to her memory following her death from measles virus infection. You will see her name at the beginning of each of these books. And I know how happy she would be if only she could know that her death had helped to save a good deal of illness and death among other children.
