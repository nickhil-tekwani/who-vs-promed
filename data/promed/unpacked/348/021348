The El Paso County Coroner's office is reporting the 1st local death from botulism since 2008. The coroner reported that an 80-year-old woman died after eating prepared potatoes that had been previously frozen and then were left at room temperature for nearly 2 weeks.

The El Paso County Health Department says improper food storage was also the cause of the last death from botulism more than a decade ago.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism occur from home prepared foods which are stored or canned improperly. No information is given with regard to how the diagnosis was made and whether anti-botulinum antitoxin was given.

Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

An October 2013 article in PLoS Pathogens (1) found that several auxiliary proteins produced by the organism bound to botulinum toxin A and facilitated its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract via multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Indeed, in mice it seemed possible to block the neuromuscular effects of botulinum toxin by blocking absorption using a non-metabolizable galactose analog called isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and prolonged median survival time. The same group more recently, in June 2014, published (2) that the same hemagglutinin complex of the progenitor toxin complex bound to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, as well as carbohydrate binding and facilitated paracellular absorption of the toxin complex. Abolishing either the E-cadherin or carbohydrate binding of the toxin complex drastically reduced oral toxicity.
