A teenager infected with HIV before birth remains healthy after 12 years without treatment. This 1st case of long-term remission gives scientists new insights into the potential effectiveness of early HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] detection and treatment. Researchers say early detection of HIV and treatment can, in some cases, limit infection.

A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for AIDs. The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an AIDS conference in Vancouver, Canada by doctors from the Institut Pasteur [Paris] who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the 1st weeks of her life. Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a "functional cure," because the child had no detectable virus. However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.

This time, there is more caution. It is the 1st case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent. The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for 6 weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load, and she was put on a cocktail of 3 antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV. When the girl was 6 years old, the family decided to stop the drugs, and for 6 months, doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable, although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.

There are people known as "elite controllers" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier Saez-Cirion of the HIV, Inflammation and Persistence Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the French woman does not have the genetic factors associated with those persons. "Most likely, she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection." That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection, and all except 2 still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.

Saez-Cirion said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the 1st 6 months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the 2 remaining, one lasted for 3 years without needing drugs, and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.

"She is doing perfectly well," said Saez-Cirion. "She has a healthy life with no complications." But he added: "Very clearly, this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission." The case was presented at the 8th International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: "We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure ... The child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About one percent of people can do that."

Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. It was possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.

"The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop," she said. "These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative."
