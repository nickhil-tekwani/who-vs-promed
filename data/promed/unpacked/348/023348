2 children die of measles
-------------------------
Two children suffering from measles lost their lives, while dozen others affected in mountainous area of the district on Monday [10 Jan 2017].

According to details, 2 children suffering from measles died while dozen others affected in Wala Shahal area of Sherani district [Balochistan province]. Officials of the health department have confirmed the death in far-flung mountainous areas that lack health facilities. They were identified as a 2-year-old and 3-year-old.

District Health Officer Dr. Arif Shah said that medical team has been dispatched to the affected area on emergency basis to cope with the situation and immunize the children.

Last week, 9 children suffering from measles in different areas of Kibzai Tang Sar Union Council, had died while dozens others were affected. The area people had alleged that the entire focus of health department was on the anti-polio campaign while no measure was being taken to prevent other diseases. Poor quality and ailing routine vaccination program were the factors in the surge of measles cases. They fear that more children will suffer in the affected area, if the vaccination campaign was not launched immediately.

The measles is a respiratory infection caused by a virus that can spread via contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Sneezing and coughing can release contaminated droplets into the air, adding children who suffer from measles may experience complications including pneumonia, blindness, deafness, ear infection, diarrhea and dehydration. Routine immunization for children is highly effective in preventing measles.

Australians warned to guard against measles
-------------------------------------------
Health authorities issue important immunisation advice.

Following a measles health scare aboard an international flight to Sydney last week, health authorities are warning Australians to be on the lookout for visible symptoms and have offered guidance on how to minimise the risk of infection.

NSW [New South Wales] Health reports a young woman, infected with the measles virus, travelled on Virgin Australia Airlines flight VA70 from Denpasar, Bali to Sydney, Australia on 1 Jan 2017.

The woman presented to Sutherland Hospital emergency department on 4 Jan [2017] and the hospital has been contacting people and patients who may have been exposed during her visit.

NSW Health said this was an isolated case and not linked to the 4 cases reported last month [December 2016].

In December 2016, the ABC reported 4 people who had spent a significant amount of time in Sydney's metropolitan area had been diagnosed with the infectious and easily contagious measles virus.

WA [Western Australia] authorities identified 2 new measles cases in children from non-vaccinating families last month [December 2016].

In July 2016, there was a spate of measles cases in Victoria. Then, Victoria's acting chief health officer Finn Romanes warned there was a good chance more cases had gone unnoticed.

Symptoms include fever, sore eyes and coughing followed 3 or 4 days later by a red, blotchy rash spreading from the head and neck to the rest of the body.

Measles can have serious medical complications, particularly for young children.

Children or adults born during or since 1966 who don't have documented evidence of receiving 2 doses of measles vaccine, or evidence of previous infection, should be vaccinated.

For young children, the measles vaccine is recommended at 12 months and again at 18 months of age.

Two doses of the vaccine generally provides lifelong protection.

NSW Health offers free MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine through registered GPs for people born after 1965 with no record of having received 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

Measles on rise in Switzerland
------------------------------
70 measles cases were detected in Switzerland by health authorities in 2016, up from 36 infections 2 years ago, Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve reported Wednesday [11 Jan 2017], citing latest figures from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH).

According to the report, half of last year's [2016] cases were due to 2 outbreaks in Lausanne and Engadin. Most of those who contracted the highly-contagious disease had either not been inoculated or had only received 1 dose of the vaccination.

FOPH reminded that to prevent the spread of the disease in a country, at least 95 percent of its population born after 1964 (before which time no vaccine was available) must have received 2 doses of the serum.

The most recent data on vaccination levels in the confederation, from 2014, shows that 93 percent of the Swiss population aged 2 and above has been vaccinated at least once, while 86 percent has received 2 jabs.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), over 134 000 measles deaths were recorded globally in 2015, with 95 percent of fatalities recorded in low-income and weak health infrastructure countries.

[Parents whose children are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated place their children at risk of contracting measles, which can be associated with severe disease, not only in Europe, but also in the United States.

See http://www.wbap.com/2017/01/06/measles-outbreak-feared-for-texas/ from 6 Jan 2017 [edited]:
The largest measles outbreak in recent memory occurred in Ohio's Amish country [USA] where 383 people were sickened last year [2016] after several traveled to the Philippines and brought the virus home. While that outbreak got the public's attention, it's nowhere near the level of the latest measles outbreak that originated at Disneyland in December [2015], prompting politicians to weigh in and parents to voice their vaccinations views on Internet message boards.

Measles has been making a comeback in recent months and Baylor College medical researcher Peter Hotez says Texas may be facing a widespread outbreak. Hotez told KXAN News more parents are opting out of vaccinating their kids and it's a big concern for state lawmakers.

Austin [Texas] Democrat Donna Howard is promoting a bill to require parents to talk with a doctor before deciding against vaccinating their kids.

Measles is a highly contagious disease that requires hospitalization for 1 in 4 people infected. Symptoms include fever, an itchy skin rash, runny nose and red eyes. The Centers for Disease Control says 9 out of every 10 people exposed to the disease will be infected. It is especially dangerous for children under the age of 5.

Measles had been declared eradicated among U.S. citizens by the year 2000 thanks to near universal vaccination. Since then many people have become concerned about the long-term effects of vaccinations and are choosing to skip them for babies. The majority of measles-related deaths are children.
