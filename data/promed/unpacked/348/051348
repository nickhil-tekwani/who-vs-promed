Situation update
- Since the last update (of 26 Jan 2018), 6 new suspect RVF cases have been reported in Yirol East. These include 2 males and 4 females aged 7-60 years, and clustered in Wonthow payam, Yirol East county. There are currently no suspect cases on admission.
- The number of alerts have continued to decline in the week with the last alert that met case definition being reported on 25 Jan 2018; 3 alerts were reported from 26 - 27 Jan 2018, but they all did not meet the case definition. From 28 Jan 2018 to date, there have been no new alerts from all the areas under surveillance.
- However, reports of illness and death in Livestock are still rampant in the outbreak area where for example on 31 Jan 2018, the rapid response team witnessed 4 sick goats, one aborted and 2 had nose bleeding in Acigoor village close to the Thonabutkok village. The MLF/FAO team is conducting follow up investigations. Additional reports of animal deaths after short illness of 3-4 days in Pem cattle camp, Awerial county are also being investigated.
- As of 2 Feb 2018, a total of 26 suspect RVF human cases have been reported in Eastern Lakes State. Out of the 26 suspect human cases reported since 7 Dec 2017, 3 human cases have been confirmed, 3 died and were classified as probable cases with epidemiological linkage to the 3 confirmed cases, 4 were classified as non-cases following negative laboratory results for RVF, and 16 are still classified suspect cases due to pending or partial laboratory sample testing.
- During the week, 5 new samples were sent to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for testing on 31 Jan 2018 and the test results are still pending.

Initial reports on the event
- On 28 Dec 2017, the Eastern Lakes Ministry of Health reported a suspect viral hemorrhagic fever cluster to the National Ministry of Health and WHO. The initial cluster involved 3 deaths in Thonabutkok village, Yali Payam, Yirol East county with 7 Dec 2017 as the earliest date of onset.
- Preliminary investigations conducted by the County Health Department, State and National MoH, CUAMM, and WHO show that the 3 deaths had a severe hemorrhagic illness and were epidemiologically linked by place (Thonabutkok village) and time (with 49 and 51 as the respective epidemiological weeks of illness onset). However, there was no history of close physical contact between the cases and travel history was not significant. In addition, the symptoms were not reported in the respective close case contacts during the clinical illness or even after death.
- There is significant history suggesting a zoonotic hemorrhagic illness as abortions in goats and sheep; deaths/disease in goats and cows; wild bird die-offs have been reported in association with this event cluster.

Brief Case Clinical and Epidemiological Findings
- The putative initial case was a 30-year-old female housewife from Thonabutkok village in Yirol East county. Her illness started on 7 Dec 2017 with fever, headache, neck pain and sudden nose, gum, and injection site bleeding. She reported to a health facility the same day where she was admitted in the maternity ward since she was pregnant. After 8 days of treatment with no improvement, she moved to a private clinic for 4 days where she was treated for malaria and typhoid fever. The illness worsened on 19 Dec 2017 and requested to return home. She died at home the same day. No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- The 2nd case was a 13-year-old female from Thonabutkok village (approximately 150 meters from the putative initial case). Her illness started on 20 Dec 2017 with headache, joint pain, neck pain, fever, generalized swelling at the joints which were painful (ecchymosis), bleeding from the nose and gums. She died at home on 26 Dec 2017 after the she developed bleeding from the skin blisters. Goat and sheep abortions were reported in association with this case. No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- The 3rd case was a 15-year-old male from Thonabutkok village. His illness started on 24 Dec 2017 with headache, fever, sweating, and neck pain, nose bleeding, vomiting of blood and gum bleeding, convulsions and loss of consciousness. He died at home on 27 Dec 2017 after failing to improve on treatment in a private clinic. in the case neighborhood, 8 goat deaths with extensive hemorrhage were reported (the goats were skinned, cooked and eaten). No supervised burial was done, and no symptomatic cases have been reported among the close contacts during the clinical illness and after death.
- As of 2 Feb 2018, the cumulative number of suspect RVF cases had risen to a total of 26 suspect RVF cases including 3 deaths, all reported in Eastern Lakes State. Active surveillance is ongoing to detect, investigate, and initiate supportive care for new suspect cases.
- The case fatality rate among suspect, probable and confirmed cases (excluding non-cases) is 13.64 percent (3/22). More cases have been reported among females 15 (68.1 percent) than males 7 (32.82 percent) (Figure 1).
- Most of the cases have been reported in the 20-19-year age-group with most cases occurring the 10-19-year age-group in the males, while in the females, most cases are reported in the 0-9-year, 20-29-year, and 30-39-year age-groups (Figure 2). The deaths occurred in the 10-19-year and 30-39-year age-groups (Figure 3).
- Figures 4 and 5 show the distribution of cases by time and outcome/epi-classification. The initial probable cases occurred between week 49-52, 2017. During weeks 3 and 4, an increase in suspect cases has been registered, though none have been confirmed.
- Figure 6 shows the distribution of clinical symptoms among suspect, probable, and confirmed cases (excluding non-cases). The most frequent symptoms are non-specific and include fever, headache, neck pains, and joint pains. Bleeding has been reported in 82 percent of suspect cases but none of the confirmed cases had bleeding.
- All the 22 probable, confirmed, and suspect cases (excluding the non-cases) have been reported from Yirol East county in Eastern Lakes state (Figure 7). In Yirol East county, cases have been reported from 5 payams with most 9 (40.90 percent) cases and all the 3 deaths reported from Yali payam.
- All the probable and confirmed cases are clustered in Yali Payam, Thonabutkok village (Figures 8 and 9).

Response updates
Overall coordination of investigation and response activities:
- The overall coordination of investigation and response activities is currently coordinated by a multi-sectoral taskforce that is meeting weekly at the national level and sub-national (Yirol East) level.
- The RVF taskforce meetings at the national and state level were held on 31 Jan 2018 and 1 Feb 2018, respectively. The Yirol East taskforce meeting was chaired by the Director General with the following partners in attendance WHO, UNICEF, FAO, CUAMM, LiveWell, HELP, CCOSS, and CHADO. The highlights of the meeting included:
- The need to intensify animal health investigation and response interventions.
- The arrival of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries/FAO team that will be in Yirol East for one week to conduct animal health investigations, train community animal health workers, and enhance community awareness to facilitate reporting animal cases and promote hygienic animal handling.
- The Ministry of Health, WHO, and CUAMM are currently implementing active case surveillance and alert response.
- There is need for logistical support (fuel) for the 3 vehicles donated by MOH to continue supporting activities. WHO and CUAMM have stepped in to provide fuel in the last weeks.
- The draft contingency plan will be discussed in detail in the meeting next week once the animal health components are incorporated.

Surveillance and case management
- The surveillance, laboratory, entomology, and case management sub-committee meeting convened on 26 Jan 2018 in Juba to review the terms or reference, action, plan and surveillance guidelines including the case definition.
- The WHO/MoH rapid response team is on the group to support the overall coordination, investigation, and response activities in Eastern Lakes state.
- With support from WHO, The MoH has drafted health workers guidelines on RVF case surveillance, investigation, case management, and control. The draft guidelines have been disseminated for input by committee members and subject matter experts at the international level.
- WHO supported 6 teams with a total of 25 community health workers that are conducting active case in the Yirol East. These community health workers have detected and reported alerts from Yali, Pagarua, Tinagau, Khap, Nyanga and Lekakudu payams in the last one week. In Yirol West, the team of 15 community health workers conducted active case search in Anuol and Aruau payams in the last one week. The team also conducted active case search in Aruau PHCU, Acigoor PHCU and Pagarau PHCU.
- The Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries/FAO animal health team arrived in Yirol West on 31 Jan 2018 and participated in the Yirol East taskforce meeting of 1 Feb 2018. The team is expected to lead the animal health investigation and response interventions including sample collection and mobilisation of communities to report sick animals and promote sanitary animal handling.

Weekly update on UNICEF support to the ongoing RVF outbreak (25 Jan- 1 Feb 2018)
- CHADO (UNICEF implementing partner) continued with community engagement, case search and reporting of suspected cases and death of animals. The CHADO team of 27 volunteers is working in close collaboration with the active case search team to engage the community and conduct risk communication.
- Case searching and community mobilization have been activated in Awerial county following reports of cases and deaths of animals: between 16-26 Jan [2018], community mobilizers identified several cases in various locations (97 goats died; one goat had a abortion; 12 cows had sign and symptoms of RVF, and 4 cows died). However, these are pending verification by the MLF/FAO animal health team.

[The number of new suspected cases continues to increase. It is gratifying to see this well-organized and supported interdisciplinary team effort initiating action in the affected village and surrounding areas. The diagnostic laboratory in Uganda is supporting the intensive field surveillance, a critical linkage to find out what is going on in a timely manner. ProMED-mail readers interested in this outbreak are urged to see the full reports at the above URL with the maps and graphs that it contains.

As mentioned earlier, there have been undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic disease in South Sudan several times before. In 2016, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. In that outbreak, several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests (see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic illness - South Sudan (02): addtl. information 20160625.4309572). It is difficult to know whether these earlier outbreaks were due to RVF or to something else.
