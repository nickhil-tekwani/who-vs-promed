In the Mtsensk District, Oryol [Orel oblast] region, Russia, several batches of pork products infected with African swine fever (ASF) have been discovered, according to Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance].

It is assumed that the infected pork products have been for sale for some time and some consumers may have purchased and consumed the products. Also the wastes from these products are used as feed for pigs, which will result in a series of new outbreaks.

According to the press secretary of the department, Olga Chanova, an audit was conducted in response to an outbreak of ASF at the largest pig farm in the Shchekinsky district, Tula region [see ProMED-mail. African swine fever - Russia (03): (TL,BR) OIE, RFI archive no. 20140206.2259800].

"It was found that LLC Lasarevskoye, in the Shchekinsky district, supplied meat products and sausages to the Orel region's selling point," said Olga Chanov. "We have already identified the people who have trade relations with the Tula company."

Rosselkhoznadzor's regional department is trying to figure out whether the products containing ASF have been supplied to any other selling points.

A study carried out on the sausage products identified the ASF genome. Further diagnosis is being carried out in the Vladimir region. The current selling point has been disinfected and quarantined.

[Orel oblast is located in the south western part of the Russia's Central Federal District, with Kaluga and Tula oblasts on its north, Bryansk on its west, Kursk on its south, and Lipetsk on its east.

Results of epidemiological investigations on farms suspected to have been exposed to the contaminated pork products are anticipated.

According to Russia's reports to the OIE, its largest ASF epizootic took place between September 2009 and November 2013. A summary with links to the 111 reports and an interactive map showing the 302 outbreaks is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=8462.

All reports are presented in table form in the pdf document at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014575_20131226_150932.pdf, which includes the following summary:

"Total outbreaks: 302 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Wild species / 753 / 429 / 390 / 333 / 0
Swine / 362 340 / 8170 / 5164 / 337 543 / 6466
Wild boar / 211 / 32 / 24 / 3 / 5"

The term "resolved" is addressed in OIE's document "The World Animal Health Information System", available at http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/the-world-animal-health-information-system/the-oie-data-system/ (accessed 7 Feb 2014), which says:

"Alert procedure:
After having informed the OIE of a significant epidemiological event by means of an immediate notification report, the Member must send weekly Follow-up Reports so that the event can be monitored as it evolves. In all cases, the country must submit a final report to notify either that the event has been resolved or that the disease has become endemic. In both cases, the country will continue to submit information in its six-monthly reports if the disease is on the OIE List".

Another relevant OIE text, addressing the issue, is found in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Chapter 1.1. "Notification of diseases, infections, infestations and epidemiological information"

Article 1.1.3.2:
"Weekly reports subsequent to [an immediate] notification... should continue until the disease, infection or infestation has been eradicated or the situation has become sufficiently stable so that six-monthly reporting... will satisfy the obligation of the Member Country; in any case, a final report on the event should be submitted."

Russia submitted a final report on ASF on 25 Dec 2013, stating, "The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted." The date given for the event "resolved" was 16 Dec 2013. The last previous outbreak had started, reportedly, on 30 Oct 2013 (follow-up report 107).

The continued circulation of the virus is of grave concern to Russia, to its neighbours, and in particular to European countries with dense pig and wild boar populations. - Mod.AS
