Eight new polio cases reported in Pakistan, WHO puts pressure on EPI
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health is facing pressure from international donor
organizations, especially from UNICEF [United Nations Children's
Fund] and the World Heath Organization [WHO], after [a rapid]
increase in polio cases in Pakistan.

According to resources at the Ministry of Health, the Expanded
Programme on Immunization (EPI) is under a great [pressure from]
UNICEF and WHO as 8 new cases were found in a week in Pakistan.

EPI has got the services of the Lady Health Workers [programme] to
run the polio campaign effectively; for this purpose EPI is starting
a 2-day training workshop today [Mon 4 Aug 2008] at a local hotel in
which co-coordinators from district and tehsil [local administrative
division] levels from 44 selected districts will participate. Later
on they will train the other Lady Health Workers in their respective districts.

The most polio cases among the 8 have P1 poliovirus [type 1 wild
poliovirus -- WPV1], which could be epidemic any time and according
to (WHO) P1 could affect 312 children of its surrounding areas.

So far, 23 polio cases have been detected this year [2008] while the
number of cases in previous year was 33.

Meanwhile it could be a great worry if the number of cases increases
from 33 this year [2008].

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 29 Jul 2008 there
have been 17 cases of polio confirmed to date in 2008, as compared
with 11 cases confirmed during the same period in 2007 -- a 55
percent increase in reported cases from the previous year (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).

"- One new case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Swat
district in the North West Frontier Province -- NWFP), bringing the
total number of cases for 2008 to 17. The most recent case had onset
of paralysis on 3 Jul 2008 (WPV1 from NWFP).
- This latest case from Swat follows confirmation of an initial WPV1
case reported from the district last week [21-27 Jul 2008], which had
been the 1st polio case in Swat since June 2007. Both WPV1s were
isolated from children who had never been immunized. Access remains
significantly compromised in this area due to insecurity.
- 2 mop-up campaigns are to be held in response, the 1st as part of
larger subnational immunization days (SNIDs) currently underway, and
the 2nd on 5 Aug 2008 aiming to vaccinate 800 000 children in the
area. Discussions are underway between the District Health
Administration and tribal leadership to ensure increased access to
populations during these immunization campaigns.
-* At the same time, the Federal Ministry of Health convened an
emergency meeting of the NWFP and Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA) health authorities. Discussions focused on the strong
opportunity to eradicate polio and the need to continue the fight
against the disease, drawing on the experience from other polio-free
countries, which had faced similar challenges, such as Somalia. The
meeting discussed ways to ensure access to each and every child by
involving all stakeholders, especially in security-compromised areas of NWFP.
- SNIDs are currently underway (28-30 Jul 2008) using mOPV1
[monovalent oral polio vaccine-1], in all of Sindh, as well as
high-risk areas of Balochistan, NWFP, and Punjab."

Unfortunately vaccination activities in parts of Pakistan have been
significantly influenced (negatively) by civil unrest, as has been
the case in Afghanistan discussed below in part [2] of this update.

Thirteen Afghan polio cases, unrest hampering vaccinations
----------------------------------------------------------
Afghanistan has this year [2008] recorded 13 new cases of polio,
which is only endemic in 3 other countries worldwide, the health
minister said Saturday [2 Aug 2008].

Almost all the new cases were in the southern provinces, which see
the worst of a deadly Taliban rebel-linked insurgency, with the
insecurity hampering efforts to wipe out the crippling disease.

"We have 13 cases since the beginning of this year [2008]," health
minister Mohammad Amin Fatimie told an event to mark the start of a
new round of polio vaccinations.

Most of the cases were in children aged [less than] 2 years, he said.
The number was down from 31 in 2006 and 17 in 2007.

"The 1st challenge is that the immunisation teams are not able to
cover every single house and the enemies of Afghanistan are stopping
the process," Fatimie said, referring to Taliban and other militants.

There are large parts of mainly southern Afghanistan that are
considered dangerous, even for Afghans, with insurgents and other
rebels kidnapping and sometimes killing people associated with the government.

According to an umbrella body of NGOs, the Agency Coordinating Body
for Afghan Relief, 19 non-government organisation workers have been
killed this year [2008]

In some cases Taliban were speaking out against the vaccination
campaign and telling people not to participate, the health minister said.

"The 2nd challenge is that one of the 4 countries that have polio is
a neighbouring country, Pakistan," he said.

Hundreds of people move every day between Afghanistan and Pakistan,
where there have been 20 cases of polio this year [2008], and this
spreads infection.

"Our coverage is 90 percent in insecure areas and in the areas where
there is active fighting, or the area is battlefield, or there is
danger from mines -- they are necessarily out of coverage," ministry
spokesman Abdullah Fahim said. [this paragraph seems to suggest that
in areas with active fighting or where there had been active fighting
and it is known that land mines had been placed, the coverages with
vaccines are suboptimal, whereas other areas in the insecure zone
have reported 90 percent coverage with the vaccines. - Mod.MPP]

The ministry said the 3-day immunisation drive starting Sunday [3 Aug
2008] would see more than 52 000 staff and volunteers deliver oral
polio vaccinations to 7.5 million children across the country.

[According to the most recent information available on the polio
eradication website (dated 29 Jul 2008) as of 29 Jul 2008 there have
been 17 cases of polio confirmed whereas in the same timeframe in
2007 there had been 5 cases of polio confirmed (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>):

"- 2 new cases were reported in the past week (both WPV1s [wild
poliovirus type 1]), bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to
13. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 3 Jul 2008 (WPV1
from Kandahar).
- One of the newly reported cases is from Uruzgan province, in the
Southern Region. It follows confirmation of an initial WPV1 case
reported from this province last week [21-27 Jul 2008], which had
been the 1st polio case reported from Uruzgan since September 2006.
Both WPV1s were isolated from children who had never been immunized.
Access remains significantly compromised in this area due to insecurity.
- Uruzgan will be covered as part of the upcoming National
Immunization Days (NIDs), to be held on 3-5 Aug 2008 (with trivalent OPV)."

The newswire above probably reflects the increase in press coverage
leading up to the National Immunization Days in an attempt to
heighten awareness of the population to the situation with polio in
the country and the need for vaccinations. Unfortunately as both the
newswire and the summary above from the polio eradication website
point out, civil unrest has impeded vaccination activities in the
affected area of the country.

Uruzgan province (Oruzgan on the map) is immediately north of
Kandahar province, which borders with Pakistan to the south.

Debut of type 3 polio dose
--------------------------
The vaccine to treat type 3 polio, many cases of which have been
detected in the country recently, will be used in the state for the
1st time tomorrow [4 Aug 2008].

A type 3 polio case was detected in Howrah's Panchla earlier this
year [2008]. Before that, the type [wild poliovirus type 3] was
detected in 2003.

In 2007, of the 874 cases of polio detected across the country, 794
were type 3. Of the 336 cases this year [2008], 346 were type 3. Of
these, 209 cases were from Bihar.

Considering Bengal's proximity with Bihar and that many migrants come
[to Bihar], experts saw the possibility of the type 3 virus spreading
fast. "We will have the 1st pulse polio round with the monovalent
oral vaccine of type 3 tomorrow [4 Aug 2008] as there is a case in
Howrah and also keeping in mind demographic factors," said state
health commissioner Asim Das.

Studies say the monovalent type 3 vaccine gives greater immunity --
almost 5 times more -- to type 3 cases than the trivalent vaccine.

[According to the most recent polio eradication website update on
polio in India (as of 29 Jul 2008), there have been 331 cases of
polio confirmed to date for 2008 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>.

"- 15 new cases were reported in the past week (one WPV1 from Badaun,
Utttar Pradesh; and 14 WPV3s [wild poliovirus type 3] from Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh), bringing the total number of cases for 2008 to 331.
The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 11 Jul 2008 (WPV3 from
Uttar Pradesh).
- The reporting of a 2nd WPV1 case from Badaun following confirmation
of an initial WPV1 from May [2008] -- both genetically linked to
ongoing WPV1 transmission in access-compromised areas of central
Bihar state -- underscores the risk this particular serotype
continues to pose to children across India.
- A programmatic review of supplementary immunization activity (SIA)
operations in Badaun suggests that the overall quality of activities
being conducted in this district in 2008 has declined. The risk of
further spread of WPV1 in this area of western Uttar Pradesh is
therefore deemed as high, particularly with the onset of the high
season (rainy season) for polio transmission.
- Western Uttar Pradesh had previously been free of WPV1 for more
than 12 months. Efforts must be maximized to prevent the further
spread to other areas within western Uttar Pradesh (such as Moradabad
district).
- In Bihar, specific strategies to reach all populations in
access-compromised areas -- notably the Kosi river basin in the
central part of the state -- continue to be implemented, as part of
urgent efforts to rapidly interrupt the remaining low-level
indigenous WPV1 transmission.
- The strategic use of monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3) is continuing in
both Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with the result that the WPV3 outbreaks
in both states have been significantly controlled.
- The next SIAs are: a mop-up in western Uttar Pradesh (currently
underway, launched on 27 Jul 2008) with monovalent OPV type 1
(mOPV1); and, a mop-up in Bihar and Assam on 10 Aug 2008, using mOPV1
(to be confirmed by the Government of India)."

There was an 11-month-old infant with confirmed WPV3 associated polio
in late June 2008 (see
<http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Minor-detected-with-polio-in-Howrah/326025/>
for more details.

As mentioned by this moderator in an earlier posting on polio in
India, "As a reminder, in recent years, the polio eradication effort
has switched to the use of monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV)
using the vaccine virus type 1 to interrupt transmission of the then
predominant WPV1 circulation in the country. The resurgence of WPV3
as a predominant type in circulation serves to validate that the
widespread use of mOPV1 was successful in interrupting transmission
of WPV1 in most of the country. The clear challenge ahead will be the
interruption of WPV3 circulation without jeopardizing the
interruption of WPV1 circulation." (see ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis:
India 20080303.0876).

The updates above contain information on 3 out of the 4 remaining
endemic countries for polio -- Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The
4th remaining endemic country is Nigeria (see prior ProMED-mail
postings listed below). While the newswires are all oriented towards
announcing immunization activities in the countries, they serve as
good reminders that the WPV is still circulating in this region of
Asia, with increases in reported cases in 2008 to date when compared
to 2007 (166 percent more cases reported in 2008).

According to the polio eradication website statistics, as of 29 Jul
2008, the numbers of confirmed cases of polio reported show a
significant increase from the same period of time in 2007, with 94
percent of cases reported from endemic countries. In all 3 countries
covered in this update (Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India), there have
been significant increases in the reported cases as of 29 Jul 2008
when compared with the reported cases in the same timeframe in 2007
(see tables below from the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>):

Total cases: Year-to-date 2008 / Year-to-date 2007 / Total in 2007
Globally: 896 / 337 / 1315
- in endemic countries:
844 / 278 / 1208
- in non-endemic countries: 52 / 59 / 107

please see the table at

The clear concerns surrounding the increased WPV circulation in the
endemic countries (including Nigeria) are that there will be
importations of the WPV to other areas that have successfully
interrupted WPV circulation with the threat of establishing continued
circulation of WPV in these countries, as occurred in prior years
related to importations from Nigeria and India (see prior ProMED-mail
postings listed below. - Mod.MPP]
