A NSW woman has become the 14th person in less than 2 months to be diagnosed with measles, with health authorities urging people to be alert for symptoms of the condition. The woman, aged in her 40s and who thought she had been vaccinated as a child, became ill after returning home to Sydney from an overseas trip last week, NSW Health said in a statement on Fri [22 Feb 2019].

Between 1 Jan and 18 Feb 2019, 9267 measles cases including 146 deaths were officially reported through the routine surveillance system from the Philippines Department of Health (DoH): a 266% increase with the same time period in 2018 (see Table 1).

Since the declaration of an outbreak in 5 regions on 11 Feb 2019, a surge in the number of measles cases is being observed (see Figure 1), caused by the rapid spread of the disease, which is highly contagious; increased awareness of parents to take their sick children to the nearest health facility, as per DoH advise; as well as improved reporting.

Even more concerning is the drastic increase in the case fatality rate (CFR) from 0.93% on 31 Dec 2018, to 2% on 7 Feb 2019.

With a median age of 2 years old, 61% of measles cases are under 5 years of age. Data from 2018 show that 10% of cases are between 6 and 15 years of age, whereas 15% are between 16 and 30 years of age. The majority of measles cases are male (53%).

As of 18 Feb 2019, 64% of all cases are not vaccinated.

[4] Philippines: vaccine policy
Date: Sat 23 Feb 2019
Source: Rappler [abridged, edited]
https://www.rappler.com/nation/224156-measles-cases-continues-rise-doh-proposes-no-vaccination-no-enrolment-policy


As the number of measles cases continues to rise across the country, the Department of Health (DOH) proposed a "no vaccination, no enrollment" policy in public schools.

"It was just an idea worth studying and objectively looking into its merits or the lack of it," said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III in a text message to Rappler on Sat [23 Feb 2019] when asked about the proposal.

The Department of Education (DepEd) 1st aired the DOH proposal in a statement Friday night, 22 Feb 2019.

"In view of the rising number of measles cases in the country, the Department of Education (DepEd) is studying the proposal of the Department of Health (DOH) to implement a "no vaccination, no enrollment" policy in public schools," the DepEd said.

The DepEd said, however, that it will review the proposal while considering the right of students to learn and access to quality basic education.

"As much as there is a growing need to reinvigorate the campaign for the importance of vaccination, Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones emphasizes that the proposed policy must take into consideration the human rights of learners, especially their access to quality basic education," DepEd said.

DepEd said it was also looking into ways to boost parents' confidence in vaccination. The measles outbreak in parts of the country had been attributed to the vaccine scare created by the Dengvaxia controversy.

Over 830 000 children were vaccinated through the school-based dengue immunization program. Panic ensued after Dengvaxia manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur admitted in late 2017 that Dengvaxia is not guaranteed to prevent dengue among those without prior infection, and the latter may even develop more severe symptoms once infected.

In the meantime, DepEd said it was working closely with the DOH to combat the highly contagious disease. Earlier, the 2 agencies set up a joint task force focused on measles control in school.

It enumerated its measures to reverse the rising trend of measles cases:
- Develop consent and evaluation forms to identify students' vaccination status as either vaccinated, unvaccinated, or "doubtful" of vaccination
- Gather data on measles cases in schools
- Coordinate with health centers for students who were absent or whose parents did not consent to vaccination
- Follow up with students who were not vaccinated or chose to get immunized through private doctors

The DepEd was also reviewing ways to strengthen Executive Order No. 663 issued in 2007, and EO 82 issued in 2012. The 2 orders focused on ensuring basic immunization for children and addressing events considered a "national crisis."

The government is conducting a mass immunization campaign which will run until March 2019.

The DOH is targeting to vaccinate about 12 million people. Of this number, 7 million are children from kindergarten to Grade 7.

At a glance:
- The Department of Health has spent much of 2018 trying to recover from its Dengvaxia dengue vaccine controversy.
- Dengvaxia has contributed to low immunization rates with only 6 out of 10 children receiving scheduled vaccines as of November 2018.
- Accumulation of unvaccinated children has led to several measles outbreaks, with supplemental immunization activities seeing dismal results. - Mod.LK]

https://www.clark.wa.gov/public-health/measles-investigation


Clark County Public Health is continuing its measles outbreak investigation and has no updates to report today [Sat 23 Feb 2019]. Since 1 Jan 2019, Public Health has identified 65 confirmed cases and is currently investigating one suspected case. Public Health has not identified any new locations where people may have been exposed to measles.

Here are the details of the [65] confirmed cases:
- Age
1 to 10 years: 47 cases
11 to 18 years: 15 cases
19 to 29 years: 1 case
30 to 39 years: 2 cases

- Immunization status: Unimmunized: 57 cases, Unverified: 6 cases, 1 MMR vaccine: 2 cases

- Hospitalization: 1 case (none currently)

The confirmed cases include 2 cases who traveled to Hawaii and another case who traveled to Bend, Oregon. The confirmed cases also include 2 Clark County residents who moved to Georgia. The case totals do not include confirmed cases from King County and Multnomah County, Oregon.

Public Health has identified suspect cases that were unimmunized when exposed to measles and received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine more than 72 hours after exposure. To prevent illness, one dose of MMR vaccine must be given to unimmunized people within 72 hours of exposure.

About 5 percent of previously unvaccinated people will develop a rash after being immunized. When administered after 72 hours, the vaccine is less likely to prevent illness, and if the person develops a rash, there is a small chance that the rash is due to the vaccine. People who experience these mild vaccine-associated rashes cannot transmit the virus to other people.

However, in these situations, it is difficult to determine whether the rash is a benign vaccine reaction or measles illness. Specimens for these suspected cases are sent to a specialized laboratory out of state to confirm measles, but it can take more than a week to get the results. In those cases, pending lab results, Public Health will treat the suspect cases as we would treat confirmed cases and release information about public locations the cases visited while potentially contagious with measles. Public Health will remove those locations if the cases are ruled out.

On 12 Feb 2019, Public Health removed one previously confirmed case after additional testing revealed the case was actually experiencing benign vaccine rash. That case -- an unimmunized child 1-10 years old -- received one dose of measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR. Public Health also removed the exposure locations associated with this case since the vaccine virus cannot be transmitted to others.

To date, the majority of lab results of confirmed cases have matched a wild strain of virus circulating in Eastern Europe.

Public Health is not providing any additional information about the 2 cases with one dose of MMR in order to protect the patients' privacy.

[Vaccine hesitancy is a major problem in Washington, Clark County. While officials continue to study the outbreak, one factor that made it easier for the measles to spread is the high numbers of children who have never received the MMR vaccine.

Washington -- particularly Clark County -- has had a growing problem with declining immunizations rates. The number of kindergartners who have been immunized for measles has dropped 12 percent over the past 15 years; https://patch.com/oregon/portland/clark-county-measles-cases-now-63-three-new-exposure-sites-named. - Mod.LK]

Costa Rica's Health Ministry confirmed on Thu 21 Feb 2019 afternoon 3 imported cases of the measles, the country's 1st since 2014.

The affected are a 5-year-old French boy, his mother and father, according to the Health Ministry. The family has been placed in quarantine at Hospital Monseor Sanabria in Puntarenas.

The mother and child do not have the measles vaccine, according to the Health Ministry, while the father has not completed the entire vaccination series. They had arrived in Costa Rica on 18 Feb 2019.

The Health Ministry says it will investigate what contact the contagious family may have had with susceptible people.

The CDC estimates measles killed 500 people annually in the United States before a vaccine was developed in 1963.

[10] Opinion: Dr. M Siegel

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dr-marc-siegel-measles-outbreaks-are-far-worse-than-the-vaccine-that-can-prevent-them


Dr. Marc Siegel explains why measles can "spread like wildfire." If you're not vaccinated, there is a 90 percent chance you will contract measles if you come into contact with the disease, warns Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel.

Measles is a highly contagious disease which commonly causes pneumonia and, less commonly, brain swelling or even death (1 or 2 for every 1000 cases).

The measles mumps rubella vaccine is highly effective and managed to stamp out native measles in the U.S. entirely in 2000. This accomplishment was a huge triumph for the U.S. public health system.

This measles outbreak [in Clark County, Washington] has created a firestorm of response, from anti-vaccination protests against mandatory vaccines, to proposed legislation in Washington State to get rid of personal or philosophical exemptions. Such exemptions are largely responsible for less than 80 percent of the population in the area being vaccinated against measles.

Fear of a virus like measles should be worse than the fear of the vaccine to prevent it.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, FDA commissioner, has raised the question of whether there should be a uniform policy across the country. He said to me in an exclusive statement, "We need to ask the question: When do we cross a line where some states acting in such an irresponsible fashion, and creating national and even global risks with their lax policies, requires federal health officials to pursue some uniform standards?

What we're seeing is that even if the policies on exemptions are local, the consequences of the most irresponsible state actions are national and even global. We are all paying a price for these state-level policies. If states don't reexamine these policies on their own, we need to consider what limits we can and should place on the most egregious exemptions that are contributing to outbreaks of devastating diseases. Irresponsible actions by some state officials have forced this question to be asked."

In my book "False Alarm, the Truth About the Epidemic of Fear," I point out that fear of a virus like measles should be worse than the fear of the vaccine to prevent it, a vaccine which, in this case, utilizes a neutralized virus to provoke an immune response [the virus is not neutralized as stated here, but rather is an attenuated live virus. - Mod.LK], a vaccine that generally has minimal side effects (and if there are side effects, they are due to genetic or lower socio-economic susceptibility), as some scientists claim, they are clearly far less dangerous than the risks of the disease itself.

Arthur Caplan, founding director of medical ethics at NYU Langone Health, agrees with Dr. Gottlieb and believes that the CDC and the Surgeon General must add their voices to the effort.

As a practicing internist with an eye on public health, I must insist that vaccines are the best way to protect not only the individual but also the society from emerging or, in this case, reemerging diseases.
