The Kamla Nehru Zoo in Indore has reported the deaths of 6 wolves in recent days from rabies, according to a Times of India report. "A total of 6 out of the 8 wolves kept in separate cages died due to rabies in the last 3 days," the in-charge of the zoo, said. The other 2 wolves have not exhibited rabies symptoms to date. The source of the rabies is unknown.

Rabies is an acute viral infection that is transmitted to humans or other mammals usually through the saliva from a bite of an infected animal. It is also rarely contracted through breaks in the skin or contact with mucous membranes.

According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, all mammals are susceptible to rabies.

[In 2016, there were several rabies episodes at the Delhi zoo. There have been suspicions that the source of that outbreak might have been mongoose bites.

Mongooses are indigenous to Africa and Asia and have been introduced in many parts of the world (for a picture see http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-An9rL-UEn1Q/TxPlECH_SaI/AAAAAAAAAH0/J4yi1XhIX00/s1600/MONGOOSE.jpg). Mongooses are the major reservoirs of rabies in Cuba, Puerto Rico, Grenada, and South Africa. Another likely source could be stray dogs. In Delhi, mongoose rabies accounts for only 0.4% of the human cases of rabies, while dogs are responsible for 96.7% of them (Ind J Pediat 2004, 71:217-220). - Mod.PMB
