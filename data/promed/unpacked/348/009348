A man from the village of Gehazor in Kotajkskiy district has been
admitted to the Norskaya infectious hospital of Yerevan in connection
with a wound on his hand. The patient works as a veterinarian and had
contact with many sick pets. After a survey and investigation in the
clinic, a diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax has been established in the
patient.
The patient received treatment until 18 Sep 2006 and was discharged
as recovered.

[In the current report, there is no information on whether the source
has been found and disinfected. The affected man may not be the only
person infected by the source. Human anthrax cases usually follow
exposure to sick animals, most commonly from cattle during slaughter
and butchering of the carcass and appear periodically in Armenia. In
November 2005, cutaneous anthrax was registered in a female
inhabitant of the Armenian city of Gumry after processing meat bought
in the market. Most likely, this meat did not pass pre-sale
veterinary control. - Mod.NP]
[Presumably, this was a veterinarian with a mixed practice, as
domestic animals are rarely afflicted with this disease, who became
infected as a result of necropsying a dead animal in that or another
village. Dogs can be affected when they lick the blood from an
affected carcass, so this disease is usually limited to farm dogs and
fox hounds. A few years ago, a veterinarian's dog -- I think in New
Mexico -- got infected while its master was learning why one should
never necropsy a suspect anthrax case. - Mod.MHJ]
