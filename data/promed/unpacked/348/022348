Thousands of pet cats are feared to have fallen ill or died with a rare blood illness that has been linked to premium food brands. At least 330 have died, according to Royal Veterinary College figures, but the true number is likely to be much higher.

Lawyers representing owners claim thousands of cherished pets have become sick, and vets believe many cases could also have gone undocumented. A common factor appears to be the diet of the cats. The foods watchdog announced the recall of a large number of hypoallergenic dry cat food products made by the Fold Hill Foods company and sold under several different brands.

The recall was announced on 17 Jun [2021] and covers several leading brands of dry food from Applaws, plus others owned by Pets at Home and Sainsbury's.

Deaths have risen since [the recall], and there are fears that many cat owners are unaware of the danger and are still using the dry food, which has a long shelf life. Apart from the distress, owners have been faced with vet bills.

Food Standards Agency, Food Standards Scotland, and Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] are advising cat owners not to feed their cats specific cat food products. Since April 2021 there have been over 130 cases of feline pancytopenia, an illness that can often be fatal in cats. Pancytopenia is a very rare condition where the number of blood cells (red, white, and platelets) rapidly decrease, causing serious illness.

This current outbreak of pancytopenia is potentially linked to specific cat food products. As a result of this, a product recall has been issued that details the affected products (https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-prin-36-2021).

A government spokesperson said: "Working with the Royal Veterinary College, the Animal Plant and Health Agency, and other government departments across all 4 nations of the UK, local authorities, and the pet food supply chain, we are investigating a possible link between specific cat food products and feline pancytopenia. There is no definitive evidence to confirm a link at this stage.

"No unsafe cat food has been identified, but the manufacturer and brand owners affected, based on investigations so far, are taking the precautionary action of recalling and withdrawing cat food products having been linked to affected cats. There is no evidence to suggest this outbreak of feline pancytopenia presents any risk to human health."

Pancytopenia is a serious, but usually very rare, disease. If your cat is unwell and has been fed any of the cat food listed in the product recall, you should seek immediate advice from your vet.

If your cat's usual food is a product affected by the recall, use an alternative cat food brand. If your cat was being fed a product affected by the recall for a medical reason, discuss with your vet what alternative food would be best to switch to. This will help to avoid your cat becoming ill as a result of ceasing to feed the listed food.

The Royal Veterinary College has put out a call for information (https://www.rvc.ac.uk/news-and-events/rvc-news/rvc-study-to-investigate-mysterious-recent-spike-in-severe-feline-pancytopenia-cases) to gather further information on any identified cases and the possible cause of this illness in cats.

Find out more details of the recall and all affected products in the product recall at https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-prin-36-2021.

https://www.rvc.ac.uk/news-and-events/rvc-news/rvc-study-to-investigate-mysterious-recent-spike-in-severe-feline-pancytopenia-cases


The Royal Veterinary College (RVC) is appealing to vets in general practice and animal referral hospitals across the UK to take part in a new survey to investigate a spike in severe feline pancytopenia cases. This condition can often prove to be fatal.

Led by Dr Barbara Glanemann, senior lecturer in small animal medicine and co-head of the Small Animal Internal Medicine Service, and Karen Humm, associate professor in transfusion medicine and emergency and critical care at the RVC, the study aims to identify common denominators such as toxins or other factors to potentially establish a cause.

"Typically, we may see one case of this per year, but we have seen now 10 cats with severe pancytopenia (consisting of severe leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anaemia) in the last 4 weeks. Most have had severe generalised bone marrow hypo- to aplasia. Some cats have presented at the same time from the same household. Given the rarity of this condition, the clustering of these cases is concerning. Investigations in our cases have not revealed any identifiable underlying cause so far. Speaking to several colleagues in general practice and other referral hospitals around the country, we are currently aware off about another 40-50 affected cats. The cats are severely unwell, have spontaneous bleeding, and require often multiple transfusion for stabilisation prior to any investigation being possible," commented Dr Barbara Glanemann.

Feline pancytopenia update: The Royal Veterinary College (RVC) is aware of 528 cats that are known to us based on cases treated at our own hospitals and information provided by some vets in the UK. Of these there was 63.5% mortality at time of reporting.

These data probably represent only a percentage of cases, as many cats may not be presented to a veterinary practice and/or investigated by a vet. Only a small percentage of the vets in the UK are actively reporting to the RVC at this time. The data from our survey are provided by third parties and have not been independently verified and are correct when provided by the vets concerned. Therefore, the percentage of mortalities may change after submission of the information.

On Thursday 16 Jul 2021, a spokesperson for the RVC said: "The Royal Veterinary College continues its investigation into the sudden increase in feline pancytopenia in cats in the UK. Currently, we are sadly aware of over 500 affected cats. Investigations into an underlying cause do not suggest a link with common feline infectious diseases, common toxins (for example, heavy metals, oestrogen), or deficiencies/excesses in vitamins or minerals.

"Results of analyses by the RVC of cat food involved in the product recall published by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) have been shared with the FSA. We would like to draw your attention to a revised published FSA statement published 16 Jul 2021 (https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/update-from-the-food-standards-agency-and-food-standards-scotland-following-the-rise-in-cases-of-feline-pancytopenia).

"Our investigations are ongoing, and we are still collecting data from practising veterinarians, as well as testing food samples associated with affected and unaffected cats to determine the significance of these findings. We have shared our results with the FSA in order to assist them with their investigations into this matter.

"To support our ongoing efforts, we are encouraging vets who have seen cats with unexplained severe thrombocytopenia and/or neutropenia, with or without concurrent anaemia, to complete our survey (https://rvc.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/pancytopenia)."

Mycotoxins are toxic compounds that are naturally produced by different types of fungi. They can grow on a variety of different crops (for example, grains and vegetables), before or after harvest, and foodstuffs including cereals, nuts, spices, dried fruits, apple juice, and coffee, often under warm and humid conditions.

Trichothecenes are a large family of chemically related mycotoxins produced by moulds like fusarium, trichoderma, _trichothecium_, and others. Type A trichothecenes include the T-2 and HT-2 toxin.

T-2 and HT-2 toxins have a wide range of toxic effects in animals, including weight loss, loss of appetite, and decreases in blood cell concentrations (white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets), leading to an increased risk for infections and/or bleeding. The European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reports that cats are particularly sensitive to T-2 and HT-2 mycotoxins (EFSA Scientific Opinions 2011, 2017), but a lack of data hinders the establishment of a legal safe value for T-2/HT-2 concentrations in feed for cats. In some countries, a legal safe limit has been established in feeds for these mycotoxins for some species [see source URL for list of additional publicly available resources].

Information for cat owners
--------------------------
1. My cat has been eating a recalled food brand. What shall I do?
Do not feed your cat any more of this food. Please contact the product manufacturers for brand-specific questions. Further details can be found here: https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-prin-36-2021.

You could discuss with your vet whether you would like a blood test performed looking at the levels of red and white blood cells and platelets in your cat's blood, as decreases in these levels are seen if your cat is affected with pancytopenia.

2. My cat is ill, and I think it might have this problem. What should I do?
Please contact your vet so they can examine your cat and discuss further investigation as necessary. You may also want to contact the product manufacturers for brand specific questions if your cat has been eating one of the recalled diets. Further details can be found here: https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/alert/fsa-prin-36-2021.

3. We are trying to gather information on all affected cats, so if your vet thinks your cat is affected, then please ask them to complete our survey to allow us to learn more about this syndrome (https://rvc.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/pancytopenia). If you give your vets permission for us to contact you, we may be in touch to ask you some questions, but we will not do this if you would rather not be contacted.

Information for vets
--------------------
1. How do I log a case:
Compete the survey at https://rvc.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/pancytopenia.

2. How do I recognise if a cat has this syndrome?
The clinical signs can be very vague initially (lethargy, malaise, and inappetence). One of the 1st more specific clinical signs that can be seen is bleeding -- for example, from the mouth, haematochezia, haematuria, haematemesis, melena, haematoma post blood sample. In more severe cases when bleeding is marked, patients can present collapsed with hypovolaemia. Some cats have presented with no clinical signs at all and have been diagnosed purely because another cat in the household was affected.

3. How do I diagnose this syndrome?
A complete blood count with blood smear examination (ideally performed at an external laboratory) is required. The cats may have a pancytopenia affecting platelets (generally less than 20 x 10exp9/L), neutropenia (generally less than 0.5 x 10exp9/L), and a varying level of non-regenerative anaemia depending on whether (or how much) bleeding has occurred. However, it seems that earlier in the disease process only thrombocytopenia or neutropenia may be present, and some (in particular very young) cats, in an apparently earlier stage of the disease, have had signs of regenerative anaemia. The pancytopenia is caused by severe generalised bone marrow hypo- to aplasia, and the gold standard method to diagnose this is bone marrow sampling (aspirate and core).

4. How should I treat this syndrome?
The ideal treatment for these patients is unknown. We suspect a toxic basis for the disease (though this has not been confirmed), but the toxin, and therefore any "antidote," is unknown. Treatment is therefore based on supportive care. Cats should not be fed any more food that has been subjected to a recall. In unstable anaemic patients, whole blood or packed red blood cells (with or without plasma) are recommended. Broad spectrum antibiosis -- for example, potentiated amoxycillin -- is recommended for patients with a neutrophil count below 1 x 10exp9/L. Corticosteroid therapy is controversial. There is no evidence that it is beneficial, and immunosuppressive doses may well be harmful in patients with such a low neutrophil count. Other possibly useful therapies include granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), tranexamic acid in patients with large volume haemorrhage, cobalamin, folate, and vitamin E, though none of this advice is evidence based.

5. What should I do with a cat that seems healthy but has been eating a diet which has been recalled?
There will likely be many cats that are in this situation, and the best approach will depend on owner finances and concern. Asking the owner to monitor the cat closely and to contact you if they note any of the clinical signs noted above is generally appropriate. A complete blood count (CBC) could reassure an owner or allow an asymptomatic case to be detected. We would recommend a CBC with blood smear examination (ideally performed at an external laboratory) is performed in asymptomatic cats in a household where another cat has been affected. If mild decreases in platelet, neutrophil, and/or red cell numbers are noted on CBC, but levels are not compatible with those noted above, then we would recommend repeat CBC in 3-14 days depending on the severity of the decrease to monitor for progression.

[It is unusual for a disease of this nature to be linked to pet food. The Royal Veterinary College (RVC; [4] above) states it is not linked to common feline infectious diseases or common toxicities.

According to the articles above, some natural toxicants are being examined. Some of the descriptions make me wonder about aflatoxin contamination in the food. It appears to be on the list of investigative concern. This is a mycotoxin that occasionally can grow on the pet food under very specific conditions. I also wonder if it is some preservative or common source of an ingredient that could have been contaminated with a virus.

Feline pancytopenia is a syndrome that may arise for a number of reasons (https://eclinpath.com/hematology/pancytopenia/). It is distinct from the disease called feline panleukopenia, which is caused by parvovirus infection (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/feline-panleukopenia/feline-panleukopenia).

We look forward to further clarification of the cause of this feline pancytopenia, hoping the RVC's study will soon report. ProMED would be grateful for further information from informed sources. - Mod.TG
