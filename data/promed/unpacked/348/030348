[According to the report above, a total of 80 844 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from China, representing an increase of 20 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (14 Mar 2020) report was prepared.

It is now the 6th consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country. In addition, 10 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. Four new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

There were 16 imported cases into China confirmed, representing 80% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Beijing (5), Zhejiang (4) Shanghai (3), Gansu (3), and Guangdong (1) bringing the total number of imported cases to 111. A challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China. The remaining 4 cases with local transmission, were all from Wuhan in Hubei province.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in S. Korea has increased by 73 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (13-14 Mar 2020) when there were 107 newly confirmed cases. The epicenter of this outbreak is still Daegu province with 6031 reported cases and the surrounding province of Gyeongbuk with 1157 reported cases. Daily case counts are slowing down with only 4 newly confirmed cases in Gyeongbuk in the past 24 hours, and only 53 cases reported from Daegu. Provinces reporting near or more than 100 cases include Gyeonggi (211), Seoul (247), Chungnam (115), and Busan (106). In the past 24 hours (14-15 Mar 2020), 7 provinces reported no new cases -- 2 fewer than yesterday (13 Mar 2020).

The English language update page for today (15 Mar 2020; (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has tables epidemiologic links of confirmed cases and gender and age distribution that are very interesting and informative.

In addition, there was the following information:
- Epidemiological links have been found for 80.8% of the total cases; 19.2% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 1 on the following page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2. (Tables are at the URL provided in this moderator comment).
- 9 more cases were confirmed at the call center located in Guro-gu, which brings the total number of confirmed cases there to 124. Also, 13 confirmed cases have been reported from Saeng Myeong Su Church located in Bucheon, Gyeonggi province. One of the confirmed cases from the 11th floor of the call center attended the service at the church. Further epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway.
- In the city of Sejong, a total of 29 confirmed cases turned out to be linked with the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. Tests were conducted for the entire staffs of the Ministry and 27 were confirmed positive. Two other cases are family members of the confirmed staff. Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are on-going.
- As new cases are continuing to emerge in small clusters from businesses, churches, Internet cafes, and medical facilities, KCDC stressed the need for stronger prevention measures especially with public spaces and facilities used by many people.
- KCDC urged everyone to keep strict adherence to personal hygiene and social distancing measures during the upcoming weekend. Individuals with fever or respiratory symptoms are advised to refrain from going to work or school and generally stay at home and watch their symptoms for the next 3-4 days.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 21 157 cases, including 1441 deaths, up from 17 660 cases and 1266 deaths reported on 13 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 13 and 14 Mar 2020 was 3497 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2547 newly confirmed cases between 12 and 13 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (11 685), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (2644), and Venice (1937), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 74% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

B. Spain: total lockdown
Date: Sat 14 Sep 2020

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/world/europe/spain-coronavirus.html

A day after an emergency was declared, government officials put in place sweeping restrictions on the public. Stay inside, residents were told.

Faced with a sharp rise in coronavirus [COVID-19] cases, Spain on Saturday [14 Mar 2020], became the 2nd country in Europe to impose sweeping restrictions on the public, telling everyone to stay indoors, with limited exceptions. The government said people could leave their homes to buy food, to go to work if they cannot work remotely, to seek health care, or to assist the elderly and others in need.

The government also ordered all schools, restaurants, bars, and non-essential stores to close, extending measures that various regional authorities, including in Madrid and in Catalonia, had taken in recent days. Long-distance trains and buses across the country will have less frequent service. "Spain is demonstrating in these critical hours that it has the capacity to overcome adversity," Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said in announcing the new measures, which he described as drastic. "We are facing very difficult weeks of efforts and sacrifices," he warned. "Some important rights must be limited if we want to beat the virus." The final victory over the coronavirus, he added, will come only "when we have a vaccine."

Mr Sanchez said the government would take steps to oversee and maintain the nationwide supply of food, energy and other basic services during the 15-day lockdown, which is scheduled to begin Monday [16 Mar 2020].

On Saturday [14 Mr 2020], health authorities reported a surge of 2000 new infections, the largest daily increase in Spain since the beginning of the outbreak. The numbers suggest the country is following a curve similar to that seen in Italy, which has also imposed restrictive measures on public movement. The death toll in Spain rose to more than 190 on Saturday. Over all, 6200 people are infected. The more restrictive measures came after increasing alarm about the upswing in cases.

On Friday [13 Mar 2020], the prime minister had warned that the number of coronavirus cases in Spain could reach 10 000 next week, given how sharply infections have been rising.

On the same day, regional officials in Catalonia declared a lockdown, telling all residents to stay at home, and the authorities in the capital, Madrid, ordered all restaurants and bars to close by Saturday [14 Mar 2020]. Stores in Madrid were also closed.

On Saturday [14 Mar 2020], the Madrid region, the epicenter of Spain's coronavirus crisis, accounting for more than half of the reported cases, was already feeling the effects of restricted movement. Madrid is normally one of Europe's most bustling cities, with people filling its public parks and squares, or meeting for drinks and tapas in its thousands of bars and cafes. Yet on Saturday [14 Mar 2020], Madrid resembled a ghost city, as its 3.5 million residents, who normally spend much of their social life on the streets, started to follow the advice of the authorities to stay at home. The train stations and main avenues were almost deserted, while some police cars patrolled the city center. Only stores providing basic services -- such as supermarkets and gas stations -- were allowed to stay open. People who ventured outside often headed to supermarkets to buy essential supplies.

Museums and other public venues closed earlier this week. The gates of Madrid's central park, the Retiro, were shut by the police on Saturday afternoon [14 Mar 2020]. On the arcaded Plaza Mayor, one of the main public spaces in the heart of the city, some tourists took a last walk as they hoped to catch a flight later in the day.

The Spanish government has only once before declared a state of emergency, in 2010, when the military was ordered to break up a wildcat strike by air traffic controllers that had paralyzed the country's airports.

A lockdown of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia, in Spain's northeast, was announced Friday [13 Mar 2020] by Quim Torra, the region's leader, who asked the central government in Madrid to help suspend travel to and from the region by closing airports and train stations. Mr Torra said it was necessary to "restrict entrances and departures" from Catalonia, but such a demand could also fuel the debate over the territorial sharing of power in Spain.

On Saturday [14 Mar 2020], the northern Basque region declared its own state of emergency.

Elsewhere in Spain, the southern city of Seville canceled its Easter celebrations, an event that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. In the southeastern region of Murcia, the regional authorities put almost 400 000 residents of its coastal towns under lockdown, while warning visitors from Madrid and elsewhere to stop heading for the seaside and risk spreading the virus further.

Terminal 1 of Madrid's airport was also almost empty on Saturday morning [14 Mar 2020].

Earlier on Saturday [14 Mar 2020], as Madrid residents bought groceries and hurried back home, the authorities urged people to remain calm and maintain a one-meter distance in supermarket lines. Yet many said they knew the worst was yet to come. An Egyptian entrepreneur who lives in Madrid, said Spaniards, like other Europeans, were not psychologically prepared for the coronavirus because they had not faced such a crisis in a generation. "There has been no war, no widespread illness, and a relative state of well-being despite the economic crisis," [he] said, wearing a mask. "So Europeans were just not ready. We don't know how to react."

C. France: lockdown
Date: Sat 14 Mar 2020 7:01 PM CET
Source: Metro [abridged, edited]
https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/14/france-becomes-latest-country-go-lockdown-battle-coronavirus-12398948/

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has asked citizens to work from home and to only go outside to buy essential supplies, take light exercise, and vote in this weekend's [15 Mar 2020] local elections. All non-essential businesses will be closed and although public transport will remain open, Mr Philippe encouraged residents to limit their use, telling them not to travel between towns unless essential. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] Mr Philippe said: 'I have decided to close all non-indispensable locations. We must absolutely limit our movements. 'I am conscious of the efforts and sacrifices that we are asking, but I have faith that the French people will have the capacity to overcome this serious moment.'

The country had already banned mass gatherings of over 100 people, suspended sports events and ordered the closure of schools and universities. The tough new measures come after hundreds took to the streets of Paris to demand stronger action to stop the spread of coronavirus. Despite labelling COVID-19 as France's 'biggest health crisis in a century' President Emmanuel Macron confirmed this week that Sunday's [15 Mar 2020] local elections would go ahead. He faced criticism for this decision as the number of infections soared past 4000 and the death toll climbed to 91. Demonstrators filled a Paris neighbourhood calling for coronavirus screening for all and more funding for health services to tackle the outbreak. Protesters with the National Union of Students of France (UNEF) thought measures taken by authorities didn't go far enough -- though some were quick to point out that they disobeyed a nationwide ban on public gatherings by grouping together in protest. Philippe acknowledged that the French people find the concept of social distancing repugnant, 'because we are a people that likes to gather, a joyful people, a people that likes to live together... Maybe even more when fear starts to spread.'

But he said: 'We have seen too many people in cafes and restaurants. In usual times, this would make me happy. Because this is the France we all love. But for a few weeks, this is not what we should be doing.' The new measures make France the latest European country to go into lockdown, following the likes of Italy, Denmark , Poland, and Spain. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez confirmed a 15-day nationwide lockdown on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] as part of state of emergency measures to control the spread of the killer virus. All shops except pharmacies and stores selling basic necessities will be forced to close under the new rules, which came into effect after the number of cases soared by over 1500 in just 24 hours. Nearly all countries in Europe have closed schools and several have fully or partially shut their borders, including Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

In Italy, the 1st European country to go into lockdown, the number of cases jumped by 20% today [14 Mar 2020], with over 21 000 people thought to be infected with coronavirus.

Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has announced schools could be closed for up to 4 months to stop the spread of the disease. She has been under pressure to follow in the footsteps of the Republic of Ireland, where schools shut this week. The announcement offers a glimpse of the scale of the crisis yet to come and raises questions about what will happen in the rest of the UK.

https://news.expats.cz/health-medical/shops-and-restaurants-must-close-for-10-days-over-coronavirus/

Restaurants, bars and shops remain closed in Czechia from 06:00 today [14 Mar 2020] until [24 Mar 2020], except for food stores, drugstores, pharmacies, petrol stations and others as a measure to help stem the coronavirus infection, the government has decided, PM Andrej Babis has written to CTK [the Czech News Agency]. Among the catering facilities, the exceptions include canteen services.

Gambling rooms and casinos have been closed as well, according to the resolution the government has released on its website overnight. Unlike other facilities, gambling rooms and casinos are closed indefinitely. Banks and post offices remain open, untouched by the ban. Other shops exempted from the closure include the sales of information technologies, consumer electronics, newspapers, magazines and tobacco products, and also pet shops and glasses shops.

Presence of people has been banned in catering facilities with the exception of those that do no serve the public, such as corporate canteen services and the catering in medical, social care and prison facilities. The ban furthermore does not apply to food and meals sales outdoors, where the customers do not enter the given facility. On the other hand, the ban has closed catering facilities in shopping malls with an area over 5000 square metres. Services such as hairdressers' shops and beauty parlors will remain closed as well, unlike laundries and dry-cleaners, to which the ban does not apply.

Later this morning [14 Mar 2020], Babis told media that the new wave of closures is aimed to prevent accumulation of crowds of people in shopping centres. Interior Minister Jan Hamacek (Social Democrats, CSSD) said the police will go to big shopping malls to check whether the government measure is being observed.

The 1st case of new coronavirus appeared in the Czech Republic on [1 Mar 2020]. Case numbers reached 150 this morning [14 Mar 2020], 9 more than late on Friday [13 Mar 2020], Babis said. About 6900 people are in quarantine.

E. Multicountry partial lockdowns with focus on cinema industry

Berlin also shut down its movie theaters, along with all other public gatherings of more than 50 people, as Spain and France join Italy, Poland, Denmark, Norway and Greece in a coronavirus lockdown.

Spain has joined France, Italy and Poland among European countries to shut down all national cinemas and most public places, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] suspended all retail commercial activity in country for 15 days, with exceptions made only for those considered basic necessities, such as grocery stories and pharmacies.

The announcement came just hours after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe made a similar move, closing all "non-essential" public places, including cinemas, bars, restaurants, cafes and nightclubs. The French measures take effect as of midnight local time on Saturday [14 Mar 2020].

The move is a further ramping up of quarantine measures following a move Friday [13 Mar 2020] in France to ban gatherings of more than 100 people. In response to those measures, the French cinemas association, the FNCF, said its members would strive to keep theaters open if possible. The new ban makes that impossible. France had 4499 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Saturday [14 Mar 2020], up from 3661 on Friday [13 Mar 2020], and 91 deaths.

The European box office is set to take a major hit this weekend as cinemas across the continent shut their doors or greatly curtail their operations in response to concerns over the coronavirus. In Germany, Berlin on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] night announced a ban on all public gatherings of more than 50 people, shutting down all the cinemas, as well as bars, theaters and clubs in the German capital. The move follows a similar shut-down in several mid-sized cities across the country, including Bonn, Stuttgart, Bielefeld and Kassel, which earlier this week ordered cinemas to shutter out of health concerns. More are expected to follow.

Several smaller European territories, including Denmark, Norway, Greece and the Czech Republic, have followed Italy and Poland in closing all cinemas for at least 2 weeks in response to the coronavirus pandemic, as have Israel and Lebanon. "This is crazy and unprecedented; the impact is obviously going to be immense," said one box office analyst, who asked to speak off the record due to the sensitivity of the situation. The impact of the coronavirus crisis on the global film industry has already been substantial. China, the world's 2nd-largest territory outside North America, has been shut down since early January [2020], resulting in billions in lost revenues. "A big question will be how long this lasts and if, afterwards, the pent-up demand for movies can make up for lost revenue now," the analyst noted.

What's clear is that the situation is going to get worse before it gets better. At a press briefing on Friday [13 Mar 2020], the director general of the World Health Association, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Europe is now the world center for the coronavirus outbreak, with more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China. Sweden, Finland and Belgium are expected to soon follow their European neighbors and close cinemas. Smaller territories, including Romania and Ireland, have already advised theaters to limit crowds in individual screenings to 100 people, akin to the French restrictions. The U.K. remains the only major European territory that, so far, has not moved to curb cinemagoing. But that could change soon. English top-flight professional soccer league, the Premier League, on Friday [13 Mar 2020] suspended all matches until the weekend of [3-5 Apr 2020] out of concern for fans in the stadiums, as well as for players.

Even where cinemas stay open, the growing concern over coronavirus infection is certain to limit attendance. Going into this weekend, the studios, exhibitors and distributors across Europe should brace themselves. It's going to be a rough ride.

[While this specific article is focused on the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the cinema industry (formerly known as the "film" industry), it is a good glimpse of what implementing social distancing means as a national, provincial or municipal policy. Cinemas and other theaters where crowds gather sitting fairly close to one another is a good setting for transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. New York City currently has a shutdown of all Broadway theaters, the 1st time this has happened for public health reasons. Other reasons were the 2 days following 9/11 and the occasional power outage. (https://broadwaynews.com/2020/03/12/the-history-of-broadway-shutdowns/#:~:text=Following%20that%2C%20Broadway%20went%20dark%20in%202003.).

Unfortunately, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will be staggering for all walks of life globally. - Mod.MPP]

F. Israel (in WHO EURO region) to use cyber tech to follow COVID-19 cases
Date: Sat 14 Feb 2020

https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-to-use-cyber-tech-to-track-coronavirus-patients-1.8675008/.premium-israel-to-use-cyber-tech-to-track-coronavirus-patients-1.8675008


Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Saturday [14 Mar 2020] that Israel seeks to use technological means usually used for counter-terror to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, as the country saw diagnosed cases spike by 50 in one day. The announcement was made as part of a new set of directives issued by the government that will effectively see the country grind to a halt while it attempts to combat the coronavirus outbreak.

Shortly after the announcement, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit approved the use of cyber measures to track patients' phones. The Justice Ministry, responding to a Haaretz query, said the directive was legal under the regulations that were put in place to fight the virus. A representative told Haaretz that the ministry's legal opinion would be "forwarded to the Shin Bet security service and brought before the government on Sunday [15 Mar 2020]."

The prime minister called COVID-19 an "invisible enemy," and said "all means would be used to fight the spread of the coronavirus, including technological means, digital means, and other means that until today I have refrained from using among the civilian population."

According to sources familiar with the policy, Netanyahu is primarily referring to the use of cellular geolocalization to verify the past whereabouts of patients that have tested positive for COVID-19, or to check whether they had violated a quarantine order. Some other forms of digital surveillance may also be used.

"...According to a senior law enforcement official, police have recently used cellular phones to verify their versions of coronavirus patients for being in certain places. For example, the police assisted the Ministry of Health as part of an examination conducted by a resident of Or Yehuda, who was infected with the coronavirus, when he used cellphone tracking to trace his tracks. However, police have made it clear this evening that they do not intend to use cellular tracking for activities against coronavirus patients. "We do not intend to detect people and do not intend to detain them," an organization official stressed.

"Netanyahu announced tonight that in order to curb the spread of the virus, "all means will be used ... including technological means to combat terrorism, which I have so far avoided activating in the civilian public. But there is no choice." Netanyahu also said: "I asked the Justice Department for these steps. They are not simple; they have a certain amount of harm to the privacy of those people, who will check who came in contact with the sick and what preceded it. It is an effective tool for detecting the virus."

Informed sources said that Netanyahu's 1st and foremost intention was to follow the cell phones of those diagnosed with the disease. This is to ascertain, among other things, whether they were in isolation. The officials added that other digital surveillance measures may also be used to ascertain where the patients are. The ISA was asked to contribute its capabilities to the move.

The Shin Bet says that, "Further to the request of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Health, the possibility of using the General Security Service's technological capabilities as part of the national effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus epidemic is being explored."

[As a reminder, there were cellular phone apps that were used to track movements of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals in South Korea (see COVID-19 update (24): 20200301.7039103 for more details). The Korean government was publishing personal details of each confirmed case that permitted app developers to design apps to warn the population if they were going near SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, basically using a similar design as proposed above but for public use. - Mod.MPP

The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority announced a USD 13.3 billion program to cushion the private sector from the impact of the epidemic.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi decided to suspend school and university classes for 2 weeks starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020] over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. Sisi also allocated 100 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 6.36 billion) to finance the anti-COVID-19 fight.

Speaking at a special cabinet meeting, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye said Palestine was the 1st to follow China's example by taking timely measures to fight the deadly disease and has been successful in controlling it thus far. Ibrahim Melhem, spokesman of the Palestinian Authority, said Palestine follows in China's steps to stop the spread of COVID-19, which has largely been controlled by China about 2 months after its outbreak. "The full cooperation between the Chinese government and its people and securing food that was sufficient for 2 weeks have all contributed to limiting the spread of the virus," Melhem said.

Lebanon informed Syria that it will close its land borders with Syria starting Monday [16 Mar 2020] as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

To contain the spread of the virus, Morocco took new measures, including a ban on mass gatherings of more than 50 people. A ban on flights was extended to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, in addition to Italy, France, Spain and Algeria.

Oman on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] announced a one-month suspension of all schools and universities starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020] amid concerns over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

Jordan also decided to suspend all schools, universities and educational institutions for 2 weeks starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020]. All flights from and to Jordan will be suspended from [17 Mar 2020] until further notice. All sea and land borders are closed except for commercial movement and shipping, while gatherings and large events, including prayers at mosques and churches, are also banned.

In Syria, one of the only 2 countries in the Middle East that are reportedly unaffected by COVID-19, President Bashar al-Assad ordered the postponement of the parliamentary elections from [13 Apr 2020] to [20 May 2020] to prevent the spread of the virus.

In Yemen, another country reportedly free of any COVID-19 case, the internationally-recognized government decided to suspend all flights to and from Yemeni airports for 2 weeks, starting Wednesday [18 Mar 2020]. Flights for humanitarian purposes and relief aid will be excluded from the ban. The Yemeni government also ordered the temporary closure of the country's border crossings, with exception for commercial, relief, and humanitarian shipping traffic.

Meanwhile, the Houthi militia that controls northern Yemen announced the suspension of international flights for 2 weeks, while deciding to end the school year this month [March 2020], ahead of schedule, in the cities under its control.

**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 133. This includes 12 countries (including 1 territory) from the Western Pacific region, 53 countries (including 3 territories) from the European region, 8 from the Southeast Asia region, 17 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 28 countries (including 5 territories) from the Americas region, and 15 countries from the African region.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 61 518, including 2192 deaths. The countries of the EURO region of WHO have reported a total of 36 271 cases (59.0% of total cases reported outside of China) and in the past 24 hours have reported 7372 newly confirmed cases representing 75.6% of the newly reported cases outside of China. As for within mainland China, in the past 24 hours, cases were reported from Gansu (2), Shanghai (4), Beijing (1) and Hubei (4). Remembering the Chinese report from 13 Mar 2020, there were 7 newly confirmed imported cases: Shanghai (4), Gansu (2) and Beijing (1), leaving the only locally acquired cases reported from mainland China being the 4 cases reported from Hubei.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the ca
