A disease that is said to be causing 10 deaths each day has broken out on
an island in the swamps of Lake Bangweulu. The island has been tentatively
identified as Kaoma Lunga, whose chief appealed to the government for
assistance in fighting the disease. Lt. Gen. Christon Tembo, Vice
President, said a medical team will be dispatched to the area. No
information about symptoms or suspected diseases is as yet available.
