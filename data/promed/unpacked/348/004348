Citation: Combating Micronutrient Deficiency through Vegetables. 1996.
Centerpoint 14(1):4-5. (Centerpoint is a newsletter published by the Asian
Vegetable Research and Development Center)
Take this scenario: some 40 million preschool children worldwide suffer
from a mild vitamin deficiency, and 0.7 million new cases are added every
year. About 1.5 billion people or 30% of the world population have iron
deficiency; in China, 40-50% of pregnant women and 24% of children are
affected by iron deficiency.
Micronutrient deficiency
Micronutrient deficiency is reported to afflict more than 2 billion people
worldwide. The affliction results in the body becoming more vulnerable to
many diseases and even increased mortality, especially among women and
children. Vitamin A deficiency hampers normal eye function and retards
normal growth of the body, while iodine deficiency causes goiter,
cretinism, stillbirths, abortions, and congenital anomalies. Other
statistics indicate that micronutrient deficiency is pervasive and a major
health and nutritional problem worldwide.
What is the solution to this problem? Vitamin pills? iron-fortified food?
or supplements containing the required minimum level of micronutrients?
Most nutritionists agree that none of these purely technical solutions are
practical for poor people who have no access to expensive medicinal
treatments. Integrating micronutrient-rich foods in the diet is the only
way to solve this problem, and vegetables are the cheapest source of these
nutrients, say AVRDC Agricultural Economist Mubarik Ali and Biochemist and
Director General Samson C.S. Tsou in a paper which reviewed policy options
to increase consumption of micronutrient-rich foods in general, and
vegetables in particular.
This solution fits the new concept of "food security" forwarded during the
International Conference on Nutrition held in 1992. The Rome conference
defined food security as "a balanced and safe diet for an active life."
Thus, in addition to macronutrients, such as food energy and protein,
micronutrients, especially vitamin A, iron, and iodine, are necessary
ingredients in a balanced diet and hence, are an integral part of food
security.
Data from many countries suggest that the prevalence of micronutrient
deficiency now far exceeds protein-energy malnutrition in Asia. Despite
substantial increases in cereal supply, which has contributed to increased
intake of calorie- and protein-rich foods, the supply and consumption of
commodities rich in micronutrients, such as provitamins, minerals, and
iodine, have not increased proportionally.
Vegetables and micronutrient availability
Vegetables are a major and efficient source of micronutrients considering
both per unit of land occupied and per unit production cost. They have an
advantage over cereals, legumes, and livestock in producing vitamins A and
C. Under Taiwanese conditions, for example, Chinese cabbage, onion,
cabbage, tomato, and sweet pepper produce 13, 3, 3, 3, and 2 times more
iron, respectively, compared to cereals, from a given piece of land per
day. And mungbean sprouts can provide 45% more protein than cereals per
unit of land per day.
In terms of micronutrient supply per unit of production cost (i.e.,
variable and fixed costs), Chinese cabbage, onion, and cabbage are 3.6, 2,
and 1.2 times more cost-efficient, respectively, compared to cereals, in
providing iron. Chinese cabbage is 92% more efficient than beef in
supplying iron. And Chinese cabbage, cabbage, sweet pepper, mungbean
sprouts, and tomato are 11.4, 3.8, 3.1, 4.8, and 2.8 times more efficient,
respectively, than chicken when it comes to protein as well.
Moreover, increased vitamin C consumption from vegetables enhances iron
bioavailability from other foods.
Despite these advantages, vegetable supply in most Asian countries is far
below the 200 g/capita/day required level recommended by AVRDC (based on
vitamins A and C requirements). This is aggravated by seasonal and annual
fluctuations in vegetable production and consumption. A more serious
concern is the increase in real prices of vegetables in several developing
countries in recent years.
Micronutrients and vegetable handling
Micronutrient availability is very sensitive to the way vegetables are
handled, stored, and cooked. For instance, boiling vegetables substantially
improves their iron bioavailability in most cases. Iron bioavailability in
cabbage was enhanced from 5 to 18% through cooking and reduced from 18 to
12% when the cooked cabbage was kept in the refrigerator at 4Ã¸C for 3 days.
Provitamin A, such as betacarotene, is degraded after treatment with acid,
heat, and even light. Thus, the bioavailability of nutrients in processed
products is generally lower than in fresh vegetables.
Research on cooking and processing methods have substantial scope to
improve bioavailability of micronutrients in vegetables. Thus, social
scientists and nutritionists need to work together to understand cooking
and food processing habits, and the acceptability of interventions for
enhancing micronutrient availability.
Strategies to solve deficiency
Instituting policies, such as reducing the relative prices of vegetables
through enhanced production and efficient marketing systems, generating
awareness among consumers about the role of vegetables in human health, and
improving vegetable cooking and processing methods can help ease the
problem, claim Drs. Ali and Tsou.
Thus, the goals should be to increase vegetable supplies and also to make
vegetables available during the off season to all sectors of society. Both
production and trade-oriented strategies should be considered to achieve
these goals. The production strategy should focus on developing
high-yielding and stress-tolerant varieties and effective management
systems so that more farmers can grow vegetables with low input cost,
especially during the off season. Programs should focus on enhancing
overall supply of appropriate vegetables along with increasing diversity in
vegetable production.
The trade-oriented strategy should identify favorable vegetable growing
regions and encourage production and trade in these locations. To succeed,
physical infrastructures, such as roads, cold storage, etc., and an
efficient marketing system need to be developed so that vegetables can be
hauled at low cost with their quality preserved. And they must reach the
market at a time when consumers want them.
The benefits of these strategies include increased food and income
security, new jobs, diversity in food, and enhanced sustainability of the
agricultural production systems that result from diversification of these
systems.
Overall, agricultural research should focus increasingly on combating
micronutrient deficiencies rather than simply increasing production. The
authors thus propose that expanded ex ante and ex post analysis of the
impact of agricultural technologies on micronutrient availability be made
part of technology development programs at national and international
research centers.
Role of AVRDC
Nutritional objectives are among the top-priority research goals at AVRDC.
AVRDC aims to tackle the micronutrient deficiency problem by enhancing the
physical availability of nutritious vegetables, improving their economic
accessibility to all sectors of society, and by increasing their
palatability.
AVRDC research focuses on developing improved varieties for the tropics and
improving production technologies to make vegetables available during the
lean-periods; reducing production and marketing costs to make them
accessible to the poor; diversifying vegetable production systems; and
enhancing the quality of vegetables.
More efficient and cost-effective analytical methods to evaluate
nutritional content and bioavailability are being developed. Data on
vegetable cultivation in different regions and nutritional content of
various vegetables are continuously updated. Moreover, advanced food
handling methods to improve micronutrient availability are also being
evaluated.
In collaboration with cooperators in the national agricultural research
systems, AVRDC socioeconomists and nutritionists help identify the proper
mix of vegetables to tackle micronutrient deficiencies specific to each
area.
Through improved varieties and production technologies, sustainable
production systems, quality improvement, and raised awareness of nutrition
concerns, AVRDC hopes to make vegetables better accepted by growers, and
ultimately, consumers.
