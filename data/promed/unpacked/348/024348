A dairy cow is dead from cattle tick fever on a farm near Kyogle in northern New South Wales [NSW].

The property is in quarantine and treatment for cattle ticks, a notifiable disease in NSW, is underway.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries' senior veterinary officer, Paul Freeman, said the dairy farmers sought veterinary advice when the animals displayed symptoms of the disease.

"They'd noticed red urine, just off colour, and there are a number of other conditions that can cause that, so it was sampled and it came back confirmed with tick fever," he said.

There was only a light infestation of the ticks found on the dairy herd. "It had had a dipping treatment by the owners and they'd been ticks seen but they thought they were bush ticks," Mr Freeman said.

The death marks the 1st case of tick fever in NSW this year [2015], but there has been a total of 8 cattle tick infestations in the region over the past 3 weeks.

The remaining 7 infected properties, located from north of Casino to the Queensland border, are also in quarantine.

Mr Freeman said the movements of the infected dairy herd were now being traced. "They've had some movement of animals but mostly to abattoir type movements, but those investigations haven't been complete yet," he said.

"There had been some animals that were introduced from Queensland some time ago and that's the main reason we send the ticks off for some testing.

"There's no indication at this stage if that's responsible for it."

A dairy herd on a property north of Kyogle, north east NSW, is under quarantine following the confirmation of tick fever in a single cow.

Department of Primary Industries [DPI] warned coastal producers to be vigilant as peak tick season kicks in.

DPI staff treated the cow and said there is only a light infestation of cattle tick in the herd.

However, regulatory officers are also investigating the movements of cattle to determine if any possibly infected animals moved to other herds or properties.

There had been Queensland introductions to the affected Kyogle herd.

Additional clinical cases on the farm are unlikely now that treatment for cattle tick has commenced, authorities said.

DPI Senior Veterinary Officer at Lismore Paul Freeman said ticks thrive in the hot and moist conditions that currently prevail in the region.

However, as grass growth intensified in paddocks there was less straying, which could reduce the likelihood of outbreaks, he said.

NSW has had 8 outbreaks since the start of this tick season, on [1 Oct 2014], which is on par with last's season figures.

Cattle ticks are the most serious external cattle parasite in Australia and can transmit tick fever, a potential fatal disease of cattle.

There were 2 cases of tick fever in NSW last year [2014], one fatal.

Minister for Primary Industries Katrina Hodgkinson urged North Coast livestock producers to be vigilant. "This is a timely reminder for cattle producers to tighten their farm biosecurity measures and check for cattle ticks and tick fever," she said.

"While there were only the 2 known cases of tick fever [in 2014], there were 93 new cattle tick infestations in NSW.

"This is why it is so important that producers remain vigilant and inspect their herds regularly and report any signs of cattle ticks.

"Every time cattle ticks are detected in NSW the herd is subject to a supervised eradication program using chemicals to kill ticks and then inspected to ensure they have been eradicated."

Cattle tick and tick fever are notifiable diseases in NSW. Producers and veterinarians are obligated to inform DPI or Local Land Services inspectors if they suspect cattle tick or tick fever.

This is likely a case of babesiosis. Readers are referred to the moderator's comment in ProMED-mail post 20080313.1006 to understand why it is called tick fever and not babesiosis.

This is the time of year for tick fever, a disease complex, to occur in Australia.

Sadly this disease complex can kill cattle and this is a stark reminder of that reality. - Mod.TG]
