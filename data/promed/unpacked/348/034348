Below are some comments on the risk of dengue haemorrhagic fever in
returning tourists. This was the paragraph in "PRO/EDR> Dengue - Canada (ex
Barbados)" that prompted the comments:
"This outbreak points to an increasing health risk for tourists in popular
vacation destinations of the Americas. It also points out the need for
(...) a clearer definition of the risks of haemorrhagic dengue in tourists
who have had classic dengue in the past and wish to return to dengue
endemic regions of the world."
--------------------------------
1. A significant number of dengue infections are sub-clinical, and primary
dengue infections may be particularly mild in children. Therefore, a
significant number of former tourists that may not have been diagnosed with
dengue [may have been infected and may also be at risk when visiting the
same or other areas where dengue viruses are circulating.
2. A clearer definition of the risk of complicated forms of dengue in
tourists would involve the knowledge of the type that infected them in the
past. Retrospective typing of dengue infection is possible using a viral
neutralization procedure. However, this procedure usually permits clear
interpretations only in individuals that were previously infected by a
single type. The procedure is costly and only available in highly
specialized laboratories.
3. Some indication of potential risk could be obtained knowing which
type(s) of dengue virus(es) were prevalent at the time of a past visit to a
particular area or country together with the type(s) currently circulating
in the area to be visited. With the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico,
past information for circulating dengue viruses in Caribbean countries is
scant. For most Caribbean countries the best data are probably those
collected by the Virology Laboratory in the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre
(CAREC): the CAREC database involves over 2000 viral isolates obtained from
17 different countries over a period of two decades. These data have been
submitted recently for publication.
4. Complicated forms of dengue are likely to be seen in tourists in the
future. Given the evolution of the disease, in some cases these
complications would be likely to occur after the patient has returned to
his/her home country. Hopefully, all physicians attending returning
tourists already know what Caribbean physicians have been learning in the
line of fire, that a) early detection and timely and effective fluid
reposition [replacement are key to saving the life of the patient, b) the
haematocrit is central to the early detection of the syndrome of increased
vascular permeability and c) virological confirmation can seldom be awaited
to start the race against hypovolemic shock.

[The complement-fixation test usually can sort out which dengue serotype
was responsible for the infection, even in instances of secondary
infections, and is an easy and inexpensive test to conduct. I wonder why
this excellent test has gone out of fashion, to be replaced by less useful
and more complex assays. - Mod.CHC
