[Reading between the lines of this official report to Paris, this was a single unvaccinated bovine that when exposed to probably soil spores, came down with the infection. The vaccinated stock was protected and was clinically unaffected, though some may now have raised titers from subclinical infections. Fortunately, this dead animal was not butchered for human consumption and exposure to the pathogen. And this case will persuade the Kazakhs to continue vaccinating livestock in the risk regions of the country. - Mod.MHJ
