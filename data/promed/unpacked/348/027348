----------------------------------------------------
"Federal health officials attribute 2019's outbreak to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children..." This concerns me.

Reports blaming vaccine hesitancy for low uptake may help drive understanding of how to address vaccine hesitancy. But they have adverse consequences: they make it easier for people to blame vaccine hesitancy when they should be blaming inadequate vaccination services (and funding better services); and, for those people who are hesitant, it may also validate their concerns -- "lots of other people are refusing vaccines believing them to be unsafe, so there must be something in it..."

For most of us, in everyday practice, tackling vaccine hesitancy means following the simple rules outlined to me by Dr David Elliman (I hope I'm characterizing them in a way he would recognize!):
1. Most people are content to be or have their children vaccinated, and long discussion is unnecessary and counter-productive.
2. A few have reasonable concerns that can easily be addressed.
3. Some have a quasi-religious antipathy to vaccination. These people may only have come to try to convince you that vaccination is harmful! For these people there's no point in trying to address specific concerns -- it may even harden their position. The best response is simply to say "Vaccination is the best way to protect your self/child. I realize that you don't agree, but if you change your mind, come back at any time and you/your child can then be vaccinated."

Tackling poor uptake for other reasons, however, is hard work. It requires good population databases, excellent systems for call and recall, finding ways to identify people having difficulty making it to appointments and to reach out to them. (The term "tail-gunning" was invented for identifying the (usually relatively few) people on a list of people who hadn't had their vaccines and following them up.)

Remember the Jewish community in North London? It was assumed they had some religious or cultural objection to vaccination. Actually, they had very large families; and if you don't have a lot of money, and you have a lot of children, simply getting to the clinic (GP surgery) for the vaccine is really difficult.

Reaching out to people and making vaccination easy costs money, at a time when austerity measures have had a cumulative effect. They tend to hit the community services first. If hospital beds close, there's an outcry. If you cut back on health visiting and vaccination services, most people don't notice.

So as vaccine (and public health) advocates, we need to keep pressing for investment in and improvements to vaccination services; and not fall prey to victim-blaming talk of vaccine hesitancy.

[2] New York City: school closure
Date: Tue 11 Jun 2019 5:29 PM ET

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/ny-williamsburg-yeshiva-closed-by-city-health-measles-outbreak-20190611-rmveg7kzcrb7rhv7sfm3nopggu-story.html


Months into a measles epidemic, [New York] city health officials said they were forced on Tue 11 Jun 2019, to shut down a Brooklyn yeshiva for failing to comply with emergency measures to curb the ongoing outbreak. The number of cases citywide hit 588, according to the Health Department.

One of the United Talmudical Academy's 4 locations -- Central UTA Boys Division at 762 Wythe Ave. in Williamsburg -- was shuttered when the school didn't bar students and staff who didn't have proof they were inoculated with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, officials said. The school was also hit with violations for failing to have enough staff present for students and for not providing health inspectors with vaccination and attendance records, according to the agency. The yeshiva can't reopen until the school can prove it has complying with Health Department mandates.

The phone operator at Central UTA Boys Division hung up on the Daily News on Tuesday afternoon, 11 Jun 2019, and another call seeking comment was not returned.

The yeshiva is the 10th school the city has closed down since the Health Department ordered all people who live, work, or go to school in 4 Williamsburg zip codes be vaccinated or risk fines. The other 9 schools have already reopened.

The United Talmudical Academy in Williamsburg was previously hit with USD 13 000 in fines for 11 violations at 4 different locations in May 2019.

"School staff, parents, and healthcare providers need to continue playing their role in bringing this outbreak to an end," Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said in a statement. "We've seen our weekly case counts decline, but the reality is this outbreak is not over, and the Health Department will continue to use all the resources and strategies available to us. We urge anyone who can get vaccinated to do so."

Nationwide, there have been 1022 confirmed cases of measles in 2019 through 6 Jun 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The city's measles outbreak began in October 2018, hitting Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn hardest. Of the 588 cases to date across the 5 boroughs, 74%, or 437, occurred in Williamsburg zip codes where the vaccination order is in place. The city has so far slapped 173 individuals with summonses for failing to comply with the vaccination order, risking USD 1000 penalties, according to the Health Department. 68 of those were eventually scrapped after the individuals showed proof of immunity or got vaccinated.

[3] Comoros Islands
Date: Wed 12 Jun 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/comoros-islands-reports-measles-outbreak-39736/


The Ministry of Health in Comoros Islands has confirmed a new measles outbreak, coming in the aftermath of the tropical cyclone that devastated the country in April 2019, according to a WHO report. Through 1 Jun 2019, a total of 66 suspected measles cases have been reported, of which 16 were confirmed.

There have been no associated deaths, although one severe case was hospitalized. The most affected of the four Comoros Islands is Grand Comoros (Ngazidja), particularly the district of Moroni. 80% of the reported cases are in the age range of 6 months to 14 years, with children between 6-8 months most affected. Most affected children have been in contact with unvaccinated adults, and most cases are pre-vaccination, unvaccinated or of unknown vaccination status.

WHO says the last measles outbreak in the country, with more than 1000 cases, was reported 13 years ago. However, there has been a consistent decline in measles vaccination coverage, estimated at 90% in 2017, which leads to an accumulation of susceptible individuals.
