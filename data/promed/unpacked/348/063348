Re: Undiagnosed deaths, ibex - Pakistan: (Sindh) request for information
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In case of epizootic events with blindness as a major symptom in
ungulate species like ibex, infectious keratoconjunctivitis (caused
by _Mycoplasma conjunctivae_) has to be considered. This disease may
lead to death since blind animals are disoriented and can fall from
rocks or die of any other trauma, have difficulties finding food, or
become weak and develop secondary diseases. More information are
necessary to seriously consider possible etiologies and propose
management strategies.

[Dr Ryser-Degiorgis' observation is correct. Keratoconjuctivitis can
also be related to another infectious Mycoplasma disease in caprines,
namely Infectious agalactia (combined with arthritis and mastitis).
The causative agent, _M. agalactiae_ has been isolated from Spanish
ibexes (_Capra pyrenaica_).

Among other infectious caprine diseases, which deserve inclusion in
the quite long DD (differential diagnostic) list, CAE (Caprine
arthritis encephalitis), a retroviral disease manifested by CNS
signs, sometimes including blindness, should be considered as well. - Mod.AS]
