A Comment on Spread of Norwalk-like Virus on Cruise Ships
---------------------------------------------------------
[Professor Norman Noah of the Public Health Laboratory Service,
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, has sent this comment on
the ProMED-mail post archived as: "Norwalk-like virus, cruise ship -
USA (Alaska) 20020607.4432"]
As most cabins and state rooms on modern day cruise ships have
private bathrooms, the opportunity for spread of Norwalk-like virus
(NLV), although still there, is much rarer than it was. Aerosol
spread after vomiting, or touching infected objects are
possibilities. Whilst on a river cruise in a country known to have a
high incidence of travellers' diarrhoea, several of us succumbed to
what I am convinced was NLV infection. The pattern of onsets was
indicative of case-to-case spread and was not food-borne.
We observed the following sequence by the room attendant whilst
cleaning the bathroom: Use one cloth; clean bath; then clean inside
of toilet; then clean sink/basin; then clean tooth-mug. Then
[presumably] use same cloth when cleaning next cabin and so on. We
now take plastic disposable cups on this type of holiday. Hopefully
most people vomit into a toilet bowl and not into a sink/basin.
Incidentally it is unfair of your moderator to blame the UK for
introducing this ubiquitous organism to this ship on [presumably] no
evidence. NLV surely is common in most or all parts of the world and
I am certain it is far far commoner in many other countries than it
is in UK. It is just that we diagnose it better, probably even better
than you do in the US..........?

[I have sympathy with Professor Noah's strictures. There has been a
degree of reluctance among North American colleagues to accept that
NLV transmission can be other than predominantly food-borne. The
question of accuracy of diagnosis is relevant also. Recently an
agency report (AFX London, Fri 7 Jun 2002) stated that "P&O Princess
Cruises PLC said it had begun a probe into a mystery virus which
caused dozens of passengers to fall ill on one of its ferries. At
least 40 out of 800 people who boarded the St Sunniva ferry sailing
between Aberdeen in Scotland and the Northern Isles off the Scottish
coast fell victim to a 24-hour stomach bug. A spokeswoman for the
firm said the victims were mainly elderly passengers (and none were
hospitalized)." In fact these figures were cumulative over a period
of 11 days (i.e., probably several round trips) and no virus
identification has been reported. The seas between Aberdeen and the
Northern Isles can be exceedingly rough even in summer, and one
wonders how many elderly passengers feel ill under normal
circumstances over a period of 11 days. - Mod.CP]
