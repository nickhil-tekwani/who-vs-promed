Government rules out bird flu
---------------------------------
The government has ruled out bird flu following the deaths of
thousands of wild birds in Ntchisi on Tue 13 Dec 2005.
In a press statement released Wednesday [14 or 21 Dec 2005?], the
government attributed the deaths of the birds to a heavy downpour
that fell the previous night.
In an interview on Wednesday [probably 21 Dec 2005], Director of
Health and Livestock Development Wilfred Lipita said that the
government had sent specimens to South Africa as a formality.
Lipita said the rains killed the wild birds, adding that the results
from South Africa would be known next week [final week December 2005].
"Even where you know somebody was beaten, you still bring him to the
hospital to establish where he had been beaten," said Lipita.
In the statement, the government said that the birds had been
identified as European swallows (_Hirundo rustica rustica_) [see
commentary].
The government has advised the public to avoid contact with and
consuming any dead wild birds to avoid infection.
Experts from the Departments of Animal Health and Livestock
Development and National Parks and Wildlife visited Chinkhande
Village in the T/A Vuso Jereis area, about 35 km southeast of Ntchisi
Boma, where multiple deaths of wild birds were 1st reported in the
middle of this month [December 2005].
In the aftermath of the deaths of the birds, the government warns the
public to report any signs in domestic animals, such as problems in
respiration, drops in egg production, reddening and swelling of the
head and/or comb, and blood-stained nasal discharges.
Specimens were collected and sent to Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute in South Africa by the Central Veterinary Laboratory to
rule out avian influenza and to establish the cause of the deaths.

[Until avian influenza is ruled out by completed laboratory
investigations, hopefully establishing the actual cause of the
(swallows?) die-off, this case remains regarded as AI-suspected.
An accurate definition of the affected species will help; in the
previous newswire, the dead birds were identified as Drongos (birds
belonging to the family _Dicruridae_). - Mod.AS]
