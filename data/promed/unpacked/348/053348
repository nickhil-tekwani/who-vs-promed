Russia: 2 human cases of rabies contracted from pet cats in Pereslavl
-----------------------------------------------
In Pereslavl (in the Yaroslavl region of Russia), 2 women were infected
with rabies. In both cases, the women contracted infection from [pet] cats
which had bitten and scratched them. After several days, the animals became
ill and died. Laboratory analysis confirmed that the cats had died as a
result of rabies virus infection. The 2 women received post exposure rabies
therapy immediately.
At the present time, it is impossible to determine precisely the origin of
the rabies in Pereslavl. It has been suggested that the virus was
introduced by rodents. The most recent case of human rabies in Pereslavl
occurred last year [2003], when a 53 year old man died of rabies after
being bitten by a feral dog.
The chief veterinarian of the Pereslavl Municpial District, Nina Gorshkova,
stated that rabies is rare in cats and that this was the 1st time she had
encountered cat rabies.
[The Yaroslavl region is located in the central part of Russia adjacent to
the Moscow region.]

[Rabies in cats is not, in fact, rare. In various countries (such as
Israel), the usual annual rate of cat/dog rabies fluctuates between 1/5 to
1/15 -- that is, one rabid cat per 5 to 15 rabid dogs. In the most recently
available WHO World Survey of Rabies (1999) there have been, worldwide,
7578 and 1157 laboratory confirmed cases in dogs and cats, respectively. In
the Russian Federation, the figures for 1999 were 465 and 253 (see, for all
reporting countries,
<http://www.who.int/emc-documents/rabies/docs/wsr99/Table2.pdf>).
As to the repeated rumors from Russia about rabid rodents, this needs more
lab-based substantiation. - Mod.AS]
