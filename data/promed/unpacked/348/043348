The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) issued an alert on Thu 9 Jul 2015 warning of a case of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) near Ottawa.

Ottawa is located about 5 hours' drive (approximately 300 miles) from Caledon Equestrian Center, where the horses are stabled for the equestrian competitions of the Pan Am Games. Horses entered in the dressage competition went through inspection on Thursday [9 Jul 2015], and the 1st competition, the Prix St Georges, is on Saturday [11 Jul 2015]. Here is the official alert message issued by OMAFRA:

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) has been notified of a case of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), caused by equine herpes virus 1 (EHV-1), in the Ottawa region.

The horse is currently receiving veterinary care at a referral center. OMAFRA has notified all veterinarians associated with animals that had contact with the suspect case in the preceding 10-14 days. EHV-1 infection in horses can cause respiratory disease, abortion, neonatal foal death, and/or neurological disease. Disease associated with EHV-1 infection is not federally reportable, but detection of the neuropathogenic strain is immediately notifiable by laboratories under the reporting regulation of the provincial Animal Health Act. Attending veterinarians suspicious of EHM should contact OMAFRA as soon as possible.

Because infected horses may show no clinical signs but still shed the virus, the temperature of suspect animals should be monitored twice daily for 14-21 days and any abnormalities discussed with a veterinarian. Neurological signs, if they develop, may include loss of balance, hind-limb weakness, recumbency, difficulty urinating, decreased tail tone and depression. It is important that a veterinarian assess suspect cases of EHM, since it can be difficult to distinguish this from other serious neurological diseases, such as rabies.

EHV-1 is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse, by sharing contaminated equipment (bits, buckets, towels, etc.) or by the clothing, hands or equipment of people who recently had contact with an infectious horse. This highlights the need for routine biosecurity measures (including hand hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices) to be in place at all times to prevent a disease outbreak. Special attention should be given to cleaning and disinfecting trailers.

Current EHV-1 vaccines may reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurological form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread. The best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[Of the previous 9 postings on Canadian EHV-1 cases, 7 were from Ontario and 2 from Saskatchewan. There were 2 reports in 2014 of cases in New York state.

To quote my colleague Tam Garland: This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately. This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease, EHM, has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may last longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

It should be noted that to date, 9 EHVs have been identified worldwide. Three of these -- EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV- 4 -- pose the most serious health risks for domesticated horses and can have significant economic impacts.

EHV-1: can cause 4 manifestations of disease in horses, including a neurological form, respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal death. EHM is most often due to mutant or neuropathogenic strains of EHV-1, so called because of a particular mutation in the genome.
EHV-3: causes a venereal disease called equine coital exanthema that affects the external genitalia.
EHV-4: causes a nonfatal upper respiratory tract disease in foals and is uncommonly associated with abortion and rarely with neurologic disease.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus. This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
