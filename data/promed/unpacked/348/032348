Japanese encephalitis has killed 6 people in Assam since April [2022] when floods and rain-induced landslides struck the State to claim 186 lives so far.

According to the office of the Mission Director of the National Health Mission (NHM) Assam, the 6 were among 48 Japanese encephalitis cases reported from April to [6 Jul 2022]. While 2 persons died in Jorhat district, a person each died in Kamrup, Lakhimpur, Nagaon and Dhemaji districts.

"With the floodwaters receding and inmates of relief camps returning to their houses, consumption of contaminated drinking water and subsequent health issues have been reported from some pockets in the districts. The district health teams have been instructed to intensify the monitoring and timely reporting of cases of fever for follow-up and action," M.S. Lakshmi Priya, NHM Assam's Mission Director said.

Tests for Japanese encephalitis are available free of cost in all district hospitals and government medical colleges and hospitals, she added.

The instruction followed a meeting on Wednesday [6 Jul 2022] to review steps undertaken to check the spread of water-borne and vector-borne diseases.

Apart from Japanese encephalitis, acute encephalitis syndrome has killed 16 people this year [2022], health officials said. They were among 143 cases reported so far. A total of 19 dengue cases have also been reported to date [6 Jul 2022].

Acute encephalitis syndrome is most widely caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus carried by mosquitoes.

On Wednesday [6 Jul 2022], a spokesperson of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said the flood situation eased considerably with the number of affected people declining from 4.26 lakh to 3.75 lakh [426 000 to 375 000] in the last 24 hours.

There are now 1.35 lakh [135 000] people taking shelter in 295 relief camps across 20 flood-affected districts compared with 1.48-lakh [148 000] people 24 hours ago [5 Jul 2022], the spokesperson said.

[Assam has been a state of very active Japanese (JE) virus transmission in recent years. Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission so more cases are likely to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic.

Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) has been a problematic diagnosis for a long time because the specific etiological factor involved is undetermined. Earlier this year (2022) Dr. T. Jacob John commented, "WHO has been promoting syndromic diagnoses for a variety of conditions, but this one, AES, has led to death due to misdiagnosis in many children. Such a diagnostic term to cover acute encephalitis (mostly viral such as JE, herpes simplex, West Nile), acute encephalopathy (mostly biochemical and non-infectious, such as hypoglycemic encephalopathy, heat hyperpyrexia, Reye syndrome), pyogenic meningitis (pneumococcal or _H. influenzae_ b, occasionally _N. meningitides_), cerebral complications of systemic diseases (scrub typhus, leptospirosis, chikungunya), TB meningitis, viral meningitis, cerebral malaria, brain abscess, etc., is not only unscientific but also unethical as it condones lack of further investigations, even a lumbar puncture.

"When clusters of cases are reported, the disease is taken as JE without protocol-based investigations. Acute encephalopathy and scrub typhus also may occur in clusters.

"I had repeatedly condemned this shortcut diagnostic term, which I declare is not a diagnostic term at all. Each child with brain fever (translation of 'chamki buckar') deserves an etiology-specific diagnosis, and the term AES is better avoided in clinical practice.

Without knowing the cause of AES, except for JE virus infections, prevention is not possible. - Mod.TY
