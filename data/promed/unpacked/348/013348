Mumps outbreak continues in Alberta
-----------------------------------------------
Public health officials are still trying to contain an outbreak of
mumps, after almost 100 cases of the virus were confirmed in southern
Alberta. In the Chinook Health Region, which covers the Lethbridge
area, most of the 38 confirmed and 21 suspected cases are connected
to the University of Lethbridge and Lethbridge College.

In the Calgary area, 57 cases have been reported between January and
October 2007; 43 of those cases were identified in October 2007
alone. Six of the recent cases were players on the University of
Calgary's Dino's hockey team. Health officials are now warning all
hockey players in the city not to share water bottles or mouth guards.

The province is offering free mumps immunizations in 2 phases: 1st to
post-secondary students, then to everyone in the high-risk population
between the ages of 17 and 26. People in this age group received only
one dose of the mumps vaccine when they were children, which is now
thought to have worn off. Those born before 1970 are assumed to have
been exposed to the mumps virus at some point in their life and are
therefore immune. Those younger than 17 have been vaccinated twice.

In an effort to publicize the immunization clinics, the province has
borrowed some graphic advertisements from Nova Scotia, where more
than 700 cases of mumps have been reported since an outbreak began
last February [2007]. In one ad, a pair of flaming basketballs are
accompanied by the headline: "The swelling's not so bad. It's the
severe testicular pain...'' It then reminds viewers that the mumps
can lead to sterility, meningitis and deafness. The posters have been
so popular that many have been stolen in the Chinook region.

Mumps is a viral infection of the salivary glands that causes fever,
headache and swollen glands around the jaw. In rare cases, it can
lead to serious complications such as those listed above. The virus
can be spread from about 7 days before glands become swollen to 9
days after. There is no specific treatment.

More than 13 500 people have already been vaccinated, and clinics
will continue into December 2007 at universities and colleges. A
general immunization phase is set to start in early December 2007 to
target the 475 000 people who could be at risk. Vanessa Maclean,
acting medical officer of health for the Chinook Health Region, says
it could still be a while before there's a slowdown in the number of
cases, noting that even after immunization, it takes about 12 days
for someone to be protected. Dr. Judy MacDonald of the Calgary Health
Region says she also expects to see more cases in the short term
because the vaccination campaign is just now in full activation.

[This update records the continued upsurge in cases of mumps
affecting an age group that was incompletely protected by a single
vaccine dose in the past. The outbreak is currently restricted mainly
to university and college students due to their seasonal aggregation
and housing in close contact. It is estimated that 475 000 people in
the general population remain at risk and will be offered a 2nd dose
of mumps vaccine in due course.
