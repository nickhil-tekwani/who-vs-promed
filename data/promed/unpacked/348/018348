2 alpacas imported from Canada into Norway have tested positive for bovine tuberculosis (bTB).

Antibodies against bovine tuberculosis were found in 2 alpacas, which are currently in solitary confinement on a farm in Hedmark. The 2 positive animals were imported from Canada along with 19 other alpacas in summer.

Camelids imported to Norway are tested for a number of animal diseases of which Norway is free, and the animals are kept isolated from other animals for half a year while testing is in progress.

Blood samples from the alpacas must be positive in 2 different serological methods performed by the Animal and Plant Health Agency as well as other tests before there is a strong suspicion of bovine tuberculosis.

Bovine tuberculosis is prevalent in many parts of the world, but as a result of testing cattle, it has been possible to limit the spread.

The disease can infect a variety of animal species and the authorities are therefore acting to prevent the introduction of this disease into Norway. The last time bovine tuberculosis was detected in Norway was in 1986.

The alpacas will be subjected to further tests before decisions are taken on what to do with the animals.

[The last occurrence of _Bov. tuberculosis_ (bTB) in Norway dates back to 1986. In Canada, the last case was reported in Manitoba province during May 2014.

The 1st general test of all areas of Canada for bTB was complete by 1961 when the national prevalence was reduced from over 4 percent in 1923 to approximately 0.1 percent. The classification of provinces/areas based on their TB status has been an effective approach in the latter stages of Canada's eradication effort. In 2009, bTB, carried by wild elk, was reported to increasingly threaten Manitoba cattle herds, causing farmers to call for a cull of the elk (see ProMED-mail post 20091023.3641).

Information on the tests which the Canadian-sourced alpacas underwent prior to their export to Norway will be helpful. - Mod.AS
