[This is the 1st time that WNFV is officially reported in Algeria.

The following abstract and conclusion come from an article titled "West Nile virus in Algeria: a comprehensive overview" by I. Lafr, A. Hachid, I. Bitam. Published January 2019, pages 9-13 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297518300933?via%3Dihub

Abstract
--------
West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus, related to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The virus is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle. WNV has recently dramatically expanded its geographical range and is now considered the most widespread arbovirus in the world, including the Americas, Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin. In Algeria, West Nile disease (WND) infections with human meningoencephalitis cases have been reported in 1994 in Tinerkouk (southwest Sahara. In autumn 2012, one fatal clinical case of WNV neuroinvasive infection was reported in Jijel (coastal east). During the same year [2012], a retrospective serosurvey performed in Algiers and bordering areas highlighted specific anti-WNV IgG in local population. Between 2013 and 2014 2 clinical cases were reported, in Timimoune (south) and Guelma (northeast), respectively. Although no case was reported in equids, serosurveys demonstrated its presence: an animal serosurvey was conducted in Djanet (south) in 1975, and in 2014 a seroprevalence of equids in the northeast part of Algeria highlighted a virus circulation. This review aims to evaluate the global epidemiologic situation of West Nile disease in Algeria, with an updated situation based on human cases, equine reports and entomologic investigations. Our study reinforces the need for building the capacity for surveillance in this region to prevent future emergence of WNV and other arboviruses.

Conclusion
----------
WND remains endemic in Algeria and the surrounding Mediterranean areas. Virus circulation becomes permanent and is probably maintained by insect vector movements and reintroduction of migratory birds. WNV circulation needs further monitoring programmes, including a permanent serosurvey of resident and migratory bird species involved in the reintroduction of this arboviral threat. Therefore, the entomologic identification of mosquito species through risk areas determines the role of other vectors such as argasid ticks in the dissemination and maintenance of WNV. Wetlands and surrounding areas should be rigorously assessed by a passive monitoring programme. The control of some anthropogenic and environmental factors could help prevent extension and reemergence of WNV epidemics. Regional and International collaborations would certainly upgrade the knowledge of WNV dynamic circulation and demonstrate unknown aspects of this arboviral disease. Finally, understanding WND epidemiology will certainly contribute to preventing the reoccurrence and spread of the infection among humans and animals in Algeria and the Mediterranean region. - Mod.CRD
