Rare mushroom blamed for mystery deaths in China
------------------------------------------------
A tiny mushroom, little known to scientists, is behind some 400
sudden deaths in China, experts say.

For 30 years, during the rainy season, scores of villagers in Yunnan
province have died suddenly of cardiac arrest. Following a 5-year
investigation, researchers from the Chinese Centre for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in Beijing say they have the culprit.

The mushroom, know as "little white", belongs to the _Trogia_ genus
and has 3 toxic amino acids, experts say.

Researchers found that the deaths, known as Yunnan sudden death
syndrome, occurred almost always during rainy season (from June to
August), and at an altitude of 1800-2400 m (5900-7900 ft).

Warning
-------
"We heard amazing stories about how people would drop dead in the
middle of a conversation," Zhang Shu, a cardiologist who took part in
the CDC study, told Science magazine.

"About two thirds of victims, in the hours before death experienced
symptoms such as heart palpitations, nausea, dizziness, seizures, and
fatigue," he said.

The investigation was initially hampered by language barriers, and
the remote locations of the Yunnan villages.

However, in 2008, the scientists noted that the little white mushroom
was often found in the homes where people had died.

Yunnan province is well-known for its wild mushrooms, many of which
are exported at high prices. Families, who make their living by
collecting and selling the fungi, eat the little white as it has no
commercial value -- it is too small and turns brown shortly after being picked.

A campaign to warn people against eating the tiny mushrooms has
dramatically reduced the number of deaths. There have been no
reported deaths so far this year [2010].

However, the scientists are carrying out further tests to find out
why the mushroom is so lethal, as testing found the mushroom
contained toxins, though not enough to be deadly.

"What's happening in Yunnan isn't expected from any other mushroom
toxin," said Robert Fontaine, a US epidemiologist who took part in
the investigation. "What we have here is a toxin that is picking off
vulnerable people," he told Science. He suggested that the toxins
could be acting together with high concentrations of barium, a heavy
metal, in the local water supply.

A tiny white mushroom may have triggered fatal heart attacks in
hundreds of villagers in south west China, scientists have said.

Researchers descended on Yunnan province in China 5 years ago to try
to solve the mystery of Yunnan sudden death syndrome. Each summer for
the past 30 years, during rainy season, scores of villagers of all
ages would suddenly drop dead because of cardiac arrest. As many as
400 deaths have been recorded since the 1980s. "We heard amazing
stories about how people would drop dead in the middle of a
conversation," said Zhang Shu, a cardiologist who assisted the
investigation by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention in Beijing.

There was a "very obvious clustering of deaths" in Yunnanese villages
"in a very short period of time in the summer," said Robert Fontaine,
an American epidemiologist who also took part in the study.
Initially, the team had trouble pinpointing the culprit. Most
villagers only spoke their own dialect while their villages were
remote and often blocked by landslides. Rapid burials made it
difficult to conduct autopsies.

However, in 2008, the scientists spotted that the _Trogia_ mushroom,
known locally as the little white or butterfly mushroom, was often
found in the homes where people had died.

Villagers who made their living by collecting and selling wild
mushrooms could not sell the _Trogia_ because it was too small.
Instead, they took them home and ate them. "We repeatedly found it at
all these sites," said Mr Fontaine.

A campaign to warn people against eating the tiny mushrooms has
dramatically reduced the number of deaths, with none reported so far
this year [2010].

However, the scientists remain unsure about why the mushroom is so
lethal. Tests have shown that while it contains toxins, it does not
contain enough to be deadly. Mr Fontaine hypothesised that the toxins
could be acting together with the high concentrations of barium, a
heavy metal, in the local water supply.

[There are about 20 different species of the _Trogia_ genus. The
mushroom was named for the mycologist Jacob G Trog from Switzerland.
The mushroom is believed to be in Marasmiaceae family. Shiitake
mushrooms are in this family. - Mod.TG]
