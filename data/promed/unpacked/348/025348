Nineteen people, 9 of them children, have died from food poisoning in Madagascar after eating a turtle, sources said Thursday [18 Mar 2021]. A total of 34 people were hospitalized on Monday 15 Mar 2021] in Vatomandry, in the east of the island, after eating the protected species, the Health and Food Safety Control Agency said. Ten of them died, it said. Another 9 people, all of them children, died at home after eating meat from the same turtle, the region's governor said.

Health authorities have warned against eating turtles as well as 2 dozen species of fish, which feed on algae that can be toxic during the November-March hot season. Dozens of food poisonings occur each year in coastal Madagascar, and deaths are common. Sixteen fatalities were recorded in 2 incidents in the 2017-2018 hot season.

[Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve (http://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0101&L=CTURTLE&P=R14884) by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands:

". . . 28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon, western province, Solomon Islands, suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, needles and pins, and general weakness after eating turtle meat (which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of Tue 16 Jan 2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the symptoms.

"Six people (all children between 3 months and 11 years old) out of the 28 people died [within 5 days]. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught, was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and the meat was unusually soft."

"From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified . . . As turtles feed on sea grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were deduced to be the source of the toxin."

"Abstract
--------
In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning attack rate was 48% with a lethality of 7.7%. Such [an] accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures.

Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the flesh of certain marine turtles (green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin, which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea; a burning sensation of the lips, tongue, and mouth; difficulty in swallowing; a tightness in the chest; skin rash; enlargement of the liver; or even coma and death. - Mod.LL
