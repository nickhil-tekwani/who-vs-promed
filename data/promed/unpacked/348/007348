Maine officials say a horse in Oxford County has been euthanized after testing positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], a virus transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.

The horse was vaccinated for EEE and West Nile Virus a year ago, but had not received a booster dose.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maine Department of Agriculture says 8 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive for EEE in York County this year [2013].

The state last saw EEE in horse in 2009, when 15 horses died of the disease. Signs of the disease in horses include stumbling or poor balance, unusual behavior, and lethargy. Other signs include head pressing, circling, tremors, seizures, and eventual coma.

[Vaccination is critical, and so is keeping the animal properly boosted with the vaccines. The immunity to EEE wanes rapidly and horses should be revaccinated about every 4 months.
