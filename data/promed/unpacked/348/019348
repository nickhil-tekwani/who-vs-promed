More than 20 people living in the 5 camps around Zalingei, capital of Central Darfur, died of a 'malaria-like disease' since [Fri 18 Sep 2015].

The symptoms of the disease are a loss of appetite and vomiting, high fever, and twinges, the coordinator of the Central Darfur camps told Radio Dabanga.

He said that the disease has emerged since the end of July [2015] and has affected many people in the 5 camps that host some 182 000 displaced. "Every family has at least one member suffering from the disease." He added that many people in Zalingei town are also affected.

He demanded the Central Darfur government and the state Ministry of Health develop a remedial plan and speed-up provision of the required medical staff.

[Zalingei is a town in southwestern Sudan with an estimated population of 27 258 in 2009 and is capital of Central Darfur, one of Sudan's 18 states (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalingei). Central Darfur is one of 5 states (Central, East, North, South, and West Darfur) that comprise the Darfur region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Darfur). A map showing the location of Central Darfur is available at http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/map_2981.pdf.

As a result of armed conflict, the Darfur region has many displaced people living in camps where malnutrition is compounded by extreme overcrowding, shortage of clean water, inadequate latrines, and appalling sanitary conditions. Many families have no shelter other than small, tarpaulin-covered huts that are highly vulnerable to heavy rains and winds.

There have been multiple reports of undiagnosed illness in the refugee camps in the Darfur region of Sudan in the past several years. The news report above says that a febrile ("malaria-like") illness has affected many people in the refugee camps around Zalingei and in Zalingei itself over the past 2 months. The illness has caused 20 deaths over the past several days.

However, with the limited information provided, it is difficult to speculate on which diseases could be circulating in the displaced person camps. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
