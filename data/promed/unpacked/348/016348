The USA government has announced a recall of 1.2 million pounds [544 000
kg] of salami and other "ready-to-eat sausages", related to a large,
ongoing salmonella outbreak. As of 23 Jan 2010, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC] reported that 184 potentially
outbreak-associated cases have been identified in 38 states, including 8
from Oregon and 14 from Washington state. Nationally, more than 35 people
have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported. The earliest
recognized cases began in July 2009, and CDC continues to report cases.

According to the Oregon state Department of Public Health, Rhode
Island-based Daniele brand salami has been identified as the source of the
outbreak. The Oregon DPH said in a statement [23 Jan 2010] that the

online. Vendors include Costco, Walmart, Sam's Club, Amazon, and other
locations. Most products are sold under the Daniele brand name, but several

[The specific serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is not stated in the
posting. As a dried, preserved meat, salami can be kept in the home for a
long time and, therefore, continue to be a potential hazard. - Mod.LL

A search of ProMED-mail's archives using "salami" as a title word finds
only 2 references -- one to trichinellosis [Trichinellosis, salami -
Argentina: (SFE) 20080722.2214] and one to VTEC [E. coli, VTEC, salami
