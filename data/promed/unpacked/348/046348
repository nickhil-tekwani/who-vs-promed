Plague in Congo DR: follow up, epizootic and new outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
This is a follow up of the WHO summary statement on plague in Congo DR (Plague - Congo DR (07): (IT) clusters, fatal, WHO 20200725.7606707) posted on ProMED 25 Jul 2020 (posted on the WHO website on 23 Jul 2020). As stated in the WHO article, since 12 Jun 2020, an upsurge of plague cases has been noted in the Rethy Health zone, Ituri province where response has been hampered by the insecurity due to the presence of the CODECO [Cooperative for the Development of Congo] armed group in the region. The COVID-19 pandemics and the rise in cases in Bunia town are further complicating the response team interventions in the area. Other health zones have since then been affected and the case number in Rethy health zone is still increasing with 62 cases reported to date of which 6 bubonic plague cases since 1 Aug 2020. It strongly suggests that plague is actively circulating in the rodent and flea population in the whole region. Indeed, 2 additional events are worth reporting.

On 22 Jul 2020, the central office of the Aru health zone (BCZ [Health Zone Central Office]), Ituri Province, Congo DR received an alert from the Titular Nurse of the Oronzi Health Area reporting a large rat fall around and inside houses in the Burenga village (N2.81114, E30.79158). This village is located 90 km [56 mi] north from the on-going Rethy outbreak area and 10 km [6.2 mi] west to the Uganda border. This information was relayed by the RECO (Community Relay Network) network who are volunteers trained in community monitoring and surveillance.

On 23 Jul 2020, a team composed of the technician from Aru General Reference Hospital (HGR) and the Chief Physician of Aru HGR -- who is the focal point for plague surveillance in this plague endemic zone -- was sent to the field to carry out an investigation. Upon arrival, the team observed a mass die-off of a single Muridae rodent species, the black rat (_Rattus rattus_). 3 blood samples were taken on freshly dead rat carcasses and the rapid diagnostic tests performed on fresh rat carcasses were positive for plague. No human cases have been reported to date.

The team has instructed the RECO to carry out insecticidal dusting of houses (as a measure to prevent flea borne plague transmission) by spraying them with a deltamethrin-based solution, to raise awareness among the population and finally to go to the Health Centre as soon as symptoms consistent with either forms of plague appear. This rapid response highlights the success of recent community awareness campaigns that followed the Rethy Area outbreak reported on 14 Jun 2020 (ProMED archive no. 20200617.7480784) and updated on 25 Jul 2020 by WHO (ProMED archive no. 20200725.7606707).

On 31 Jul 2020 a new plague outbreak was noted in the Logo Health Zone in the Kanga Health Area sharing a border with the Wala health area, in Jupanjaya village (N2.05394, E30.94094, 1985m asl [above sea level]). Rat falls have also been reported in several villages of the health area and in particular in Juparima village (N2.08094, E30.95742, 1977m asl) where _R. rattus_ have been dying in houses and peri-domestic bushes.

So far 4 human cases have been reported and confirmed microbiologically at the Logo General Reference Hospital (Wayson staining of bubo aspirate). The index case is a 23 month old female from Jupanjaya village. Since 30 Jul 2020, the child had had chills and fever. On 31 Jul 2020, the child's condition worsened with impaired breathing, high fever, which prompted her mother to seek treatment at the health center. At her admission, the child presented with fever at 38 deg C [100.4 deg F], and dyspnea. The nurse excluded malaria with a negative RDT [rapid diagnostic test] and confirmed the pneumonia which he treated with amoxicillin and paracetamol. Slight improvements were observed, that is, fever and dyspnea regressed, however in the morning of 1 Aug 2020, the presence of left axillary bubo was noted and the child condition relapsed. 3 more of bubonic plague cases have been reported: an 8 year old boy was reported on 2 Aug 2020 from Moo village (N2.06797 E30.97878, 1555m asl), 21 year old female on 11 Aug 2020 from Raa village (N2.07814 E30.92981, 2044m asl) and a 24 month female on 14 Aug 2020 from Kanga village (N2.07428 E30.95431, 1955m asl).

Given that this area has experienced pneumonic plague in recent years, the RECOs are leading an awareness campaign to broadcast preventive measures, and are actively searching for cases in the communities to refer them to the health centres. Household insecticidal dusting with deltamethrin is on-going. While the medical staff of the Ituri Province is well trained and prepared to respond to plague outbreaks, the underfunding of plague response teams, the lack of research on the origin of infected rodents and fleas, the gaps in our understanding on the factors triggering plague reemergence, and the current sanitary and security realms should be emphasized. The evolution of these multiple outbreaks should be closely monitored and dealt with.

This is the 7th outbreak of human plague (epidemiological threshold is 1 to declare an outbreak, according to the country's plague response guidance manual) in the region in less than a year.

The frequency of the rat falls is an early alert signal that plague may be circulating and there is an urgent need for communication and outreach campaigns throughout the whole plague endemic area.

Interestingly since June 2020, plague has also reemerged in China (ProMED archive nos: 20200809.7660510 and 20200706.7543168), the USA (ProMED archive nos: 20200808.7658204 and 20200729.7622263), Mongolia (ProMED archive no. 20200720.7591590), and Russia (ProMED archive no. 20200812.7670859) raising even more questions on the conditions prevailing in these areas and the factors triggering plague reemergence in animal populations worldwide.
