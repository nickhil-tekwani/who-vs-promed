Rabies has broken out in Mansa district, which has recorded 14 cases
[canine or human?] and one [human] death in the recent past. District
livestock officer Beatwell Mbewe said yesterday [14 Oct 2011] in Mansa
[district] that the 14 cases [canine or human?] were recorded in
Chembe area, while one person died in Mwang'uni after being bitten by
an infected dog.

Mr Mbewe said that, despite there being no cure, the disease could be
prevented if a person bitten by a rabid dog received treatment before
the symptoms manifested themselves. He said one of the commonest
symptoms of rabies in human beings is failure to swallow food or
having a condition known as hydrophobia, or fear to drink water.

As a way to prevent the spread of the disease, the department of
livestock embarked on a mass rabies vaccination campaign in which more
than 500 dogs in Mansa district were expected to be covered. Mr Mbewe
said rabies vaccine centres had been opened in the Senama, Kapesha,
Namandwe and Suburbs areas.

He called on members of the public to report to the department of
livestock, the police and hospital or clinic immediately after being
bitten by any dog as a way of preventing the deadly disease.

Rabies is a disease of dogs and other animals that causes madness and
death. But infected animals could pass the disease to humans if they
are bitten.

[Dog rabies potentially threatens over 3.3 billion people in Asia and
Africa. People most at risk live in rural areas where human vaccines
and immunoglobulin are not readily available or accessible. Wound
cleansing and immunization within a few hours after contact with a
suspect rabid animal can prevent the onset of rabies and death. The
local authorities in Mansa appear to be well aware of the problem and
the remedy.

Post-exposure prevention consists of local treatment of the wound,
administration of rabies immunoglobulin (if indicated), and immediate
vaccination. In developing countries, the vaccination status of the
suspected animal alone should not be considered when deciding whether
to initiate prophylaxis or not. It must be presumed that the single
fatal human case in Mwang'uni had been bitten by a rabid dog and did
not receive appropriate treatment.

Mansa is the capital of Luapula province of Zambia and headquarters of
Mansa district. It takes its name from the Mansa River, which flows
west to the Luapula River. Mansa district can be located in the
