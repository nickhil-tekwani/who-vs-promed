[1] Moderna vaccine adverse reactions
[A] Single batch allergic reactions
Date: Mon 18 Jan 2021

California's top epidemiologist told healthcare providers on Sunday [17 Jan 2021] to stop using a batch of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine after a "higher than usual" number of people had apparent allergic reactions at a San Diego vaccination clinic. California has received about 330 000 doses from the Moderna lot in question -- about 10% of all the vaccines, both Moderna's and Pfizer's, that have been distributed across the Golden State, officials said.

The apparent allergic reactions occurred at San Diego County's drive-through mass vaccination site at Petco Park, said California Department of Public Health spokesman Darrel Ng. A "higher than usual" number of patients who received the vaccine appeared to be suffering from allergic reactions. Their symptoms were severe and required medical attention, Pan said.

Dr Eric McDonald, San Diego County's director of epidemiology, said during a livestreamed news briefing Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] that operations at Petco Park slowed down after 6 healthcare workers who had just been vaccinated had apparent allergic reactions. "That number, clustered together, was slightly higher than expected for the time period," McDonald said. He said the health providers swapped out the batch of vaccines they were administering, "in the possible event" that reactions were connected.

"Any vaccination, whether it's the COVID vaccination or the flu vaccination at your doctor's office, should be given under medical supervision," McDonald said. "In this case, with a new vaccine, there are very specific guidelines that all sites giving this vaccine must follow." That includes monitoring patients after the shot is administered for at least 15 minutes, and longer in cases where patients have a medical condition that could lead to an allergic reaction.

The Petco Park site has the capacity to administer 5000 shots per day. It's one of several mega-sites that launched in California within the last week, including a similar clinic at Dodger Stadium that city officials say will soon have a capacity of about 12 000 shots daily.

No other cluster of issues, or individual issues, have been reported with the Moderna batch, lot 041L20A, which was distributed to 287 medical providers across the state, officials said. The batch arrived in California between [5 and 12 Jan 2021].

"There are not immediate replacement doses during the pause in addition to pending orders scheduled for shipment in the next few days," the state said in a statement sent to medical providers.

Moderna did not immediately return a request seeking comment.

California State epidemiologist statement recommending providers pause administration of single lot of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
California State Epidemiologist Dr Erica S Pan issued the following statement today [17 Jan 2021] recommending providers pause the administration of lot 41L20A of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine due to possible allergic reactions that are under investigation.

"Our goal is to provide the COVID vaccine safely, swiftly, and equitably," said Dr Pan. "A higher-than-usual number of possible allergic reactions were reported with a specific lot of Moderna vaccine administered at one community vaccination clinic. Fewer than 10 individuals required medical attention over the span of 24 hours. Out of an extreme abundance of caution and also recognizing the extremely limited supply of vaccine, we are recommending that providers use other available vaccine inventory and pause the administration of vaccines from Moderna Lot 041L20A until the investigation by the CDC, FDA, Moderna and the state is complete. We will provide an update as we learn more."

All appeared to be experiencing a possible severe allergic reaction during the standard observation period -- a type of adverse event that the CDC reports some people have experienced when receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.

While no vaccine or medical procedure is without risk, the risk of a serious adverse reaction is very small. While less data exists on adverse reactions related to the Moderna vaccine, a similar vaccine shows that the expected rate of anaphylaxis is approximately 1 in 100 000.

More than 330 000 doses from this lot have been distributed to 287 providers across the state. The shipments arrived in California between [5 and 12 Jan 2021]. The state has not been notified of any other cluster or individual events related to this lot.

The manufacturer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are reviewing the lot and related medical information.

Below is the recommendation sent to providers today [17 Jan 2021]:

Recommendation that providers pause administration of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine Lot 041L20A
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This week, a higher-than-usual number of adverse events were reported with a specific lot of Moderna vaccine (Moderna Lot 041L20A) administered at one community vaccination clinic. Fewer than 10 individuals required medical attention over the span of 24 hours. Follow up investigation of outcomes of these individuals is underway, and more information will be forthcoming.

All appeared to be experiencing a possible severe allergic reaction during the standard observation period -- a type of adverse event that the CDC reports some people have experienced when receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine site switched to another lot of Moderna vaccine after closing for a few hours.

The manufacturer, CDC, and FDA are promptly reviewing the lot and related medical information. No additional clusters have been reported. Their investigation continues, and we expect to learn more this week.

Out of an extreme abundance of caution and also recognizing the extremely limited supply of vaccine, we are recommending that providers use other available vaccine inventory and pause administration of vaccines from Moderna Lot 041L20A until the investigation is complete.

There are no immediate replacement doses during the pause in addition to pending orders scheduled for shipment in the next few days.

We expect to provide an update this week as we learn more.

Providers of COVID-19 vaccine should continue their routine precautions to recognize and manage allergic reactions and potential adverse events.

[The frequency of adverse reactions following COVID RNA vaccination is more frequent than following flu vaccination, that is, the US public health agency said allergic reactions were found to occur at a rate of 11.1 per one million vaccinations, compared with flu vaccines, in which such reactions occur at a rate of 1.3 per one million shots.

The State did the right thing to play it safe and pull the single lot causing problems until further analysis is complete. Note that this report is about Moderna vaccine while the following MMWR report is on Pfizer-BioNTech.

"Summary
--------
What is already known about this topic?
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs rarely after vaccination.

What is added by this report?
During [14-23 Dec 2020], monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System detected 21 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of a reported 1 893 360 1st doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (11.1 cases per million doses); 71% of these occurred within 15 minutes of vaccination.

"What are the implications for public health practice?
"Locations administering COVID-19 vaccines should adhere to CDC guidance for use of COVID-19 vaccines, including screening recipients for contraindications and precautions, having the necessary supplies available to manage anaphylaxis, implementing the recommended postvaccination observation periods, and immediately treating suspected cases of anaphylaxis with intramuscular injection of epinephrine."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the next weeks and months, physicians will face questions regarding the science, safety, and efficacy of the 1st wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines to be authorized and distributed. In most cases, these vaccine platforms will be new technologies that have not previously been administered other than through clinical trials. Although the initial data on efficacy and safety are extraordinarily encouraging, many questions remain regarding who should receive these vaccines and the immediate, intermediate, and long-term impact of the vaccination program on the pandemic. In this article, we provide a perspective on the vaccines furthest along in development in the United States, 2 of which have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been recommended for use by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is important to note that an EUA by the FDA is a mechanism used during a declared public health emergency to get potentially effective interventions as quickly as possible to those who might benefit and is not the same as formal FDA approval.

The vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are the 1st coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines to receive EUA and are currently being distributed according to the priorities set by the CDC (Table 1). These vaccines, and all vaccines currently under study in phase 2 or 3 trials in the United States, utilize the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as their antigen. This glycoprotein is present on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion, enables entry of the virion into cells through binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2), and is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines consist of synthetically produced messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that encode a stabilized form of the spike protein formulated in a lipid nanoparticle. Although the mRNA-lipid nanoparticle platform is not part of any currently licensed vaccine, it has been studied in humans for the past 10 years as investigational vaccine candidates for influenza virus, Ebola virus, and other diseases. Vaccines are deemed efficacious by preventing infection, transmission, mild disease, and/or severe disease. An interim analysis of the 2-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine observed 95% protection against symptomatic disease (1,2); similar data were seen for the Moderna vaccine (3,4) (Table 2). Although the total number of cases of severe disease were small in these trials, substantially fewer severe cases were observed in vaccine recipients than placebo recipients (Table 2). Of note, there was an indication of effectiveness even before the 2nd dose for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (Figure). Reactogenicity consistent with a vigorous immune response occurred in over half of the vaccine recipients, as evidenced by local injection-site reactions and mild systemic symptoms, such as myalgia and fatigue. However, the incidence of severe adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. The incidence and severity of local and systemic reactions to these vaccines were above those of seasonal influenza virus vaccines, and this should be made known to potential recipients before vaccination. However, as noted by the FDA Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the risk-benefit analysis strongly favors immunization being safer for most individuals compared with the risks for infection. Following closely behind the mRNA vaccines are 2 vaccines undergoing testing that use adenoviral vectors: the AstraZeneca vaccine, using a chimpanzee-derived adenovirus (ChAdOx), and the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine, using a human adenovirus (Ad26). These are replication-incompetent viral vectors in which part of the viral DNA has been deleted and the DNA of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been inserted. These vaccine vectors can enter host cells and express the spike protein but are unable to replicate. Given that there is substantial natural exposure to the approximately 70 types of circulating human adenoviruses, preexisting immunity to the vaccine platform from prior adenoviral infections could dampen the immune response to the spike protein antigens expressed by an adenoviral vaccine. Both adenoviral vaccines are designed to minimize this problem by selecting vectors with low seroprevalence in humans. Johnson & Johnson/Janssen has recently published interim results of their phase 1-2a study showing their approach is immunogenic (5) and recently completed enrollment in their approximately 45 000-volunteer phase 3 study. Initial results are expected in early 2021. AstraZeneca recently announced interim results of its international phase 3 trial and noted approximately 70% protection from clinical disease overall (6). Of note, those results were a composite of 2 different dosing regimens used in several countries. While efficacy was as high as 90% in a small cohort of participants in the United Kingdom who received a 50% lower 1st dose than the remainder of the study population and 62% in those who received the full dose for both the prime and the boost, it is unclear if this difference in efficacy is related to differences in dose, the interval between doses (4-12 weeks), or other confounding factors. Data from the AstraZeneca trial in the United States using a full dose for both the prime and the boost (at 28 days) are expected in early 2021.

There are many additional vaccine platforms in various stages of development around the world. Among the most advanced in testing in the United States are the spike protein vaccine produced by Novavax, which is in advanced phase 3 testing in the United Kingdom and early phase 3 testing in the United States, and the spike protein vaccine from Sanofi-GlaxoSmithKline, which is using Sanofi's established technology for producing influenza virus vaccines. Both the Novavax and Sanofi-GlaxoSmithKline proteins are produced in insect cells using recombinant baculovirus. In addition to these vaccines, Merck has begun phase 1 testing of an attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the spike protein. Each of these approaches has some unique attributes with regard to immunogenicity, cost, reactogenicity, ease of administration, and distribution logistics (such as cold chain requirements).

As the 1st wave of vaccines is now rolling out, health care providers need to be prepared to address questions regarding the safety of these vaccines. As large populations become vaccinated, it is possible for rare side effects to emerge. Although these vaccines have been administered to tens of thousands of people, very rare and serious side effects can be observed only after vaccination of millions of people. Also of note, in any large immunization campaign, many adverse events will be noted in individuals after vaccination given the fact that adverse events (for example, heart attack, stroke, and diabetes complications) occur every day in the absence of vaccination. It would be difficult to clearly attribute these temporally associated events to vaccination without better data pointing to a causal relationship. We will need to rely on careful epidemiologic evaluations of such events to sort out background morbidities within the population from the identification of new, rare side effects attributable to the vaccines. While most vaccine-related adverse events would be expected over the 1st few weeks to months after vaccination, the possibility remains that some could occur over the longer term. The logistics of collection and aggregation of such data will be highly complex given the number of vaccines that might be available by mid-2021, the number of shots required, and the diverse outlets planned for vaccination. Anyone suspecting an adverse event from vaccination is encouraged to report it to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html).

Additional unknowns include the safety and efficacy of the vaccines in "special" populations, such as children, pregnant women, individuals with underlying illnesses, and those taking medications that might influence the immune response to a vaccine. The phase 3 trials were carefully designed to include participants who were diverse with regard to ethnicity, race, age, and comorbidities; however, they typically excluded pregnant women, children, and those with immunodeficiency or a history of allergic reactions to vaccines. Although persons younger than 16 years were excluded from their phase 3 trials, both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have plans to test their vaccines in pediatric populations. Additional studies are underway to examine safety and immunogenicity in larger groups of special populations. The recent examples of immediate hypersensitivity reactions in a number of recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, some with a history of hypersensitivity reactions, highlight this point.

Another unknown is the duration of protection provided by these vaccines. Data were recently published on the serum antibody response to the Moderna vaccine out to 119 days after the 1st vaccination (90 days after the 2nd immunization) (7). Although there was only an approximately 2-fold decline in antibody titers over this time, in prior trials of influenza virus vaccines using the mRNA and protein platforms, serum antibodies waned dramatically by 6 months to 1 year (8). At present, the durability of the immune response to the spike protein is unknown. It is possible that symptomatic or severe disease may be durably curtailed by memory T-cell and/or B-cell responses, however, this remains uncertain and the duration of protection needs to be carefully monitored.

Perhaps the unknown with the greatest potential immediate impact on the current pandemic is the degree to which these vaccines protect against infection and transmission. The high degree of protective efficacy reported thus far in these trials refers to symptomatic disease. Protection from actual infection may be considerably less, whereas protection from severe disease may be considerably higher. The ability of these vaccines to protect against infection is being analyzed by looking for evidence of asymptomatic infections in the vaccinated cohorts in the phase 3 trials through shedding of virus by asymptomatic individuals and development of antibodies to viral proteins not included in the vaccines. In preliminary data reported to the FDA by Moderna, 38 participants in the placebo group compared with 14 participants in the vaccine group were found to be shedding virus in the absence of symptoms before the 2nd immunization, suggesting a degree of protection from infection and, by extension, decreased transmission. The distinction between immunity that protects a vaccinated person from developing symptomatic disease and immunity capable of also interrupting transmission of the virus from the vaccinated person to others is an important consideration for population immunity. This distinction is frequently lost in discussions about the collective societal responsibility to get vaccinated to reach an adequate level of population (herd) immunity to eliminate transmission. Failure to appreciate this distinction may lead to a false sense in vaccinees that they are protected from infection and thus cannot transmit to susceptible contacts. Hence, it is critical to continue to reinforce the public health measures of social distancing, handwashing, and masking until the current outbreak is under control.

Given that recent polling suggests that only 40%-60% of people in the United States are currently planning to get vaccinated, it is conceivable that without some impact on transmission, the virus will continue to circulate, infect, and cause serious disease in certain segments of the unvaccinated population. Administration of parenterally administered vaccines alone typically does not result in potent mucosal immunity that might interrupt infection or transmission (9). In the case of poliovirus, induction of mucosal immunity through vaccination with the live attenuated oral polio vaccine, in contrast to the parenterally administered inactivated vaccine, was thought to have played a critical role in interruption of transmission and control of poliovirus epidemics (10). For these reasons, additional data regarding protection from infection should be generated as soon as possible. If these vaccines do not provide durable, high levels of protection from infection, and do not drive the prevalence of virus in the community to near zero, a thorough analysis of shedding and transmission will need to be done through additional study. Armed with such data, public health officials can make decisions regarding prioritization of populations to receive the vaccine, and researchers could potentially improve upon the 1st wave of vaccines.

Progress toward effective vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 has proceeded at an unprecedented pace. In the coming weeks and months, physicians must be prepared to explain the rapidly increasing body of data supporting the safety and efficacy of these vaccines, while at the same time acknowledging some degree of uncertainty. The FDA and CDC have provided thorough and thoughtful reviews leading to decisions that have been informed by public consultation and independent advisory panels. Answers to frequently asked questions are posted on their websites and frequently updated. The road ahead will almost certainly have plenty of bumps, and our current understanding of these vaccines is very likely to change over the coming months. It is incumbent on frontline professionals to be well informed about these vaccines to provide evidence-based recommendations to their patients on whether to be vaccinated. Health care providers should keep a watchful eye out for new information on safety, efficacy, and durability as it becomes available. It is highly likely that vaccination and its subsequent ability to prevent disease will provide critical and life-saving benefit in the coming months and may be one of our surest ways to emerge from this pandemic to a more normal society. Acknowledging that there is still much to learn while strongly encouraging vaccination is arguably one of the most critical challenges facing health care providers today. Having a clear understanding of the data supporting the use of these new vaccines is critical to addressing that challenge.

[This is an excellent review of the vaccines currently being administered to protect individuals from COVID disease, but the authors raise a number of important unknowns. For one, it is not known what the impact on infection and transmission is, and the effectiveness of the vaccine on individuals with exacerbating conditions or taking medications that may interfere with boosting a robust immune response. Safety and efficacy are becoming clearer as the number of vaccinees increases and rare adverse events are being observed such as temporary paralysis. (See reports above on this problem.) Data on the duration of protection is becoming clearer as it is monitored over time since vaccination.

[3] Germany (Bavaria): new variant
[A]
Date: Mon 18 Jan 2021
Source: I Am Expat [edited]
https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/german-expat-news/new-covid-mutation-discovered-bavaria


First the UK and South Africa, and now Bavaria: a new variant of COVID-19 has apparently been discovered in a hospital in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Virologist Christian Drosten is currently investigating.

New COVID mutation sent for testing in Berlin
---------------------------------------------
According to a number of media reports, a new mutation of coronavirus has been discovered at the Garmisch-Partenkirchen hospital in Bavaria. The Muenchner Merkur reports that, following a coronavirus outbreak during which 73 patients and employees tested positive, the hospital's laboratory found some irregularities in the samples collected. Swabs from the 3 affected patients were sent to the Charite hospital in Berlin to undergo further testing. A more in-depth analysis then confirmed what the doctors already suspected: they had found a new COVID mutation.

The previously-unknown strain is now being examined by the virologist Christian Drosten. He and his team will now decipher the characteristics of this variant to clarify what caused this change. It is as yet unclear where the mutation came from and if it is more contagious. More concrete results are expected at the end of January [2021].

No evidence that new Bavarian strain is more infectious
-------------------------------------------------------
"Scare tactics would be absolutely dubious and inappropriate. The fact that it is a new variant does not mean that it is more infectious," said the Garmisch-Partenkirchen hospital in a statement. It's worth pointing out that, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 12 000 changes in the sequences of the virus have been discovered worldwide.

Recently, 2 new strains were detected in the UK and South Africa, which have proven to be more aggressive and contagious. But, according to experts, there is no evidence that these new strains are any more deadly. Vaccine makers are also confident that all currently available vaccines will continue to work against the new variants.

A crisis team is now meeting in Garmisch-Partenkirchen to discuss how to proceed.

Another new variant of the coronavirus may have been discovered at a hospital in Bavaria following an outbreak among patients and staff. At the hospital in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, known as a skiing and hiking destination situated at the foot of the Bavarian Alps, 52 patients and 21 employees had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. During the outbreak at the hospital, it had been suspected that an altered variant might have played a role in the new infections. This was confirmed in an interim report from Berlin's Charite on Monday [18 Jan 2021], where samples are currently being examined.

However, it is still unclear whether the change is truly new and whether it has an impact on the rate of infection or the severity of the disease.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, several changes in the genetic sequences of the virus have been recorded worldwide. Currently, 2 variants (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) initially detected in the UK and South Africa are considered to be of particular relevance for Europe. These variants, also detected in parts of Germany, are thought to be highly contagious.

A new genome sequence?
----------------------
The pathogen detected at the Garmisch-Partenkirchen hospital is not one of these 2 variants, explained Clemens Stockklausner, deputy medical director and head of pediatrics and adolescent medicine at the hospital. There is no mutation at position 501 -- this would be typical for the British and the South African mutation. However, a piece of the spike protein is missing at positions 69 and 70, he said. "Now it depends on what other changes can be found in the genome of the virus to make an informed classification," Stockklausner said. Sequencing the entire genome takes about 10 days, he said. "We expect to hear back with more meaningful details by the end of January [2021]."

[I can't help but think we are in a heightened "seek and ye shall find mode" with respect to identifying variants. As is mentioned in the discussions above, and in many previous discussions, these viruses are continually mutating, some helpful to further the "life" of the virus, others less so. When exposed to the pressures of herd immunity, successful (for the virus) mutations will avoid the protective antibodies both natural immunity from infection as well as vaccine induced.

The above discussion re the significance of the mutations seen in Bavaria is similar to those discussed in COVID-19 update (23): USA (CA) new variant, South Asia, WHO, global 20210118.8112752, with respect to the significance of the L452R variant identified in Santa Clara California. It is unclear if these newly identified variants really are associated with increased transmission or were the viruses "lucky enough" to be involved in a superspreading event leading to an increase in presence of the variant.

More studies are necessary to identify the significance of these newly identified variants. And now that there are more concerted efforts focused on increasing the sequencing of viral isolates, one should not be surprised if we keep learning of more and more variant strains identified. - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 59.7% of daily case numbers and 60.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 41.68 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and Canada. 6 additional countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (Peru, Chile, Panama, Bolivia, Dominican Republic, and Honduras) and an additional 4 countries (Paraguay, Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and El Salvador) reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. These decreases in reported cases are consistent with the previously observed weekend reporting artifacts.

- The European region reported 25.6% of daily case numbers and 27.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 30.66 million. Countries not reporting cases include Spain, Belgium (1 case), Sweden, Switzerland, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, among others. The UK maintains its dominance (albeit reduced), followed by Russia, France, Italy, and Portugal (reporting more than 10 000 cases). Another 12 countries reported more than 1000 cases, and an additional 5 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.3% of daily case numbers and 3.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 5.36 million cases. Iran maintains its dominance, reporting just over 6000 cases, followed by Lebanon, UAE, Tunisia, Pakistan, and Libya. Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, and Oman reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The African region reported 3.7% of daily case numbers and 3.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 2.33 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, with over 12 200 cases, followed by Zambia, and Nigeria. Ghana, Mozambique, Malawi, Cameroon, and Botswana reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

[Definite weekend reporting artifact. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases include Sweden and Venezuela, among other countries. Countries experiencing significant decreases in reported cases since Fri 15 Jan 2021 include USA (down 43.2%), Germany (down 53.5%), the UK (down 32.7%), Brazil (down 64.6%), South Africa (down 39.4%), and Mexico (down 62.2%), among others. The global daily newly reported deaths have decreased by 37.7% since Fri 15 Jan 2021.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (144 326), Spain (84 287), and the UK (37 535), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9631 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 17 Jan to late 18 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries) include the USA, Spain, UK, Brazil (24 139), Russia (22 857), and Colombia (14 719). A total of 49 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (compared with 55 on Fri 15 Jan 2021); 23 of the 49 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region (down from 28 on Fri 15 Jan 2021), 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 17.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 96.0 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.04 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even with the weekend reporting artifact. Africa has been showing increases over the last few weeks with now 3-4 countries reporting over 1000 cases per day. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 8 out of the last 9 days. It is too early to tell whether the major lockdowns in Europe are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
