Oyster Herpes: Latest Symptom of Global Warming?
------------------------------------------------
In July [2010] lab testing of farmed oysters
detected the 1st known United Kingdom cases of
herpes in the shellfish. The virus has already
killed between 20 to 100 percent of breeding
Pacific oysters in some French beds in 2008,
2009, and 2010, according to the French Research
Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer).
The reason for oyster herpes's emergence in
Pacific oysters off England remains a mystery,
though global warming may have played a part, experts speculate.

A new strain named _Ostreid herpesvirus 1
(OsHV-1) (mew-var)_, the virus remains dormant
until water temperatures exceed 16 C [61 degrees
F], which U.K. waters reach in the height of
summer, according to Kevin Denham of the British
government's Fish Health Inspectorate. With that
in mind, Tristan Renault, director of Ifremer's
genetic and pathology lab, said that global
warming "could be an explanation of the
appearance of this particular type of the virus."

Though all herpes strains are DNA-based viruses,
herpes, which infects everything from cows to
clams to monkeys, comes in a wide variety of
species, each with their own unique set of
symptoms. Among humans, perhaps the best known
forms are the Herpes simplex viruses, which are
spread through close contact and can manifest
themselves as oral and genital blisters.

Ostreid herpes viruses are known to affect not
only oysters but also clams, scallops, and other
mollusks, according to Renault. Herpes-infected
shellfish aren't new to science, but in 2008the
1st year a huge increase in mortality rates was
detected in FranceIfremer detected a new variation of the virus.

Like the other strains of herpes that affect
mollusks, OsHV-1 (mew-var) attacks young oysters
during breeding season, when the mollusks' bodies
are so focused on producing sperm and eggs that
the oysters have no energy to maintain an immune
system, Renault said. But OsHV-1 (mew-var) is
"more virulent than strains we identified
before," Renault said, adding that the virus is
so efficient at killing its hosts that it can
wipe out 80 percent of the oysters in a bed
within a week. That death rate is the only
outward sign something's wrong, he added, because
a oyster herpes have no visible symptoms, and
diagnosis is possible only through lab testing.

Though oyster herpes can't be transmitted to
humans, it does threaten the fishing industry,
since dead oysters are unsafe for eatingand
that's exactly what worries oyster harvesters
such as Seasalter Shellfish. Based in the
southeastern English city of Whitstable, where
oysters have been harvested for centuries,
Seasalter this summer became the 1st company to
discover the herpes-ravaged oysters in the U.K.
The finding prompted an investigation by the Fish
Health Inspectorate, which detected the virus and
learned that Seasalter had employed equipment
previously used in France to refurbish oyster beds.

"We were told it had been out of the water for a
number of years," Denham said. "Nevertheless
there's still a possibility" that the virus could
have traveled from infected French beds via the
gear. Possible culprits also include other reused
equipment or water transferred from an infected area.

To keep the U.K. oyster-herpes outbreak from
spreading, the British government has banned the
shipping of oysters out of affected areas, most
of which, like Whitstable, are around the mouth
of the River Thames in southeastern England.

No matter what measures are taken, Denham said,
oyster herpes is going to be tough to kick. Even
if all the infected Pacific oysters are removed
from oyster farms, wild Pacific oysters will
still be present in surrounding waters, perhaps
acting as "a reservoir for infection."

It's unlikely, though, that OsHV-1 (mew-var)
would end up in U.S. oyster beds, Renault said,
because the United States doesn't typically
import oysters from Europe. But a less virulent,
herpes-like virus has been detected in farmed
oysters off California. If sea temperatures
continue to rise, he said, perhaps (mew-var) or
something like it could emerge in U.S. waters too.

Epidemiological comments:
Movement controls in the form of a confirmed
designation have been applied to the Oyster
herpesvirus Containment Area known as
"Compartment 6 - Swale, Thames and North Kent Coast".
Under the current conditions of the designation,
movements of _Crassostrea gigas_ are permitted
only for direct human consumption, subject to hygiene regulations.
In addition, the controls stipulate that disposal
of dead Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas of all
stages must be by an approved method for disposal
of Category 2 animal-by-product waste.
Epidemiological investigations are underway.

Oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1, (mew-var)), United Kingdom
-----------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological comments:
Kent outbreak
1. Update as of 29 July 2010

Since the initial outbreak further samples have
been collected from the other Crassostrea gigas
farms in the containment area and from a wild
population of this species. At present, there are
no indications that the virus has spread to other
stocks within the containment area and no further
mortalities have been reported, although not all
tests have been completed to date. We have been
notified of 2 sites that received _C. gigas_ from
the affected farm earlier this year and prior to
the outbreak. To date, neither site has reported
mortalities or stock problems; however,
arrangements are in place to test both sites.

An initial epidemiological study and report has
been produced; there is no evidence of spread
from the area, but a number of possible routes
that the virus may have entered the positive site
have been identified, although none has been
confirmed as the route of infection. The
epidemiological investigation is continuing.

The surveillance programme for OsHV-1 (mew-var)
in the rest of the United Kingdom is continuing;
to date, no further reports of abnormal mortality
have been received and no other positive results have been recorded.

2. Update as of 5 August 2010

Since the previous follow-up report, there are no
changes to the epidemiological situation except
that the mortality on the 1st affected site
appears to have peaked with stock loss reported
to have reached 100 percent in some stocks on
site. To date, there have been no other reported
mortalities or stock problems within or outside
the OsHV containment area and the surveillance
programme for OsHV-1 (mew-var) in the rest of the United Kingdom is continuing.

Of the 3 additional samples collected from other
-C. gigas- sites within the containment area
post-outbreak, one has been confirmed as
negative; results are still pending for the other
2 samples. Contact testing is underway for the 2
sites that received -C. gigas- from the affected farm earlier this year.

Oyster herpesvirus (OsHV-1, (mew-var)), United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological comments:
Update as of 12 Aug 2010

Kent outbreak:
The mortality event at the affected site is now
reported as having passed, and the 1st of the 2
consecutive inspections required by Article 4 of
Commission Regulation (EU) 175/2010 is scheduled
to be carried out today, this is approximately
one month after the initial report of the abnormal mortality.

Contact chasing of the 2 sites that had purchased
stock from within the Containment Area prior to
the identification of the infection is now
complete as are the tests for the 3 additional
samples collected within the containment area,
and all samples have tested negative by PCR.
There is therefore no evidence for the spread of
infection from the actual site that experienced the mortality.

The surveillance programme for the rest of the
coast of England and Wales is continuing, and to
date no further positive results for OsHV-1 have occurred.

Suspected Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV1), Ireland
-------------------------------------------------
Information received on 16 Aug 2010 from Mr
Patrick J. Rogan, Chief Veterinary Officer,
Agriculture House, Department of Agriculture and Food, Dublin, Ireland

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 28 May 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 03 Jun 2010
Report date 16 Aug 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 16 Aug 2010
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 3 scale05
Mortality: 3 scale05
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: OsHV1 [mew-var]

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 14
Total animals affected
Species: Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_)

Epidemiological comments
------------------------
Mortalities have been considerable, particularly
in seed. Half grown and adult oysters have also
suffered mortalities in some areas though at
lower levels. Transmission from site to site as
well as through the water is believed to be
occurring but the presence of the virus in all of
these areas last year [2009] and the possibility
of latency makes it impossible to be sure whether
the source is introduction of stock from an
infected area or as a result of latent infections in existing populations.

Although mortalities now appear to be at an end,
reinfection of stocks which will be introduced
between now and next summer [2011] is anticipated
once the temperatures begin to climb again in June.

Between 3 June 2010 and 5 August 2010 OsHV1
(mew-Var) strain detected in all 14 bays using PCR and histopathology.

[While in England one location, in Kent, has been
reportedly affected, the emerging virus seems to
have widely spread in Ireland, reported from the
southern, western and northern coasts (see map at the above URL).

This agent is not (yet) included among OIE's
listed aquatic diseases; at present notified and
handled as an emerging disease.
