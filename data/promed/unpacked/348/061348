A concrete answer to the carp caper that gripped Lake Scugog and its
residents continues to evade those searching for the reason why
thousands of fish mysteriously died earlier this summer [2007].
Now, provincial officials say, a definitive answer for the Lake
Scugog deaths may never be revealed.
In an information session held Wednesday evening [22 Aug 2007] at the
Little Britain community centre, officials with the Ministry of
Natural Resources (MNR) provided few new leads to the mystery which
began to unravel in early-June [2007] when area residents began
noticing large numbers of the hefty fish washing ashore and floating
belly-up in the lake.
According to the MNR's Dr. Elizabeth Wright, samples of Lake Scugog
carp sent to the provincial fish lab at the University of Guelph, as
well as a federal laboratory at Nanaimo, BC, both came back with
inconclusive results. The outcomes of those tests, however, can at
least be partially blamed on the poor condition of the decayed fish
when the samples arrived at the labs, she adds.
"They didn't find any pathogens or high levels of anything, but the
fish were in very poor shape," says Dr. Wright, the ministry's
coordinator of fish health and aquaculture. "It doesn't mean that
they didn't have anything, just that they were in poor condition."
The only conclusion that officials could draw from the samples is
that the Lake Scugog carp showed no viruses but they did have high
levels of the bacteria _Flavobacterium columnare_ [_Flexibacter
columnaris_], which can lead to the columnaris disease, says Dr. Wright.
However, in other neighboring bodies of water in the Kawartha Lakes
system, such as Sturgeon and Pigeon, where large carp die-offs were
also reported, lab tests confirmed high levels of columnaris, she adds.
MNR officials hinted earlier this summer that columnaris, or the
bacteria that causes the disease, could be responsible for the
massive fish die-offs across the water systems, but held off on a
final judgment until all tests were complete.
So, with no concrete answers provided through the samples sent away
for examination, chances are slim the Lake Scugog riddle will be solved.
"There's not much else we can do, we've tested a number of fish (from
Lake Scugog) and we've found no viruses, just high levels of the
bacteria that causes columnaris," says Dr. Wright.
"We're probably never going to know," she says, quickly adding that
the carp "degrade very, very quickly," making it difficult for lab
officials to pinpoint an exact cause of death.
An infection that develops most readily in warm water and spreads
quickly, columnaris occurs when fish are stressed, perhaps due to low
oxygen levels or crowding. The disease is not known to be a risk to
human health.
Over the past couple of months, it is estimated that about 90 tonnes,
or about 200 000 pounds, of the dead carp were dropped off at
transfer stations across Durham Region, the City of Kawartha Lakes
and Peterborough County.
That equates to somewhere between 13 000 and 24 000 fish, depending
on their size, says Dan Taillon, a biologist with the Peterborough
district's MNR office.
Mr. Taillon adds, however, that he's sure the carp population is
still strongly represented in the area lakes. "It's hard to get an
idea of how many are out there... and what (the die-offs) mean to the
population, but we're confident there's still healthy carp in the
lakes, and lots of them," he says, stressing carp are a tolerant
species of fish.
And, he adds, there have been no reports of further die-offs in the
lakes since the end of July [2007].
"That's pretty encouraging, things seem to be improving
dramatically... we're definitely past the worst of this," Mr. Taillon says.

The cause of the massive carp die-off in the Kawartha Lakes is the
same bacteria identified in early July [2007] by scientists at a
Guelph lab, Ministry of Natural Resources officials revealed
Wednesday [22 Aug 2007] night.
The cause has been determined to be columnaris -- a disease caused by
the bacterium [_Flavobacterium] columnare_, which is present
worldwide in water and mud, they said.
Columnaris poses "no risk known to human health," they said.
Thousands of carp have died since late May [2007] in 11 local lakes,
the largest die-off conservation officers say they've seen.
Ministry biologists were stumped as to the cause of the die-off
despite preliminary results last month [July 2007] that suggested
columnare in samples taken from the 2nd lake affected, Sturgeon Lake.
At the time, they said the bacteria had likely contributed to the
deaths, but reserved final diagnosis until they could determine if
the fish also had a virus, a process that can take 6 weeks.
Meantime, residents and municipalities shoveled dead carp off a
growing number of lakes and worried about which lake would turn up
dead carcasses next.
At the 1st of a series of 3 public information meetings last night
[21 Aug 2007] in Little Britain, Elizabeth Wright, the ministry's
coordinator of fish health and aquaculture, presented the final diagnosis.
"These results came in (from both the federal lab in Nanaimo, BC and
the lab in Guelph) over the last day. No viruses were found. Very
high levels of the bacterium which causes columnaris was found in the
samples from Pigeon and Sturgeon lakes," she said.
Columnaris is an infection that develops most readily in warm water,
especially about 18 deg C (64.4 deg F) and spreads quickly. Epidemics
of the disease happen when fish are stressed, perhaps due to low
oxygen levels or crowding. Death occurs one or 2 days after the
infection sets in.
"The fish could not fight it (the bacteria) off and they got sick and
died." Wright said.
Humans don't get the disease because our body temperatures are
"inhospitable," she said.
The bacteria likes to grow in warm temperatures, ideally 20 to 25 deg
C (68-77 deg F), although the ministry says columnare can grow at
temperatures ranging from 4 to 33 deg C (39.2-91.4 deg F).
Hearing the official cause of the die-off was not enough for several
local residents who spent a large part of June and July [2007]
carrying dead fish from the lakes to landfills.
Some, such as Ken Trodds of Washburn Island, one of about 50 people
in attendance at last night's [21 Aug 2007] meeting at the Little
Britain Community Centre, said the die-off is a sign of the times.
Trodds hauled 45 dead carp from his shoreline. "Water levels are low
-- I have 4 inches (10 cm) of water at the end of my 24-foot dock
(7.3 m)," he said. "And the weed situation is beyond belief."
Ron Coutois of Washburn Island agreed. He hauled wheelbarrows full of
the dead fish, he said. Water levels are at their lowest -- that must
have something to do with the situation, he said. "The water levels
have to be controlled," he said. "If you don't we're not just talking
carp; you're talking them all."
But water levels in the Kawartha Lakes are a federal concern of the
Peterborough-based Trent-Severn Waterway under Parks Canada, ministry
biologist Dan Taillon told them.
No one was present from waterway management [Tuesday] night [22 Aug
2007] and MNR regional manager Les Selby admitted the system can seem
confusing. "It may seem confusing to the public because there are a
lot of agencies involved, but ministries have roles and
responsibilities," Selby said. "That's a fact of life. I wouldn't
apply for a driver's license at the passport office."
He said as a provincial ministry responsible for fish in area lakes,
the condition of those lakes has become a top concern. "We've had
conversations more recently with the Trent-Severn Waterway about
water levels and the value of water levels as it affects spawning and
fish kills," Selby said.
A working group made up of representative from about 20 fish interest
groups from the region has been struck and has already made a
presentation to the waterway, he said.
"We're dealing with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans who's in
charge of the habitat, water levels that are Parks Canada and the
Trent-Severn Waterway and shoreline management which is also
Trent-Severn Waterway," he said.
Still, for many, last night's [21 Aug 2007] meeting failed to erase
the lingering stench of the dead fish.
City of Kawartha Lakes solid waste manager Bill Pickard agreed
residents had a difficult situation but said disposal staff acted as
soon as they knew it was a problem by putting in weekend curbside
pickup of the carcasses as well as allowances for carp in regular pick-ups.
"There's no question in situations like this there could have been
much better communication," he said. "There's no question this has
been a learning curve."
By the time dead fish turned up in Balsam Lake, he had his own staff
on the lake to remove them, rather than wait for others, he said. He
said, however, the burden of the die-off hit hard, especially with
disposal staff who often wretched at the stench.
Water quality issues, the responsibility of the Ministry of the
Environment, shouldn't be a concern, said ministry issues project
coordinator Jamie Mugford.
Annual samples of Lake Scugog have not turned up anything unusual, he
said, and results of supplementary testing of five lakes -- Scugog
was not included -- will be available by the end of the month [August 2007].
"Field observation did not indicate any apparent water quality issues
that may be causing the die-off," Mugford said.
Tony Kenny, of Baileboro, called the government response to the carp
die-off "a shameful situation."
"All the ivory towers of all the ministries are sitting here shifting
responsibility," he said. "The cleanup should have been the
responsibility of the MNR. It's a pitiful shame all the way around
and the municipality is stuck with the bill."
Garry Otten, president of the Peterborough County Landowners'
Association, agreed. "I take great offence to the panel saying that's
not my job; it's their job," he said. "As taxpayers of this country
we allowed the government to create bureaucracies to protect our
water. The taxpayers have already paid for your bureaucracies.
"You organize yourselves and do it," he demanded. "That's what our
tax dollars are for."
City of Kawartha Lakes Mayor Ric McGee estimated the cleanup of dead
carp has cost the municipality CAD 40 000 (about USD 38 000), about
CAD 1000 (about USD 950) per tonne of carcasses.
Natural Resources Minister David Ramsay said this week there will be
no government money to help foot the bill. He did, however, say he
would talk to his federal counterparts, McGee said.
A 2nd and 3rd public meetings are still scheduled for Wednesday [23
Aug 2007] at 3 p.m. at the Coboconk Community Centre and at 7 p.m. at
the Bobcaygeon Service Centre.
No meetings were scheduled for Peterborough County residents because
none were requested and a media briefing was held there 31 Jul 2007,
ministry staff said.
Die-off update
--------------
- Tests from both a provincial lab and a federal lab conclude
columnaris, a bacterial infection, is responsible for the fish
die-off in the Kawartha Lakes.
- Columnaris is not known to affect humans.
- Fish died in 11 lakes, starting with Lake Scugog in early June [2007].
- The die-off appears to have stopped; no dead carp have been
reported to the Ministry of Natural Resources in the past 3 weeks.
- Ministry staff say there are still healthy carp in all area lakes.
- As many as 24 000 dead carp were buried in municipal landfills; 3
times that many may be buried on private land or have sunk to the lakebeds.
- The cleanup cost is about CAD 1000 (about USD 950) per tonne, and
the province isn't paying for it.
- No other species seem to be affected by the bacteria.
- This is the largest die-off ministry staff have seen.

_Flexibacter columnaris_ is a common bacterial infection in cultured
fish. It is often mistaken for a fungal infection because of its
mold-like lesions.
The bacteria are most likely to infect fish that have been stressed
by such conditions as poor water quality, inadequate diet, or
handling and shipping. Columnaris can enter the fish through the
gills, mouth, or via small wounds on the skin. The disease is highly
contagious and may be spread through contaminated nets, specimen
containers, and even food.
Columnaris can be external or internal and may follow a chronic or
acute course. Lesions in chronic cases progress slowly, taking many
days before culminating in fish death. In acute cases the lesions
spread quickly, often wiping out entire populations of fish within hours.
High water temperatures accelerate the progression of the disease;
however lowering the water temperature will not affect the outcome of
the disease once it is present. Hopefully some cooler weather will
help the situation. When the ambient temp drops, resulting in a drop
in water temperature, the situation may improve as susceptibility to
infection will decrease.
