The press service of the Ministry of Emergencies reported that a man
born in 1988 has been hospitalized due to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in the Kyzylorda region. The victim, a resident of
Kambash village in Aral region, was admitted to the infectious
diseases department of the district hospital on Fri 14 May 2011.
Medics confirmed the severe form of the disease. It should be stated
that recently a patient with the same diagnosis died in South
Kazakhstan region on 11 May 2011 [see also: Crimean-Congo hem. fever -
Kazakhstan: (SK)].

According to the Committee of State Sanitary and Epidemiological
Surveillance of the Ministry of Healthcare, the patient had been
bitten by a tick during [sheep] shearing. In fact, large scale
activities for prevention of the spread of dangerous [tick-borne]
diseases have been underway since the beginning of the year by a
special commission of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of
Kazakhstan working in that region.

CCHF is an acute infectious disease of humans transmitted by the bite
of ticks, characterized by fever, severe intoxication and bleeding of
the skin and internal organs. The causative agent was detected in 1945
[in the Crimea], and a similar disease was found in the Congo in
1956.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic
fever caused by a virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_ of the
family _Bunuaviridae_. CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high
mortality rate. Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently,
although animal infection may be more common.

The geographical distribution of the virus, like that of its tick
vector, is widespread. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases
and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans do occur. The disease is
endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia.

Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the virus from direct
contact with blood or other infected tissues from livestock during
this time, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The majority
of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock industry,
such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and
veterinarians. CCHF virus infection is an occupational hazard for
agricultural workers in this region of central Asia. Further
information on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can be obtained from
the WHO Fact sheet at:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html.

It is unclear from the information provided whether this is a new
case or in fact refers to one of the 2 CCHF-infected sheep-shearers
described previously in "Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Kazakhstan: (SK),"
reported from a Russian source.
