[Re: ProMED-mail MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (18): Italy, contact screening, RFI 20130603.1753321]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
With regard to rumours appeared on the press -- and published on ProMED -- about positivity for MERS-CoV among close contacts of confirmed cases detected in Florence, we would like to specify that the reference lab of Istituto Superiore di Sanita has not confirmed any of the samples from asymptomatic contacts of the cases.

Moreover, the virus has not been characterized yet. Thus, significant mutations in the viral genome that might explain changes in virulence on transmissibility cannot be confirmed as yet.

Clinical surveillance of close contacts is ongoing.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs Rezza and Donatelli for their rapid response to ProMED-mail posting MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (18): Italy, contact screening, RFI 20130603.1753321, requesting more information on the newswire reports mentioning positive tests for MERS-CoV among asymptomatic contacts of the 3 confirmed cases.

Our post did request further information, as the results were clearly indicating new findings that prior to these newswires had not been seen during the evolution of this emerging novel pathogen. We apologize for any misconceptions created by the prior post.

ProMED-mail awaits further results from continued investigations ongoing in Italy -- preferably from official sources in Italy. - Mod.MPP
