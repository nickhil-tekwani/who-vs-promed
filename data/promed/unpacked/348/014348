At a time when BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] wings are agitating against killing of cows in the country, the Karnataka Government has ordered culling of 49 cows at a farm belonging to a legislature member in Kolar due to dreaded "Brucellosis" disease found in these animals.

Following report from veterinarians about these cows infected [by] the disease, which is also known as "contagious abortion" and "bangs disease", and a complaint by the villagers about possibility of their cows also getting infected, Minister for Animal Husbandry A Manjuhas gave permission to kill these affected animals yesterday [4 Sep 2016].

The farm has about 1000 cows and owner MLA Vartur Prakash sent blood samples which were found positive and a team of veterinarians also visited the farm recently and confirmed about the infection. Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) has also stopped purchasing milk from the farm due to the disease and has decided to resume only after getting clearance from its veterinarians.

The Brucellosis is a bacterial disease chiefly affecting cattle and causing undulant fever in humans.

[Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_ (which affects mainly goats and sheep), and occasionally by _B. suis_ (porcine brucellosis). Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from _B. abortus_.

Clinically, the disease is characterised in cattle by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis (testicular inflammation), epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis, a tube at the back of the testicle) and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ bacteria from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. Presumptive diagnosis can be made by assessing specific cell-mediated or serological responses to _Brucella_ antigens.

Though both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are known to be endemic in India (Ref), only _B. abortus_ is mentioned in India's annual reports to the OIE. The bacteria _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_, both highly pathogenic for humans, are included, in India's OIE report for 2015, in the list of diseases "for which no information has been provided".

According to India's most recent available (2014) annual statistical-epidemiological report to the OIE, a total of 113 cases of bovine brucellosis in cattle and 1 in a buffalo, in 7 new outbreaks, were recorded during that year. The final annual report for 2015 is not yet available. The actual data on the ground are, most likely, significantly higher, as apparent from a recent presentation by Prof Narinder Singh Sharma at the regional FAO/OIE/APHCA (Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia and the Pacific) workshop on Brucellosis Diagnosis and Control in Asia-Pacific Region, held in Chiang Mai, Thailand, 18-21 March 2014, where he presented the following data:

- Slide 8: addresses _B. melitensis_ serological study in animals in Tamil Nadu State, revealing incidence of 13.85, 9.96 and 20.35 percent positive animals (3 serological tests applied).

- Slide 15: presents the results of a serosurvey in humans, demonstrating incidence of 11 percent among (118) veterinarians, 25.3 percent among (87) veterinary paraclinical staff and 16.1 percent among (62) dairy farmers.
