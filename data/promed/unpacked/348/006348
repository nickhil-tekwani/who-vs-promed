[1] Continuing outbreak

The Foster Farms salmonella outbreak has continued to grow, with the number of infected people now surpassing 600. California health officials said that 27 new infections have been reported since 22 May 2014, with 468 patients confirmed so far. That puts the total tally nationwide at more than 600.

Infectious disease specialists at the CDC told The Oregonian that cases are continuing to trickle in. The CDC updates its case count periodically.

California health officials declined to provide specifics about whether those sickened had recently purchased Foster Farms chicken, but Dr Robert Tauxe, deputy director of the food-borne illness division at the CDC, said earlier this year [2014] that new cases were linked to fresh and not frozen chicken.

The outbreak has dragged on since March 2013, making it one of the longest in USA history, sickening people in 27 states, including Oregon and Washington, as well as Puerto Rico. It involves antibiotic-resistant strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg. Last month [May 2014] the Center for Science in the Public Interest sued the US Department of Agriculture over a petition to ban [sic] that strain and 3 others because of the threat to public health posed by superbugs. The USDA allows the sale of salmonella contaminated chicken, though it announced a plan last year [2013] to set a ceiling on the amount allowed on chicken parts, which is currently about 25 percent.

[2] Legislation
Date: Wed 25 Jun 2014

http://www.oregonlive.com/health/index.ssf/2014/06/house_bill_would_ban_antibioti.html


Congress moved Wed 25 Jun 2014, to ban the sort of antibiotic-resistant strains of _Salmonella_ that have sickened more than 600 in the Foster Farms outbreak. Rep Rosa DeLauro, [Democrat- Connecticut], and Rep Louise M. Slaughter, [Democrat-New York] introduced a bill that would require the USA Department of Agriculture to recall meat, poultry, or egg products contaminated with bacteria resistant to 2 or more critically important antibiotics or with pathogens that cause serious illness or death.

The bill, the Pathogens Reduction and Testing Reform Act, follows frustration among food safety advocates over the lack of recalls in the Foster Farms outbreak. The outbreak started in March 2013 and is ongoing, sickening at least 601 people in 27 states, including Oregon, and Puerto Rico. The USDA has repeatedly said it lacks the authority to ban salmonella on raw poultry and cannot force a recall unless it can link at least one product manufactured on specified dates with at least one confirmed illness.

In the Foster Farms outbreak, local and state officials have confirmed 7 strains of antibiotic-resistant _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg. Health authorities have recovered Foster Farms chicken from sick people's homes as well. But the USDA has declined to call for a recall. The act, if adopted, would change that.

"The USDA has failed to recall meat contaminated with antibiotic-resistant pathogens because they do not believe they have the legal authority to do so," DeLauro and Slaughter said in a statement. "This bill would ensure there is no confusion."

The USDA said 3 Foster Farms plants in California caused the outbreak, shutting one down in January [2014] for 3 weeks over cockroaches. A spokesman for the USDA's inspection arm reacted to the bill by saying the agency welcomes the "congresswomen's ongoing efforts on our shared goal of ensuring food safety standards continue to be stringent, effective, and constantly improving." He said the USDA "will continue to work aggressively in preventing foodborne illness, including implementing the 1st-ever performance standards for salmonella in chicken parts and ground poultry later in 2014."

The USDA has set a 7.5 percent limit on salmonella on whole chickens but there is no ceiling on parts, which account for the majority of sales. It is currently working on a limit based on baseline studies in slaughterhouses which show a 25 percent contamination rate. For campylobacter, another pathogen associated with poultry, the USDA allows 10.4 percent on whole carcasses but again does not have a limit on parts.

The bill names both salmonella and campylobacter as pathogens and says the ban would apply to bacteria that are resistant to 2 or more antibiotics considered to be critically important for human medicine by the World Health Organization. The WHO has sounded the alarm on the threat posed to human health by superbugs.

The Center for Science in the Public Interest, which welcomed the bill, sued the USDA last month [May 2014] over a petition calling for a ban of 4 antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonellae, including _S._ Heidelberg, the contaminant in the Foster Farms outbreak. The USDA has banned 7 strains of _E. coli_, including O157:H7, in ground beef to protect public health.

If adopted, the bill would amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act and the Egg Products Inspection Act.

[From the 2nd part of this posting:

"The USDA has set a 7.5 percent limit on salmonella on whole chickens but there is no ceiling on parts, which account for the majority of sales.

To this moderator, this continued scenario further underscores the need for consumers to understand that zero tolerance for certain enteric pathogens will likely never occur. Buyer beware, cooker beware, eater beware. Appropriate cooking and kitchen hygiene are the routes to safety. Note that the new legislation revolves around resistant bacteria. It is just as easy to die from a totally sensitive strain as from a resistant one. - Mod.LL
