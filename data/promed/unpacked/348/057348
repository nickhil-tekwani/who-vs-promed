Cholera case reported in Kazakhstan - spokesman
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st case of cholera in 8 years in Kazakhstan has been reported, a
spokesman for the Kazakh Emergency Ministry in Astana, the country's
capital, said on Thu 21 Jul 2005.
The spokesman said a patient diagnosed with cholera was placed in an
infectious diseases hospital in the southern Kazakh city of Kzyl-Orda. The
authorities have identified and examined 9 individuals whom the patient had
contact with. They quarantined the source area and highly trafficked areas,
and have banned people from swimming in any natural bathing areas. The last
cholera case was registered in southern Kazakhstan in 1997.

A local resident has been hospitalized with a diagnosis of cholera in the
infectious hospital of the Kyzyl-Orda region, according to the regional
department of the State Epidemiological Surveillance Center.
The 51 year old resident of the regional center [Kyzyl-Orda], a driver, was
admitted to the hospital on 19 Jul 2005. According to his physicians, the
man had become ill 10 days earlier, and only after deterioration of health
had he presented for medical aid. The preliminary diagnosis was
laboratory-confirmed.
As informed by Ersultan Kuandykov, director of the regional department of
the State Epidemiological Surveillance Center, a meeting of the city
anti-epidemic commission has taken place in Kyzyl-Orda. A plan for
preventing disease spread was developed at the session. Now quarantine
actions are being applied in the suburban settlement of Gagarin, where the
sick person lives. Examination of all contacts is being carried out.
According to Kuandykov, the last case of cholera was recorded in the region
in 1997 in the settlement of Karauzjak. That outbreak was contained.

Gastro not yet gone, cholera is already on
------------------------------------------
2 patients with clinical symptoms of cholera were admitted to Christian
Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). 35 new cases of gastroenteritis were
also reported. All of these patients are from Gill Road and Khud Mohalla.
Meanwhile, gastroenteritis continues to rock the city, as 64 new cases were
reported on 17 Jul 2005. 8 patients have been admitted to Arora Hospital
and 16 new patients have been admitted to Rama Charitable Hospital.
At Rama Charitable Hospital, [a total] 36 patients have been admitted with
gastroenteritis. Dr Sanjay Gupta said, "For a week, we have been receiving
16 to 17 patients in the OPD [outpatient dispensary] daily. Many of these
were brought in in serious condition with severe dehydration." The hospital
is crowded with gastroenteritis patients to such an extent that one patient
was referred to CMC last night because of lack of space.
Meanwhile, at Civil Hospital, 6 new patients were admitted, of whom 4 are
from Sherpur. The total number of patients has risen to 49 of which 19 are
from Sherpur. Also 5 patients with gastroenteritis were admitted to

The outbreak of cholera in Guinea-Bissau has killed 37 people and sent 2238
people to hospital since 11 Jun 2005, the Health Ministry of Guinea-Bissau
said on Thu 14 Jul 2005, in a statement. The epidemic spread very rapidly
to almost all the country, except for several islands in the east part,
since the 1st case was found on 11 Jun 2005, the health ministry said.
Bissau, the capital of the tiny west African country, was the most serious
affected area in the country, where 1993 people were found affected and 20
people were killed by the disease, the health ministry said. It was
reported that the hospitals in Bissau could only receive about 80 patients
every day.
And the coming rainy season might worsen the situation as the polluted
water will cause a further spread of cholera.

Cases of shigellosis linked to lake at state park in Carbon County
------------------------------------------------------------------
Dirty diapers may be the source of an outbreak of bacterial illness in at
least 5 people who swam at Beltzville State Park in Carbon County, PA
during the 4th of July weekend, officials said on Fri 15 Jul 2005.
9 other cases of shigellosis, which causes fever, diarrhea, and stomach
cramps, are suspected but have not been confirmed by laboratory tests,
according to the state Health Department. Recent tests have shown low
levels of bacteria in Beltzville Lake's water, so it's open for swimming.
Dirty diapers discarded near the water's edge or on babies playing in the
lake also were suspected in a 1995 outbreak that sickened about 70 people,
said Andre Weltman, a Health Department public health doctor. "In 1995, we
observed diapers left at the edge of the lake," Weltman said. "Over the
July Fourth weekend, we can't be sure, but it's a good guess there may have
been diapers changed near the lake. We know they were left sitting there,
and may have been washed down into the lake."
Weltman said officials do not believe the bacteria was in food or came from
the park's sewer system. There were almost 1000 cases of the illness in the
state in 2004.
