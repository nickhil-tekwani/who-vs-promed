Foot and mouth disease in Paraguay (virus types O and A)
--------------------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Paraguay reported

Morinigo Vera, deputy minister of animal production, Ministry of
Agriculture and Animal Production, Asuncion:

[According to the OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines, "Antibody to the polyproteins 3AB or 3ABC are the single most
reliable indicator of infection. In animals seropositive for antibody to
3AB or 3ABC, antibody to one or more of the other non-structural (NS)
proteins including the L, 2C, 3A, or 3D protein is further confirmation of
infection. The test can be used on a herd basis to detect FMD virus
infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. Care must be taken
when interpreting results from single animals, as some repeatedly
vaccinated animals produce antibody to 3ABC. It has not yet been
established whether or not all animals that have been both vaccinated and
infected seroconvert to this protein". See:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00022.htm>.
The reported identification of a simultaneous field infection with 2
serotypes is somewhat unusual, though it has previously been recorded in
other countries. It would be useful to obtain the confirmation of the
reference FMD laboratory in Rio.
The estimated date of first infection, 8 days prior to the detection of
this outbreak, seems somewhat optimistic. It usually takes longer before an
infection is discovered, certainly in a remote, isolated location, such as
the one described in this case.
This notification mentions, as a control measure, "modified stamping-out
policy", which means that not all infected and contact animals have been
killed. Previous press items mentioned the "immediate slaughter of 95
animals". It will be useful to determine what has been done concerning the
220 small ruminants in the affected premises. - Mod.AS]
