WHO concerned as one Ebola case confirmed in urban area of Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One new case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been confirmed in Wangata, one of the 3 health zones of Mbandaka, a city of nearly 1.2 million people in Equateur Province in northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC].

The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo announced the finding, after laboratory tests conducted by the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) confirmed 1 specimen as positive for EVD.

Until now, all the confirmed Ebola cases were reported from Bikoro health zone, which is also in Equateur Province but at a distance of nearly 150 km [approx 93 mi] from Mbandaka. The health facilities in Bikoro have very limited functionality and the affected areas are difficult to reach, particularly during the current rainy season, as the roads are often impassable.

"This is a concerning development, but we now have better tools than ever before to combat Ebola," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "WHO and our partners are taking decisive action to stop further spread of the virus."

WHO is deploying around 30 experts to conduct surveillance in the city and is working with the Ministry of Health and partners to engage with communities on prevention and treatment and the reporting of new cases.

"The arrival of Ebola in an urban area is very concerning and WHO and partners are working together to rapidly scale up the search for all contacts of the confirmed case in the Mbandaka area," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.

WHO is also working with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and other partners to strengthen the capacity of health facilities to treat Ebola patients in special isolation wards.

As of [15 May 2018], a total of 44 Ebola virus disease cases have been reported: 3 confirmed, 20 probable, and 21 suspected.

WHO partners in the DRC Ebola response include:
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the Congolese Red Cross (Congo ICRC), the Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC ICRC), Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF), the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa-CDC), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the World Food Programme (WFP), UNICEF, UNOCHA, MONUSCO, International Organization for Migration (IOM), the FAO Emergency Management Centre - Animal Health (EMC-AH), the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP), Gavi - the Vaccine Alliance, the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), the UK Public Health Rapid Support team, the EPIET Alumni Network (EAN), and the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Emerging Diseases Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN). Additional coordination and technical support is forthcoming through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) and Emergency Medical Teams (EMT).

[Ben Shepherd, an expert on the DRC at London's Chatham House, said the country had managed earlier outbreaks of the disease "pretty well. The lack of infrastructure can act as a natural firebreak slowing the spread of the disease. But the cities have very little planning, water, sanitation or electrification. If Ebola was to reach Kinshasa, it would be beyond apocalyptic," he said.

The port city of Mbandaka lies on the eastern bank of the Congo River, Africa's 2nd longest after the Nile. Tens of millions of people live along the river, and the capitals of Congo, the Central African Republic and Congo Republic lie along it and its tributaries. This creates a much more precarious situation for spread of EV than Bikoro, the epicenter of the outbreak. - Mod.LK]

[2] WHO: Emergency Committee
Date: Thu 17 May 2018
Source: STAT [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/17/ebola-who-emergency-committee/


The World Health Organization has convened a special committee of experts to help guide its response to the expanding Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During its 1st meeting on [Fri 18 May 2018], the group will be asked if the outbreak should be declared an international health emergency.

The announcement that an emergency committee has been convened to assess the latest Ebola outbreak comes a day after the national laboratory in the DRC confirmed a case had been discovered in Mbandaka, a city of 1.2 million people. The case had previously tested positive with a rapid test, but that finding has been confirmed with a 2nd test.

The decision to convene an emergency committee rests with the agency's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who traveled to the DRC last weekend to assess the situation and the response.

The emergency committee will be asked if this outbreak should be deemed a public health emergency of international concern -- a PHEIC (pronounced "fake") in health law.

Dr. Ashish Jha thinks the committee may not declare a PHEIC just yet. But if it holds off, it will undoubtedly say it needs to continue to meet to reassess the situation and could declare an emergency later if the outbreak escalates.

"It's still localized to a single country and a single region within that country," said Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. "Obviously, if there is evidence that the disease is spreading further -- down the Congo river to other cities along the river, for instance, I could imagine them coming back and declaring a PHEIC."

Regardless of whether the declaration comes [Fri 18 May 2018], establishing an emergency committee at this point sends a loud message about how concerning this outbreak is, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

"This is not going to bring any new resources on the front lines today that they didn't have yesterday. They've basically already sent in the A Team to begin trying to stop this," Osterholm said. "But I think what it does is it lets the rest of the world know how important this is and why the support for this A Team effort is so critical. And whether it be other country donors, other organizations stepping up if additional resources are needed, this is really important."

[Formally, a PHEIC is defined as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response."

In reality, it's a political tool that the WHO uses to sound the alarm about a serious disease that has caught the world off guard and put people's health in danger. It's meant to draw countries' immediate attention -- to galvanize resources and stop the disease from spreading further across borders.

When there's a looming disease crisis on the horizon, the World Health Organization convenes a panel of experts under the International Health Regulations (which are a set of laws that govern global responses to pandemics involving 196 member countries).

These experts -- dubbed an "emergency committee" -- meet and assess the risk posed by a disease outbreak and then advise the WHO director general [currently Tedros Adhanom] about whether to declare a PHEIC, that then decides whether to take action. So far [under Margaret Chan's directory (from 2006 to July 2017)] she always followed the committee's advice.

The WHO has only declared a public health emergency 3 times since the International Health Regulations were enacted in 2007.

The 1st time was in 2009, with the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2nd time was in May 2014, when polio seemed to surge again, threatening the eradication effort. The 3rd time, in August 2014, came as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was growing out of control. Notably, the emergency committee decided not to declare the MERS virus a PHEIC. The Zika declaration was the 4th PHEIC in history, and the 1st time the WHO issued such a warning over a mosquito-borne disease.

These decisions are not taken lightly. First, the PHEIC is a political tool used to focus the world's attention on a health crisis. Using this declaration too often would weaken its significance.

Second, one of the key considerations in declaring a PHEIC is whether the disease threat is dire enough for countries to be forced into enacting travel and trade restrictions. These can be devastating to local economies.

Even if the WHO only warns people to limit or delay travel to affected regions (instead of outright travel restrictions), health emergency declarations are often associated with economic losses.

Because of the Ebola crisis, the World Bank Group estimated that the West African countries at the center of the outbreak -- Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone -- lost out on about USD1.6 billion in economic growth in 2015. Similarly, the South American countries hit by swine flu suffered economic losses ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 percent of their GDPs.

DRC: 9th Ebola outbreak in 40 years
-------------------------------------
At present, 514 people who may have been in contact with infected people have been notified by the national health authorities, and they're currently under monitoring. To tackle the epidemic and limit as much as possible the risk of it spreading, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is stepping up its response in the affected areas (Mbandaka and Bikoro).

MSF Emergency teams are already on site and have set up an isolation zone in Mbandaka's main hospital (5 beds) and one in Bikoro hospital (10 beds). Teams are also setting up 2 Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) in Mbandaka and Bikoro, with 20 beds each. In the next few days, several tons of supplies (medical kits; protection and disinfection kits containing isolation items, such as protective clothing, gloves and boots; logistic and hygiene kits containing items such as plastic sheets, chlorine spray kits, water treatments kits, etc; palliative drugs will arrive in Mbandaka. Among the MSF staff on the ground are some of the organisation's most experienced Ebola field workers, including medical personnel, experts in infection control and logisticians.

"This is the 9th Ebola outbreak in Congo in the last 40 years. So far, all of them have occurred in remote and isolated areas, as was the case last year [2017] in Likati, when the epidemic didn't spread." explains Henry Gray, MSF Emergency Coordinator in Mbandaka. "With the new case confirmed in Mbandaka, the scenario has changed, and it has become most serious and worrying, since the disease is now affecting an urban area. It is paramount to trace the suspect case in order to have a clearer view on how it reached the city. We are working closely with the Ministry of Health and the other organisations in the field to implement a coordinated, tailored and rapid response to stop the spread of Ebola."

Moreover, MSF and its research arm Epicentre are working closely with the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) on the implementation of the Ebola vaccine rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP as an additional measure to control the outbreak. Whilst the strategy is being put in place, the "pillars" of an Ebola intervention, that consist of early treatment and isolation of people who are sick, tracing and following up contacts, informing people about the disease, how to prevent it and where to seek care, supporting existing healthcare, and temporarily changing cultural behaviour around funerals must continue in order to stem the spread of the disease.

[4] Vaccine
Date: Thu 17 May 2018

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/world/africa/ebola-congo.html


The rVSV ZEBOV vaccine will be kept in the capital until shortly before use because of the lack of facilities in the provinces for storing it at the required temperature, between minus 60 and minus 80 deg C [approx. minus 76 to minus 112 deg F].

Such difficulties underscore the severe logistical challenges to fighting the disease in remote and rugged terrain with few roads, little electricity or basic services, and no facilities for health workers to live and work in.

International agencies are sending in protective equipment for health workers, body bags to enable safe burials, chlorine-spraying equipment, water treatment kits and medicines.

But the infection area has no airports that can handle large planes. Mbandaka is accessible only by small aircraft and Bikoro only by helicopter. Villages beyond Bikoro where the outbreak is believed to have started have so far been reached only by motorbike.

In one hopeful sign, Dr. Salama said, the 2 suspected cases in Mbandaka involve brothers believed to have contracted the virus at a funeral ceremony in Bikoro.

So health officials say the infection was probably part of the same transmission chain as the earlier cases in the outbreak, and not evidence of a different chain that had been developing undetected. That would pose a far more complex challenge in controlling the outbreak.

[It feels like the world is holding its breath in anticipation of deployment of the vaccine. It is not going to be easy as a result of logistical challenges, population density in Mbandaka, need for cold chain, and poor facilities. But the vaccine has been demonstrated to be highly effective in trials to date, so the world is hopeful. - Mod.LK]

[5] Community alarm system

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/urgent-need-activate-community-alarm-system-halt-further-spread


Communities across Equateur Province need to be alerted to the rising Ebola risk if the spread of the killer disease is to be halted.

This warning from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) comes following news of reports of a confirmed Ebola case in the provincial capital, Mbandaka, in north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

"Local volunteers and health workers are the community's alarm system," said Ben Adinoyi, IFRC Regional Head of Health and Care, who is currently based in Kinshasa. "They are our eyes and ears on the ground. They are critical to the early identification and containment of new cases. They need to be activated across the province and even beyond. If we don't, then the virus may spread too far and too quickly."

At least 23 people have died of suspected haemorrhagic fever in an outbreak that was first confirmed on [8 May 2018] in Bikoro health zone, a remote part of the country. A total of 3 of those cases are confirmed to be Ebola. Fears of a flare up are mounting as cases have spread across 3 different health zones."

A Red Cross team of experts is on the ground in Equateur Province providing training and support to local volunteers. They have brought essential supplies like stretchers, chlorine disinfectant, safe burial kits, informational posters and other supplies to support local communities and health centres.

Critically, more than 110 Red Cross volunteers in Bikoro and Mbandaka are alerting communities as well as disinfecting houses where cases have been suspected. The volunteers are also ready to provide safe and dignified burials if needed. The effective management of dead bodies is a crucial component of an effective Ebola response. ...-more

[Since it appears this outbreak may have begun with a funeral burial, it is critical to involve the community in control efforts to be sure they understand how Ebola virus is transmitted from person to person, and how burial practices create a great risk of infection. - Mod.LK]

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/world-bank-provide-us3-million-support-ebola-response-efforts


The World Bank announced today that it is making USD 3 million immediately available to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)'s Ebola Virus Disease Response Plan (EVDRP) to fight the current Ebola outbreak in the country. The funds will be used to finance health care services in the health facilities serving the affected population, to provide medicines required for the case management of Ebola patients and suspected cases of Ebola, and to finance support and logistics.

"We commend the DRC Government's rapid mobilization to address the current Ebola outbreak," said Jean-Christophe Carret, Country Director for the Democratic Republic of Congo at the World Bank Group. "We will continue our strong and ongoing engagement with the Government to ensure a robust response."

The financing announced today could increase to up to USD 15 million if needed as part of the disease surveillance and response funding available under the current Health Systems Strengthening project in DRC.

"We are committed to working with the DRC Government and with all partners coordinated by the World Health Organization to mount an effective response," said Tim Evans, Senior Director, Health Nutrition and Population at the World Bank Group. "If additional financing is needed, the World Bank Group stands ready to increase its support." ...-more
