Study sheds light on death spike in Hong Kong COVID-19 surge
------------------------------------------------------------
The recent omicron variant surge in Hong Kong came with a mortality rate among the world's highest yet in the pandemic, a troubling development in a region known for its strong pandemic measures, and today [8 Apr 2022] researchers from the United States, Hong Kong, and China who dug into the data suggest that vaccination lapses in older people played a major role.

The team published its findings today [8 Apr 2022] in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). [Smith DJ, Hakim AJ, Leung GM, et al. COVID-19 mortality and vaccine coverage -- Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, 6 Jan-21 Mar 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 8 April 2022. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7115e1]

In other developments, China's surge continued, prompting more locations to tighten their measures, and in the United States, COVID-19 levels are rising again in the east.

Vaccine gap in oldest Hong Kongers
----------------------------------
Hong Kong's surge began in early January [2022] with a cluster of omicron infections in a quarantine hotel. Its 5th wave peaked on [4 Mar 2022], along with a mortality rate of 37.7 per million population that was among the highest in the world during the pandemic.

Officials reported 5906 deaths as of [21 Mar 2022] during the omicron surge. Of eligible people in Hong Kong, 64% had received at least 2 vaccine doses and 5% had gotten a booster dose, but coverage varied by age. Only 49% of people ages 60 and older had gotten at least 2 doses, with coverage declining as people got older.

Among the deaths, 96% occurred in people ages 60 and older, and of those 70% were unvaccinated. "The high overall mortality rate during the ongoing 2022 Hong Kong omicron COVID-19 outbreak is being driven by deaths among unvaccinated persons aged â‰¥ 60 years," the team wrote.

In weighing other factors, the team compared Hong Kong's surge with New Zealand, which has a lower population density but, like Hong Kong, was thought to largely have vaccine-induced immunity due to vaccination combined with low infection levels during earlier waves.

The investigators found that, during the omicron peak, New Zealand's mortality reached 2.1 per million population, compared with Hong Kong's nearly 38 deaths per million population, which they said underscores the vaccine's impact on preventing COVID-19 deaths.

The reasons for Hong Kong's low vaccination rate in older groups aren't clear, but it might be due to vaccine hesitancy or complacency over the government's earlier success with its "zero COVID" policies, researchers noted.

China's surge continues as cities tighten measures
--------------------------------------------------
China today [8 Apr 2022] reported 24 101 cases, of which 22 561 were asymptomatic. Of the asymptomatic cases, 90% were from Shanghai.

Regarding symptomatic cases, Shanghai's daily numbers topped Jilin province's total. Reuters today [8 Apr 2022], citing Chinese health officials, reported that Shanghai's high number of asymptomatic cases might be partly due to a blurred line between asymptomatic and mild cases. One Chinese official told the news service that disease patterns across Chinese hot spots would be comparable if mild cases were included in the asymptomatic numbers. [https://www.reuters.com/world/china/shanghai-widens-covid-testing-other-chinese-cities-impose-curbs-2022-04-08/]

Meanwhile, more cities in China tightened their measures, including Beijing, which beefed up screening in certain employment sectors, according to Reuters. Shizong County in Yunnan province shuttered shops and suspended travel out of the area. So far, about 2 dozen Chinese cities are in partial or full lockdown.

COVID-19 test-to-stay strategies for school students
----------------------------------------------------
A study today [8 Apr 2022] in Pediatrics suggests a test-to-stay (TTS) strategy, as opposed to quarantine, was a safe and effective tool for Massachusetts public schools for the 2021-22 school year, as it was associated with both limited COVID-19 transmission and increased in-person learning days for students.

The TTS program required all students exposed to a COVID-19 case in the classroom to use a rapid antigen test for 7 days following the last exposure date. If the test was negative, students could remain in school. The program was opt-in, and for students who chose not to participate, an exposure resulted in at-home quarantine for at least 7 days following any in-school close contact if the student was not fully vaccinated.

A total of 2298 schools signed up for TTS, and during the first 13 weeks of the program (Sep to Dec 2021) 1959 schools used TTS for 102 373 individual, exposed students. Out of 328 271 tests performed, 2943 positive cases were identified, for a per-person positivity rate of 2.9%, similar to during mandatory quarantine the year before [2020].

The authors said the TTS program resulted in a minimum of 325 328 and a maximum of 497 150 days of in-person school for participants that could have been lost to quarantine.

While the study results were encouraging, a commentary in the same journal argued that TTS may not work for under-resourced schools and students. "If TTS participants must seek testing in the community, barriers including out-of-pocket costs, transportation logistics, and access to health care provider-based testing need to be addressed," the commentators wrote. "Unvaccinated students in school districts without the capacity to implement TTS, and students in TTS districts who have barriers to opt in to these programs, may not have equal access to in-person learning. Increasing access to and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will allow more students to stay in the classroom."

" ...TTS allows school-based close contacts, who would otherwise home quarantine, to continue in-person learning if they remain asymptomatic and test at least twice in the 7 days postexposure. The objectives of TTS are to:
1. reduce the number of days a student is prevented from accessing in-person learning and school-based services;
2. reduce the burden caused by quarantine policies on students and families; and
3. maintain the safety of the school environment. ...

"States and school districts have a responsibility to thoughtfully consider inequities when planning TTS strategies and proactively develop plans that ensure availability of TTS to all students across schools. Schools and districts can work with families to define challenges to participation in TTS and together design a strategy allowing for equitable access, while maintaining program fidelity. Regularly monitoring program participation can quickly identify differences in access. School administrators can work to ensure all students who qualify for TTS can access testing, including providing clear and accurate information about testing resources in the community. Finally, public health and education agencies can assist by ensuring schools have adequate contact tracing and testing services and by continuing to promote and provide opportunities for vaccination. Thoughtful consideration and planning of TTS can capitalize on the federal resources available (School Testing for COVID-19 | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and minimize the barriers experienced by schools and families in under-resourced communities. ..." - Mod.LK]

Omicron COVID-19 infections appear milder, shorter than delta cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------
An observational study yesterday [7 Apr 2022] in The Lancet suggests that COVID-19 infections with the omicron subvariant have less involvement of the lower respiratory tract, lower odds of hospitalization, and shorter duration of illness and infectiousness than delta cases.

Led by King's College London researchers, the prospective study recruited 63 002 United Kingdom residents aged 16 years and older reporting their COVID-19 test results and symptoms on a smartphone app from 1 Jun 2021 to 7 Jan 2022. Participants had tested positive for COVID-19, were symptomatic, and had received at least 2 doses of any COVID-19 vaccine.

The primary study outcome was the likelihood of having any of 32 symptoms monitored in the app or being hospitalized within 7 days before or after testing positive during the period of delta (1 Jun to 27 Nov 2021) versus omicron (20 Dec 2021 to 17 Jan 2022) dominance.

In the 1st period, delta was responsible for more than 70% of all cases in the UK and for COVID-19 infections among 4990 participants matched for age, sex, and vaccine dose with 4990 infected during the period in which omicron was responsible for more than 70% of infections.

Participants reported less loss of smell during the omicron period than during delta (16.7% vs 52.7%; odds ratio [OR] 0.17), but sore throat was commoner during omicron than delta (70.5% vs 60.8%; OR 1.55). Hospitalization was less common during omicron than delta (1.9% vs 2.6%; OR 0.75).

"The prevalence of symptoms that characterise an omicron infection differs from those of the delta SARS-CoV-2 variant," the study authors wrote. "Our data indicate a shorter period of illness and potentially of infectiousness, which should impact work-health policies and public health advice." In a related commentary, Linda Houhamdi and Pierre-Edouard Fournier, both of Aix-Marseille Universite in France, noted that people younger than 16 years and those who were obese were excluded from the study. "Indeed, omicron cases have been reported in patients younger than 16 years, and obesity is an indisputable comorbidity factor in the severity of COVID-19."

"This study has multiple strengths. First, it is a prospective survey with a 1:1 matching design, and uses an emerging concept, that is, real-time recording of multiple clinical symptoms based on self-reported information from the participants themselves. Second, the cohort of fully or booster-vaccinated individuals subsequently infected with either omicron or delta variants was large. And last, but not least, it was the first study to detail every symptom and duration of acute illness in every infected vaccine recipient.

"Mobile apps to monitor diseases are highly valuable and can easily be implemented worldwide and in various languages. ..." - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 20 countries -- South Korea (185 495), Germany (169 454), France (148 768), Japan (107 148), Italy (67 641), Vietnam (65 097), Australia (63 140), Portugal (63 070), Spain (48 834), USA (46 460), UK (41 284), Belgium (34 209), Brazil (29 575), Thailand (25 298), Greece (14 763), Russia (14 311), Malaysia (14 944), Austria (14 085), New Zealand (11 702), and Netherlands (10 873) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3835 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 6 Apr 2022 to late 7 Apr 2022).

A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 23.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 17.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 5.2% decrease in daily reported cases and a 27.5% decrease in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.28 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 497.83 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.19 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
