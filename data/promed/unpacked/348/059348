["Equine infectious anaemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology, and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result.

"Antibody response usually persists and antibody-positive animals, older than 6-8 months, are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf

Between December 2014 and December 2015, 7 outbreaks of EIA were reported in Germany. These outbreaks were located in the provinces of Sachsen (3) and Bayern (4). A total of 13 cases were diagnosed from a susceptible population of 160 animals (equidae). All affected animals (cases) were destroyed. The event was resolved on November 2015. See the final report made on 17 Dec 2015 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019368_20151218_125041.pdf.

EIA virus is not considered a risk for human health. - Mod.CRD
