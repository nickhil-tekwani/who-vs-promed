Outbreak Notice: Meningococcal Disease, Anhui Province, China
---------------------------------------------------
According to a 31 Jan 2005 report from the Ministry of Health (MOH)
of China, an outbreak of meningococcal disease is occurring in 11
cities in Anhui Province in eastern China. From 20 Dec 2004 through
30 Jan 2005, 62 cases have been reported, including 6 deaths.
Most of the cases are reported to be caused by _Neisseria
meningitidis_, serogroup C. Students 13-18 years of age have
reportedly been predominately affected. The MOH has responded to the
outbreak by issuing a notice to all local health bureaus to enhance
surveillance and intensify prevention and control measures, including
vaccination and preventive medication for close contacts.
According to the MOH, most previous cases of meningococcal disease in
China were caused by serogroup A. Since 1984 the government has
provided vaccine for serogroup A to children. Currently, bivalent
polysaccharide vaccine that protects against serogroups A and C is
being distributed.
Meningococcal disease, which can be found worldwide, is a serious,
sometimes fatal disease, caused by bacteria. It can cause meningitis,
an infection of the brain and spinal covering, as well as blood
infections. The bacteria that cause meningococcal disease are spread
through close, direct contact with an infected person that leads to
exchange of saliva or respiratory secretions, although infected
persons may not always appear to be sick.
Household contacts of patients with meningococcal disease may be at
risk. Risk factors for getting meningococcal disease include [older]
age, immune system problems such as HIV or AIDS, respiratory problems
such as influenza, smoking or being around people while they smoke,
and indoor crowding.

Meningococcal disease in Sudan
------------------------------
As of 7 Feb 2005, the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health has
reported a total of 250 cases and 19 deaths of meningococcal disease
in Blue Nile (199 cases), Gadaref (22 cases) and Khartoum states
(29). 3 specimens have been laboratory-confirmed for _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup A. The outbreak appears to be decreasing.
The Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health has rapidly responded to the
outbreaks and implemented mass vaccination campaigns in the villages
affected in Blue Nile and Gadaref States. Reinforcement of
surveillance is ongoing. WHO is assisting the Federal Ministry of
Health in running a workshop on prevention and control of
meningococcal disease.

WHO issues warning over meningitis
----------------------------------
Sudan is at risk of an outbreak of the highly contagious disease
meningitis and additional funds are required to purchase vaccines and
antibiotics, WHO warned.
Meningitis cases had been reported in the eastern Sudanese states of
Gadaref and Blue Nile, bordering Ethiopia. Between 22 Jan and 2 Feb
2005, a total of 169 cases, including 23 deaths, were reported from
both states, WHO said.
Localized vaccination campaigns were ongoing since 1 Feb 2005,
targeting 70 percent of the population in affected villages in both
states.
"The Sudanese government has responded quickly and sent in
vaccination teams straight away and the number of reported cases has
been falling since last week," Dick Thompson, spokesman of the
communicable diseases section of the WHO in Geneva, told IRIN on Fri,
11 Feb 2005.
"Although, besides the outbreak in Gadaref and Blue Nile, no
meningitis cases have been reported anywhere else in Sudan so far, it
is only the beginning of the meningitis season," Thompson said. "The
important thing is to identify the disease early and start
vaccination campaigns rapidly."
The WHO is supporting the Sudanese Ministry of Health to raise
supplementary funds to purchase the meningococcal meningitis vaccine
and antibiotics to establish a buffer stock in the event of
widespread meningitis outbreak in Sudan.
Overcrowded housing situations and large population displacements due
to crises, pilgrimages, and regional markets facilitate the
transmission of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the most important [type
of] meningitis-causing bacteria, which has the potential to cause
epidemics, according to WHO.
The 1st known meningitis outbreak in Sudan was reported in 1950-51
and affected 72 162 people. The 2nd was in 1988-89 with 38 805 cases
and 2770 deaths. The most recent occurred in 1999, when about 33 216
cases and 2306 deaths were reported.

Vaccination completed following meningitis outbreak in refugee camps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Health workers have completed a 12-day drive to vaccinate 72 000
people against meningitis following an outbreak of the highly
contagious disease in 3 overcrowded refugee camps in eastern Chad,
the WHO said on Tue, 8 Feb 2005.
"We have completed the vaccination of nearly 72 000 people in the
Treguine, Bredjing, and Farchana camps and the population within a
5-km radius of the camps, which represents a 89 percent coverage
rate," Doctor Camilo Kuan, the head of WHO emergency operations in
eastern Chad, told IRIN by telephone.
Treguine, Bredjing, and Farchana are located near the border town of
Adre. Together, they host 1/3 of the 213 000 refugees from Sudan's
troubled Darfur region who have sought sanctuary on Chadian soil.
Kuan said 19 suspected cases of meningitis had been reported in the 3
camps during January 2005, of which 6 had been confirmed. Only 1
person had died from the disease, which causes an inflammation of the
brain, he added.
The vaccination drive began on 26 Jan 2005 and was conducted by
Medecins sans Fontieres (MSF) France, MSF Holland, and the
International Federation of the Red Cross.
A major meningitis outbreak occurred in Chad in 1998 when several
hundred people died of the disease. Further outbreaks occurred in
2000 and 2001.
Officials from the UN refugee agency UNHCR said the number of
Sudanese refugees registered in Chad had increased steadily to 213
000 in recent weeks. This was mainly due to displaced Sudanese
moving from towns and villages in eastern Chad into the 11 official
refugee camps because their food supply from the local community was
drying up, the officials told IRIN.

[5] USA, vaccine supply

Meningitis drug may be in short supply
--------------------------------------
Health officials are bracing for the possibility of shortages of a
new shot that prevents the type of meningitis that often spreads on
college campuses.
A government panel recommended for the 1st time Thu, 10 Feb 2005 that
all 10 million or so 11- and 12-year-olds in the USA get the
vaccination, along with teenagers entering high school and college
freshmen living in dormitories.
The problem is that the [vaccine], called Menactra, is so new that
the manufacturer will not be fully geared up for a few years, and
only 5 million doses are expected to be available in 2005, said the
maker, Sanofi Pasteur.
The immunization, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
January 2005, is expected to become available to doctors in March
2005.
Health officials with the panel, which advises the CDC, said
Menactra's predecessor vaccine, Menomune, also created by Sanofi
Pasteur, could be used as an alternative in the event of shortages.
But Menomune does not provide nearly as much protection as Menactra.
Meningococcal meningitis affects about 3000 a year in the USA and
kills around 300. College freshmen who live in dormitories have the
highest rate of the disease in the country -- 5.1 per 100 000 people,
according to the CDC.
The vaccine shortages could occur during the next few 3 years,
because a new factory that will produce Menactra will not open until
2007 or 2008, said Phil Hosbach, vice president of new products and
immunization for the company.

[The difference between the 2 biological products is not related to
their capsular polysaccharide antigens -- both are quadrivalent
products containing types A, C, Y, and W-135 -- but rather that the
new vaccine has antigens that are conjugated to a protein backbone.
Similar conjugated vaccines (although not quadrivalent) have been
available in Canada and the UK.
Conjugation allows the antigen to become T-cell-dependent, thereby
producing an immunity that is longer-lasting and can be boosted,
unlike the unconjugated older product, which conferred shorter
immunity. Additionally, conjugation allow the antigen to be
immunogenic in children less than 24 months of age. It is likely
that when adequate amounts are available, this vaccine will join its
conjugated polysaccharide vaccine "cousins", the _Haemophilus
influenzae_ type b and heptavalent pneumococcal product. - Mod.LL]
