The health authorities of the Dominican province of Santiago remained today, 19 Aug 2012, on the alert to the increasing number of people with symptoms of cholera in that territory, where more than 300 are reported affected. The outbreak of diarrhea in the last 3 days is caused by poor quality of drinking water consumed by residents of the territory, said the provincial director of Public Health, Ramon Martinez.

In addition to diarrhea, patients treated at public and private hospitals, had vomiting and severe pain in the abdomen. Most of the patients were tested for diagnosis, and [in many of them the presence of bacterial infections other than cholera was confirmed], said an epidemiologist quoted by local media.

Cholera coming from Haiti appeared in the Dominican Republic in November 2010, and has caused so far more than 170 deaths, official figures indicate. Dominican former minister of health, Bautista Rojas, said in July 2012 that cholera has affected 0.22 percent of the Dominican population of about 9.5 million inhabitants, although concentrated in the areas of greatest social vulnerability.

"We will maintain continuous monitoring of the issue, including the strengthening of the various components of the strategy to combat the disease to reduce risk and achieve its elimination," said Rojas.
