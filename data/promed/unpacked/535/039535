A Q fever outbreak in a school in central Israel
-----------------------------------------------
A recent outbreak of febrile disease has occurred among high school
students in an urban area in Israel. 110 of 270 students and 7 of 40
employees in the same school developed high-grade fever with headache and
malaise, which lasted 4-10 days. 2 patients (a 16-year-old student and a
50-year-old employee) developed myopericarditis.
A diagnosis of acute Q fever was made, as a convalescent serum of the
student showed IgM and IgG antibodies against phase II antigens of
_Coxiella burnetti_. The diagnosis was confirmed serologically in 11 other
students that were tested.
An epidemiological investigation was conducted to disclose the source of
the infection. It revealed that all the patients had either eaten in or
passed through the dining room of the school before the outbreak started. A
possible source of the infection might have been a parturient cat in the
area of the dining room and possible spread of contaminated aerosol by the
air conditioning system. Unfortunately, we were unable to prove this
assumption.

[Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, a strictly
intracellular bacterium that is a potential bioweapon. In Israel, the
disease was 1st described during the 4th decade of the previous century and
has been notifiable in humans and animals for more than 50 years. Cases in
humans and in farm animals (cattle, sheep and goats) are recorded every
year; in the latter, the infection is manifested by abortions, causing
considerable economic losses.
Though the world literature incriminates mainly farm animals as the source
of human infection, this is not always supported by evidence in Israel;
while in some human cases a link to farm animals or their fomites/products
could be demonstrated, in the majority of cases, no such association is
apparent. Other sources/animals should be considered as well. The current
observation may indicate the need for more attention to the potential role
of pets, particularly cats; the stray cat population in Israel is estimated
to exceed 6-figure numbers, with high densities observed in urban areas.
Epidemiological investigation regarding their infection rate with _Coxiella
burnetii_ might be justifiable.
