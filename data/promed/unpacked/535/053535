The Utah state veterinarian has issued a warning after 4 cases of the EHV-1 virus [infection] were confirmed in Cache County. 2 of the horses have been euthanized.

The warning states that exposed animals and their facilities have been quarantined.

A news release from the Ogden Golden Spike Event Center states that the facility continues to be proactive by maintaining horse safe health practices.

"We would like to remind you about how important it is for horse owners to practice good biosecurity at home and while at events," states the release.

"Preventive care is essential and should be the mindset," Bruce King, the Utah state veterinarian, is quoted as saying in the release. "Horse owners need to use good biosecurity by not sharing buckets or tack of any kind."

The Golden Spike Event Center release encourages horse owners to keep their horses as isolated as they can and to be careful around horse events.

King also reminded that all horses have been exposed to the virus by the time they are 6 months old.

"The Golden Spike Event Center is at no more risk than at any other time," King said in the release. "Horse owners need to understand that the virus is out there, and it will pop up frequently."

[This release makes some valid points of strict biosecurity, and weighing the risk. If your animal is not feeling well or is a little "off" then keep the animal at home. You may save your animal's life or the life of animals belonging to someone else by not exposing them.

This virus clearly seems to be intense and wide spread this early in the spring.
