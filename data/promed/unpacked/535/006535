Letter: Inept deer cull could increase Lyme
-------------------------------------------
Lyme disease is a serious concern on Long Island [NY] due to its prevalence, difficulty to properly diagnose, and potential for devastating lingering effects, as well as conflicting opinions on treatment protocols and efficacy ["We tipped nature out of balance," Opinion, 10 Feb 2014]. As a mother, I am particularly concerned about risks to my children and support research on how to decrease the incidence of this dangerous condition.

Many studies have shown that incidence of Lyme disease is not decreased in human populations until the deer population is greatly decreased -- by 90 percent or more. Furthermore, human incidence of the disease is often increased for at least 2 years following smaller decreases in deer population, as the ticks accept a large range of hosts. If deer aren't available, humans are a good alternative.

Furthermore, it's the 2nd stage of the ixodes tick's life cycle that is most dangerous to humans, and that's when ticks are most commonly found on small rodents, not deer. Several studies have shown that decreasing fox populations are correlated to increased Lyme disease diagnosis in humans. Researchers surmise this is because foxes help control the population of small rodents.

I am concerned that unless we are prepared to cull 90 percent of deer and keep the population at this level, we will not see any decrease in human Lyme disease.

Studies have shown possible decreases in Lyme disease when deer are treated with sprayed-on insecticide. Furthermore, any programs to increase the population of birds of prey, which hunt small rodents, may be effective in decreasing human Lyme disease incidence.

While decreasing human Lyme disease is important, severe culling of deer may not translate into a decrease in human Lyme disease.

Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis), an infectious disease is caused by at least 3 species of bacteria of the genus _Borrelia_. _Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto_ is the primary cause of Lyme disease in North America. This is a spirochete bacterium with great genetic diversity.

The blacklegged tick or deer tick, a hard body tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) is the main vector on the east coast of the United States. Other ticks and biting insects such as mosquitoes, deer flies, and horse flies have been shown to carry the Lyme disease bacterium.

The relationship between deer and the disease is complex. Deer show no symptoms of the disease. Deer may carry small numbers of the spirochete that causes Lyme disease but they are dead-end hosts for the bacterium. Deer cannot infect another animals directly and no deer hunter has acquired the disease from dressing out a deer. Infected ticks that drop from deer present little risk to humans or other animals since the ticks are now at the end of their life cycle and will not feed again.

These ticks are just as capable of being on dogs, or cats, or any human. These ticks are very adaptable to a variety of hosts. Culling deer does not prevent the tick from adapting to dogs, cats, people, horses, or any other hosts. Likewise with mosquitoes, deer flies, and horse flies more than capable of carrying the bacterium, culling deer may not solve the Lyme disease problem.

The incidence of disease is due to a number of factors including:
- tick abundance;
- deer population;
- recognition of the disease;
- residence in a wooded area;
- potential for contact with ticks; and
- physician reporting of disease.

The tiny nymphal stage of the tick and the adult tick can both transmit the disease. The nymph is very tiny, about the size of a poppy seed or smaller, so it is easy to see why people do not recognize when they have a tick on them. It is also why some people do not get early treatment. Ticks can be almost anywhere a warm blooded host is.

The author of the letter argues that not culling enough deer might be counterproductive, increasing instead of decreasing the incidence of Lyme disease in humans. In the East Coast of North America, Lyme disease is transmitted by _Ixodes scapularis_, a tick that uses 3 hosts to complete its cycle, each for one of its stages: larva, nymph, and adult.

When a larva feeds on an infected rodent, after molting to nymph it can transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the causative agent of Lyme disease) to the next host it feeds on. Adult ticks can also transmit the pathogen if they fed on infected rodents at an earlier stage, but it is less likely that an adult tick transmits the disease to a human, as adults are larger and easily spotted before they have been attached long enough to inoculate the pathogen. Deer are the preferred hosts for adult ticks. More deer represents more opportunities for female ticks to engorge and lay hundreds of eggs that will produce larvae that primarily feed on rodents, some of which will be infected. Therefore, while culling low numbers of deer may not result in a significant effect on the incidence of Lyme disease in humans, it is unlikely that it results in an increase of it (at least in the long term). Adults may seek alternative hosts, but then there would be less larvae in the next generation, because females are less able to succeed. - Mod.PMB]
