As of 22 Mar 2007, the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak deaths in
Tanzania have risen to 18 as 2 more people died of the disease on
Wednesday [21 Mar 2007], in Dodoma, [the country's designated capital.]
A local English newspaper, The Citizen, reported on Thursday [22 Mar
2007] that 2 more people had died of the deadly disease that already
had claimed the lives of 13 Dodoma residents up to Monday [19 Mar
2007] of this week.
Countrywide, 3 others have so far died of the disease that first
broke out in neighboring Kenya and spread into northern Tanzania
earlier this year [2007].
Early this week the Tanzanian Health Minister, David Mwakyusa,
confirmed that apart from these deaths, 79 people were suspected to
have contracted the deadly virus. These deaths and suspected cases
are scattered in the country's Arusha, Dodoma, Manyara, and Tanga
regions, 3 of them being in the north and one in the middle. The
Arusha region was the 1st in Tanzania to have reported RVF-caused
deaths in early February [2007], after 2 people were found dead on 31
Jan 2007 in the region.
In 1998, [there was an outbreak of] Rift Valley fever in Arusha
following a similar outbreak in Kenya and the disease killed at least
10 people in Tanzania between January and March that year.
Rift Valley fever, most common during years of heavy rainfalls, is a
viral disease that affects mainly animals such as cattle, buffalo,
sheep, and goats. But it can also affect humans. People contract RVF
mainly from bites of infected mosquitoes and the disease can also be
spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of an
infected animal. RVF can cause serious eye infection, inflammation of
the brain, severe bleeding (hemorrhage) and death.
