[The new cases reported by the FAO bring FluTrackers' tally of H5N1 cases since 1 Jan 2015 to 128, as only 7 cases on the list of 11 above had not previously been included on Sharon Sanders (Editor-in-Chief)'s list. See https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/egypt/h5n1-tracking-egypt/720309-egypt-2015-who-moh-provincial-health-depts-h5n1-confirmed-case-list. No deaths are noted among these cases, although they may be reported in the future. The reporting problem continues even as the case numbers increase, with discrepant numbers coming from WHO and FluTrackers compared with the Egyptian MOH [see more discussion of this in ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (78): Indonesia (BT) RFI, Egypt (SJ) H5N1 20150329.3263924]. Egypt appears to be experiencing intense activity as evidenced not only by the increasing numbers of cases, but also from reports of serious losses to the poultry industry, most likely from H5N1 (see http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/02/egypt-h5n1-poultry-losses-climbing.html).

[2] Indonesia (Banten): avian influenza human H5N1

Tangerang Woman Free of H5N1, Remains Under Observation
-------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health will continue to monitor a woman from Tangerang [Banten province, Indonesia] for at least another day after her husband and 2-year-old child died of bird flu last week [see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (78): Indonesia (BT) RFI, Egypt (SJ) H5N1 20150329.3263924].

The head of the ministry's research agency, Tjandra Yoga Aditama, said the woman was free of the H5N1 virus, and that health officials had run 2 separate tests. "We will check the sample from her throat on the 3rd day to ensure that she is healthy," Tjandra said. "Overall she is in good condition; she no longer has fever."

A 40-year-old man from Tangerang died on Tuesday [24 Mar 2015], and his 2-year-old child died on Thursday [26 Mar 2015]. The government suspected the patients contracted the virus from an infected owl while visiting a relative's house in Bogor, West Java [Jawa Barat province].

[The Jakarta Post today (Mon 30 Mar 2015) indicates the 2 family members died from H5N1, which we suspected, but had not been able to confirm when the previous post was made by ProMED (Avian influenza, human (78): Indonesia (BT) RFI, Egypt (SJ) H5N1 20150329.3263924). This news report also indicated that the 2 were believed to have been exposed to poultry when they visited the Bogor home of a relative who owns a small poultry farm. See more at http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/03/30/greater-jakarta-two-die-bird-flu-tangerang.html. However, the post above suggests it may have been an infected owl that served as the source of the virus. The National Wildlife Health Center (US Geological Survey) indicates birds in the order _Strigiformes_ (owls) are infected by H5N1 and die from the infection. The role of wild birds in avian flu virus dissemination has been a subject of intense discussion. Most wild birds are thought to become infected when sharing water sources contaminated with the virus, as H5N1 is primarily a gastrointestinal infection in birds, and is generally believed to spread through infected feces. This is probably the case for waterfowl; however, owls, which are opportunistic hunters, likely may become infected by consumption of infected prey. Suggested further reading on the topic of wild bird involvement in H5N1 transmission includes: Tian H et al. 2015. PNAS 112(1). http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1405216112.
