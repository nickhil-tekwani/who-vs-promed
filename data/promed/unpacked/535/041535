CRYPTOPERIDINIOPSIS, FISH KILLS - USA (FLORIDA)

Cryptoperidiniopsis, a cousin of _Pfiesteria piscicida_, is suspected in a
series of fish kills in the Indian River and St. Lucie River, about 30 miles
north of West Palm Beach, FL. Observable effects are lesions similar to
those seen in the mid-Atlantic episodes of _Pfiesteria piscicida_. And
Florida scientists believe that this pathogenic relative (which has been
found in the waterways) may act in the same way of causing fish to slough
off their protective mucus coatings, allowing bacteria and fungi to attack.
