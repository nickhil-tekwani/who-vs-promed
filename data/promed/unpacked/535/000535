In Bishkek, 7 people from Kyrgyzstan's village of Dzhetim-Tebe have been
hospitalized with suspected symptoms of anthrax. Quarantine has been
imposed in the whole Kara-Kuldzha district. Doctors are going to examine
all of the village's 200 residents to prevent an anthrax outbreak. Several
epidemiological and veterinary teams have been rushed to the village. The
regional and district administrations issued funds for preventive
operations. Measures to liquidate the anthrax nidus are being taken.
