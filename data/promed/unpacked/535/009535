Norwegian colleagues report that there is only 1 case in Norway with the same MLVA profile [as the cases in Sweden]. They are in dialogue with my Swedish colleagues and are going to interview this patient regarding any possible associations. As far as I understand the other cases in Norway are unrelated.

The number of (diagnosed) cases in Norway has been low and geographically distributed in a way that makes a travel hub or destination a likely common point of infection, and a probable common point has been identified as an Oslo Airport caf√©. Because of delays in reporting and diagnosis epidemiological investigation is still ongoing, so it is early to say what the final result will be.

I would suggest that the main confounders will be a) not seeing a doctor when ill, b) if diagnosed at visit no microbiology is asked for, and c) sample taken after illness in reality has cleared.

[I would like to thank Ann Lindberg for clarifying that most of the cases of _S._ Typhimurium in Norway are not related to the concurrent outbreak in Sweden and thank the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for the comment. - Mod.LL
