A case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has been reported in Kaolack commune. According to the health services of the region quoted by the daily "L'As", the infected carrier comes from the department of Koungheul and is a vehicle driver in his state. The victim is currently hospitalized at the Ibrahima Niasse regional hospital in Kaolack. According to the newspaper health authorities say they have taken all steps to prevent the spread of the disease.

According to a specialized site "mesvaccins.net", the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is of the genus _Orthonairovirus_, of the family Nairoviridae. It can be responsible for serious epidemics of viral haemorrhagic fever. It causes high fever, pain, nausea, and vomiting usually 3-4 days after infection. It can be responsible for severe bleeding forms with a lethality rate of 10 to 40 per cent.

Human transmission of the virus is by tick bite (_Hyalomma_) or by contact with blood (or body fluids SB) containing the virus or animal tissues immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases occur among those involved in the livestock industry, such as farm workers, slaughterhouse employees, and veterinarians. A nosocomial exposure in health care facilities may also occur.

The Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north. Hosts of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus include a wide range of wild and domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.

[Previous seroprevalence studies have highlighted that CCHF is focally endemic throughout Senegal and neighboring countries (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323271/).

Sporadic human infections may be expected in people with regular contact with livestock in endemic areas, but these are preventable through use of repellents, protective clothing, and gloves to prevent tick bites, and avoiding contact with blood and body fluids of livestock.

To prevent outbreaks of CCHF, public awareness campaigns aimed at the populations most at risk -- livestock farmers, butchers, and health personnel -- must be conducted, and the epidemiologic alert systems must be strengthened. In addition, conditions that enhance maintenance of the virus in nature and its transmission to humans must be better understood so adequate control measures can be developed. - Mod.UBA
