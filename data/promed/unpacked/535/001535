Viral outbreak in China tests government efforts
------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in
China, which since January [2009] has killed 19
children and made nearly 42 000 ill, has
researchers calling for a better surveillance
system to detect the disease and for action to
speed up vaccine development. "The situation of
preventing and containing hand, foot and mouth
disease is very serious at the moment," Deng
Haihua, spokesman for China's health ministry,
said last week. More cases are expected, as the
disease normally peaks between May and July. In
the absence of a drug treatment, the ministry is
focusing on prevention and containment.

The outbreak is the latest in a series to have
hit China in recent years, caused by a
fast-spreading virus called enterovirus 71. "The
persistence of enterovirus 71 outbreaks in China
is a wake-up call," says Jane Cardosa, a
virologist at the University Malaysia Sarawak in
Kota Samarahan. In 1997, Sarawak saw the 1st
outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease in the
Asia-Pacific region. The disease causes flu-like
symptoms, along with rashes on the hands and
feet, and mouth ulcers. It can be caused by many
types of human enterovirus belonging to the
family _Picornaviridae_, which are mainly
transmitted through fecal or oral routes.
Although normally mild, the disease can be
life-threatening: some viruses, particularly
enterovirus 71, can cause inflammation of the
brain stem, resulting in heart failure and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

In 1997 in Sarawak, more than 2600 cases of the
disease were reported and 29 people died. The
next year in Taiwan, there were 129 000 reported
cases and 78 deaths. In mainland China, the 1st
reported case was in Shenzhen, Guangdong
province, in 1999. At 1st, outbreaks were local
and there were no reported fatalities. But since
2004, the outbreaks have become more severe and
widespread, says Xu Wenbo, an infectious-disease
expert at the Beijing-based China Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

In May 2008, the country's health ministry added
hand, foot and mouth to its category 'C' of
notifiable diseases, meaning that all diagnosed
cases must be reported through a national
Web-based system for disease surveillance, and
took measures to streamline reporting
requirements. The Ministry also vowed to take a
tough stance against cover-ups and last month
[fired] 4 health officials in Henan province for
concealing the number of infections and deaths.

This year, enterovirus 71 has caused nearly all
of the laboratory-confirmed cases in 2 hot-spots,
the provinces of Henan and Shandong.

Xu suspects that the disease's increasing
virulence may be due to a genetic change in the
circulating virus strain. Before 2004 the
predominant strain was called C4b; since then, a
different strain, C4a, has been most common (see:
Y. Zhang et al. J. Clin. Virol. 44, 262Â­267;
2009). What caused this switch isn't clear, says
Xu, as little is known about the genetics and
transmission trends of the fast-mutating virus.
Most studies have been clinical, aimed at, for
example, identifying the strains behind a given
outbreak and the disease's clinical features,
especially when there are neurological
complications. Many researchers say it is time to
step up efforts to understand the basic biology
of enterovirus 71 to speed vaccine development.

In a major push financed by the Chinese Health
Ministry and the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, Xu and his colleagues measured the
infection rate in adults and children during last
year's outbreak and analysed stool samples and
throat swabs taken from more than 18 000
patients. Preliminary results suggest that the
infection rate is alarmingly high, meaning that
there are large populations of virus carriers who
do not show any symptoms of the disease.

Experts are divided as to how worried the world
should be about the virus. Tom Solomon, a
neurologist at the University of Liverpool, UK,
argues that enterovirus 71 infection is
underappreciated on a global scale and may pose a
bigger risk to public health than is currently
thought. But Hans Troedsson, the World Health
Organization's representative in China, says
"there is no cause for alarm." The public-health
impact of hand, foot and mouth disease, including
cases caused by enterovirus 71, is no more
serious than other common childhood diseases, he
says. Troedsson thinks that the recent apparent
increase in enterovirus 71 infection might be due
to higher reporting rates rather than an increase
in disease prevalence. "We will closely monitor
the situation and decide policies accordingly," he says.

[This article provides a useful statement of the current situation and
an indication of the extent of the epidemic. The strain of
enterovirus 71 associated with this outbreak differs from that
prevalent in earlier outbreaks when the disease was less prevalent.
Before 2004, the predominant strain was designated C4b; since then, a
different strain, C4a, has been most common. Whether this is related
to the apparently greater severity of the disease since 2004 has still
to be established. - Mod.CP]
