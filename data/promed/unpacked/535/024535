Sheep producers in the Big Horn Basin and surrounding areas are urged
to closely monitor their flocks for bluetongue, an infectious disease
due to a potentially fatal virus.

An outbreak of bluetongue this fall has killed more than 300 sheep in
the Worland, Otto, Basin, and Greybull areas of the Big Horn Basin
and led to sickness in hundreds of other sheep.

The virus also killed pronghorn antelope, white-tailed deer, and mule
deer in the Big Horn Basin as well as antelope and mule deer in the
Cody (WY), Sinclair (WY), and Douglas (WY), areas. The disease is
also present in southern Montana.

Sheep owners are urged to contact their veterinarian if they notice
symptoms of bluetongue in their flocks, says Don Montgomery, director
of the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (WSVL), which is managed
by the University of Wyoming's College of Agriculture.

Montgomery says samples from sheep (either live or dead animals) can
be collected and sent to the WSVL for testing.

"We may see additional losses due to abortion, particularly in sheep
but possibly in cattle. This could occur even after a hard freeze
kills the midge vector," Montgomery says. "Bluetongue crosses the
placenta and causes fetal malformations. We are most likely to see
this in the Big Horn Basin along the affected drainages."

[Bluetongue is a non-contagious, arthropod-borne viral disease of
both domestic and wild ruminants. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is endemic
in some areas with cattle and wild ruminants serving as reservoirs
for the virus.

Bluetongue is an orbivirus, which cross-reacts with many
antigenically related viruses including Palyam virus and the viruses
that cause epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer and African horse
sickness. Bluetongue virus replicates in both arthropod and mammalian
host cells. The virulence of BTV varies quite markedly; even strains
with matching serotypes have variable virulence. A total of 25
serotypes have been identified worldwide with only 5 recognized
within the United States.

BTV can replicate in a variety of mammalian cells. According to
Smith, "Clinically, the BTV seems to present as underlying
endothelial cell damage resulting in a vasculitis causing edema and
eventually necrosis of epithelial and mucosal surfaces."
Teratogenesis occurs in the developing fetus due to virally induced
disruptions of organogenesis.

BTV infection occurs in both wild and domestic ruminants/camelids
from the bite of the vector midge of the genus _Culicoides_. The
_Culicoides_ vector infects most species during mid-summer to early
fall when it is most active. The virus can also be transmitted
sexually in infected semen and transplacentally from dam to
offspring. Transmission via embryo transfer may also be a concern if
the embryo is not washed at least 10 times. _Culicoides_ transmission
is by far the most important method of transmission in endemic areas.
BTV is mostly seen in the southern United States where _Culicoides_
are widespread. In the absence of competent vector populations,
animal-to-animal transmission is not capable of maintaining an
endemic state. The overall seroprevalence of cattle in the United
States is greater than 18 percent.

Bluetongue is clinically manifested as 2 syndromes: 1) vascular
insult of several organ systems and 2) a reproductive syndrome. Sheep
are commonly seen with clinical disease, but other domestic ruminants
such as cattle and goats only rarely show clinical signs.
Differential diagnoses of bluetongue in sheep include Orf (contagious
ecthyma), foot-and-mouth disease, any vesicular disease, and sheep pox.

Environmental elimination is usually not possible so sheep should be
kept indoors during peak midge activity, such as, dusk. Environmental
control using Ivermectin can be attempted, but transmission of BTV
can occur before the insect's demise. Some modified live vaccines are
available and should be based upon the local strains and serotypes.

Frost usually kills the midges responsible for transmission of the
disease. Hopefully the weather will reduce the number of cases in the
near future.
