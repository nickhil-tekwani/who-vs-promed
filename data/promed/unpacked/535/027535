A case of anthrax in a person has been registered in the Armenian
city of Gjumri. A 47-year-old woman bought some meat in the local
market and, after preparing the food, developed an ulcer on her hand.
The woman went to the medical aid clinic and was sent to the
infectious disease hospital.
The press-secretary of the Ministry of Health of Armenia has stated
that, after having carried out bacteriological analysis, experts from
Gjumri have diagnosed anthrax in the woman. Nevertheless, the
Ministry of Health has not yet received final confirmation. Results
will be known in the near future. It is necessary to note that this
is the 1st discovery of a case of anthrax in Armenia.

[They wish! The government has not submitted any disease reports to
OIE in 2003 nor in 2004. The last official case of anthrax was in
2001 in a cow. But in 2003, there was a newspaper report of a bovine
case in Armavir; it had not been vaccinated. The annual vaccination
levels are some 1.2 million cattle per year, 1.5 million sheep, 16
000 horses, and 27 000 pigs. 3 large cats in the Yerevan Zoo were
infected from contaminated meat in 2002. And the numbers of human
cases in recent years has been from 2 to 12+ people each year. In
2004, there was a severe outbreak in Shirak involving 40 cattle, a
number of dogs and presumably some human cases, as meat from the
infected herd was sold in an adjoining market 2 days before the
cattle deaths were reported. The poor quality of the national
livestock vaccine was blamed for this outbreak. The Minister of
Health needs to talk to his colleague, the Minister of Agriculture,
about improving the national anthrax control program. - Mod.MHJ]
