19 people from a commune in the central province of Binh Thuan were
hospitalized Friday [9 Jan 2009] after being attacked by rabid dogs,
Ho Chi Minh City doctors said.

All the victims, from Binh Thuan's Tan Phuc Commune, were listed as
being in critical condition because of delays in transferring them to
Ho Chi Minh City [HCM] Hospital for Tropical Diseases, doctors said.

Head of the hospital's Examination Department Mai Xuan Thong told VNA
it was the 1st time the hospital received so many people from one
place bitten by rabid dogs in separate attacks.

Doctors said "mad" dogs had attacked 57 people in Tan Phuc over the
past 6 months, with 2 victims dying from rabies because of improper
care and treatment.

[The detailed clinical condition and post exposure vaccination or
treatment on the 19 people bitten by rabid dogs are not described in
the above report. Rabies can be prevented by the timely
administration of efficient vaccines and rabies immune globulin as
post exposure prophylaxis as well as preventive pre-exposure
vaccination for those felt to be at high risk of exposure.
