AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN - THAILAND (05): NOT

There are 2 boys with upper respiratory tract infection from a village in
Knong Kai province. This village was listed as an affected area because
H5N1 was identified in dead chickens. The provincial health office took
these 2 boys for treatment at the provincial hospital. Both have mild
fever and headache and mild respiratory symptoms, and chest x-rays are
normal. Because one of the boys had a rapid flu test positive for
influenza A, we listed this case as a probable case [of avian
influenza]. However, this morning the Medical Science Department
laboratory [of the Ministry of Health] documented it was an H3 influenza
virus. We are going to discard this case in tomorrow's report. (The
newspaper mentioned one of the cases was a girl; this is incorrect, as both
cases were in boys).
The Thai Ministry of Health has made the reporting criteria [for suspected
cases of human infection with avian influenza virus] more sensitive, and as
a consequence we have to work harder for laboratory testing and field
investigations. But this is to ensure that we will not miss a single case
of avian flu, if there are any!

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Kumnuan Ungchusak for this follow-up
information. The Thai Ministry of Health has increased surveillance
(epidemiology and laboratory) of influenza-like illness in provinces where
H5N1 (avian) influenza virus has been identified. Thus, we are seeing more
reports of "suspected" cases in humans based on rapid identification of
influenza A viruses that are subsequently confirmed as influenza H3 viruses
(human). Prudence would suggest refraining from posting newswires on
"suspected" cases in Thailand based on such identification. It is clear
the Thai Ministry of Health is doing an excellent job of active
surveillance for influenza to identify possible human infections associated
with non-human influenza type A viruses, including a transparency in early
reporting that is to be commended. - Mod.MPP]
