At least 4 people have died, and 15 others are in intensive care, following a food poisoning scandal at a retirement home in France. A total of 22 residents at the residential care facility in Lhrem, near Toulouse, sat down for dinner last night [Sun 31 Mar 2019] before becoming violently ill.

"The residents all had symptoms at around 8:00 p.m., an hour and a half after their meal," deputy mayor Frederic Pasian said, adding that many were "vomiting and displaying other serious symptoms related to their meal." He said that names of the 4 deceased, and all the other victims, were not being released until family members had been informed. Mr Pasian indicated that there were serious fears that others could die.

In the meantime, a Red Cross crisis unit has been set up at the Cheneraie (the retirement home), which has 88 private rooms for those living there. A statement released by the prefect of the Haute-Garonne department of southwest France, where Lhrem is located, reads: "22 residents of La Cheneraie, a nursing home for elderly residents in Lherm, have become victims of food poisoning on the evening of 31 Mar [2019] after dinner."

[The relatively short incubation period of onset of illness, about 90 minutes after the meal, is too short to be caused most infectious etiologies. Although staphylococcal enterotoxin foodborne illness, caused by a preformed toxin, can have such a short incubation period, it is usually 4-6 hours and has a low case fatality rate. Heavy-metal poisoning from metal leached from containers has an incubation period that's as short or shorter and causes primarily vomiting, but like the staphylococcal illness, it is usually not fatal. The overall state of health of those involved is not clear and could be a factor, but it is more likely that the etiology was one of a chemical contamination of some sort. - Mod.LL
