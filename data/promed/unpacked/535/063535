The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) was notified by the Health and Family Planning Commission (HFPC) of Guangdong Province today [7 Jan 2014] of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a man aged 31. The patient, who lives in Shenzhen, had onset of symptoms on 30 Dec 2013 and was admitted to a local hospital on 3 Jan 2014. His specimen tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by the relevant health authority of Guangdong Province today. He had no recent history of contact with poultry and is currently in stable condition. His 35 close contacts in Shenzhen have been put under medical surveillance, with their specimens all tested negative for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus by the relevant health authority of Guangdong Province.

Investigation by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province also revealed that the patient had another close contact, who is a 4-year-old girl living in Hong Kong. The girl and her 37-year-old mother travelled to Shenzhen between 26 Dec 2013 and 6 Jan 2014. The girl had close contact with that patient on 30 Dec 2013.

Upon receipt of the notification from Guangdong HFPC, the CHP commenced contact tracing immediately and located the duo today [7 Jan 2014]. Preliminary investigation by the CHP showed that the girl has been asymptomatic all along, while her mother developed a sore throat last night [6 Jan 2014]. The pair has been admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation, and their respiratory specimens will be taken for preliminary laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP.

To date, a total of 149 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the mainland. They are: Zhejiang (52 cases), Shanghai (34 cases), Jiangsu (28 cases), Guangdong (9 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Fujian (5 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (2 cases), Hunan (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases) and Hebei (one case). The CHP will follow up with the mainland health authorities for more case details.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organisation (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said. All border control points (BCPs) have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation.

Regarding health education for travellers at BCPs, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding. "Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza A(H7N9)-affected areas and provinces, with fever or respiratory symptoms should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces," the spokesman advised.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:
* Do not visit live poultry markets. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
* Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
* Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing; hold the spit with a tissue, and put it into a covered dustbin;
* Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
* Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

A 4-year-old Hong Kong girl who came into close contact with a Shenzhen man infected with H7N9 has been placed in isolation at Princess Margaret Hospital. The girl and her 37-year-old mother were in Shenzhen from 26 Dec 2013 until Mon 6 Jan 2014. The girl had close contact on 30 Dec 2013 with the 31-year-old infected man, who was by then beginning to show symptoms, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong said. Notified by the center, the local Centre for Health Protection started contact tracing and located the girl and her mother yesterday [7 Jan 2014]. "Preliminary investigation showed that the girl has been asymptomatic all along, while her mother developed a sore throat on Mon 6 Jan 2014," the center said. The pair have been admitted to an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital, and their respiratory specimens will be taken for preliminary laboratory testing.

The Shenzhen resident, who is the 2nd case of H7N9 infection in the mainland city, did not have any contact with live poultry. After starting to show symptoms on 30 Dec 2013, he was admitted to hospital on Friday [3 Jan 2014]. He has received Tamiflu and is in a stable condition. Health authorities have placed 35 of his close contacts under medical observation, but their throat swabs have all tested negative for H7N9. Meanwhile, health authorities in Dongguan said a patient died of organ failure after being confirmed to have contracted the H7N9 virus last month [December 2013].

Guangdong has so far reported 9 cases of H7N9, and this is the 1st fatality. A total of 149 human cases of H7N9 have been detected in the mainland and 2 in Hong Kong. At least 45 have died across the border, and one in Hong Kong. Secretary for Food and Health Ko Wing-man said the territory is stepping up vigilance for different types of flu virus. "The outbreak of H1N1 human swine flu has claimed lives in the United States, and I appeal to the public to get vaccinated if they find any vaccination scheme suitable in Hong Kong," he said. Ko added that swine flu H1N1 will become a type that will prevail among the seasonal flu strains.
