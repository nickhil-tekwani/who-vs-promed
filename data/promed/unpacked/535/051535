Foot-and-Mouth Disease Marches Westward
Animal Health Officials Fear Spread of Virus
--------------------------------------
Animal health officials in Texas are watching with concern the relentless
westward march of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The most recent outbreak of
FMD was confirmed in late February [2001] at several sites in England,
where livestock operations already have been financially ravaged by the
brain-wasting disease, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and outbreaks
of the viral infection, hog cholera.
Additional cases of FMD have been detected among cattle, sheep and swine in
Great Britain. In addition to the loss of thousands of animals, British
farmers may lose as much as $73 million just from the week-long ban (which
could be extended) on the transport and marketing of livestock susceptible
to the disease.
FMD, which has not been seen in the U.S. since l929, is caused by a highly
infectious virus that can cause death or disabling blisters and sores in
and around the mouth, muzzle, teats and feet of livestock with cloven or
"split" hooves. Cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer are highly susceptible,
and can exhibit clinical disease signs after an incubation period of only 3
to 8 days. To stop the spread of infection, affected or exposed animals
must be slaughtered, then burned or buried. Premises and equipment must be
disinfected to prevent disease spread.
"FMD virus poses special challenges, requiring proper disinfection and
biosecurity protocols. People who have worked around or been near infected
animals can inadvertently carry and spread the virus via their equipment,
cars, clothing, shoes, or even for a short time in their lungs or pharynx
(throat)," said Linda Logan, Texas' state veterinarian and head of the
Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health
regulatory agency. She pointed out studies indicate the virus can drift up
to 40 miles on the wind, another hurdle to confining an FMD outbreak to a
defined geographic area. [The virus has been documented as spreading much
farther, almost 300 miles on the wind. - Mod.TG] "FMD is probably the most
economically damaging livestock disease," Dr. Logan said.
The disease is currently affecting 4 of the world's 7 continents: Asia,
Africa, South America and Europe, leaving only North America, Australia,
and Antarctica free of the disease.
"An outbreak costs a country millions of dollars to fight, and thousands of
animals can be lost. Additionally, livestock markets must be closed to
prevent spread of infection, dairies may not be able to operate, and
transportation of livestock must cease. Furthermore, there's the cost of
depopulating and disposing of affected or exposed animals and vaccinating
'clean animals' to create a disease-free 'buffer zone,'" said Dr. Logan, a
specialist in tick-borne and foreign animal diseases. She also serves on a
national team reviewing how best to safeguard U.S. livestock from foreign
diseases and pests.
Dr. Logan urged livestock producers in Texas to step up their surveillance
and to take precautions to protect herds from possible contamination. "If
you've traveled internationally, don't risk carrying disease home to your
herd. Disinfect your boots before working with your livestock. Producers
who feed waste food to swine should be particularly careful to ensure all
scraps are well cooked," she said. She also suggested producers limit
vehicle traffic and visitors onto their premises, and keep new animals
isolated for several days prior to adding them to the existing herd.
"If your livestock become lame or develop blisters or sores, call us. Our
emergency response within the first 24 hours after the first signs of
disease will affect our outcome over the next 6 months," Dr. Logan said.
The TAHC and U.S. Dept. of Agriculture's Veterinary Services in Texas
operate toll-free numbers 24 hours a day for emergency calls. [US Dept. of
Agriculture's Veterinary Services 512-916-5555; Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC) 800-550-8242.]
While FMD vaccine is available, Dr. Logan said it is used only in
emergencies, to create a "disease-free" buffer zone around an infected
area. Because vaccinated animals will test positive, they cannot be shipped
internationally and protocols require the animals to be destroyed as soon
as the disease is eradicated.
"Most importantly, FMD outbreaks result in trade embargoes imposed by other
countries," said Dr. Logan.
"South Korea, for instance, had been free of FMD since l934, but was struck
by the virus in late March 2000," she reported. "Producers in that country
intended to export $400 million worth of pork in 2000, but Japan and its
other trading partners immediately shut their doors to South Korean
exported animals and products. It can take years to be declared
disease-free and reestablish international marketing opportunities."
"For years, we worried about domestic regulatory diseases that are 'tame'
compared to the devastation of foreign animal diseases," said Dr. Logan. "A
global economy brings with it global risks, and we must be prepared for the
inevitable threats posed by international trade and travel."
"Then there are the items travelers like to tote on long flights, such as
sandwiches, delicacies or other food items that could be contaminated by
the virus," said Dr. Max Coats. Although direct flights from countries
affected by FMD are checked carefully, Dr. Coats said there's always a risk
contaminated items could be smuggled or inadvertently brought into the
country by the millions of visitors and returning U.S. citizens who travel
internationally. Around 4.5 million British residents, for example, came to
the U.S. on direct flights in l999.
During the past year, more than a dozen countries have been plagued by
outbreaks of FMD, and the virus continues to migrate westward, noted Dr.
Logan. In early March 2000, Japan reported its first cases since l908, and
Japanese authorities laid blame on imported straw contaminated with the virus.
"Within 2 weeks of the initial case, Japanese livestock authorities checked
more than 25 000 dairies, nearly 27 000 beef cattle farms and almost 3700
pig farms to determine if there was additional infection," said Dr. Logan.
"If this scenario occurred in Texas, the TAHC field staff would be unable
to handle this enormous task alone, and we would have to summon help from
private veterinary practitioners, our partners within the state's emergency
management system, and our federal counterparts in the USDA." Of the 215
TAHC employees about 100 are livestock inspectors and around 20 are
veterinarians.
By Valentine's Day [14 Feb] 2000, reports indicated more than 500 animals
had died from the disease in eastern Mongolia, a large country bordered on
the south and east by China (also affected) and by Russia to the north. A
year later, FMD outbreaks continue in Mongolia, where winter blizzards also
wiped out more than 1.5 million animals.
By Easter last year, Russia reported cases among swine herds in its eastern
regions, and in late spring, infection was detected at a pig farm in
Kazakhstan, which shares borders with China and Russia. In August,
infection drifted southward into the small country of Tajikstan where cases
among cattle and sheep herds were reported.
In northeastern Greece, near the Turkish border, 2 free-grazing cattle
herds were struck by the disease in July 2000, and surrounding cattle, goat
and swine herds were destroyed. In the fall, Turkish governmental
authorities requested more than $43 million in international aid to curtail
livestock smuggling in its eastern and southeastern regions and stop the
introduction of FMD and its potential spread into Europe.
South American countries were hit by infection in late summer 2000, said
Dr. Coats. Paraguay was struck first in early August, followed by outbreaks
in Uruguay and Colombia. Argentinian officials blamed their country's
outbreak on cattle smuggled from Paraguay. An Argentinian newspaper
reported that as many as 20 000 head were smuggled in from Paraguay.
"Argentina is the world's fourth largest cattle-production country, and
producers had planned to expand their exports by $5 billion in 2000. Brazil
is the world's largest exporter of beef. Both countries lost their
marketing opportunities when FMD hit the countries," said Dr. Coats.
"When infection spread to Uruguay, the military shut down all human and
animal movement and dropped food into the restricted area from
helicopters," said Dr. Logan, who visited the country last fall.
"Animals in the affected area were euthanized and buried within 24 hours,
which stopped the spread of disease. Uruguayan officials and producers had
prepared for such an outbreak ahead of time by setting up funds to pay
producers for their livestock losses." [An indemnity plan still does not
exist in the United States despite repeated insistence from a number of
veterinarians. - Mod.TG]
FMD also wreaked havoc in South Africa in summer 2000, when
viral-contaminated waste food was off-loaded from a foreign vessel and fed
to swine.
"We're monitoring the movement of FMD closely. Buffer zones and existing
prevention efforts seem to have failed, as one after another, countries are
hit by the disease," said Dr. Coats. "Foreign animal diseases, like FMD,
are the 'gift that keeps on giving,' as demonstrated by the 2001 resurgence
of infection in Taiwan, after the country lost nearly all of its swine
herds in l997 outbreaks."
"This most recent FMD outbreak affecting Great Britain was initially
detected by a veterinarian inspecting pigs at a slaughter plant in a town
northeast of London. Since then, cases have been disclosed throughout Great
Britain, which has about 157 000 livestock farms," commented Dr. Coats. He
said British authorities believe the virus may have been introduced through
the feeding of contaminated wastefood to swine.
Sheep on a nearby farm were exposed and may have spread infection to as
many as 25 000 animals when they were hauled to three markets.
"Livestock shows in Great Britain have been cancelled, and animal parks and
zoos have been closed. Horse events also have been postponed, even equine
are not susceptible to the disease. Fears are that the virus could be
carried and spread either by the horses' hooves or by the vehicles used to
transport the animals," commented Dr. Coats.
He said French authorities are destroying more than 47 000 British sheep
recently imported. He pointed out that, in Germany, authorities are taking
precautions, destroying susceptible animals recently shipped in from Great
Britain.
In the Netherlands, more than 4300 susceptible livestock and deer have been
killed on farms that have links to Great Britain. Livestock markets in the
Netherlands also are being closed for a week, he said.
"Worldwide, nearly two-thirds of the FMD outbreaks are attributed to the
introduction and feeding of contaminated meat, meat products or garbage to
animals," said Dr. Logan. She said about a quarter of infection is spread
by airborne transmission, and about 10 percent is comprised of infected
livestock importations or contaminated objects and people."
"The FMD situation is a lot like watching a hurricane develop. We can't
pinpoint its next landfall, but we know its direction. We must be prepared
to take action immediately if the virus is introduced into the U.S.-- or
Texas," said Dr. Logan.
