Multiple dogs at Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Loxahatchee Grove [Palm Beach County] have tested positive for canine influenza, a highly contagious respiratory disease.

The details were confirmed Wednesday [23 Jun 2021] by founder Laurie Simmons and the shelter's spokesman Chase Scott.

Scott said Big Dog Ranch Rescue took in a dog after it was surrendered by a Palm Beach County owner.

That dog later tested positive for canine influenza 3 days later, which Simmons said then spread to 50 to 60 dogs which are currently sick. 4 dogs have also contracted pneumonia. However, no dogs have died.

The surrendered dog appeared to be healthy, was updated on vaccines, already spayed. So instead of putting it in quarantine, where we normally put all our shelter dogs coming in, we put it directly into our adoption buildings," Simmons said.

She said 4 adoption buildings at the facility have been on lockdown since 8 Jun 2021.

Simmons said they performed PCR tests on the dogs and have consulted a University of Florida veterinarian regarding the outbreak. "It's way bigger than anything we have ever seen," Simmons said.

She doesn't believe any dogs adopted before 8 Jun 2021 were affected by the virus.

Currently, puppy cabins, which are separate and isolated from the affected areas, are the only areas where dog adoptions are being allowed.

Several adoption buildings will likely be shut down until mid-July [2021].

Simmons said they will administer canine influenza vaccines to dogs not having been affected by the disease starting Thursday [24 Jun 2021].

"This is a highly infectious virus. If you are in contact, and the dog coughed on you, saliva on you, it can be carried on your clothes, your skin, your shoes, and lives on surfaces for up to 48 hours," Simmons said. "If you are walking your dog, another dog coughs on the grass, your dog sniffs the spot, it can get the virus that way also."

Dr Cynda Crawford with the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine said the disease is at a level in the county where dog owners and other facilities should be on alert.

"We have multiple confirmed cases not only in the dogs at the Big Dog Ranch shelter, but also in pet dogs out in the community, so it is good evidence the virus is here in Palm Beach County," Crawford said.

Dr Cynda Crawford explains canine influenza can spread very easily among dogs. She said this marks the 1st return of the canine influenza virus in Florida since a big statewide outbreak in the summer of 2017.

The CDC says on its website canine influenza is thought to pose a low threat to people.

[We are saddened to learn this very contagious disease has made its presence known again.

If you have a sick animal, have touched one, or take one to a veterinary office, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly before touching other animals. Washing your clothes and showering or bathing are critical to help keep the spread of this disease down, and not track it back to your home if you are working in a shelter or a veterinary office.

"Canine influenza (CI) or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the USA, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the USA, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.

"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the USA."

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (such as dog parks, play dates, or interactions in the park) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm). - Mod.TG
