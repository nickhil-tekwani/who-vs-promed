Comment on the outbreak at the Malaysian National Service Trainee Camp
-------------------------------------------------
The outbreak described in the recent ProMED-mail post archived as "Acute
respiratory infection, NS trainees - Malaysia: RFI 20060423.1191" could be
due to adenovirus infection, which is well known to have caused explosive
respiratory outbreaks in US military recruits, especially in the conditions
of over-crowding and poor hygiene in such training environments. I have
attached 2 references regarding this problem in military recruits.
The diagnosis should be relatively straight forward and rapid using viral
culture, adenovirus-specific PCR, or adenovirus-specific
monoclonal-antibody immunofluorescence staining of respiratory specimens
(NPAs, throat swabs, nasal swabs).
Having said that, it would be interesting to know what the pathogen
responsible is, if it is not influenza or adenovirus, or perhaps, even
non-viral.

Agents associated with outbreaks of respiratory infection among the military
-----------------------------------------------
Two other agents associated with outbreaks of respiratory infection among
military personnel are adenoviruses and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_. The
following information has been abstracted from GIDEON.
Adenoviruses
------------
Adenoviruses were originally described during outbreaks among American
military personnel during the 1950s.
- These agents accounted for about 72 per cent of all respiratory disease
and 10 per cent of hospitalization among recruits in 1958.
- Military outbreaks tend to involve adenovirus types 4 or 7.
- Adenoviruses were implicated in 53 per cent of respiratory disease among
military trainees during 1996 to 1998.
- 2 recruits died of adenovirus infection in Illinois in 2000, the 1st
fatalities among military personnel since 1972.
- A live oral vaccine was released in 1971 for routine use in the military.
- Recent discontinuance of vaccination has been followed by large outbreaks
of acute respiratory disease.
Notable outbreaks:
1986 - An outbreak (132 cases) of keratoconjunctivitis due to adenovirus
type 8 was reported at a military teaching hospital.
1988 to 1989 - An outbreak (2603 cases) of acute conjunctivitis at an
American air base in the Philippines was caused by adenovirus types 19 and
8, as well as enteroviruses.
1997 - An outbreak (541 cases of adenovirus type 7 and 132 of adenovirus
type 3) was reported at the Great Lakes Naval Recruiting facility in Illinois.
1997 - An outbreak (146 cases) occurred among students at a job training
facility in South Dakota - this was the 1st non-military outbreak reported
in the United States.
1997 - An outbreak (1000 or more hospitalized) of adenovirus type 4
infection was reported from an army basic training center in South Carolina.
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_
-----------------------
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ was 1st isolated from American military personnel
in 1944.
- At the time, the organism was estimated to account for 68 per cent of
"atypical pneumonias" among recruits.
- As many as 57 per cent of recruits had evidence of acute infection, and
up to 56 per cent of pneumonia among recruits during the 1960's to 1990's
was ascribed to this organism.
Notable outbreaks:
1966 (publication year) - An outbreak was reported aboard a nuclear submarine.

the outbreak in Malaysia is awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
