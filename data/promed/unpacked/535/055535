An outbreak was investigated by Argentina health officials in the Department of Diamante, Entre Rios province, where workers of a meatpacking plant demonstrated symptoms of headache, myalgia, fever and cough.

Q fever, caused by _Coxiella burnetii_ bacteria, was reported in 11 people; 10 required hospitalization. The predominant symptoms were headache (64%), myalgia (64%), fever (55%) and cough (37%). Four (36%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. All [improved] after receiving antibiotic treatment with different therapeutic schemes: ampicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam and doxycycline.

Direct contact with animal tissues and fluids could have been the cause, [linked to] poor use of personal protection equipment and insufficient ventilation of some sectors of work, and conditions of moisture and potential areas where fluids could collect. Environmental and building adaptations were carried out, [and] the correct use of personal protective equipment [advised/implemented?].

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_ which is found worldwide. The bacteria naturally infect some animals, such as goats, sheep and cattle. _C. burnetii_ bacteria are found in birth products (that is, placenta, amniotic fluid), urine, feces, and milk of infected animals. People can get infected by breathing in dust that has been contaminated by infected animal feces, urine, milk, and birth products. Some people never get sick; however, those who do usually develop flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, fatigue, and muscle pain.

A [Q fever] warning was issued yesterday [10 Feb 2022] by the Entre Ríos Ministry of Health after the contagion of 11 workers from a refrigeration plant in the city of Diamante, Entre Ríos, who were hospitalized and recovered favorably after receiving antibiotic treatment.

Elidelmar Otman, a journalist with LRA42 Gualeguaychú, said that this is the first time that the province has detected this disease and that the outbreak, which occurred in November [2021], was contained and controlled and did not generate consequences for meat consumers.

The authorities of the provincial Ministry of Health determined that the disease began to develop after direct contact with animal tissues and fluids, in addition to the "poor use of personal protection equipment and insufficient ventilation in some work sectors". In addition, humidity and areas where fluids could accumulate also influenced the spread of this disease, taking into account that all the affected people work in the same beef and pork slaughter area.

The diagnosis of Q fever was confirmed by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (INEI) of the ANLIS Malbrán Institute, and the journalist was given details of the changes in the protocols implemented from this situation in that refrigeration plant.

Q fever is an infectious, zoonotic and highly contagious disease present in several countries of the world, whose prevalence in Argentina is unknown, and rural workers, veterinarians and ranchers are the main populations at risk.

Q fever is an infection caused by _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.

Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta. Q fever occurs worldwide, with the exception of New Zealand (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/1/01-0305_article).

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ are asymptomatic (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Most people with acute Q fever infection recover, but others may develop chronic infection that includes endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), chronic hepatitis, chronic vascular infections (especially in patients with vascular grafts or arterial aneurysms), osteomyelitis, osteoarthritis, or chronic lung infection. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage and chronic infection. Chronic Q fever is rare, occurring in less than 5% of persons with acute infection, occurring within a few months to decades after the initial symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. Post-Q fever fatigue syndrome has been reported in up to 20% of patients with acute Q fever.

Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures or working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downwind from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

A Q fever outbreak occurred in Canadian and US travelers to Germany, where they received live sheep cell therapy in 2014 by the same German physician. (See the following ProMED posts in the See Also section below: Q fever - Germany: (RP) sheep cell therapy 2014 20170416.4974554, Q fever - USA, Canada: ex Germany (RP) sheep cell therapy 2014 20151002.3684869, Q fever - Canada (02): ex Germany (RP) sheep cell therapy 20141014.2863025, and Q fever - Germany: (RP) sheep cell therapy, 2014 20170416.4974554.)

Live cell therapy, not available in the United States, involves injecting processed cells from organs or fetuses of nonhuman animals (for example, sheep) into human recipients to treat a variety of health conditions. At the time of the Q fever outbreak in the Canadian and US recipients of live sheep cell therapy in 2014, an outbreak of human Q fever was being investigated by German authorities associated with a sheep flock that was used for production of fetal sheep cell injections by the German physician.

Acute Q fever is treated with doxycycline in non-pregnant people for 2-3 weeks. Because early doxycycline treatment (within the first 3 days of symptoms) is most effective, treatment of a symptomatic patient suspected of having Q fever should be based on clinical findings and should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6203a1.htm). Alternative drugs include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or a fluoroquinolone. Chronic Q fever -- for example, endocarditis or vascular infection, is treated with a combination of doxycycline plus hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414865). Treatment of Q fever endocarditis may also involve valve surgery.

In Australia, immunization is recommended for high-risk occupational groups, such as abattoir workers, farmers, stockyard workers, shearers, animal transporters, and others exposed to cattle, camels, sheep, goats and kangaroos or their products (including products of conception), veterinarians, veterinary nurses, veterinary students, professional dog and cat breeders, agricultural college staff and students, wildlife and zoo workers (working with high-risk animals) and laboratory personnel handling veterinary specimens or working with the organism; workers at pig abattoirs do not require Q fever vaccination (https://immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au/vaccination-for-special-risk-groups/vaccination-for-people-at-occupational-risk). However, there is a risk of severe local reactions to the vaccine in those people previously exposed to Q fever or Q fever vaccine. To assess prior exposure, prevaccination serologic screening is necessary. Any positive result on screening precludes Q fever vaccination (https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/infectious-diseases/disease-information-advice/q-fever). Immunity following vaccination is long-lasting. Revaccination is not indicated due to the possibility of severe hypersensitivity reactions. Q fever vaccination is not available in the United States.

Entre Ríos is one of the 23 provinces of Argentina, bordering the provinces of Buenos Aires (south), Corrientes (north) and Santa Fe (west), and Uruguay in the east; its capital is Paraná (250 000 inhabitants) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entre_R%C3%ADos_Province). A map showing the location of Diamante, a city (population of about 20 000 in 2010) on the western edge of the department of Diamante in the province of Entre Ríos, can be found at <www.google.com/maps/place/Diamante,+Entre+Rios,+Argentina>. - Mod.ML
