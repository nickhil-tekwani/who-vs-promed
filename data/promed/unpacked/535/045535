Increase in cases of visceral leishmaniasis, Campo Grande
-------------------------------------------------------------------
From January [2015] until [20 Oct 2015], there were 181 confirmed cases and 8 deaths. Deaths were in Campo Grande (2), Corumba (4), Jardim (1), and Ladario (1) [Mato Grosso do Sul state].

In 2014, there were 181 cases with 11 deaths recorded in Aquidauana (1), Campo Grande (6), Corumba (3) and Sao Gabriel do Oeste (1) [Mato Grosso do Sul state].

In July [2015], a study showed that Campo Grande, with 55 cases, was among the 4 cities in the country with the highest number of cases of leishmaniasis in humans. The number is considered worrisome and was reported in the PhD animal science lecture of Francisco Anilton Araujo held at UFMS (Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul) during the National Week for Combating Visceral Leishmaniasis.

[The study mentioned is Druzian AF et al. (Risk Factors for Death from Visceral Leishmaniasis in an Urban Area of Brazil. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Aug 14;9(8):e0003982). The main findings were that 36.6 percent of the patients were co-infected with HIV/AIDS, and the mortality rate was 21.6 percent. In a multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with death were secondary bacterial infection (42.86, 5.05-363.85), relapse (12.17, 2.06-71.99), edema (7.74, 1.33-45.05) and HIV/AIDS co-infection (7.33, 1.22-43.98).

It is well known that treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients is very difficult, and some studies suggest that it cannot be cured, so that lifelong treatment is necessary (Bourgeois N et al. Active chronic visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-1-infected patients demonstrated by biological and clinical long-term follow-up of 10 patients. HIV Med. 2010;11:670-3).

Thus, data on the number of patients with visceral leishmaniasis can only be interpreted if the proportion HIV positives are known. - Mod.EP
