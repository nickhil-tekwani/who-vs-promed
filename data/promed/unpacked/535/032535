Schmallenberg virus in Greece
-----------------------------
In the ProMED-mail posting 'Schmallenberg virus - Europe (33): Greece, bovine, caprine, 1st rep' you indicate that this is the 1st report of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) presence in Greece. This is not the case as the paper 'Evidence of Schmallenberg virus circulation in ruminants in Greece' [see reference below] has already described the presence of SBV in this country.

[Thanks to Dr Zientara for bringing the Epub ahead of print short communication (accepted 3 Jul 2013) above to our attention. The text is available at http://tinyurl.com/m6le55f. The abstract says:

"During March 2013, we investigated the presence and the levels of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) circulation in 3 dairy cow herds and 3 sheep flocks in Central Macedonia, Greece. In 2 cow herds, a high number of abortions had been observed during the winter. 6 bulk-tank milk samples and 147 individual sera were screened for SBV-specific antibodies by ELISA. Positive reactions were obtained from 5 out of 6 bulk-tank milk samples, 58 out of 90 sera from the 3 cowherds, and 2 sera from 2 of the 3 sheep flocks. 22 ELISA-positive sera were tested by serum neutralization test (SNT). SNT confirmed the presence of neutralizing antibodies against SBV in all samples tested, with titers ranging between 1:32 and 1:256. No neutralizing antibodies against Akabane virus (AKAV) or Shamonda virus (SHAV) were detected, indicating that neutralizing antibodies against SBV do not cross react with AKAV or SHAV in SNT. ELISA testing of bulk-tank milk samples proved to be convenient and reliable. None of the tested sera was found positive for SBV by real-time RT-PCR, indicating that the sampling was conducted past the viremia stage. This is the 1st report of SBV circulation in Greece."

In fact, 1st case of an emerging infectious disease (which may have impact upon internationally traded animals!), should preferably be immediately and officially reported to the OIE by the affected country. National veterinary services, worldwide, should be able to obtain such information directly, not compelled to search in the scientific literature.

Greece's neighbour, Turkey, is another example: information included in a scientific paper on SBV in Anatolia is still to be officially confirmed (abstract at http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11250-013-0415-2 and ProMED-mail post 20130510.1704469).

At present, 25 European countries (including Greece) are regarded as SBV-infected; 20 of them (excluding Greece) submitted official information to the OIE, either immediately upon diagnosis (9 countries, notifications distributed by the OIE), or by other, slower procedures (11 countries). Greece and another 4 European countries (details in the commentary to ProMED-mail post 20130920.1957844) remain, so far, in the status of "suspected" though the scientific evidence is complete. Anatolia (western Turkey) if/when added, will become the 1st SBV-affected territory outside of Europe.

In the absence of official notifications, submissions by scientists, such as the current one and that submitted on 19 Sep 2013 (on cattle and goats in Greece, included in ProMED-mail posting 20130920.1957844), are warmly and gratefully welcomed; the earlier, the better.

Official confirmation from Greece is pending. - Mod.AS
