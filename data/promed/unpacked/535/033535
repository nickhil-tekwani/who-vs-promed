EBOLA VIRUS, GENETIC VS ANTIGENIC STABILITY
===========================================

I'm a bit confused here. Karl Johnson says the Ebola virus is stable,
therefore only the Yambuku and Kikwit pattern of viral outbreak is to be
feared -- but coincidentally we have another participant, Jim Pacelli
<kaser@mail.caribsurf.com> who asked:
"Why is it believed that Ebola virus is *antigenically* stable? Although it
doesn't contain the segmented genome of such as influenzaviruses, the error-
prone polymerases still would seem to make the virus subject to any one of a
number of potentially deleterious mutations." Now the answer from the
moderator takes care of the "potentially deleterious mutations" aspect of
the question but raises further questions.
For instance "Mod CHC" responded by saying that : "I do not recall anyone
saying that Ebola virus is *antigenically* stable." With the following
caveat: "Those that have been obtained from humans in specific locations
over time have been shown to be remarkably similar *genetically*." But
"...no one has done a comprehensive study of the *antigenicity* of these
viruses." And finally we are told that "We may be talking only of a matter
of selection of certain genotypes (found in the human samples obtained
during outbreaks) in regard to stability. Other, apocalyptic strains, may
be out there in all their instability."
Now, I would like to know which train of thought to follow here. Do we
have a stable virus (Johnson), or a virus strain accidentally and randomly
capable of infecting humans and other (primate) hosts, with potentially
more devastating "relatives" upon which humans have not yet stumbled (Mod
CHC)? In either case, as far as I can make out, increased human incursion
and disruption of the environment are the only known risk factor for
acquiring Ebola (and in those terms I don't see much difference, except one
of scale, between ADFL rebel military operations in the bush and the
activities of the charcoal maker index case in the Kikwit outbreak).
Therefore, unless other (for the moment unknown) variables are the true
critical triggers of index cases, isn't Zaire a country looking for another
Ebola epidemic?

[Karl Johnson means that Ebola-Zaire hasn't changed *genetically* in 20+
years, so not to worry about it mutating to become airborne. But Charlie
Calisher told me he means that we already have Ebola-Zaire, Ebola-Gabon,
Ebola-Tai; there are probably other *antigenic* variants of Ebola out there
in central Africa, with possibly differing lethalities, and who knows which
of them -- or others as yet unknown -- marauding troops will pick up? -

hantavirus research, so don't expect to hear from him for a week. Karl,
your turn - Mod.JW]
