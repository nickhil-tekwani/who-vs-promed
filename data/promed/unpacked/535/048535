Further to the recent ProMED-mail post Theileria, bovine - Australia (03): (VI) 20151204.3839037 and the moderator's accompanying comments, ProMED readers may be interest in reading the articles in:
Vol 64 (1) 2016 of the New Zealand Veterinary Journal [NZVJ] which is devoted to highlighting some of the significant work carried out by veterinarians, laboratory scientists and veterinary parasitologists responding to the emergence of bovine anaemia associated with _Theileria orientalis_ infection (TABA) in New Zealand.

This special issue of the NZVJ is openly accessible until the end of January [2016] at http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tnzv20/64/1.
