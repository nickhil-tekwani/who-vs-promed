USGS Surveillance Update, as of Wed 2 Jul 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the USGS reflect information
for the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season that has been submitted
and verified to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
up to Wed 2 Jul 2003.
The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are
created from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance database.
The maps portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive surveillance
data reported to the CDC by cooperating health departments and
verified to ArboNET. In addition, maps for 2 surveillance categories
(avians and mosquitoes) will portray counties that have done
"testing" of samples for West Nile virus.
Discrepancies noted between these data and data presented from other
sources reflect local variations in reporting policies and
procedures. It is not unusual for cases to be announced in other
media before being reported and verified in ArboNET.
The following information is a synopsis of the results of West Nile
virus surveillance listed according to state. The original USGS maps
further locate both positive and negative surveillance reports by
county. (The data are provisional and may be subject to revision.)
Birds
-----
34 states are conducting surveillance with 24 states reporting
cumulative positive test results as follows: Alabama (12), Colorado
(4), Florida (5), Georgia (9), Illinois (2), Indiana (3) Iowa (4),
Kansas (0), Kentucky (0), Louisiana (38), Michigan (7), Minnesota
(1), Mississippi (3), Missouri (4), Nebraska (7), Nevada (0), New
Hampshire (0), New Jersey (1), New York (1), North Carolina (3),
North Dakota (5), Ohio (5), Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), South
Carolina (3), South Dakota (0), Tennessee (4), Texas (7), Utah (0),
Vermont (0), Virginia (7), Washington (0), Wisconsin (0), Wyoming (1).
[Note that many states do not continue reporting wild bird results
after confirmation of the first positive tests in any particular
county; therefore the above figures allow relative rather than
absolute comparisons. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes
----------
17 states are now conducting surveillance, with 7 states reporting
cumulative positive results as follows: Colorado (1), Connecticut
(0), Georgia (2), Indiana (2), Kansas (1), Kentucky (0), Michigan
(12), New Hampshire (0), New Jersey (1), Nevada (0), North Carolina
(0), Pennsylvania (0), South Carolina (0), South Dakota (0), Texas
(16), Utah (0), Virginia (0).
Sentinel Flocks
---------------
3 states are conducting surveillance, with all 3 reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Florida (38), North Carolina (1),
South Dakota (9).
Veterinary
----------
10 states are conducting surveillance and all 10 are reporting
cumulative positive test results [presumed to be equines] as follows:
Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Georgia (1), Kentucky (2), Missouri (1),
Minnesota (3), North Dakota (1), Texas (4), Wisconsin (1), Wyoming
(3).
Human
-----
There are no confirmed reports of surveillance activity or positive
test results from any state. [A suspected case of human infection in
Washington state (see: West Nile virus, human - USA (Washington):
suspected 20030601.1334) has not been confirmed. Another suspected
case was reported from South Carolina on 15 Jun 2003 and confirmation
is still pending (see: West Nile virus, human - USA (SC)
20030615.1480). - Mod.CP]

[Since the previous report dated 25 Jun 2003 the number of states
carrying out surveillance of wild birds has increased by 5 to 34 (the
5 being Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada, Vermont, and Wisconsin). West Nile
virus-positive birds have been reported from 24 states, with a
positive test result reported from Minnesota for the first time. The
number of states reporting West Nile virus-positive equines remains
at 10. 7 of the 17 states now conducting surveillance of mosquitoes
have reported West Nile virus-positive results (Kansas and Michigan
for the first time). The number of states reporting surveillance of
sentinel flocks remains at 3, with all 3 states reporting positive
results. No human cases of West Nile virus infection have been
confirmed anywhere in the United States; confirmation of a suspected
case in South Carolina is still awaited. - Mod.CP]
