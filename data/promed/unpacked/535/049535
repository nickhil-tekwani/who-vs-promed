The Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) at Cefas [Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science] are investigating an outbreak of Koi herpesvirus at a fishery near Tunbridge Wells, East Sussex.

Initial controls have been placed on the affected site to prevent further spread of this disease and the FHI are currently assessing the extent of the outbreak and the options available for the control of the disease.

Details of the affected site will become public information when a confirmed designation is issued and this will be published through http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) disease has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. Like other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it.

More information on KHD is found in the OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
