First suspected human case of West Nile virus infection this season
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TRENTON: A 72 year old Bergenfield woman has tested positive for the
presence of West Nile virus (WNV). Testing on serum and spinal fluid
specimens completed today by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior
Services laboratories were consistent with the diagnosis of WNV infection.
Final confirmation of this case will be made by the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within a few weeks. Prior to today's
results, the virus had only been detected in New Jersey this year in
mosquitoes, crows and sentinel chickens.
The patient was admitted to Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck at the end of
July with symptoms consistent with WNV infection, including a fever greater
than 100 degrees [Fahrenheit, muscle weakness, and malaise. Her mental
status has improved, but she still has weak legs and is receiving
rehabilitative therapy. "This finding reminds us that while most people
exposed to West Nile virus may experience no or only mild symptoms, for
some people -- particularly the elderly -- West Nile virus infection can
result in serious illness," said acting heath and senior services
commissioner George T DiFerdinando Jr, MD.
This year, the virus has been detected in birds and/or mosquitoes in every
New Jersey county. In total, 647 crows and 193 mosquito pools collected
from across the state have tested positive for the presence of WNV this
season. In 2000, testing confirmed the presence of WNV in 6 state
residents, and numerous birds, mosquitoes, and horses. State epidemiologist
and assistant commissioner Eddy Bresnitz, MD, said the state's first
confirmed [? human case of the season "underscores the importance of our
statewide surveillance and mosquito control activities, and the key role
physicians play in recognizing and reporting suspected cases of West Nile
virus infection to public health officials."
