The Swiss Federal Health Office has decided not to ban people living in
Britain between 1980 and 1986 from giving blood, Swiss Radio International
reported Sunday.
The decision came despite claims a ban could help control the spread of new
variant -Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (nv-CJD), which is the human variant of
BSE, (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) commonly known as mad cow disease,
a fatal brain disorder in cattle. It is thought humans can contract nv-CJD
by eating contaminated beef, although this has never been formally proven.
The Swiss health authorities believed existing blood filtration systems had
provided sufficient protection for patients, adding a ban on donations from
former British residents is unnecessary.
It admitted, however, this method does not provide a 100 percent guarantee
that blood products are safe, saying this would require a new test capable
of detecting the infectious agents which cause BSE and nv-CJD.
As a further precaution, donors will be asked if there have been cases of
CJD within their families, and to state whether they have undergone corneal
implants.
Britain was badly hit by the BSE epidemic. As a result, the United States
and Canada have imposed bans on blood donations from people who were living
in Britain when the disease was at its height.
Although they hope these precautions will help limit the spread of nv-CJD,
experts admit the benefits of such bans are impossible to quantify as it is
not yet known whether the disease can actually be transmitted through blood
products.
