Bats in Africa have been found to carry henipaviruses, which can spread to other animals and humans, and [cause] a disease that is similar to rabies, researchers say. A population of fruit bats common across 2800 miles of central Africa has been found to harbor the viruses, a joint study by the University of Cambridge and the Zoological Society of London found.

34 per cent of African straw-colored fruit bats, which can live in groups of more than one million and often congregate near cities, were found to be infected with Lagos bat virus, a disease similar to rabies, while 42 per cent had been infected with henipaviruses, the researchers reported in the journal Nature Communications [see below]. Fruit bats are often hunted for meat, which can result in a spread of these pathogens from animals to humans, the researchers said.

Henipaviruses have caused fatal disease in humans, pigs and horses in Southeast Asia and Australia, they said. "In Australia ... the virus has spread into horses, and from horses, this virus has passed into vets tending sick horses, and this has killed a number of people in Australia," Cambridge epidemiologist James Wood told the BBC. "In Malaysia, there was a huge outbreak associated with pigs in 1999 in which more than 100 pig farmers and slaughter house workers died."

But [there] was no evidence yet that either of the 2 viruses found in the bats had spread to humans in Africa, he said. "I think that it's no immediate cause for panic; these viruses have probably been there for a very long time in bats. But I think that it does raise questions relating to public health surveillance and care that should be taken to avoid possible contact that might result in transmission," he said.

Continent-wide panmixia of an African fruit bat facilitates transmission of potentially zoonotic viruses. (By: Alison J. Peel, and 13 others)

Abstract
--------
The straw-coloured fruit bat, _Eidolon helvum_, is Africa's most widely distributed and commonly hunted fruit bat, often living in close proximity to human populations. This species has been identified as a reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses, but uncertainties remain regarding viral transmission dynamics and mechanisms of persistence.

Here, we combine genetic and serological analyses of populations across Africa to determine the extent of epidemiological connectivity among _E. helvum_ populations. Multiple markers reveal panmixia across the continental range at a greater geographical scale than previously recorded for any other mammal, whereas populations on remote islands were genetically distinct. Multiple serological assays reveal antibodies to henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus in all locations, including small isolated island populations, indicating that factors other than population size and connectivity may be responsible for viral persistence. Our findings have potentially important public health implications and highlight a need to avoid disturbances that may precipitate viral spillover.

[Bats, which represent about 24 per cent of all known mammalian species, frequently act as vectors of lyssaviruses. In particular, insectivorous bats play an important role in the epidemiology of rabies and some rabies-like viruses, while the haematophagous vampire bats are the major wildlife vector for rabies in Latin America. In contrast, the role of fruit bats (flying foxes) in the epidemiology of the Australian bat lyssavirus is only just emerging. Information on the pathogenesis of lyssaviruses in bats is scarce.

Lagos bat virus is a lyssavirus of southern and central Africa that causes a rabies-like illness in mammals. It was 1st isolated from a fruit bat from Lagos Island, Nigeria in 1956.

Henipavirus is a genus of the family _Paramyxoviridae_, order _Mononegavirales_ containing 3 established species: Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Cedar Virus. The henipaviruses are naturally harboured by Pteropid fruit bats (flying foxes) and some microbat species. Henipavirus is characterised by a large genome, a wide host range, and their recent emergence as zoonotic pathogens capable of causing illness and death in domestic animals and humans.

The finding of these novel, putative Henipaviruses outside Australia and Asia indicates that the region of potential endemicity of Henipaviruses extends to Africa. - Mod.CP
