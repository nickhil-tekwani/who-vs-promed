Japan will cull about 20 000 chickens at a farm in the western
prefecture of Shimane after the country's 1st case of avian influenza
since 2009 was discovered by the government today [30 Nov 2010].

The government has asked the farm operator, which also raises about
3300 chicks, not to move the birds out of the area to contain the
disease, Yuji Kawakami at Shimane Prefecture's livestock office said
today by phone. The owner of the egg-laying chicken farm in Yasugi
city found 5 dead birds yesterday [29 Nov 2010], he said.

The government has asked farms within a radius of 10 km [6.2 mi] from
the Yasugi farm not to move birds, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

"Preventing the spread of bird flu is important from the standpoint
of crisis management," chief cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku told
reporters in Tokyo today [30 Nov 2010].

Japan raised a total of 178 million egg-laying chickens and 107
million broilers as of 1 Feb 2009, the latest data from the ministry
show. A broiler is a commercial-grade young chicken typically 7 weeks
old at the time it is killed, the most common type of chicken
available in supermarkets.
