Given the topic it may be worthwhile visiting the following site for more
detailed information detailing the administration of Human Pituitary Derived
Hormones in Australia.
http://www.cjdsupport.org.au/contents.htm
This is an ongoing saga which has yet to be resolved. The site is also cross
referenced to the Australian Parliament which has completed a second inquiry.
If any memebers wish more information they should feel free to contact Gina
[? for more information. I hope the information adds to the understanding
of the problems that are being faced by recipients of the hormone and their
families.
The other issue that may promote some discussion relates to Lyodura TM and its
link to CJD.
