[A] China from the NY Times 5 Apr 2003
<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/05/science/
sciencespecial/05CHIN.html>
More than 50 cases of a mysterious respiratory illness have now been
identified in the Chinese capital, health workers here say. The cases are
all being treated at You'An Hospital, an infectious disease hospital in
central Beijing. It is not clear whether the cases represent people who
have fallen ill since 31 Mar 2003 or, as is more likely, involve at least
some people previously hospitalized with conditions that had not been
classified as the illness, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
[B] Singapore - from Newsday 5 Apr 2003
<http://www.newsday.com/news/health/wire/sns-ap-mystery-
illness-asia,0,5329545.story?coll=sns-ap-health-headlines>
Singapore's economic losses for the first month of the outbreak could total
an estimated $286 million & could hit $2.3 billion if the outbreak continues
for 3 months, Standard Chartered Bank economist Joseph Tan was quoted
in the Straits Times newspaper.

[According to today's WHO update:
"... a cumulative total of 2416 SARS cases and 89 deaths have been reported
from 18 countries. This represents an increase of 63 cases and 5 deaths
compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Hong Kong SAR (3), Malaysia
(1), and Singapore (1). The death reported by Malaysia represents the first
case reported in that country. New cases were reported in Canada (5), Hong
Kong SAR (39), Taiwan, China (2), Singapore (1), the United Kingdom (1), and
the United States of America (15). One of the 2 probable cases reported in
Switzerland was removed from the list."
Additional information from the NY Times newswires and other sources
suggests that there may be more cases of SARS occurring in Beijing. Caution
should be taken in interpreting these reports as the reports to WHO (with
the exception of the data from the USA) are reports on probable cases and
not on suspected cases. Hence, hearsay reports of additional suspected
cases require prudence and patience for more information -- as we have
already observed, some suspected cases are later ruled out as due to other
causes.
The Chinese Ministry of Health has apologized publicly for not releasing
information on this outbreak sooner. They are now reporting probable cases
daily to the WHO. It seems counter-productive to continue a line of
criticism and innuendo about failings of one or more governments in
reporting, as they are trying to deal with an outbreak of significant
magnitude & as yet unknown etiology both domestically and internationally,
that in addition to the health consequences has significant economic
consequences in the involved areas, as demonstrated in the second newswire
brief from Singapore presented above. - Mod.MPP]
[To place these figures in perspective, China (including Hong Kong) has now
reported 69 deaths in 4.5 months. In 122 cities in the USA, with a total
population much less than one quarter of China's population, there have now
been 890 deaths from pneumonia + influenza reported in the 3 months ending
29 Mar 2003 -- see: <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5213md.htm>
