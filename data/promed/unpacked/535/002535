An anthrax outbreak occurred last week [around 6 Jun 2012] and involved 10 dead white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) on a newly purchased ranch 25 miles north of Uvalde, Texas on Highway 55 (to Rocksprings). There was one freshly dead deer when the veterinarian visited the ranch, and this was the one he sampled and sent to College Station for confirmation, information of which was released this morning [14 Jun 2012]. The ranch carries white-tails and some exotics, all behind an 8-foot fence. There are no livestock. The size of this deer ranch is unavailable.

The 10 deer are said to have died over a "2-day" interval. This tells me that there are already other prior cases in that general area that either no one is talking about (not unusual), or they have yet to get out and check their stock and watch the vultures. That "10" were affected essentially at once would confirm fly activity, because in dry years, it is usually just single or double deaths and no follow on. The flies feed on an index case, and then with contaminated mouthparts feed on others nearby. From the nature of commercial deer ranching in Texas, the deer density is high, as they are frequently fed with cracked corn at multiple feeding stations, so the female flies do not have trouble finding another deer to feed upon.

The new owner had been moving dirt, as new owners are wont to do, and it is theoretically possible he had disturbed an old anthrax grave, which, with the recent 4 to 6 inches of rain, the turned soil could have sprouted some tasty grazing for the deer. Though normally browsers, deer will graze. Outbreaks based on grazing usually start with a single affected animal from which the infection spreads. Ten "at once" is not likely to be from grazing. But maybe we don't have the full story.

Because of the increase in rainfall in early May 2012 in the area bounded by Interstate 10 and Interstate 90, essentially between Uvalde and Sonora, [see: http://www.srcc.lsu.edu/stations/index.php?action=metadata&network_station_id=417706], we had been warning the local deer ranchers of the risk from a sudden tabanid hatch and resulting anthrax outbreaks involving numbers of animals. Latterly, they have been reporting a lot of flies in the area. Unfortunately, we seem to have been correct in our prediction. We expect a not inactive summer in this part of Texas, where wildlife anthrax is enzootic.
