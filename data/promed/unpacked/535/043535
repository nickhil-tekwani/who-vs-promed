The Superintendency of Epidemiology of Minas Gerais state reports that as
of 20 Feb 2003 there have been 42 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the
Serro region: 23 suspect cases are under investigation, 16 deaths have been
repoprted & 6 more are under investigation.
Although YF vaccination only becomes protective after 10 days, and less
than 10 days remain before Carnaval begins on 1 Mar 2003, free vaccination
will still continue to be available at the more than 3000 vaccination posts
in the state. Everyone who lives in, or travels to Minas Gerais state
should get themselves vaccinated. The basins of the rivers Paranaiba,
Grande & Sao Francisco are considered to be areas at risk. The outbreak is
moving towards the Rio Doce basin, which includes a large part of the
state. The Secretary of Tourism is informing tourists through travel &
ticket agents of the risk of YF and the need for vaccination .

earlier -- see ref. (08) below. The health authorities are to be
congratulated on making a huge effort to contain the outbreak through
vaccination. - Mod.JW]
