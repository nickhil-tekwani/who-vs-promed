Link found between Toronto's 2 clusters
-------------------------
Toronto doctors said yesterday they had established a link between 2 SARS
clusters, which could help ease the World Health Organisation's (WHO)
concerns about how the city is containing the disease.
Health officials said they had probably worked out how the SARS virus
infected a 96-year-old man who died on 1 May 2003 and is believed to have
caused Toronto's second outbreak late last month [May]. The man fell ill
after hip surgery but his symptoms went undetected for weeks.
Dr Barbara Yaffe, associate medical officer of health for Toronto, said the
elderly man caught SARS from a nurse on his floor at North York General
Hospital. The nurse had contracted SARS from her mother, who had been at
suburban Scarborough Grace Hospital where the city's first outbreak surfaced
in March after the virus was brought in from Hong Kong.
Finding a link between the 2 affected hospitals was a crucial part of the
city's battle against the virus, which has killed 33 people in and around
Toronto in 3 months. News of the link came just hours after the WHO decided
against issuing a 2nd travel advisory for the city.

How SARS experts untangled the threads of the second outbreak
Health Canada, CDC link cases
North York nurse thought to be key
SARS II likely came from SARS I.
--------------------------
Researchers trying to figure out the origin of the SARS II outbreak at North
York General Hospital in April 2003 believe the missing link is a patient at
Scarborough Grace Hospital, where Toronto's first outbreak began in March
2003.
The patient got SARS at Grace Hospital, passed it to her daughter, who is a
nurse at North York General. The theory is that the nurse somehow infected a
96-year-old patient at North York Hospital, and the disease spread rapidly
from there. Investigators are still not sure how the virus would have passed
to the elderly man since he was not one of her patients.
The link was made by a team of researchers that included the Centers for
Disease Control in Atlanta and Health Canada. "As pieces come together, this
looks very likely," said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, an associate medical officer of
health at Toronto Public Health.
The link between SARS I and SARS II is heartening news for Toronto, which has
been criticized by the World Health Organization for not being able to trace
some of the cases. Knowing how everybody with the disease contracted it is
vital to managing, and eventually stopping, an outbreak.
This is what happened to cause the North York outbreak, according to
interviews with investigating doctors, medical research papers, and nurses
and doctors at North York General.
Toronto's first SARS outbreak began on 7 Mar 2003. The son of a woman who had
contracted the disease in Hong Kong went to Scarborough Grace Hospital with a
respiratory illness.
The son's pneumonia-like infection, and those of others in his family, were
initially dismissed as tuberculosis by Grace doctors and Toronto Public
Health officials. By 14 Mar 2003, they knew it was SARS.
SARS spread through Grace Hospital over the next few weeks. Among the
hospital wards affected was the coronary care unit. A female patient there
(age unknown) got sick, possibly getting SARS from a fellow heart patient, a
man. That male patient, a so-called super spreader, was then transferred to
York Central Hospital on 16 March 2003, causing an outbreak there.
Meanwhile, the female patient was ill at Grace Hospital. Chest X-rays showed
a SARS-like infection, but she was not diagnosed at the time. She was
discharged from hospital on 17 Mar 2003. The woman lived with her daughter, a
senior nurse who worked on the eighth floor of North York General Hospital.
That floor is now known as the SARS ward, but in March it cared for patients
recovering from other problems, such as injuries.
Blood tests returned to Toronto Public Health last week confirm the elderly
woman had the SARS coronavirus. She was suffering from a mild case of the
virus when she passed it on to her daughter in late March. On 30 March 2003,
the nurse developed a fever and felt lethargic. She went home early from
work. She did not know she had SARS.
Also on the 8th floor at the time was a 96-year-old man who had fractured his
pelvis. The man went to North York General Hospital emergency unit and was
transferred to the nurse's floor.
Researchers believe the 96-year-old man somehow contracted SARS from the
nurse, but they say there is "no obvious link" because she was not caring for
him. The nurse also infected 3 fellow nurses, likely in a lunchroom. On 6 Apr
2003 the nurse was admitted to hospital and her SARS case was reported to
Toronto Public Health.
The 96-year-old man first developed his SARS symptoms on 4 Apr 2003, not 19
April as researchers initially thought. His first bout in early April was
calmed by antibiotics. On 19 Apr 2003 the disease resurfaced. The 4 nurses
became the first patients of a new SARS ward on the 8th floor of North York
General Hospital. But nobody [caught on] to the fact that the 96-year-old man
was developing SARS. To make room for the new SARS unit, the 96-year-old man
was transferred down to the 4th-floor orthopedic ward on 2 Apr 2003. He
infected almost a dozen nurses on that floor.
At the same time, 3 patients (2 women and a man) on the 7th-floor psychiatric
ward contracted the disease in mid-April. Health officials don't know how the
psychiatric patients got SARS. One theory is the male psychiatric patient may
have visited another hospital that had SARS. [It must be hard to get a
reliable history from a psychiatric patient. - Mod.JW]
As April progressed, SARS spread rapidly through North York General Hospital,
helped by increasingly lax mask and gown precautions among some doctors and
nurses. By early May 2003, when the province told hospitals to relax their
precautions, many more health-care workers were contracting the disease.
Despite nurses raising the alarm at the hospital and despite the fact that
4 members of the 96-year-old man's family were visibly sick with SARS,
the disease went unchecked until 23 May 2003.
In the tale of 2 hospitals -- York Central and North York -- York Central
Hospital was the one that responded quickly to the transmission from Grace
Hospital, the epicentre of Toronto's original outbreak. The doors at York
Central Hospital were closed and tight precautions taken when the hospital
realized that it had imported SARS from North York General Hospital.
The York Central Hospital outbreak was contained. Out of 16 SARS cases, 2
died, including the SARS patient transferred from Scarborough Grace Hospital.
York Central started reopening on 19 Apr 2003, when the disease was spreading
unchecked through North York General Hospital. Hospital president Dr. Richard
Schabas credited a strict infection control procedure and teamwork as tools
that defeated SARS at his hospital.
So, how was SARS allowed to fester at North York General Hospital? The cases
were dismissed as non-SARS despite what now appears to be overwhelming
evidence to the contrary. North York General Hospital's chief infectious
disease specialist Dr. Barbara Mederski has refused interview requests from
the Star. She was involved in the assessment of the SARS patients.
While North York General Hospital has declined to comment, the hospital has
sent a statement to its doctors and nurses, which reads: "This is a sensitive
issue for patients and their family, as well as our staff and physicians. At
this time we need to continue to support each other. The hospital will
continue to fully cooperate with the investigation. It is in the interest of
all us to advance the knowledge and prevention of SARS."
A Scarborough Grace Hospital spokesperson said last night the hospital
welcomes the investigation.
Throughout April and into May 2003, the 96-year-old man, his relatives, and
the psychiatric patients were assessed by a team of doctors, including public
health officials and Toronto microbiologists. But these patients were
dismissed as SARS cases because there was no link to a previous SARS case.
The 96-year-old man died 1 May 2003. His wife died later in May. The rest
recovered.
What is now clear is that the link was in the hospital, a nurse who had
been doing her job and inadvertently contracted the virus from her sick
mother. This fact was unearthed by CDC and Health Canada investigators who
did an audit of patient records and their contacts by computer this week. At
Toronto Public Health, the job has been more difficult. For most of the 2
outbreaks, they have sifted through paperwork by hand. "We've been fighting
a nineteenth century type of disease with nineteenth century technology,"
said one official.

A 52-year-old Nassau woman has become the first person suspected of
contracting SARS within New York State, health officials said Friday. The
health care worker is believed to have been exposed while overseeing a
patient hospitalized with possible SARS.
All of the other individuals in the state with a suspect or probable SARS
diagnosis are believed to have acquired it during travel to endemic regions,
such as China or Canada. There are 59 possible cases across the state,
including one in Suffolk County & 7 in Nassau County. All of the others on
Long Island are reported to have recovered.

[In North Carolina, it has become less likely that any local transmission of
SARS has occurred. The discovery of an apparent "missing link" between the
1st Toronto outbreak and the delayed 2nd outbreak is actually reassuring, in
that there is no need to invoke some undiscovered mechanism of transmission
or an unknown focus in the community -- although the source of the infection
in the psychiatric ward is unclear. More information is awaited on the Long
Island, NY case. - Mod.LM/JW]
