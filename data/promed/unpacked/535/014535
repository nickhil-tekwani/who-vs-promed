Association between adverse clinical outcome in human disease caused by novel influenza A H7N9 virus and sustained viral shedding and emergence of antiviral resistance (By HU Yunwen and others).

Summary
--------
Background: On 30 Mar 2013, a novel influenza A subtype H7N9 virus (A/H7N9) was detected in patients with severe respiratory disease in eastern China. Virological factors associated with a poor clinical outcome for this virus remain unclear. We quantified the viral load and analysed antiviral resistance mutations in specimens from patients with A/H7N9.

Methods: We studied 14 patients with A/H7N9 disease admitted to the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre (SPHCC), China between 4-20 Apr 2013 who had been given antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or peramivir) for less than 2 days before admission. We investigated the viral load in throat, stool, serum, and urine specimens obtained sequentially from these patients. We also sequenced viral RNA from these specimens to study the mutations associated with resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors and their association with disease outcome.

Findings: All patients developed pneumonia; 7 of them required mechanical ventilation, and 3 of them further deteriorated to become dependent on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 2 of whom died. Antiviral treatment was associated with a reduction of viral load in throat swab specimens in 11 surviving patients. Three patients with persistently high viral load in the throat in spite of antiviral therapy became ECMO dependent. An Arg292Lys mutation in the virus neuraminidase (NA) gene known to confer resistance to both zanamivir and oseltamivir was identified in 2 of these patients; both also received corticosteroid treatment. In one of them, wild-type sequence Arg292 was noted 2 days after start of antiviral treatment, and the resistant mutant Lys292 dominated 9 days after start of treatment.

Interpretation: Reduction of viral load following antiviral treatment correlated with improved outcome. Emergence of NA Arg292Lys mutation in 2 patients who also received corticosteroid treatment led to treatment failure and a poor clinical outcome. The emergence of antiviral resistance in A/H7N9 viruses is concerning, especially in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, and needs to be closely monitored and considered in pandemic preparedness planning.

[These findings are not entirely surprisingly and might be observed in treatment of any form of influenza where treatment involves use of the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir or peramivir. Even during brief exposure to neuraminidase inhibitors, as in treatment of seasonal epidemic influenza, there is an established risk of selecting resistance to these inhibitors, since a single amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase (H274Y) is sufficient to confer resistance. The problem is exacerbated in the case of treatment of A/(H7N9) virus infection because of the severity of the disease and the extended duration of exposure to the drug. It is not clear why corticosteroid treatment should be associated with emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor resistance other than that this may be a consequence of more serious disease and length of treatment. - Mod.CP
