The corkscrew bacterium, _Leptospira interrogans_, has never been detected in the Tasmanian devil, until now thanks to a PhD student from the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.

Doctoral student, Sarah Wynwood developed a technique for testing leptospirosis in humans and animals as part of her PhD study, which in turn resulted in detecting leptospirosis bacteria in Tasmanian devils for the 1st time [but not for the 1st time in Tasmanian wildlife] and isolated a strain of the disease never before seen in Australian wildlife.

Dr David McKay, who is supervising Wynwood's research at the university said, "Sarah's work opens up a range of interesting research possibilities which could lead to a better understanding of the disease in devils and also allow better methods of conservation," he said.

"Of particular interest would be defining just how virulent this unique type of the bacterium is in devils and whether there is any link between leptospirosis and the devil facial tumour disease that's causing a critical decline in devil populations."

Wynwood added, "As this is the 1st time leptospirosis has been seen in Tasmanian devils, and the 1st time this particular strain has been seen in any Australian wildlife, I believe it's clear there is still much more research to be done in this field."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease with a worldwide distribution caused by infection with any of several pathogenic serovars of _Leptospira_. The disease affects virtually all mammals and has a broad range of clinical effects, from mild, subclinical infection to multiple-organ failure and death.

Ms Wynwood recently presented her PhD paper at the Australian Mammal Society annual conference in Hobart, and submitted her final thesis on the topic late last month [August 2015].

[Marsupials have been found to harbour pathogenic _Leptospira_ sp. in South America and Australia. Serologic studies in Tasmanian wildlife found antibodies against the bacterium in potoroos, bandicoots, and wombats, and infection was confirmed in the latter. The finding reported here adds Tasmanian devil to the list of marsupials known to be infected by _Leptospira interrogans_. - Mod.PMB
