[Artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia
----------------------------------------
2 studies in this week's [30 Jul 2009] issue of New England Journal
of Medicine highlight the growing problem of resistance to
artemisinins in _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in Southeast Asia. - Mod.EP]

falciparum_ malaria. N Engl J Med 2009; 361: 455-67]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
----------
Artemisinin-based combination therapies are the recommended 1st-line
treatments of falciparum malaria in all countries with endemic
disease. There are recent concerns that the efficacy of such
therapies has declined on the Thai-Cambodian border, historically a
site of emerging antimalarial-drug resistance.

Methods
-------
In 2 open-label, randomized trials, we compared the efficacies of 2
treatments for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Pailin, western
Cambodia, and Wang Pha, northwestern Thailand: oral artesunate given
at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day, for 7 days,
and artesunate given at a dose of 4 mg per kilogram per day, for 3
days, followed by mefloquine at 2 doses totaling 25 mg per kilogram.
We assessed in vitro and in vivo _Plasmodium falciparum_
susceptibility, artesunate pharmacokinetics, and molecular markers of
resistance.

Results
-------
We studied 40 patients in each of the 2 locations. The overall median
parasite clearance times were 84 hours (interquartile range, 60 to
96) in Pailin and 48 hours (interquartile range, 36 to 66) in Wang
Pha (P less than 0.001). Recrudescence confirmed by means of
polymerase-chain-reaction assay occurred in 6 of 20 patients (30
percent) receiving artesunate monotherapy and 1 of 20 (5 percent)
receiving artesunate-mefloquine therapy in Pailin, as compared with 2
of 20 (10 percent) and 1 of 20 (5 percent), respectively, in Wang Pha
(P=0.31). These markedly different parasitologic responses were not
explained by differences in age, artesunate or dihydroartemisinin
pharmacokinetics, results of isotopic in vitro sensitivity tests, or
putative molecular correlates of _P. falciparum_ drug resistance
(mutations or amplifications of the gene encoding a multidrug
resistance protein [PfMDR1] or mutations in the gene encoding
sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase6 [PfSERCA]). Adverse
events were mild and did not differ significantly between the 2
treatment groups.

Conclusions
-----------
_P. falciparum_ has reduced in vivo susceptibility to artesunate in
western Cambodia as compared with northwestern Thailand. Resistance
is characterized by slow parasite clearance in vivo without
corresponding reductions on conventional in vitro susceptibility
testing. Containment measures are urgently needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The study compares resistance to dihydroartemisinin and mefloquine in
Bangladesh, western and eastern Thailand, and Cambodia. The mean
log10 concentration of dihydroartemisinin resulting in a 50 percent
inhibition (IC50) of parasite growth in vitro was 3 times higher in
Cambodia compared to Bangladesh with an increasing gradient from
western to eastern Thailand.

The mean log10 concentration of mefloquine resulting in a 50 percent
inhibition (IC50) of parasite growth in vitro was 3 times highest in
Western and Eastern Thailand and lowest in Bangladesh.

The study concludes:
"These findings suggest that the increased failure rate of
artemisinin-based therapies can probably be attributed to decreased
artemisinin susceptibility in the east rather than to major regional
differences in mefloquine sensitivity.

In southeastern Bangladesh, an area where until very recently
artemisinin-based therapies have not been extensively used,
artemisinin sensitivity remains high. These data indicate that it is
unlikely that artemisinin resistance has spread across Thailand, and
we found high susceptibility in Bangladesh."

[The 2 studies highlight a focus in Cambodia and eastern Thailand
with reduced sensitivity to artemisinins. This is worrisome because
artemisinins, alone and in combination with other antimalarials, are
the main drug used for chemotherapy throughout Asia and Africa. The
studies are also worrisome because the areas where this resistance
has been found, are the same areas where chloroquine resistance was
first described almost 50 years ago and where
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (fansidar) and mefloquine resistance also developed.

Genetic studies have indicated that the chloroquine resistant _P.
falciparum_ strain, which spread throughout Africa in the 1980s did
indeed come from Southeast Asia (Mita T et al: Spread and evolution
of _Plasmodium falciparum_ drug resistance. Parasitol Int 2009 Apr
23. E-pub ahead of print; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19393762>).

A recent study based on mathematical modelling suggests that the
focus of artemisinin resistance can be contained by use of optimal
drug dosing (Maude RJ et al: The last man standing is the most
resistant: eliminating artemisinin-resistant malaria in Cambodia.
Malar J 2009 8: 31; available at
<http://www.malariajournal.com/content/8/1/31>). However, resistance
is most probably driven by counterfeit drugs, substandard
preparation, and distribution of artemisinin as single therapy
compared to combinations and sale of single doses. This is difficult
to improve in countries, which cannot enforce quality control of the
drugs used and control distribution through prescriptions. Perhaps
control should be based on enhanced vector control especially
impregnated bed nets. - Mod.EP]
