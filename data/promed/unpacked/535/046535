The State Veterinary Services today [Mon 21 Nov 2022] reported the 1st incident this winter of H5 avian influenza in a commercial farm.

The event was diagnosed in a flock of turkeys in Kibbutz Shluhot. The flock is 19 weeks old and the diagnosis was made during the flock's last slaughter day at the 'Off Tov' poultry slaughterhouse.

[This outbreak is Israel's first for the 2022-2023 season. So far, no cases of wild birds have been reported.

Kibbutz Shluhot is situated in the Beit-Shean valley, north eastern Israel, about 7 km (about 4.3 mi) west of the Jordan river which separates Israel from the Kingdom of Jordan. Inland aquaculture is exercised in the region; the fish ponds, an attraction for migrating birds on their route from Eurasia to Africa, are presented on the map at https://tinyurl.com/yffejsyf.

On 8 Nov 2022, the State Veterinary Services published guidelines to the farmers, entitled "Preparing for the wild bird migration season". The circular (in Hebrew) is available at https://tinyurl.com/2p9xbehy. During the previous, 2021-2022 season, HPAI H5N1 caused a major outbreak in migrating birds, manifested in mass mortality of cranes and pelicans, leaking to commercial poultry farms with considerable losses.

We await serotyping results of the currently circulating H5 virus strain. - Mod.AS
