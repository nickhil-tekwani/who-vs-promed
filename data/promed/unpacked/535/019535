Following the discovery of an African swine fever [ASF] outbreak on a
farm in Santa Giusta, Oristano, 278 pigs have been killed and destroyed.

According to initial investigations, this could be a single incident.
However, difficult days are ahead for not less than 250 farmers.
These piggeries are located within the declared area of surveillance:
the territory of Santa Giusta (with 10 farms within 3 km [2 mi]) and
the communes of Arborea, Marrubiu, Palmas Arborea, Oristano,
Solarussa, Simaxis, Villaurbana, Cabras, Siamanna, and Siamaggiore.
For the next 1.5 months, they will not be allowed to slaughter or
move any pigs. A real [shock] for farmers waiting for Ferragosto [an
Italian holiday celebrated on 15 Aug] to earn a few extra euros by
selling piglets, the classic dish of the feast. The ban on slaughter
and handling is one of the main measures of the protocol activated by
the health authorities in order to prevent the serious losses (up to
80 percent mortality) known to be caused by ASF.

In other words, the economy of the entire pig industry in the area is
at stake. And since there is no vaccination against the spread of
ASF, prevention is the only remaining weapon. "To be complied with
carefully," the veterinarians have said: prevent the entry of
strangers into farms, do not visit other pig farms, and above all, do
not even dream of overriding the rules, not even to slaughter just
one pig "at home" to offer a gift to a friend.

[The province of Oristano is situated on the western side of central
Sardinia; see map at <http://healthmap.org/r/01Y3>.

ASF arrived in the south of Sardinia in 1978, probably due to
administration of contaminated swill. Later the virus spread to other
parts of the island, particularly the center. The disease became
endemic in Sardinia due to several factors: many pig farms lack
barriers (such as fences, hedges, natural barriers, etc.); pigs are
farmed according to traditional practices, such as grazing free-range
herds on vast communal lands; there is a considerable wild-boar
population. According to Italy's recent report to the EU, dated 12
Apr 2010, free-ranging pigs are considered the primary reservoirs of
ASFV in Sardinia whereas wild boars probably play a secondary role
(see
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1213042010_asf_italy_en.pdf>).

In 1993, an EU-funded ASF eradication program was adopted. According
to the guidelines of the program, all pigs in ASF affected farms and
pigs that tested positive to ASFV by serological tests were culled
and a prompt refund was given to farmers. Since 1996, pigs from
unaffected farms that were suspected of infection (that is,
free-ranging pigs sharing pastures with ASF-affected herds) were also
culled. Eventually this led to a significant reduction of the
outbreaks in Sardinia: 2007 - 30 outbreaks; 2008 - 8; 2009 - 4.

The national plan for ASF for 2010 is, according to the report above,
as follows:
- serological check of pig farms (sampling IC 95 percent prevalence 5 percent);
- serological and virological check of wild boar during the hunting
season (minimum 96 animals for each macro-area in the high risk zone
and 59 animals outside the high risk zone);
- serological check at the slaughterhouse and in the case of
slaughter for household consumption;
- serological check in order to accredit the holding;
- serological check before the movement of animal in non accredited holdings;
- serological check on animals producing meat and meat products
according to the Decision 363/2005.

The total number of pig farms in Sardinia is around 17 000,
distributed throughout the territory according to the type of
farming. In general, the density of farms per municipality varies
from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 504 farms per sq km (mean 64.28).

Further details on the history of ASF in Sardinia, epidemiology and
control measures, are available at the EU report above.- Mod.AS]
