About a month ago [around the beginning of June 2013], a woman was horseback riding and noticed the rear of her horse seemed weak. I couldn't get her going; she felt weak underneath me," she said. "I thought it was a hoof, a joint, but nothing was showing up. Then I rode her one night and she could hardly balance me. It was almost kind of scary."

She guessed her horse was suffering from equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, or EPM, a serious and often fatal neurological disease. That's because her horse had shared a barn on Old Mission Peninsula [Michigan] with 2 other horses previously diagnosed with EPM after they'd become weak and stumbled on rides. The woman's horse also tested positive.

She later learned that it's highly unusual for 3 out of 6 horses to be struck with EPM within a year of each other. "It's weird because it's supposed to be very sporadic," she said.

Indeed, the protozoal parasite causing EPM can be detected in a majority of horses. But only about 1 percent of horses that test positive for the parasite ever develop a clinical disease, said Shanti Bhuyan, a large animal veterinarian in Kingsley [Michigan], who cited a large study. Bhuyan called the 50 percent occurrence in one barn a "statistical glitch." He sees 2000 horses a year, and hasn't seen a single case. "I just want to make it clear that there is not an outbreak. There is no cause for alarm," said Bhuyan.

Bhuyan wondered if the horses had poor immune systems, but the woman said 2 were in excellent health and relatively young, while the 3rd horse was a rescue and in poor health.

The parasite is not contagious, but is spread by opossums when they defecate in the horse's water, feed or hay. Opossums pick up the parasite from cats, raccoons, skunks, and other mammals. The parasite cannot be spread from one horse to another.

The woman, an area physician, wanted others to know of the EPM "cluster" because early diagnosis can save a horse's life. The parasite is known as a master of disguise because it mimics other diseases. "The big thing is if I didn't know these other horses had been hit, I could have spent a bloody fortune figuring it out," she said. "The earlier you catch it, the better off you are."

Treatment costs about USD 800, takes about a month, and there is no guarantee of success. Because of the nature of the medication, a treated horse often gets worse before it improves, she said. "[My horse] is barely able to walk up a hill," she said. "She is stumbling, she can't turn and walk toward you. She looks like she's drunk, and her rear end goes all over the place. Her tail goes up and down instead of back and forth."

She thinks the case is worthy of study. She suspects the horses drank contaminated water at the barn. It was never flushed, but kept "clean" with goldfish. She believes the parasite built up in concentrations too high for the horses' immune systems to conquer. Her advice to horse owners is to keep their water and food supplies out of the reach of critters that could carry the disease.

Lisa Tadros, a Michigan State University's College of Veterinary Medicine resident, couldn't comment on the Old Mission cases, but said many horses are exposed to the parasite at some point in their lives, which can sometimes lead to a false positive test result. Up to 75 percent of horses will respond to treatment; a light-riding pleasure horse can still lead a relatively normal life, she said.

[Some years ago I was studying equine leptospiral abortion, which occurred due to chronically infected raccoons urinating in the horses' feed troughs, and logically they will defaecate as well. So if you have a local reservoire of infected opossums and raccoons, your horses will be at risk. And this 3rd horse was in a state of fragile health.

Here are Mod.TG's comments from the 2009 report:
"Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a common neurologic disease of horses in the Americas; it has been reported in most of the contiguous 48 states of the USA, southern Canada, and several countries in Central and South America. In other countries, EPM is seen sporadically.

Most cases of EPM are caused by an Apicomplexa protozoan, _Sarcocystis neurona_. Horses are infected by ingestion of _S. neurona_ sporocysts in contaminated feed or water. The organism is assumed to undergo early asexual multiplication (schizogony) in extraneural tissues before parasitizing the CNS. Because infectious sarcocysts are not formed, the horse is considered an aberrant, dead-end host for _S. neurona_. All _Sarcocystis_ spp have an obligate predator-prey life cycle. The definitive (predator) host for _S. neurona_ is believed to be the opossum (_Didelphis virginiana_).

Because the protozoa may infect any part of the CNS, almost any neurologic sign is possible. The disease usually begins insidiously but may present acutely and be severe at onset. Signs of spinal cord involvement are more common than signs of brain disease. Horses with EPM involving the spinal cord have asymmetric or symmetric weakness and ataxia of one to all limbs, sometimes with obvious muscle atrophy. When the caudal spinal cord is involved, there are signs of cauda equina syndrome. EPM lesions in the spinal cord also may result in demarcated areas of spontaneous sweating or loss of reflexes and cutaneous sensation. The most common signs of brain disease in horses with EPM are depression, head tilt, and facial paralysis. Any cranial nerve nucleus may be involved, and there may be seizures, visual deficits including abnormal menace response, or behavioral abnormalities. Without treatment, EPM often progresses to cause recumbency and death. Progression to recumbency occurs over hours to years and may occur steadily or in a stop-start fashion.

Postmortem diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of protozoa in CNS lesions. An immunoblot (Western blot) test for _S. neurona_ is used as an aid to antemortem diagnosis. In horses with neurologic signs, demonstration of specific antibody in CSF (by immunoblot) is highly suggestive of EPM. A positive immunoblot test in serum only indicates exposure to _S. neurona_. Conversely, a negative immunoblot result, in either serum or CSF, tends to exclude the diagnosis of EPM. In a few horses with EPM, CSF analysis reveals abnormalities such as mononuclear pleocytosis and increased protein concentration.

Depending on the clinical signs, differential diagnoses may include cervical stenotic myelopathy, trauma, aberrant metazoan parasite migration, equine degenerative myeloencephalopathy, myeloencephalopathy caused by equine herpesvirus 1, equine motor neuron disease, neuritis of the cauda equina, arboviral (Eastern or Western, equine, West Nile) encephalomyelitis, rabies, bacterial meningitis, and leukoencephalomalacia.

The only FDA-approved treatments for EPM are ponazuril and nitazoxanide, both as paste formulations. An alternative approach is the use of antifolate drugs, such as sulfadiazine, or sulfamethoxazole in combination with pyrimethamine). The sulfonamide can be given with or without trimethoprim. Pyrimethamine must be given at least one hour before or after hay is fed. Treatment is usually continued for 6 months. Anemia may develop after prolonged treatment with antifolate drugs and is best prevented by provision of high quantities of green forage. At least 60 percent of horses improve with treatment, but less than 25 percent recover completely. Relapses are common in horses that remain positive on immunoblot and rare in those that become negative.

No proven preventive is available. A conditionally approved vaccine is marketed, and its efficacy continues to be evaluated. There is interest in using antiprotozoal drugs for prevention; however, evidence-based protocols are not yet available. The source of infective sporocysts is probably opossum feces, so it is prudent to prevent access of opossums to horse-feeding areas. Horse and pet feed should not be left out; open feed bags and garbage should be kept in closed galvanized metal containers, bird feeders should be eliminated, and fallen fruit should be removed. Opossums can be trapped and relocated. Because putative intermediate hosts cannot be directly infective for horses, it is unlikely that control of these populations will be useful in EPM prevention.

Opossums are North America's only marsupial and are quite fascinating creatures. It is unfortunate that they are the host for an agent of such devastation in our equine companions.
