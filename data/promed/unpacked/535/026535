Information is beginning to spread online in Japan that a "killer tick" which carries a virus that causes severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) has already infected 53 people and has left 21 people dead. This is not the 1st time the virus has caused deaths in Japan, but Japan's Ministry of Health are now urging people not to expose their skin when walking and doing activities in areas where there is a lot of shrubbery and vegetation.

As Japan moves through the spring season, the ministry is now actively cautioning people to be aware that the virus spreads through ticks. The SFTS virus is carried by the [arthropods] and is transferred via their bite. In western Japan, 53 people have already been infected with the STFS virus, with most of the patients complaining of fever and hemorrhaging. Unfortunately, already 21 people have died.

"When in places where there is a lot of vegetation, people should try not to expose their skin where possible," Tamura Norihasa, Japan's Minister for Health, Labor and Welfare Tamura Norihisa, said in an official statement.

The majority of SFTS cases so far have been in China, which is also where scientists 1st isolated the virus in 2009. While all of the confirmed SFTS cases seem to be in western Japan, the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center warns that the type of tick that is the carrier of the virus can be found in 23 prefectures, ranging from Hokkaido in the north to the island of Kyushu in the south. There is no effective vaccine for this virus, and as Japan enters the spring season, people are advised to be more careful.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) in Japan, 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of SFTS patients reported in compliance with the Infectious Diseases Control Law under the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases was 48 until the end of 2013; 40 were developed in 2013 (see p. 38 of this issue), and 8 on or before 2012 (2 cases in 2005; 1 case in 2010; 5 cases in 2012) (IASR 34: 110, 2013). The seasonal peak was in May (Fig. 3). Patients were reported from 13 prefectures in Kyushu, Shikoku and Chugoku regions (Fig. 4). A total of 22 cases were males and 26 females. Patients' ages ranged from 48 to 95 years (median 72 years) (Fig. 5). A total of 17 of 48 had died (CFR 35 percent).

[SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family, hence the varying archive subjects listed below. It was 1st isolated in China from samples from fever patients in 2009, and has since been detected in Japan and South Korea. The vector was found to be ticks.

"The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago," said Oh Myeong-don, a doctor of infectious disease and internal medicine at Seoul National University Hospital. "A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media was reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 percent is that at 1st they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected, and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 percent," Oh said. "While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks." (See ProMED archive Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update 20130526.1738022).
