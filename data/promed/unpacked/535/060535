re: Dogs as a source of infection for horses
--------------------------------------------
Dr Digard in the ProMED-mail post "Equine influenza - Australia (11): (NSW,
QLD) 20070919.3115" has made an important and valid point in challenging
the statement "Individual horses clear the virus within 2 weeks following
infection and there is no long-term carrier status after recovery and there
are no known alternative or reservoir hosts. These features render equine
influenza (EI) eminently controllable and eradicable." [see: Equine
influenza - Australia (10): (NSW, QLD) 20070918.3108. - Mod.CP]
We were aware of the Crawford et al 2005 Science paper cited by Dr Digard
describing equine influenza virus (H3N8) infection in dogs, originally in
greyhounds in Florida that were purportedly fed infected horse meat [see
ProMED-mail post archived as "Influenza, canine - USA (FL) 20060620.1703"
and other Influenza, canine posts referenced below. - Mod.CP]. Subsequently
a much wider distribution of EI virus infection and disease in dogs,
involving horizontal transmission, was recognised in the United States.
It may have been better if the infection of dogs with equine influenza
virus had been mentioned in the original ProMED-mail post. For simplicity a
choice was made not to complicate the original message, with its emphasis
on the prospects for control and eradication of EI in Australia, by
referring to EI virus infection in dogs.
We were not aware of the Newton et al Veterinary Record July 2007
reference, cited by Dr Digard, that presents evidence of EI virus (H3N8)
infection of dogs in the United Kingdom. Evidence for infection of dogs was
based on detection of EI virus antigen in lung tissues and the detection of
EI virus specific antibodies in serum. What seems particularly significant
in the Newton et al report is that initially it was quarry hounds and
subsequently foxhounds that were considered to have been infected with EI
virus. The authors create a picture of foxhounds being in close contact
with horses including "shared airspace" during trailer transport to hunt meets.
Both of the references cited by Dr Digard refer to unusual initial
inter-species transmission events in countries where equine influenza virus
is endemic. Given the current movement bans in affected States in Australia
it is unlikely that infected horse meat will be fed to dogs, or that dogs
and horses will travel together in a shared airspace.
Also, as pointed out by Dr Digard neither of the cited papers present
evidence that dogs have been a source of infection for horses, which
supports a view that dogs are unlikely play a significant, if any, role in
the current epidemic in Australia.
All going well infection of dogs should not complicate Australian efforts
to control and eradicate EI but the possibility of such complication should
be recognised.
