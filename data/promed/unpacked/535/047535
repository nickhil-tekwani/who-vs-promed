Madagascar needs more help to combat deadly Rift Valley fever outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
United Nations agencies helping to support Madagascar's emergency plan have
appealed to international donors to step in, to extend coverage of all
populations at risk of the deadly outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in
the country. RVF in Madagascar has already caused 20 human deaths as well
as affecting livestock, according to reports by UN agencies. Since January
[2008], RVF has been reported in both animals and humans in more than 20
out of 119 districts of Madagascar, primarily in the north, south, and
central highlands. By the end of June [2008], Madagascar's Ministry of
Health had reported a total of 520 human-suspected cases related to RVF,
including 20 deaths. Laboratory tests have confirmed 84 human cases so far.

The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health
Organization (WHO) have helped Malagasy authorities develop an Emergency
Response Plan, which includes providing disease management for affected
livestock herds and human populations at risk, reinforcing livestock
disease surveillance and improving reporting systems and laboratory
diagnostics.

Transmitted by mosquitoes, RVF is a dangerous disease that affects both
livestock -- including sheep, goats, cattle, and camels -- and humans, but
is usually well established in animal populations by the time the 1st human
cases are observed.

Humans become infected through mosquito bites or direct contact with
infected material and liquids such as animal blood during slaughtering,
while the uncooked milk of infected animals can also pose a risk. No cases
of human-to-human transmission have ever been reported.

While some infected people experience no detectable symptoms, others
develop flu-like fever, muscle pain, headaches, joint pain, vomiting, loss
of appetite, and sensitivity to light. In more severe cases patients can
also experience lesions in their eyes, neurological problems, liver
impairment, and haemorrhagic fever symptoms including widespread bleeding.

FAO and WHO have received a total of USD 376 000 from the UN Central
Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support the emergency plan, but the 2
agencies are appealing to international donors to help extend the programme
to areas not yet covered, aiming to cover all populations at risk.

[The outbreak of RVF in Madagascar was reported by the Agriculture Ministry
on 9 Apr 2008, following positive results of tests on 2 of nine 9 that were
taken ill with symptoms associated with the disease 2 months previously.
The RVF situation in Madagascar has become serious because the 2 month
delay in disease reporting facilitated the spread of the disease and the
consequent occurrence of several human cases and deaths.

By 18 Apr 2008 a total of 418 human cases and 17 deaths had been recorded.
By the end of June 2008 the human case number had become 520 with 20
fatalities, suggesting a degree of containment of the outbreak. However, as
yet only 84 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing.
