Viet Nam: 2 Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza Now Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old girl and a 40-year-old woman have been infected by
avian influenza virus in Viet Nam, the hardest-hit country in East
Asia with 34 deaths so far, 13 since December 2004 -- officials said
on Fri 25 Mar 2005. "They have been here for a week and the positive
test results just came out this week," the official at the National
Institute for Clinical Research of Tropical Medicine in Hanoi told
Reuters.
The girl came from Nam Dinh province, 90 km (56 miles) south of
Hanoi, while the woman was from Quang Ninh province, which borders
China, the official said. The official gave no further details about
the cases.
The H5N1 virus, which has also claimed the lives of 12 Thais and 2
Cambodians, has killed about 70 percent of the people known to have
been infected, but it does not pass easily from birds to humans.
Experts fear that if the virus could combine with a human influenza
virus, it may become highly contagious capable of killing millions of
people worldwide. But the World Health Organization says it has seen
no evidence so far to suggest the virus is changing into a form that
could be transmitted easily from one human to another.

Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Toll Rises to 35; (A 3rd Cambodian Case Not
confirmed)
---------------------------------------------------
A 17-year-old woman became Vietnam's 35th bird flu victim on Fri 25
Mar 2005, whereas tests on a third Cambodian suspected of contracting
the virus, which has now killed 49 people since 2003, proved negative.
[Cambodia's Health Ministry and the World Health Organization said
test results on an 18-year-old bird flu suspect in the southern
province of Kampot, home to both previous cases, had proved negative.

The 17-year-old Vietnamese female, who died on 23 Mar 2005, according
to hospital emergency unit head Nguyen Hong Ha, was from Nam Dinh
province, 90 km (56 miles) south of Hanoi. A 40-year-old Vietnamese
woman from Quang Ninh, along the Chinese border, was also confirmed
as having contracted the highly lethal H5N1 virus, which doctors fear
could mutate into a more contagious form and unleash a global
pandemic.
Provincial health officials said neither of the 2 Vietnamese patients
lived in an area where bird flu outbreaks had occurred. The H5N1
virus, which has also claimed 12 Thais and 2 Cambodians, has killed
about 70 percent of the people known to have been infected, but it
does not pass easily from birds to humans.
In Viet Nam, the afternoon edition of the state-run Hanoi Moi (New
Hanoi) daily newspaper said 5 members of one family were hospitalised
on Wed 23 Mar 2005 in the northern port city of Haiphong with
coughing and breathing difficulties. Doctors suspected they had avian
influenza, the paper said. It quoted Nguyen Van Vy, director of
Haiphong's Health Department, as saying poultry at the family's house
had been slaughtered earlier to stop bird flu outbreaks. Bird flu
tests on the 5 were under way, Vy said.
Before the latest death, the WHO put Vietnam's official death toll at
33, but this did not include a boy Vietnamese doctors said died of
encephalitis, but who was later found also to have had avian
influenza.
