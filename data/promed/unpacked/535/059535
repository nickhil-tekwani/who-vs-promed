Montreal public health authorities are advising local physicians to be vigilant and test patients for syphilis after an increase in the number of reported cases in the region. "In the region of Montreal, 3 cases of congenital syphilis (where the disease is passed by an infected mother to her unborn child) were reported in 2021 and one case in 2020," authorities wrote in a bulletin to physicians issued on Friday [7 Jan 2022]. Authorities noted that until 2020, the last such case reported locally was in 2016.

The bulletin also noted that 8 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in Quebec City area between 2020 and 2021, and that the number of female cases of infectious syphilis in Montreal increased from 17 to 45 between 2017 and 2019, and from 68 to 131 in the Quebec City area during the same period [between 2017 and 2019].

The bulletin recommends that physicians test all pregnant women in their care for syphilis, as well as regularly administer tests to patients who are sexually active.

[In 2019 and 2021, ProMED posted reports of the increased incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in women, as well as congenital syphilis, in several Canadian provinces and territories (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories). The news report above now indicates that the Canadian province of Quebec is experiencing similar problems as the other regions of Canada.

However, not mentioned in the news report above is illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, which was frequently cited as a contributing factor to the increase in syphilis cases in these other Canadian locales. Transmission of syphilis in illicit drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/health/04-28TransmissionSyphilis.asp), but more likely the infection is acquired by the practice of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

Quebec, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is the largest province by area and the 2nd-largest by population, much of which lives in urban areas along the St. Lawrence River, between the most populous city, Montreal (pop. 1.7 million residents in 2016), and the provincial capital, Quebec City (pop. 531 902 residents in 2016). A map of Canada showing the location of Quebec can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Quebec,+Canada.

More information on the factors contributing to the current outbreak in Quebec would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
