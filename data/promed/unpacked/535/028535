re: ProMED-mail: Leptospirosis - Japan: (ON) military 20141112.2947035
-----------------------------------------------------
This report concerning a suspected leptospirosis outbreak in as many as 90 US Marines in a Jungle Warfare Training Center, in Okinawa, Japan, raises concerns about full adequacy of, 1st, the considered diagnosis, and, 2nd, the already installed (surgical) treatment.

First, the diagnosis of leptospirosis. An outbreak of that magnitude and that long duration (2 months) in a well-controlled population is highly unusual for leptospirosis as the sole perpetrator. Moreover, only about more than half is reported to be confirmed, without further specifications of all sero-techniques used so far to circumscribe this epidemic. When the local military-medical authorities justly wonder why the "mucky pond" used since long in their training center, now suddenly appears to pose serious problems, other intervening but localized "jungle infections", prevalent also in Japan, should at least be considered. The more so since a sudden outbreak of apparently the same disease has hit neighboring civilian locals as well, using another but nearby "swimming hole", again presumably without many prior problems.

One single case of a marine with the same feverish symptoms, staying at the same training center, but NOT having had contact with the suspected water pond, is enough to put in jeopardy the whole theory of a current leptospirosis outbreak as the sole culprit. Suspect number 2 might then well be scrub typhus, a rickettsial disease mimicking many symptoms of leptospirosis, including multi-organ involvement and thrombocytopenia. Suspect number 3 (but much less likely) would be hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), induced by _Seoul virus_ (SEOV), and spread by the omnipresent wild rat. SEOV is the only hantaviral pathogen known so far to be present in Japan, in contrast to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the causal pathogen of scrub typhus, transmitted by chigger mites in whole S.-E. Asia, including Japan. Both HFRS and scrub typhus are still underestimated in the differential diagnosis of leptospirosis, and (military) Western medicine was only 1st confronted with both these "new" diseases during the Korean War.

Scrub typhus typically occurs in isolated and sharply defined, but highly endemic, areas, as seems the case here. For this and other reasons, this infection has an impressive military history, incapacitating whole units in South East Asia during World War II. The typical and diagnostic black eschar at the site of the chigger bite is far from always being present. Moreover, "oriental" chigger bites are often painless, in contrast to American chigger bites which are very itchy, so that most soldiers deployed in South East Asia are not even aware of the bites. Lab diagnosis is additionally hampered by a frequently very delayed antibody response, resulting even in complete negative sero-results, as reported after 2 scrub typhus outbreaks in another training camp for US Marines at Camp Fugi, Japan (1).

Second, the surgical treatment. Leptospirosis is rarely an indication for surgical intervention of any kind. The fact that cholecystectomy was deemed necessary in a cluster of 3 consecutive young patients with a (re-) emerging infection (leptospirosis, scrub typhus, HFRS or other) immediately should raise the suspicion of a condition named acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC), due to the formerly called "severe inflammation response syndrome" (SIRS), in turn due to the so-called "cytokine storm", which is now considered a common point of auto-immune pathophysiology in most, if not all, emerging infections.

AAC is an acute but rapidly transient symptom of general inflammation, as all other symptoms in these illnesses, and consequently not an indication for surgery. Patients with AAC should be treated conservatively with antibiotics and supportive care, and all recover fully (see literature list hereunder). Antibiotics are not even required for AAC in HFRS, as we described in a Belgian HFRS case presenting with both pulmonary, renal, and gallbladder involvement (2).

Diagnosis of AAC can be secured if the gallbladder in ultrasound examination fulfills the following 4 criteria, most often present concomitantly at admission: hydrops of the gallbladder, "sludge" at the bottom of it, absence of gallstones, and most importantly: edematous thickening of the gallbladder wall to greater than 4 mm, as a sign of general inflammatory edema. Pain in the upper right quadrant, with a positive Murphy's sign, and inflammatory hematological abnormalities can admittedly induce the clinician into the misdiagnosis of a "classic" bacterial cholecystitis, and hence into a classic surgical therapy. However, even in the cases of leptospirosis or other emerging infections presenting with cholecystitis, literature and personal experience seem to concede in confirming that most, if not all, cases are due in fact to transient AAC (3-7).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Jan Clement for his thoughtful discussion of the differential diagnosis in this outbreak that involved 90 marines who were suspected to have contracted leptospirosis at the Jungle Warfare Training Center, Camp Gonsalves in Northern Okinawa, Japan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Gonsalves). The diagnosis of leptospirosis was said to be confirmed in more than half of cases, although the methods used to confirm this diagnosis were not specified in the news report. Also, the news report did not say if other diagnoses, such as scrub typhus or hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, were considered and ruled out. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information in this regard from knowledgeable sources.

The news report said that 3 marines had their gallbladders removed and Dr Clements raises the issue of acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) in these patients. AAC is a severe illness that that develops in the setting of various other conditions in critically ill patients. The usual finding on imaging studies is a distended acalculous gallbladder with thickened walls (greater than 3-4 mm) with or without pericholecystic fluid. Gangrene and perforation of the gallbladder can complicate AAC. The primary therapy for AAC has been cholecystectomy, but percutaneous cholecystostomy is gaining acceptance as an alternative. For a discussion of AAC, see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6881/.
