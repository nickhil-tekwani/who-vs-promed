1st Report of Pear Decline Phytoplasmas on Pear in Serbia.
----------------------------------------------------------
B Duduk, M Ivanovic, A Obradovic, Faculty of Agriculture, University of
Belgrade, Nemanjina 6, 11080 Belgrade-Zemun, Serbia; S Paltrinieri, A
Bertaccini, DiSTA, Patologia Vegetale, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of
Bologna, via F. Re 8, 40126 Bologna, Italy. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 774,
published online as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0774C. Accepted for publication 11
Apr 2005.
During August 2004, pear (_Pyrus communis_ L.) plants with typical symptoms
of pear decline (PD) were observed in orchards in central Serbia. The
affected plants showed premature reddening and upward rolling of leaves
that often showed down-turned petioles. In some cases, premature
defoliation was observed. Although a similar decline of pear was observed
earlier, until now, the causal agent had not been identified.
DNA was extracted with a chloroform/phenol procedure from fresh leaf
midribs and branch phloem scrapes of 4 symptomatic and one asymptomatic
pear plants separately. A nested polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) was
used for phytoplasma detection (1st PCR round with P1/P7 (4) phytoplasma
universal primer pair, followed by nested PCR with group 16SrX specific
primers f01/r01) (3). With these primers, the expected products from phloem
scrapes and midrib extracts of symptomatic plant samples were obtained.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses of the f01/r01
amplicon, with RsaI and SspI restriction enzymes, discriminating among
16SrX subgroup phytoplasmas, showed profiles corresponding to those of the
apple proliferation phytoplasma group, 16SrX-C subgroup, "_Candidatus
Phytoplasma pyri_" (2).
A 1155-bp sequence of 16S rDNA gene for one of the PA2f/r (1) amplicons
obtained in nested PCR on P1/P7 products from one of the leaf midrib
samples was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. AY949984); both strands of
the fragment were sequenced with the Big Dye Terminator reaction kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
The sequences were analyzed with the Chromas 1.55 DNA sequencing software
(Technelysium, Queensland, Australia) and aligned with BLAST software
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>.
The blast search showed 100 per cent homology of this sequence with that of
PD strain Y16392, confirming the identity with PD of the phytoplasma detected.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of pear decline phytoplasmas in
Serbia.

[Phytoplasmas have been implicated as the etiological agents of several
hundred plant diseases worldwide, including numerous diseases of
economically important food, fiber, forage, fruit, and timber. According to
plant pathologists at the University of California, Davis, the pear decline
[PD] mycoplasma is carried by pear psylla which transmit the phytoplasma
during feeding on pear foliage. Expression of PD depends on rootstock
susceptibility, tree vigor, and psylla numbers. The phytoplasma apparently
does not multiply in pear trees as well as it does in pear psylla. Control
of pear psylla usually results in disease remission even when rootstocks
are highly susceptible. Poor shoot and spur growth, shoot dieback, upper
rolling of leaves, reduced leaf and fruit size, and premature leaf drop
characterize PD. Sudden tree collapse can result from tissue damage at the
graft union on highly susceptible rootstocks, such as _Pyrus serotina_ or
_P. ussuriensis_, but slow decline of trees is more common. Trees on
tolerant rootstocks may show mild to moderate symptoms that occasionally
become severe if very high psylla populations occur in conjunction with
other tree stresses. Commercial pear rootstocks, with the exception of
_Pyrus calleryana_, are available which are essentially tolerant to PD and
produce excellent crops in spite of recurring pear psylla populations and
exposure to PD. Tolerant rootstocks include Bartlett seedling, Winter
Nelis, and _Pyrus betulaefolia_. To keep PD in remission on susceptible
rootstocks, control pear psylla and maintain trees in good vigor, and
reduce stress caused by inadequate irrigation, nutrient deficiency, weed
competition, lack of pruning, and pest damage. There is no known biological
control of the PD phytoplasma. Indirectly, biological control of pear
psylla can reduce disease expression.
Based on dissimilarities of restriction sites detected by rDNA RFLPs, 9
primary 16S rDNA groups (termed 16Sr groups) and 14 subgroups were
recognized in a classification scheme proposed by Lee, Hammond, Davis, and
Gundersen. At least 14 primary 16Sr groups consisting of 16SrI, aster
yellows; 16SrII, peanut witches'-broom; 16SrIII, X-disease; 16SrIV, coconut
lethal yellows; 16SrV, elm yellows; 16SrVI, clover proliferation; 16SrVII,
ash yellows; 16SrVIII, loofah witches'-broom; 16SrIX, pigeonpea
witches'-broom; 16SrX, apple proliferation; 16SrXI, rice yellow dwarf;
16SrXII, stolbur; 16SrXIII, Mexican periwinkle virescence; 16SrIV, Bermuda
grass white leaf, and at least 32 strain subgroups have been recognized. 45
subgroups were identified when ribosomal protein gene RFLP data were also
considered in the analyses.
