Global Control and Regional Elimination of Measles, 2000-2011
------------------------------------------------------
Widespread use of measles vaccine since 1980 has led to a substantial decline in global measles morbidity and mortality; measles elimination* has been achieved and sustained in the World Health Organization (WHO) Region of the Americas (AMR) since 2002. In 2010, the World Health Assembly established 3 milestones for measles eradication to be reached by 2015:
1) increase routine coverage with the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) for children aged one year to 90 percent nationally and 80 percent in every district or equivalent administrative unit;
2) reduce and maintain annual measles incidence to <5 cases per million; and
3) reduce measles mortality by 95 percent from the 2000 estimate (1).

The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) includes monitoring progress toward achievement of goals to reduce or eliminate measles in 4 WHO regions by 2015 and 5 WHO regions by 2020(2). This report updates the previous report (3) and describes progress in global control and regional elimination of measles during 2000-2011. Estimated global MCV1 coverage increased from 72 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2011, and the number of countries providing a 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine services increased from 97 (50 percent) in 2000 to 141 (73 percent) in 2011. During 2000-2011, annual reported measles incidence decreased 65 percent, from 146 to 52 cases per one million population, and estimated measles deaths decreased 71 percent, from 542 000 to 158 000. However, during 2010-2011, measles incidence increased, and large outbreaks of measles were reported in multiple countries. To resume progress toward achieving regional measles elimination targets, national governments and partners are urged to ensure that measles elimination efforts receive high priority and adequate resources.

Immunization Activities
--------------------
WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) use annual data from administrative records and surveys reported by national governments to estimate MCV1 coverage among children aged one year. Since 2003, countries also have reported the number of districts with more than or equal to 80 percent MCV1 coverage. During 2000-2011, estimated global MCV1 coverage increased from 72 percent to 84 percent; for 2011, estimated MCV1 coverage in three WHO regions was more than or equal to 90 percent. The number of countries with more than or equal to 90 percent MCV1 coverage increased from 83 (43 percent) in 2000 to 123 (63 percent) in 2011. Of countries reporting district-level MCV1 coverage, the proportion reaching more than or equal to 80 percent MCV1 coverage in more than or equal to 80 percent of districts increased from 49 percent (72 of 148) in 2003 to 56 percent (87 of 156) in 2011; in 2011, 34 percent (53 of 156) reported 80 percent MCV1 coverage in all districts. Of the estimated 20.1 million infants who did not receive MCV1 in 2011 through routine immunization services, 11.1 million (55 percent) were in 5 countries: India (6.7 million), Nigeria (1.7 million), Ethiopia (1.0 million), Pakistan (0.9 million), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (0.8 million).

During 2000-2011, the number of countries providing a 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine services increased from 97 (50 percent) to 141 (73 percent). Overall, 225 million children received measles vaccination during 39 supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) conducted during 2011. Among those 39 SIAs, 17 (44 percent) had >95 percent reported measles vaccine coverage, 12 (31 percent) included rubella vaccination, 15 (38 percent) included oral polio vaccination, and 14 (36 percent) included one or more child health interventions, in addition to vaccinations (Table 2).

Disease Incidence
---------------
During 2000-2011, the number of countries reporting annual measles surveillance data to WHO increased from 169 (88 percent) to 188 (97 percent). Effective measles surveillance includes case-based surveillance with laboratory testing to confirm cases. During 2004-2011, the number of countries using case-based surveillance increased from 120 (62 percent) to 182 (94 percent). During 2000-2011, the number of countries with access to standardized quality-controlled testing through the WHO Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network increased from 71 (37 percent) to 191 (98 percent).

During 2000-2011, the number of measles cases reported worldwide each year decreased 58 percent, from 853 480 to 354 922, and measles incidence decreased 65 percent, from 146 to 52 cases per million population per year, with declining cases and incidence reported in all WHO regions. During 2000-2011, AMR maintained measles incidence at <5 cases per million; in 2011, reported incidence in the Western Pacific Region (WPR) was 12 cases per million, a historic low. However, since reaching a low of 278 417 reported cases worldwide in 2008, annual reported cases have increased each year. From 2010 to 2011, a decrease in reported measles cases in WPR, from 49 460 to 21 050 cases, was offset by increases in reported cases, from 10 072 to 35 923 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), 52 529 to 65 161 in the South-East Asia Region (SEAR), 186 675 to 194 364 in the African Region (AFR), and 30 625 to 37 073 in the European Region (EUR). In addition, the percentage of countries with reported measles incidence <5 cases per million population decreased, from a high of 122 (67 percent) of 183 reporting countries in 2008 to 104 (55 percent) of 188 reporting countries in 2011. During 2011, large measles outbreaks were reported by DRC (134 042 cases), India (29 339), Indonesia (2893), Nigeria (18 843), Somalia (17 298), France (1949), Zambia (13 324), Chad (8650), Philippines (6538), Sudan (5616), Italy (5189), Pakistan (4386), Romania (4189), Spain (3802), Uganda (3312), Ethiopia (3255), and Afghanistan (3013).

Mortality Estimates
----------------
Many countries, particularly those with the highest disease burden, lack data on the number of measles deaths; therefore, WHO has developed a model to estimate mortality using reported numbers of cases, measles vaccination coverage through routine vaccination and SIAs, the age distribution of reported cases, and age-specific, country-specific case-fatality ratios. The addition of 2011 measles vaccination coverage and case data for all countries, and updating of data for the period before 2011 for some countries, led to new mortality estimates for 2000-2011. During 2000-2011, estimated measles deaths decreased 71 percent, from 542 000 to 158 000; all regions and India had substantial reductions in estimated measles mortality, ranging from 36 percent to 90 percent.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----------------
During 2000-2011, increasing routine measles vaccination coverage worldwide, combined with regular SIAs in countries lacking high coverage with 2 doses of MCV, contributed to a 65 percent decrease in reported measles incidence and a 71 percent reduction in estimated measles mortality. Measles elimination has been achieved and maintained in AMR, and WPR is approaching its measles elimination goal. However, since 2008, large outbreaks of measles in AFR, EMR, EUR, and SEAR have stalled progress toward regional measles control and elimination targets.

Field investigations of recent measles outbreaks found most cases were among unvaccinated persons, suggesting the main underlying cause was persistent gaps in immunization coverage, despite overall increased measles vaccine coverage. All 5 countries with the largest number of infants who did not receive MCV1 through routine immunization services in 2011 had large outbreaks of measles during 2011, highlighting the importance of a strong immunization system. In addition, poor quality SIAs and delays in planned SIAs have resulted in low coverage, contributing to the increased number of measles-susceptible children and ongoing measles virus transmission.

In 2011, estimated global measles mortality increased from the 2010 estimate, and 99 percent of the measles mortality burden was in AFR, EMR, India, and other SEAR countries. In India, the 36 percent decrease in estimated measles mortality during 2001-2011 mainly resulted from the National Measles Catch-up Programme to provide MCV2, beginning in 2010, with MCV2 introduction in routine services in states with reported MCV1 coverage 80 percent, and with SIAs followed by MCV2 introduction in routine services in states with reported MCV1 coverage <80 percent. To prevent measles epidemics and associated morbidity and mortality, WHO recommends that all children receive 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.1st, vaccination coverage estimates in this report include biases resulting from inaccurate estimates of the sizes of the target populations, inaccurate reporting of doses delivered, and inclusion of SIA doses given to children outside the target age group. 2nd, biases in surveillance data can occur because not all patients seek care and not all of those who seek care are reported. The use of measles surveillance data to estimate measles mortality improved on previously used methods that did not account for the effect of periodic outbreaks on mortality. Finally, the accuracy of the measles mortality model results is affected by biases in all model inputs, including country-specific measles vaccination coverage and measles case-based surveillance data.

In April 2012, the Measles and Rubella Initiative launched the 2012-2020 Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan to integrate rubella and measles elimination efforts, and provide strategies and guiding principles to resume progress toward regional measles elimination targets (10). The GVAP for the 2011-2020 Decade of Vaccines*** provides strategic objectives and recommended activities for increasing ownership, accountability, and vaccination coverage, as well as indicators for monitoring their impact through achievement of regional measles elimination targets. The GAVI Alliance commitment in 2012 to support eligible countries to introduce rubella vaccine using combined measles-rubella SIAs targeting children aged 9 months-14 years provides a unique opportunity to boost population immunity to both measles and rubella. The combination of new resources from immunization partners and commitments by countries to fully implement measles control and elimination strategies will help resume progress toward achieving regional measles targets.

In summary: During 2000-2010, global coverage with the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) increased from 72 percent to 85 percent, more than 1 billion children received a 2nd opportunity for measles immunization during measles supplemental immunization activities, and global reported measles cases decreased until 2008, then increased in 2010. By 2010, 40 percent of countries had not met the incidence target of less than 5 cases per million. As milestones toward eventual global measles eradication, the 2010 World Health Assembly endorsed a series of targets to be met by 2015.

The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) will monitor progress toward achievement of regional measles elimination targets. Estimated global MCV1 coverage increased from 72 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2011, and the number of countries providing a 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine services increased from 97 (50 percent) in 2000 to 141 (73 percent) in 2011. During 2000-2011, annual reported measles incidence decreased 65 percent, from 146 to 52 cases per million population, and estimated measles deaths decreased 71 percent, from 542 000 to 158 000.

During 2010-2011, measles incidence has increased and large measles outbreaks have been reported in multiple countries. To resume progress toward achieving regional measles elimination targets, national governments and partners are urged to ensure that these efforts receive high priority and adequate resources to achieve GVAP targets.

However the continued reluctance of the population of some countries (e.g., the UK) to accept universal MMWR vacation, together with organisational deficiencies (e.g., Pakistan) suggest that the WHO targets are optimistic. - Mod.CP]

Measles deaths decline, but elimination progress stalls in some regions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of measles deaths globally decreased by 71 percent between 2000 and 2011, from 542 000 to 158 000. Over the same period, new cases dropped 58 percent from 853 500 in 2000 to 355 000 in 2011, according to new data released Thursday by WHO, a leading member of the Measles and Rubella Initiative. {The Measles & Rubella Initiative is a global partnership committed to ensuring no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome. Founded originally as the Measles Initiative in 2001, it's led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and WHO. Although the WHO Region of the Americas has sustained measles elimination since 2002, and the WHO Western Pacific Region is on track to achieve elimination, large outbreaks of measles are jeopardising progress in the remaining regions that have these goals.

Success of vaccination coverage
---------------------------
WHO recommends that every child receive 2 doses of measles vaccine. The new data, published in this week's edition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [see part 1 above] and then in WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record, show overall progress in reducing deaths is linked largely to increased vaccination coverage.

Estimated global coverage with a 1st dose of vaccine increased from 72 percent in 2000 to 84 percent in 2011. The number of countries providing the 2nd dose through routine services increased from 97 in 2000 to 141 in 2011. Since 2000, with support from the Measles & Rubella Initiative, more than 1 billion children have been reached through mass vaccination campaigns -- about 225 million of them in 2011.

The 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) is recommended for children aged 9-15 months of age and a 2nd dose of measles vaccine (MCV2) is recommended to be given through routine vaccination programmes to children in the 2nd year of life or at school entry or through mass campaigns to children under 5 years of age. The exact ages will vary by country depending on the measles situation and programmatic issues.

Unprotected population
--------------------
Despite this global progress, some populations remain unprotected. An estimated 20 million children worldwide did not receive the 1st dose of vaccine in 2011. More than half of these children live in five countries:
- the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (0.8 million)
- Ethiopia (1 million)
- India (6.7 million)
- Nigeria (1.7 million)
- Pakistan (0.9 million)

Large measles outbreaks
---------------------
In 2011, large measles outbreaks were reported in all these countries and several others in:
- DRC (134 042 cases)
- Ethiopia (3255 cases)
- France (14 949 cases)
- India (29 339 cases)
- Italy (5189 cases)
- Nigeria (18 843 cases)
- Pakistan (4386 cases)
- Spain (3802 cases)

Other countries reporting large measles outbreaks in 2011 include the following:
- Afghanistan (3013 cases)
- Chad (8650 cases)
- Ethiopia (3255 cases)
- France (14 949 cases)
- Indonesia (21 893 cases)
- Italy (5189 cases)
- the Philippines (6538 cases)
- Romania (4189 cases)
- Somalia (17 298 cases)
- Spain (3802 cases)
- Sudan (5616 cases)
- Uganda (3312 cases)
- Zambia (13 324 cases)

Most of these countries are in WHO regions which have committed to eliminate measles by 2015 or 2020.

The measles outbreaks pose a serious challenge to the regional elimination efforts and signal where national health systems and routine immunization programmes need strengthening. Resuming progress in reducing measles cases and deaths means strengthening health systems so that they can provide effective immunization services and laboratory-supported surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases to all children.

The outbreaks also indicate the need to ensure that parents are fully aware of the benefits of immunization and the risks associated with not vaccinating children.

Measles Initiative partnership
-------------------------
Launched in 2001, the Measles Initiative is a partnership -- led by the American Red Cross, United Nations Foundation, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and WHO -- committed to reducing measles deaths worldwide.

In April of 2012, the partners of the Measles Initiative introduced a new global plan to jointly tackle measles and rubella using the same strategy and a combined measles-rubella vaccine. This new strategy is represented in its new name, the Measles & Rubella Initiative. The Initiative's goal is now to reduce measles deaths worldwide by 95 percent between by 2015 and to eliminate measles and rubella in at least 5 of 6 WHO regions by 2020.

World Health Assembly agreed milestones
-----------------------------------
In 2010, the World Health Assembly established three milestones towards the future eradication of measles to be achieved by 2015:
- increase routine coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) for children aged 1 year to 90 percent nationally and 80 percent in every district or equivalent administrative unit;
- reduce and maintain annual measles incidence to <5 cases per million; and
- reduce estimated measles mortality by >95 percent from the 2000 estimate.

Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan
-----------------------------------
Since then, WHO and partners in the Measles and Rubella Initiative have developed a Global Measles & Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-2020. The plan presents a 5-pronged strategy to cut global measles deaths by at least 95 percent by 2015 compared with 2000 levels and to achieve measles and rubella elimination in at least 5 WHO regions by 2020. The strategies include: high vaccination coverage; monitoring spread of disease using laboratory-backed surveillance; outbreak preparedness and response and case management; communication and community engagement; and research and development.

Measles outbreak in Morecambe and Heysham
---------------------------------------
Around 40 cases of measles have been confirmed in Morecambe and Heysham. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) and local NHS [National Health Service] said there is an ongoing outbreak of the disease in the Morecambe Bay area. The cases are mainly in unvaccinated schoolchildren and parents are being urged to ensure that their children, including teenage children, are protected by 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

Dr Steven Gee, director of the HPA's Cumbria and Lancashire Health Protection Unit, said: "We're seeing a lot of measles in Lancashire at the moment and the towns of Heysham and Morecambe are particularly badly affected. Measles is very infectious and children, teenagers and young adults who were not appropriately vaccinated at the right time are at risk and, furthermore, if they become ill with measles they can pose a serious health threat to any babies and toddlers they may come into contact with and to other individuals who are vulnerable to disease. In one major outbreak elsewhere in the north west there have been more than 500 cases and one 3rd of these patients needed treatment in hospital. A number were very ill indeed needing intensive care. Thankfully there have been no deaths."

"The best protection against measles is MMR vaccination. MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and 2 doses give lifelong protection in almost all cases. It's one of the best gifts that any parent can give to a child." When the normal vaccination schedule is followed, children are given a 1st dose of MMR when they are 13 months old and a 2nd dose at 40 months. However, the vaccine can be given at any age and the parents of older children and teenagers should realise that it is not too late. Young adults who missed out on MMR vaccine at the appropriate time can also still be immunised.

The Health Protection Agency strongly advises people with measles to avoid contact with others, especially pregnant women and infants. Parents should keep children out of nursery and away from school until at least 4 days have elapsed after the onset of the rash. Likewise, adults with measles should stay off work and avoid social functions and gatherings until they too are free of infection.

Finally, people with measles should telephone their GP surgery, NHS walk-in centre or hospital A&E unit before attending so that arrangements can be made in advance for minimising their contact with other patients who may be vulnerable to complications of measles.

Two cases of measles at James Cook University Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
Around 200 patients have been contacted after 2 cases of measles were discovered at a Middlesbrough hospital. Test results revealed both patients admitted to the James Cook University Hospital probably had the illness. However, both of the affected patients were isolated in single rooms so it is unlikely any patients have been infected while they were in hospital, say health chiefs. Members of staff who were in direct contact with the patients have also been in touch with the trust's occupational health team for confirmation of their immunity to the viral infection.

It comes as the number of cases of measles more than doubled across the North-east in the last year, according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). 38 laboratory confirmed measles cases were recorded in 2012, up from 18 the previous year.

As a precautionary measure, James Cook [University Hospital) has sent letters to around 200 people who were inpatients on 2 wards -- ward 3 and ward 15 -- the same time as the 2 measles patients, to make them aware of the symptoms to look out for. Clinical director of the clinical infection directorate, Dr Richard Bellamy, said: "Although we are still waiting for official confirmation that the patients have measles, we have taken the precautionary measure of contacting patients who were on these wards at the same time. "It's important to stress we do think the risk of anyone contracting measles is low but we wanted to minimise the chances of the illness being passed onto anyone else.

"The letters sent out basically explain the current situation, the symptoms to look out for and what people should do if these symptoms arise." It usually takes about 2 weeks from catching measles to becoming ill. The early symptoms are a raised temperature, cough, runny nose, and red and watery eyes. The trademark rash of spots associated with measles normally appears a few days later on the neck or hairline and spreading down the body. While there is no treatment for the illness, it can be prevented by the MMR vaccine which is why parents are encouraged to check their child's vaccinations are up-to-date for their age, say health chiefs.

Latest figures from the HPA show the uptake for MMR vaccine is still increasing in the region and is above the national average. For the 2nd quarter of 2012 94.1 percent of local children have had the 1st dose of the vaccine at 24 months, compared to 92.2 percent in England and Wales. By 5-years-old 91.5 percent of children have had their 2nd MMR dose compared with 87.5 percent nationally.

Anyone who has concerns and has a fever and a rash should contact their local GP -- or GP out-of-hours service -- by telephone. They should not attend their GP surgery, GP walk-in centre as measles is easily spread to others at this stage.

Somaliland government works to contain measles outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Somaliland regional government announced a measles outbreak in the Marodi Jeh region on Sunday (13 Jan 2013). 52 measles cases were documented last week, Director of Public Health in the Ministry of Health Ali Sheikh Omer said.

Some of the infected patients have been admitted to Hargeisa General Hospital for treatment. "Eleven of them were transferred from regions outside Hargeisa, and the infected patients are of varying ages," Omer told Sabahi.

The Ministry of Health is trying to prevent the outbreak from spreading to other parts of the region as the rainy season begins, said Somaliland Deputy Minister of Health Nim'o Hussein Ghawdan.

The ministry sent 12 mobile medical teams to rural areas in Marodi Jeh on Sunday on a mission to vaccinate children aged 6 months to 15 years, Omer said. They also sent 11 teams to Hargeisa, where the vaccine is being offered at clinics for mothers and children. In the past few years, there have been several outbreaks of the disease in the Somaliland region, with several deaths linked to the disease in Togdheer in July 2012. The ministry will begin a measles vaccination campaign in mid-2013, Omer said.

Experts blame lack of immunization coverage for Pakistan's measles outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In 2012, measles "claimed the lives of more than 300 children in Pakistan," with more than 200 of those deaths from Sindh province, and health experts and the WHO are saying "the huge difference in routine immunisation coverage between the provinces, districts and cities is at the root of the measles outbreak," Inter Press Service (IPS) reports.

"The government has started a mass immunization campaign from 1 Jan 2013 for children aged 9 months to 10 years in 8 districts of Sindh," according to the news service. "The outbreak casts serious doubts over official claims that 82 percent of under-fives in Sindh are immunized," according to the IPS, D.S.

Public health failings behind Pakistan's measles surge
---------------------------------------------
Child health experts in Pakistan say that the country's measles outbreak could have been prevented if the government had heeded warnings about poor vaccine coverage, Haris Riaz reports. Poor quality and ailing vaccination programmes, beleaguered with corruption, have been blamed for Pakistan's recent surge in measles.

The epidemic, which started in October 2012, has claimed more than 200 lives and has resulted in a large number of hospital admissions. Compared with the 64 deaths in 2011, measles witnessed a staggering upsurge in 2012 with a record 306 fatalities, according to WHO. The number of measles cases has also increased from 4000 in 2011 to 14 000 in 2012.

Zulfiqar Bhutta, Founding Chair of the Division of Women and Child Health at Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan, tells The Lancet that the community demand for childhood vaccines is not being fulfilled in most areas of the Sindh province, where most of the deaths (210 of 306 in 2012) have occurred. He insists that the poor coverage is due to the lack of human and vaccination resources "to those who need it the most. We have also confused people over the years by delivering some vaccines such as polio door to door and insisting that parents take their young infants and children many a mile for other vaccines," he adds.

"This was a tragedy in waiting. We have been predicting for a while now that without adequate cover with routine immunisations in many parts of Pakistan, notably in rural populations, there was bound to be a situation where you would have an outbreak like this." Bhutta suggests that the problem has been compounded by several factors including devolution of health care to provinces and transition of services such as the extended programmes of immunisation without adequate preparation.

He adds: "One contributing factor to excess mortality could be the massive rates of malnutrition, particularly in Sindh, which probably would lead to reduced immunity and adverse consequences of disease. The fact that the disease [measles] is completely preventable and has been prevented in countries including Afghanistan with a much more meagre health care system, puts the blame squarely and solely on the failure of routine immunisation systems."

Bhutta denounces the reports suggesting a link between floods and the measles epidemic. "The floods of 2010 and 2011 could have contributed to the outbreak, but the distribution of the disease belies that. These are much more mainstream regions which have just witnessed a massive failure of public health preventive programmes."

Firdous Jahan, Head of the Family Medicine Department at Oman Medical College, Oman, who has previously worked at Aga Khan University, adds that the vaccination campaigns in Pakistan are fraught with corruption. "There is tremendous corruption at the highest level necessitating a transparent organisation responsible for audit of the funds and accountability of the involved personnel." She thinks that WHO should consider diverting funds from the governmental agencies to "credible" agencies.

President of the Pakistan Paediatric Association, Iqbal Memon, recommends that the vaccination be done in a regional manner rather than countrywide immunisation on predesignated days. He emphasises the need for more vaccination centres, provision of vaccines to paediatric practitioners, and increased accessibility to the vaccination centres for the public.

Abdul Momin Kazi from the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Aga Khan University, says: "Health has never been a high priority for government. In addition to the poor health system, low health budget, lack of awareness, misconceptions regarding polio vaccine, and corruption are key hurdles. Social unrest due to the war on terror, mistrust due to a fake vaccination campaign, [and the] issues of refugees and conflict zones add to the complications."

"The majority of measles cases we encountered were unaware of immunisation; those who were aware lacked access," says Aisha Mehnaz, Head of Paediatrics at the Civil Hospital Karachi. She adds that with the exponential increase in the population, the allocation of funds to the health sector should also be amplified.

Ashfaq Mala from Konpal, a non-governmental organisation working against child abuse in Pakistan, blames government agencies for making false claims about coverage and estimates that the actual coverage is "much less than 70 percent." He also expresses concerns about training of personnel and the ability of centres to maintain an appropriate cold chain.

Meanwhile, the government has tried to respond to the outbreak with a drive to immunise around 3 million children in high-risk zones during the first weeks of January.

Measles cases confirmed in Orange County
------------------------------------
Orange County Health Officials are warning about a measles epidemic that they say is putting everyone in Central Florida at risk. The announcement comes after 4 children in Orange County -- all from the same family -- came down with the highly contagious virus infection.

"If it's an epidemic yeah it would be scary," said a mother, who was playing with her young son at Lake Eola park. In fact, measles is so rare and can be so dangerous that just one case in Central Florida is considered an epidemic. Symptoms include everything from runny nose, rash to swelling of the brain and death. There is no treatment. "With measles, it's very highly contagious so it's easily spread from person to person," said Sara Matthews, with the Orange County Health Department. "It's a respiratory virus so coughing, sneezing and it can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after the person who's contagious has left." Matthews says the 4 infected children -- aged 4, 7, 10 and 13 -- are all now recovering.

Out of privacy, health officials would not identify where in Orange County the infected family lives or which day care or private school the kids attend, but parents of other students have been notified. "In this case, the family had chosen not to vaccinate all 4 of the kids and that's what made them really highly susceptible to the measles virus," said Matthews. Health officials are still trying to find the source of the outbreak and whether there are any more cases.

The last time there was a measles case in Orange County was in spring 2011. Health officials highly recommend everyone in Central Florida to be vaccinated. They say due to the high level of international tourists and the growing trend of parents not vaccinating their children, we could see more and more cases of the measles. However, [those] who have received a measles vaccine or have had measles in the past, are likely immune to the virus.

The symptoms of measles generally begin approximately 7 to 14 days after a person is exposed and include: Measles is spread through the air by infectious droplets and is highly contagious. It can be transmitted from 4 days before the rash becomes visible to 4 days after the rash appears.
