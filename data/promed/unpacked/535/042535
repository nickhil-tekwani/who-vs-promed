All 4 cases were reported in Wenshan city, and these were the first report of local human H7N9 AIV case in Yunnan since 2017. One patient recovered and had been discharged from hospital, while other 3 patients (in stable condition) remained in designated hospital for treatment and quarantine.

[As of [15 Jun 2017], a total of 1533 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 592 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses and the geographical distribution of human cases in the 5th epidemic wave (i.e. onset since [1 Oct 2016]) is greater than in any earlier wave. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors are crucial. However, the number of reported confirmed cases has continued to decline over the past few weeks indicating that the peak of cases this wave was reached in mid-February 2017.

According to reports received by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on surveillance activities for avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses in China, positives among virological samples continue to be detected in poultry from live bird markets, commercial and backyard farms. Authorities in China have also announced plans to commence vaccination of domestic poultry in certain areas against infection with avian influenza A(H7) viruses beginning in July 2017 http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_06_15_2017.pdf?ua=1. - Mod.UBA
