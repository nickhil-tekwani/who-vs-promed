Regional emerging diseases center officially opens in Singapore
-----------------------------------------------
The Asia-Pacific region now has a new arsenal to fight infectious diseases
and bioterrorism threats, with the opening of the Regional Emerging
Diseases Intervention Centre in Singapore.
The opening of the REDI Centre comes a year after Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong 1st proposed it to US President George W. Bush when they met in
Washington last May 2004.
"In the coming years, there will be other infectious diseases which will
have serious impact on the region. It is my hope that REDI will do its part
to ensure we are all ready to handle such crises," said Singapore Acting
Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.
"Through vigilance and cooperation, we can minimize the impact of these new
emerging, and re-emerging, diseases."
Set up at a cost of S 400 000 [approximately USD $233,622 at the current
exchange rate - Mod.MPP] , the REDI Centre's top priority is the
surveillance of emerging infectious diseases like SARS.
But, the Centre, nestled alongside key research institutes, and
pharmaceutical companies, will also be a base for the training of public
health officials, researchers, clinicians, and other health professionals.
"While this Centre is primarily bilateral, we hope to see other countries
come into the REDI Centre to share their expertise, to learn, and to
participate, particularly in training activities that will take place here
on the ground," said Claude Allen, US deputy secretary of Health and Human
Services.
"That's what's key about this, that the REDI Centre is not just a bilateral
activity. It's a bilateral activity that hopes to draw multi-national
support and cooperation."
Backed by the US Centers for Disease Control, and the Food and Drug
Administration, the REDI Centre hopes to increase its staff, from the
present 4 to 15, and to start training courses by the end of 2004.
The Centre is headed by Dr. Kimi-Lin from the US National Institutes of Health.
Its 1st project is flu surveillance.
"In light of the Avian Influenza earlier in 2004, we're quite concerned
about the emergence of a new strain of the influenza virus. And, if a new
strain comes out that most populations in the world have no immunity
against, that means the new strain could cause a pandemic outbreak," said
Dr. Kimi-Lin.
It is hoped that REDI can tap US and regional expertise to develop new
vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests.
Already, the Centre's many-hands approach has received a shot in the arm
from the World Health Organization.
WHO head, Dr. Lee Jong Wook, has affirmed its commitment to work with the
REDI Centre during a visit to Singapore in Apr 2004.

[ProMED-mail applauds the development of this regional disease center. At
the 11th International Congress of Virology, held in Australia in 1999 (see
ProMED-mail posting Emerging infectious diseases, surveillance
19990809.1378), there was extensive discussion on the need to improve upon
disease surveillance initiatives, especially, for newly emerging, and
re-emerging, infectious diseases. As many of the newly recognized emerging
diseases have their geographic origins (of recognition) in East Asia (Nipah
virus, SARS, avian influenza in humans, antigenic shifts and drifts of
human influenza viruses, to name a few), the establishment of such a center
in the region seems timely and appropriate. - Mod.MPP]
