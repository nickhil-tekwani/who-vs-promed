Australia. 17 Apr 2014. Dengue fever has broken out in Nauru, affecting 2 asylum seekers and a site worker at the offshore detention centre, which houses 1166 asylum seekers.

[ProMED-mail would not normally post a report of just 3 cases. However, this is an unusual situation with potential to develop into a much larger outbreak if vigorous mosquito vector control measures are not implemented quickly to avoid further virus transmission.

Africa:
---
Mozambique (Cabo Delgado province). 20 Apr 2014. Dengue (conf.) 16 cases.

[ProMED-mail does not usually report small numbers of cases. However, since reports of outbreaks of any size from Africa are few, this report is worthy of notice. ProMED will appreciate receiving reports of any additional cases in Mozambique, or elsewhere in Africa.
