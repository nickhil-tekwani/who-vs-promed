Ukraine health officials reported this week a fatal case of botulism in Chernihiv region. The patient was a 74-year-old man who fell ill after eating homemade blood sausage, which was stored for about 2 months in the refrigerator. The victim sought medical help the day after consuming the suspicious product. He was hospitalized in the infectious department of the district hospital. However, a week later the patient left the hospital without permission. Four days later, the man was hospitalized in the regional hospital, where he died 2 days later.

Since the beginning of 2021, as of [20 Jul 2021], 10 cases of botulism have been registered in Chernihiv region, 3 of which have been fatal.

In just 5 months of 2021, 43 cases of botulism were registered in Ukraine, including 1 child. A total of 6 people died.

The probable foods that led to the disease were dried and salted freshwater and sea fish (40%), meat, fish, vegetables, canned mushrooms, and other meat products.

[The neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases; a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness. Although classically foodborne from ingestion of preformed toxin, botulism can also be linked to ingestion of environmental spores, especially in infants, as well as related to unsterile needle use in illicit drug users.

"At the end of the 18th century, there were documented outbreaks of 'sausage poisoning' in Wurttemberg, Southern Germany. The biggest one occurred in 1793 in Wildbad, where 13 people became ill (6 of whom died) after eating a locally produced blood sausage.

"The above incident motivated the German poet and district medical officer Justinus Kerner (1786-1862) to investigate the problem. Although he did not succeed in discovering the bacteria that caused it, he was the 1st to publish detailed and complete descriptions of food poisoning between 1817 and 1822. He described 230 cases, most of which were linked to the consumption of sausages. He called it 'sausage' or 'fatty' poison. The illness first became known as 'Kerner's desease,' Kerner being the man who signed the death certificates of those who ate contaminated sausage. In time it became known as 'botulism' after 'botulus,' the Latin word for sausage.

"Eighty years after Kerner's work, in 1895, a botulism outbreak affected 34 people. After a funeral dinner in the small Belgian village of Ellezelles, a group of local musicians consumed smoked ham. That led to the discovery of the pathogen _Clostridium botulinum_ by Emile Pierre van Ermengem, Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Ghent, who investigated the incident. Van Ermengen discovered that botulism was intoxication, not infection, and that the toxin was produced by a spore-forming obligate anaerobic bacterium, _Clostridium botulinum_."
