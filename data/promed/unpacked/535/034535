Polio in the Syrian Arab Republic
---------------------------------
Following reports of a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases on [17 Oct 2013] in the Syrian Arab Republic, wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated from 10 of the cases under investigation. Final genetic sequencing results are pending to determine the origin of the isolated viruses. Wild poliovirus had not been detected in the Syrian Arab Republic since 1999.

Most of the cases are very young (below 2 years of age), and were un- or under-immunized. Estimated immunization rates in the Syrian Arab Republic declined from 91 percent in 2010 to 68 percent in 2012.

Even before this laboratory confirmation, health authorities in the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries had begun the planning and implementation of a comprehensive outbreak response. On [24 Oct 2013], an already-planned large scale supplementary immunization activity (SIA) was launched in the Syrian Arab Republic to vaccinate 1.6 million children against polio, measles, mumps, and rubella, in both government-controlled and contested areas.

Implementation of an SIA in Deir Al Zour [Dayr az Zawr] province commenced promptly when the 1st 'hot cases' were reported. Larger-scale outbreak response across the Syrian Arab Republic and neighbouring countries is anticipated to begin in early November 2013, to last for at least 6 to 8 months depending on the area and based on evolving epidemiology.

Given the current situation in the Syrian Arab Republic, frequent population movements across the region and subnational immunity gaps in key areas, the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 across the region is considered to be high. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

United Nations officials confirmed an outbreak of polio among children in Syria on Tuesday [29 Oct 2013], lending urgency to plans for vaccination campaigns there and in nearby countries to try to halt the spread of the disease.

Tests confirmed polio in 10 out of 22 children in Deir al Zour Province in northeastern Syria who became ill this month [October 2013], Oliver Rosenbauer, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said. Results of tests on the other 12 children are expected soon, he added.

"With population movements, it can travel to other areas, so the risk is high of spread across the region," Mr Rosenbauer said.

United Nations officials said last week [week of 21 Oct 2013] they were launching a campaign to immunize 2.4 million children in Syria against polio and other diseases. With thousands of refugees fleeing daily from Syria's civil war to neighboring countries, they are also intensifying immunization efforts in 6 countries, including Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey, which have taken in more than 2 million Syrian refugees, as well as Egypt and Israel.

Most of the affected children in Syria are under 2 years old, Mr Rosenbauer said, underscoring the impact of 31 months of conflict on Syria's health infrastructure. The United Nations says half a million Syrian children have not been inoculated against polio in a country where, before the conflict, 95 percent of the country's population was immunized.

Despite the difficulty of delivering vaccines in a country convulsed by war, the United Nations Children's Fund said it had vaccinated about a million Syrian children this year [2013], including 800 000 who were vaccinated against polio.

After confirming the presence of the disease, attention is turning to identifying the source, Mr Rosenbauer said. Public health officials have speculated that a possible source may have been jihadists traveling to Syria from Pakistan which, with Afghanistan and Nigeria, are the only countries where the disease is still endemic.

The outbreak of polio in Syria "shows you have to eradicate the disease in the endemic countries because from there it will spread no matter where you are," Mr Rosenbauer, who works with the World Health Organization's Polio Eradication Initiative, said in an interview.

The polio outbreak in Syria was "a setback" like any upsurge in the disease, but health officials were seeing significant progress in curbing the disease in endemic countries, Mr Rosenbauer said. In Pakistan and Nigeria, the disease is geographically more restricted and in southern Afghanistan, the area of the country where the disease is endemic, no new cases had been reported this year [2013]. "That's never happened before," he said.

[The reports above provide confirmation of the previously highly suspected cases of polio in Syria. At present 10 of the 22 suspected cases have been confirmed. The information provided to date suggests that the civil unrest has significantly impacted public health initiatives in Syria, where polio vaccination coverage had been 95 percent prior to the civil unrest. The observation that "most" of the cases in Syria are less than 2 years old and were unvaccinated, suggests that the 31 months of civil unrest have disrupted the routine vaccination activities of the country.

Information that is still pending includes the genetic studies on the WPV identified in this outbreak to know the probable source of the transmission. It is tempting to speculate the virus' origin, possibly the same virus as currently circulating in nearby Israel, Gaza strip, and Egypt, where viruses genetically related to those currently circulating in Pakistan have been identified in asymptomatic individuals as well as in sewage samples in these areas. That being said, the affected region is in the eastern part of Syria near the border with Iraq and one wonders if there might be 'silent' circulation of the WPV in neighboring Iraq as well.
