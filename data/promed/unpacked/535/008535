On 26 Dec 2019, our last post of 2019 on MERS-CoV, we announced that "During the period 15-26 Dec 2019, there have been no newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia." Subsequent to that, there was a case with date of onset 20 Dec 2019 that was reported, as well as outcomes including 2 fatalities.

There have been no newly confirmed cases reported since the case below, including through today, Fri 3 Jan 2020.

[This is where we have to put in a disclaimer comment. While we are stating in this report there have been no newly confirmed cases reported since 21 Dec 2019, recent experience with the Saudi MOH website is for delayed reporting of newly confirmed cases being added retrospectively by presumed date of confirmation.

That being said, during the month of December 2019, there were a total of 4 newly confirmed cases reported in Saudi Arabia including 3 fatalities. The 4th case is still pending outcome information.

Checking the line listing I maintain, during the period 1 Jan 2019 through 31 Dec 2019, there were a total of 205 newly confirmed cases, including 57 deaths (case fatality ratio 27.8%). Cases were reported from 11 of the 13 regions: Riyadh (119), Ash Sharqiyah/Eastern (20), Al Qasim (18), Asir (13), Makkah (13), Najran (8), Al Madinah (8), Al Jawf (2), Jizan (2), Tabuk (1), and Al Hudud Ash Shamaliyah (1).

Of the 205 cases, 130 (63.3%) were classified as primary cases, of which 54 (26.3% of the total cases) had a history of camel contact preceding onset of illness; 30 (14.6%) were classified as secondary healthcare-facility-associated transmission cases; 14 (6.8%) were classified as secondary cases in household contacts; and 31 (15.1%) were classified as unknown.
