A boy, bitten by a bat with rabies, found it at Gocio Elementary School
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sarasota Health Department has issued an alert after a student at
Gocio Elementary School found a rabid bat on campus Monday [12 Apr
2010], brought it into his classroom and passed it around to other
students.

"We absolutely want anyone to contact us who has touched or may have
been in contact with the bat," said Quintin Clark, environmental
director for the Sarasota Health Department.

Clark said half a dozen students in the boy's classroom touched the
infected animal. The child's mother also handled the animal. He says
all of them -- especially the boy who found the bat and suffered a
bite -- need treatment to prevent rabies.

"It's not very painful at all," Clark said. "It's not like it used to be."

School administrators at Gocio only notified parents of students who
share the same classroom with the boy, even though the student found
the dying animal on campus. They didn't think it was necessary to
alert other students and parents.

Managers at the Boys and Girls Club of Sarasota took a different
approach after learning the boy carried the bat to their after-school
program on a school bus. They say he never took it out of his
backpack, but they notified all parents in the program in an
abundance of caution.

"We wanted to make sure they knew about it so if they were concerned
then they could go to the next step as well," said J. Mack Reid,
president of the Boys and Girls Club of Sarasota.

Health department investigators say anyone who touched the infected
bat should contact the department. They say bat bites are often no
more than painless pinpricks but the outcome is serious.

"It's a big deal because rabies is fatal if left untreated," Clark said.

The health department says everyone should follow several guidelines
to minimize exposure to rabies:

- Do not handle or feed wild animals.

- Don't adopt wild animals or bring them inside; don't try to nurse
sick animals to health. Instead, call the local animal control agency
or animal rescue agency.

- Be particularly cautious about any contact with an animal that
appears sick or is acting in an unusual manner.

[It is unlikely that anyone on the bus was exposed to rabies if the
injured animal was never taken out of the backpack. However, since
rabies is a fatal or almost always fatal disease, an abundance of
caution is probably the appropriate approach. - Mod.TG]

Stray Cat Bites Prompt Rabies Alert
Homeowner, Driver Attacked In Volusia County
--------------------------------------------
The Volusia County Health Department has issued a rabies alert for
portions of 2 cities and part of the county after 2 unprovoked
attacks on people by feral cats.

A cat bit a driver and passenger in South Daytona on 9 Mar 2010,
after the motorist hit the cat and the 2 people tried to help the
animal. [In the case of an animal being hit by a vehicle, it is
natural to assess the condition of the animal, realizing the animal
may bite or scratch out of fear. That fear may not be associated with
rabies at that moment in time. - Mod.TG]

Another cat ran into a private home in Port Orange and attacked the
homeowner on 12 Apr 2010.

Both cats were euthanized and tested positive for rabies.

Officials encouraged the public not to feed or approach feral cats or
other wildlife.

[Rabies is fatal to cats and dogs and owners should be encouraged to
vaccinate their pets, including horses and cattle. Rabies is usually
fatal to people. Exposed people need to seek medical attention for
post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]
