Italy: Death of First Victim of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A 27-year-old Sicilian woman died on Wed 6 Aug 2003 of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD], becoming Italy's first victim of the brain-wasting malady linked to
mad cow disease, doctors said. Dr. Fabrizio Tagliavini, director of the
division of neuropathology of the Carlo Besta National Neurological
Institute in Milan, said the woman had been hospitalized there for several
months.
In a telephone interview, Tagliavini said there were no other diagnosed
cases in Italy of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad
cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE]. The young woman's
disease had been confirmed by testing performed in Britain, he said.
BSE has infected cattle in much of Europe, and the human version has killed
more than 100 people overseas, mostly Britons. BSE is believed to spread
through recycled meat and bones from infected animals used in cattle feed.
The human form of the disease appears to be contracted by eating meat
contaminated by the BSE agent.

[In addition to this fatal case of vCJD in Italy, there are reports of 139
cases of definite or probable vCJD in the United Kingdom, 6 cases in
France, and one each in Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong and the USA. The vCJD
cases in Canada, Hog Kong and USA all resided for one or more period in the
UK, or parts of Europe with outbreaks of BSE in cattle, and are presumed to
have been exposed to the vCJD agent there. Currently there are reports of
suspected, but unconfirmed, cases of vCJD in the Czech Republic, New
Zealand and Spain. Suspected cases in Guadeloupe, Russia and South Africa
have been discounted. - Mod.CP]
