From: Carlos Barcelo <barcelo@heinsa.sld.cu>

We have read with a great surprise the news of El Nuevo Dia Interactivo,
San Juan, Puerto Rico, of 1 June 1999 regarding an imaginary diarrheal
outbreak in Havana, in which it was said that the National Institute of
Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology warned the population "to boil water
and maintain the most strict measures of environmental hygiene in order to
combat the epidemic produced by a bacterium, presumed to be transmitted by
oral contact with foods infected by rodents and insects, as well as by
contamination of the waters which feed aqueducts of the capital".
We want to know which source this information came from, because officially
our institute staff brought such information any moment this year and there
is no existence of epidemic with an hydric of food etiology [sic.
Information surveillance systems which are readily available in scientific
public health institutions allow us to know about any outbreak as soon as
possible. This is not currently a problem.
The Cuban health system maintains our population well informed on a
regular basis to protect people against water-borne and food-source
illness. It is interesting that your scientific review brings distorted
information about health in Cuba.

[It looks like the newspaper El Nuevo Dia Interactivo in San Juan, Puerto
Rico, is once again at odds with the reports from the Cuban National
Institute of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology. In this case, and the
earlier report about dengue in
Havana, it seems likely that routine preventive health information to the
public in Cuba about dengue & diarrheal disease is being interpreted in the
Puerto Rican press as indicating that outbreaks of those diseases are
currently occurring.
One reason for posting reports of outbreaks and unusual health events that
are found in lay press reports is to verify the information encountered so
that misinformation can be corrected. We therefore appreciate this reply
from the Cuban National Institute of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Microbiology
