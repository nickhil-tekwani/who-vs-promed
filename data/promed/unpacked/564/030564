1st Report of Stem and Root Rot of Tomato Caused by _Phytophthora
capsici_ in South Africa.
N. Labuschagne, Department of Microbiology and Plant Pathology,
University of Pretoria, Pretoria 0002, South Africa; A. H. Thompson,
ARC-Roodeplaat, Vegetable and Ornamental Plant Institute, Private Bag
×293, Pretoria 0001, South Africa; and W. J. Botha, ARC-Roodeplaat,
Plant Protection Research Institute, Private Bag ×134, Pretoria 0001,
South Africa. Plant Dis. 87:1540, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-1006-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 23 Sep 2003.
Tomato plants, grown in open hydroponics systems under shadecloth and
plastic near Barberton and Pretoria in South Africa and Srelebi
Phikwe in Botswana, developed symptoms of wilting with brown-to-black
cankers on the lower stems, blackening of the vascular tissues, and
root rot.
Pathogens isolated from affected tissues were identified as
_Phytophthora capsici_ Leonian (1) and _Pythium aphanidermatum_
(Edson) Fitzp. (2). They occurred separately or together. _Pythium
aphanidermatum_ has previously been recorded on tomato in South
Africa.
_P. capsici_ isolates were papillate, caducous, grew at >36 C, had
tapered sporangial bases, and a maximum sporangial length of >70
micrometers. Koch's postulates were confirmed by inoculating
4-week-old tomato seedlings (cv. Floradade) grown at 22-30 C in a
steam-pasteurized mixture of sawdust compost, pine bark, and
vermiculite (3:2:1). Plugs from V8 juice agar cultures of _P.
capsici_ were placed on wounds made on the stems of 10 seedlings. 10
wounded uninoculated plants served as controls.
Water-soaked lesions were visible on the stems of all inoculated
plants after 2 days. Control plants remained healthy. After 4 days,
lesions turned dark brown with affected plants wilted or dead.
Reisolation yielded _P. capsici_. The experiment was repeated with
similar results.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _P. capsici_ on
tomatoes in South Africa.

[In addition to tomato, _Phytophthora capsici_ (Pc) infects a number
of crops monitored by ProMED-Plant including cucumber, pumpkin,
summer and winter squashes, zucchini, bell pepper, chili pepper,
eggplant, and watermelon. Pc spores can survive for years in soil.
High soil moisture predisposes plants to infection. Disease
management involves avoiding the planting of crops susceptible to Pc,
use of crop rotation to include maize or small grains, application of
copper fungicides, and implementation of phytosanitary regimens to
minimize spread of the pathogen to equipment. Use of pathogen-free
transplants is recommended. In hydroponics operations, strict
management of the circulating nutrient solutions is essential to
avoid introduction of the pathogen. - Mod.DH]
