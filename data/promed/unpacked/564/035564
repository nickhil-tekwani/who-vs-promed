A total of 1746 cases of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in cattle have been reported in Mongolia so far this year [2022], and 1255 of them have been slaughtered, local media reported on Thursday [13 Oct 2022].

So far, the eastern province of Sukhbaatar and southern provinces of Dundgovi and Dornogovi have been quarantined due to the disease, said the report, citing the country's General Authority for Veterinary Services.

Lumpy skin disease is a viral infection of cattle characterized by fever, enlarged superficial lymph nodes and multiple nodules on the skin and mucous membranes.

The livestock sector is a main pillar of the Mongolian economy with around 70 million heads of livestock in the country with a population of around 3.4 million.

[Lumpy skin disease was reported by Mongolia to the WOAH on 7 Sep 2021, indicating a start date of 21 Aug 2021.

Initially a sub-Saharan African cattle disease, LSD started its spread eastward from western Asia/Middle east into central, eastern and southern Asia since 2019, eventually penetrating (in chronological order), Asian Russia, Kazakhstan, China (mainland), India, Bangladesh, Taiwan, Viet Nam, Bhutan, Hong Kong (SAR-RPC), Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Mongolia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore, and, most recently, Afghanistan. Its spread in India has been accelerating during 2022, becoming an economic issue of considerable dimensions.

Vaccination of the entire susceptible cattle population in regions facing LSDV introduction or already affected, is the proven effective measure to minimise the number of outbreaks and eventually accomplish a satisfactory control of the disease. High vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels should be achieved.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
