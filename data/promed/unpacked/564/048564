In its latest epidemiologic update on avian influenza [published 25 Jan 2018; see comments below] the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said that the highly pathogenic avian flu situation in the 2nd panzootic wave, under way since 2013, is notable. Factors include a substantial number of countries and territories affected by outbreaks in domestic birds, a substantial number of outbreaks, and circulation of diverse subtypes, which has added complexity to control and eradication.

In January 2018, 8 countries (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Taiwan, Iraq, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa) and 2 of the world's regions (Africa and Asia) were affected by outbreaks in poultry.

Compared with the 1st panzootic that took place from 2005 through 2012, the current panzootic is marked by triple the number of circulating avian flu subtypes (12 versus 4). In the current panzootic, nearly 120 million birds were lost through disease and culling, and all regions of the world have been affected, with 68 countries reporting at least one outbreak. H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 have been the commonest strains.

Most recently, new and recurring outbreaks of H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6 have struck Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, with signs that the geographic distribution is increasing. From a public health perspective, H7N9, H5N6, and H5N1 post the greatest threats to humans.

In outbreak developments, Taiwan today [23 Feb 2018] reported 4 more highly pathogenic H5N2 outbreaks in poultry, 3 on farms and one detected at a slaughter house, according to a separate report from the OIE. The events began on 11 and 12 Feb 2018, striking locations in Taichung City, as well as Chiayi, Pingtung, and Yunlin counties. Affected species included native chickens and breeding geese. Taken together, the outbreaks killed 1321 of 30 767 susceptible birds, and the rest were destroyed as part of response steps. ["Chinese Taipei" OIE Follow-up report no. 90, included the following epidemiological comments: "Samples from Chiayi county, Pingtung county, and Yunlin county were sent to the National Laboratory, Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) for diagnosis. HPAI H5N2 subtype was confirmed by AHRI. The infected farms have been placed under movement restriction. All animals on the infected farms have been culled. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km [2 mi] radius of the infected farms are under intensified surveillance for 3 months. Suspected signs were observed in poultry carcasses during post-mortem inspection in one abattoir in Taichung City. Samples were sent to the AHRI for diagnosis. H5N2 subtype HPAI was confirmed by the AHRI. The carcasses were destroyed and thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted in the abattoir. After tracing back to the farm of origin, any positive results will be included in follow-up reports."

[Subscribers are encouraged to visit the full text of OIE's "Situation Report for Avian Influenza", updated 25 Jan 2018 (12 pages, available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/OIE_SituationReport_AI_January2018_01.pdf). The richly documented report (maps, tables, graphs) concludes with the following 3 key messages:

"1. The northern hemisphere winter season is typically associated with an increased risk for avian influenza. In 2017-18 there have been new and reoccurring outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 and H5N6 in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Veterinary authorities in these countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity. However, the new outbreaks in poultry in Iraq, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), and Saudi Arabia indicate the geographic distribution of these subtypes is still increasing, and veterinary authorities must continue to respond to this risk.

"2. The zoonotic avian influenza viruses that have been detected in China (H7N9 and H5N6) and parts of Africa and Asia (H5N1) pose the most significant public health risks.

"Veterinary authorities have struggled to control the situation, which has allowed these viruses to continue to circulate in poultry populations. This creates the risk of reassortment from co-infections of different influenza viruses, and public health risks through exposure of people to avian influenza viruses during rearing and slaughter.

"Although there are seasonal trends, the risk is year round since the viruses have become established and self-sustaining in bird populations. The role of commercially farmed poultry, backyard poultry, live bird marketing systems, and wild birds of differing species in maintenance of the virus and transmission will have a local context that needs to be understood through epidemiological study.

"3. The OIE Standards, and the transparency of reporting through the OIE's World Animal Health Information System, provide the framework for veterinary services to implement effective surveillance, reporting, and controls for avian influenza. Wild bird surveillance can indicate periods of heightened risk, and at these times measures to improve on-farm biosecurity may reduce the likelihood of exposure of poultry. The veterinary services of OIE members respond to their national situations in accordance with their national policies and their economic and technical resources.

"There is no scientific evidence that supports the killing or culling of free-ranging wild birds, or other free-ranging wildlife, to control avian influenza. Detections of avian influenza, including highly pathogenic avian influenza, in wild birds alone do not result in a country losing its status as free from highly pathogenic avian influenza, and there is no justification for imposition of restrictions on trade in poultry or poultry products for such countries."

Since the said OIE update was published, Afghanistan notified HPAI H5 in poultry; Israel notified HPAI H5N8; Iran, Ireland Netherlands, and Sweden notified HPAI H5N6; and on 14 Feb 2018 Ghana submitted an immediate notification reporting an outbreak of "highly pathogenic avian influenza H9N2" (see 20180215.5628421).

In view of the fact that AI H9N2 serotype has been known, globally, thus far only as a low pathogenic strain, Mod.CRD commented in the post, "further laboratory studies may be needed to fully characterize the virus". This falls in line with the following epidemiological comment currently included in Ghana's immediate notification of 14 Feb 2017: "Confirmatory results are pending from the OIE Reference Laboratory of Padova, where pathogenicity and molecular analysis will be finally determined. If the high pathogenicity of the isolate is not confirmed, the report will be removed in three weeks."

Ghana's immediate notification is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=25915. - Mod.AS]
