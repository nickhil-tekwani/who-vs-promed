The body of a leopard was found in the Ramgarh block of Nainital
District on Wed [4 Aug 2010], raising the number of deaths of the
feline to about 71 in Uttarakhand since January this year [2010].
Locals found the body of the leopard on a road in the Jhutia area of
Ramgarh in the morning and informed the Forest Department about it.
According to Nainital Divisional Forest officer [DFO] Biju Lal TR who
visited the site to recover the body of the feline, the post-mortem
examination of the leopard conducted in the Nainital Zoo established
pneumonia as the cause of death of the female leopard aged about 7
years which had also not eaten for the past 8 days. However, wildlife
activists state that cases of intentional poisoning of wild animals,
especially leopards, are increasing consistently in Uttarakhand but
department officials are trying to present such deaths as fatalities
caused by natural factors like old age and sickness.

According to DFO Biju Lal the employees of the department in Ramgarh
were informed about the [case] at about 8 am and the forester and
range officer reached the site within 15 minutes and the body was
taken to the Nainital Zoo for post mortem examination. The post
mortem report revealed that the leopard had died of pneumonia, which
was exacerbated by the fact that the feline had not eaten anything
for the past 8 days. The viscera of the leopard will be sent to the
Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly for
examination and to the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) in Dehradun
for DNA finger printing.

The DFO said that on visiting the site he was convinced that the
death had not been caused by human actions like intentional poisoning
as the area was sparsely populated and the nearest farms are located
many miles away from the site from where the body of the leopard was
found. According to the veterinarians who conducted the post mortem
examination, it is common for wild animals to be afflicted by
pneumonia during rainy season, added the DFO.

However, the explanation provided by the Forest Department is not
convincing wildlife activists who question the possibility of a
mature wild animal contracting pneumonia due to rains which haven't
caused pneumonia in humans.

However, local residents stated that the leopard died in agony
because the site from where its body was found was dotted with
scratch marks made by the feline. In the recent past at least 2
bovines and dogs in the area have been killed by a feline, and one of
these kills was most likely poisoned by a local resident. People
abandon their unproductive cattle to roam in the forests where they
end up being preyed upon by wild cats, which in turn increases the
probability of the felines being habituated to preying on cattle.
According to Rajendra Agrawal of Wildlife Protection Society of India
(WPSI), there has been a consistent rise in incidents of leopards
being poisoned by villagers but the department officials are trying
to present these fatalities as natural deaths caused by factors like
old age and sickness.

As the State chief minister himself is in-charge of the Forest
Ministry, only direct intervention from his office can protect the
leopards in Uttarakhand because the department is not fixing the
answerability for leopard deaths on its officials. At the present
rate of death leopards could be wiped out of Uttarakhand in the next
5 years if concrete steps are not taken to protect it, warned Agrawal.

[Two questions:
1. How has the 8-day "non-eating" period been established or calculated?
2. Which "DNA fingerprints" are expected to be carried out in WII?

Results of the tests which are said to be performed by IVRI and WII
are anticipated; toxicological tests are expected to be included. -Mod.AS]
