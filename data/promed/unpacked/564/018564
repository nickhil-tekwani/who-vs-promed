Experts have reported the 1st case of swine flu that is resistant to
Tamiflu [oseltamivir], the main drug being used to fight the pandemic.
Roche Holding AG confirmed a patient with H1N1 influenza in Denmark showed
resistance to the antiviral drug. David Reddy, company executive, said it
was not unexpected given that common seasonal flu could do the same.

The news comes as a 9 year old girl has become the 3rd to die in the UK
with swine flu. It is understood from her doctors at Birmingham Children's
Hospital that she had underlying health conditions. It is not yet known
whether swine flu contributed to her death.

Meanwhile, the Department of Health has announced a big jump in the number
of patients in England confirmed with swine flu, up 1604 since Friday [26
Jun 2009], taking the UK total so far to 5937. A Health Protection Agency
spokeswoman stated that: "Routine sampling in the UK has shown that there
is currently no resistance to oseltamivir or zanamivir." Experts have been
using Tamiflu, also known as oseltamivir, in a bid to stop the H1N1
spreading in communities. If taken early, it ensures that symptoms are mild
and reduces the chance of a victim giving the illness to someone else.

This 1st reported case of resistance developed in a swine flu patient
taking Tamiflu. Mr Reddy stressed that there were no signs of a
Tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 circulating in the community. This is in
contrast to seasonal H1N1 flu, where a Tamiflu resistant strain emerged
last year [2009] and is now widely circulating. Experts fear if this were
to happen, it could render Tamiflu ineffective [in treatment of the swine
flu H1N1 virus infection].

Another antiviral drug, called zanamivir or Relenza, made by
GlaxoSmithKline, is also effective against swine flu. The UK government has
been stockpiling these antiviral drugs and currently has enough to treat
half of the population, with a contract to bring that up to 80 per cent as
soon as possible. Supplies of flu vaccine have also been ordered, and the
1st doses could be administered in the autumn [2009].

A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency said: "The Health Protection
Agency continues to watch for antiviral resistance and will be carrying out
regular sample testing throughout this outbreak. We have been monitoring
antiviral drug resistance since the beginning of this outbreak. Routine
sampling in the UK has shown that there is currently no resistance to
oseltamivir or zanamivir." Virologist Professor John Oxford said: "I'm not
surprised about this finding. The question is whether it is going to
spread. We will soon know the answer."

[According to the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme Weekly Electronic
Bulletin of 26 Jun 2009 (<http://www.euroflu.org/>), all seasonal A(H1N1)
viruses tested have been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir but
resistant to M2 inhibitors, although elsewhere Tamiflu resistance has been
observed in A H1N1 seasonal viruses. The emergence of Tamiflu-resistant 209
swine-origin A H1N1 influenza virus is not unexpected in view of the
widespread and somewhat indiscriminate use of the drug in the treatment of
what is still a relatively mild disease. It remains to be seen whether the
Tamiflu-resistant virus will spread in Europe and beyond and appear
independently elsewhere. It is presumed that the Tamiflu-resistant virus
isolated in Denmark remains sensitive to the alternate neuraminidase
inhibiter Relenza. - Mod.CP]
