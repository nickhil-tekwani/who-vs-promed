Dead cows in southern Indiana being investigated
------------------------------------------------
Purdue University veterinary pathologists are investigating the deaths of
12 cattle at a farm in southern Indiana, but they say it's unlikely the
cause is either bluetongue virus or epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD)
virus. The veterinarians say they won't be able to pinpoint why the Clark
County animals died until diagnostic work is completed. Preliminary tissue
tests should be back in 1 to 2 days. But some of the test procedures will
take several weeks.
According to Duane Murphy, co-director of the Heeke Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL), located at the Southern Indiana-Purdue
Agricultural Center (SIPAC), a local veterinarian who looked at the cattle
did not see signs consistent with either disease. Murphy says, "We suspect
these cows died of some other causes."
He says, "It would be premature to speculate until our diagnostic
laboratory has a chance to examine tissues from these animals. Bluetongue
is extremely rare, and perhaps nonexistent in Indiana, and it's considered
a nonfatal disease. In areas where bluetongue exists, it is a mild,
non-fatal disease in cattle that causes mouth, tongue or nasal sores. It
can be deadly to sheep, but we have no record or anecdotal evidence of
cattle or sheep cases in Indiana."

Clarke County has not had bluetongue, many parts of Kentucky and Indiana
have had EHD. It seems premature to rule it out so early. Also anaplasmosis
has been diagnosed in that area in past years. - Mod.TG]
