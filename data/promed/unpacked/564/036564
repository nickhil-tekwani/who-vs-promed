[1] Haiti, Dominican Republic case update

Nearly 7000 people have now died from cholera in Haiti in an epidemic which has become one of the worst of recent decades, a top health official said on Fri 6 Jan 2012.

Jon Kim Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization, said that as of December 2011, on top of the deaths, the Haitian government had reported more than 520 000 cholera cases, with 200 new sufferers appearing each day. Andrus said it was "one of the largest cholera outbreaks in modern history to affect a single country."

There are also 21 000 cases in the neighboring Dominican Republic, where there have been 363 deaths, Andrus said at a briefing for the 2nd anniversary of the 12 Jan 2010 earthquake, which killed more than 225 000 people. The cholera outbreak erupted in October 2010 and has been widely blamed on a camp of UN peacekeepers from Nepal.

[2] The role of HealthMap and Twitter for surveillance
Date: Tue 10 Jan 2012

http://www.nature.com/news/twitter-data-accurately-tracked-haiti-cholera-outbreak-1.9770


The informal information source, Twitter, was yielding data that would have been a quicker way of detecting and tracking the deadly cholera outbreak in Haiti than traditional methods, according to a study. The study found that online social media and news feeds were faster than, and broadly as accurate as, the official records at detecting the start and early progress of the epidemic, which hit Haiti after the earthquake in January 2010 and has killed more than 6500 people.

The results appear today [10 Jan 2012] in a special section of The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, published on the 2nd anniversary of the earthquake. The authors used HealthMap, an automated surveillance platform, to measure the volume of news media generated during the 1st 100 days of the outbreak, and they also looked at the number of "cholera" posts on Twitter. They found that, as the official number of cases increased and decreased, so did the volume of informal media reports about cholera.

Rumi Chunara, a research fellow at HealthMap and Harvard Medical School, USA and lead author of the study, emphasised that these informal reports were available online up to 2 weeks before official government reports, which had to go through the traditional chain-of-command structure of public health. This means they could be used to get earlier estimates of a disease outbreak and help plan a response sooner.

Chunara highlighted that "using informal media is cost-effective, rapid, and can be used to reach populations that otherwise wouldn't have access to traditional healthcare or would not seek it." Other advantages include finer temporal and spatial resolution, and the study says informal media could be used to study the activity of other disease outbreaks around the world.

Chunara recognized that informal data sources could be biased towards urban or developed areas and certain age groups and may contain false alerts, which has to be taken on board. But she added that the informal data could complement official data in an outbreak to get timely estimates of disease dynamics.

[3] The 1st case on Hispaniola
Date: Tue 10 Jan 2012

The 1st Haitian to get cholera at the onset of the 2010 epidemic was almost undoubtedly a 28-year-old mentally disturbed man from the town of Mirebalais, researchers reported.

The man, whose name was not revealed in the report in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, was known as the village "moun fouâ€š" which is Creole for "crazy person," said the authors, who work for Partners in Health, a Boston group associated with Dr. Paul E. Farmer that has provided free health care in Haiti since 1987.

Although his family had clean drinking water, the man often walked naked through town to bathe and drink from the Latem River just downstream from the Meye River, into which raw sewage drained from an encampment of United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal. Haiti's outbreak was of a Nepali strain, and that encampment is considered the source.

The man developed severe diarrhea on 12 Oct 2010 and died in less than 24 hours. Two people who washed his body for a wake fell ill 48 hours later. Haiti's 1st hospitalized cholera case was in Mirebalais on 17 Oct 2010.

The man's habits made him the 1st known victim, said Dr. Louise C. Ivers, one of the new report's authors. But because of the infamous living situation in Mirebalais, which is desperately poor and was swollen with refugees from the devastating earthquake 9 months earlier, the epidemic was inevitable.
