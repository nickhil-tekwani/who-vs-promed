Did I miss something in the epidemiology of TB in almost any species when I
read the following quote concerning orangutans and tuberculosis:-
"So then they have to spend a year plus trying to cure them of TB because,
as you say, if they were released the disease would surely wipe them out in
the wild."
The single most striking fact that I noted, when reading material on
orangutans, is that they are essentially solitary when in the wild state.
If this is accurate, then how can TB "wipe them out" ?
Granted the disease is serious, and has indeed been a problem in zoo
collections. Zoo collections definitely qualify as providing one of the
factors in TB epidemiology, which is overcrowding, at least by orangutan
standards.
TB would also no doubt be bad news for orangutans that are held in a
rehabilitation centre after being confiscated - they would be similarly
crowded or at least in close contact.
No doubt the rehabilitators are at risk, especially if the juvenile
orangutans cling to their new surrogate mothers as described by Birute
Galdikas in her book 'Reflections of Eden '. Some wild orangutans might
contract TB from in-contact infected ex-captives, say at mating time, but
many of the infected orphans would probably never reach sexual maturity.
