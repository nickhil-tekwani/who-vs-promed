[1] USDA: comment
Date: Fri 18 Nov 206
From: Randall L Levings <Randall.L.Levings@aphis.usda.gov> [edited]


In the [Thu 17 Nov 2016] posting "Bovine tuberculosis - Canada (07): (AB) Mexican strain" [ProMED-mail posting 20161117.4636107] the moderator (TG) stated:
"Hopefully USDA has a sound collection of _Mycobacterium bovis_ strains archived ..."

We believe your readers may be interested in information on this point provided by specialists in the National Veterinary Services Laboratories, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA:

Several years ago the United States, Canada and Mexico initiated harmonization efforts for diagnostic tests and methods for diseases of importance to international trade between the three countries -- bovine tuberculosis was just one of those diseases. When whole genome sequencing of _Mycobacterium bovis_ was adopted by the USDA as the preferred genotyping method in 2013, protocols were shared with both Mexico and Canada. All 3 animal health agencies have since worked together to create a harmonized database of whole genome sequences that characterize bovine TB strains in their respective countries. In this instance the isolate that matched the Canada cow was contributed to the North American _M. bovis_ database by the Mexican government as part of these harmonization efforts. Currently there are over 2500 whole genome sequences in the North American _M. bovis_ database characterizing the major known endemic strains in all 3 countries.

We are grateful for your consideration of posting this additional information.

[2] News report

While new to Canada, the strain of tuberculosis bacteria which infected the Alberta cow at the centre of a bovine TB probe has been seen before in Mexico.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] on [Wed 16 Nov 2016] reported the strain of _Mycobacterium bovis_ found in a southeastern Alberta cow is "closely related" to a strain originating from cattle in central Mexico in 1997.

While the index herd is the only one so far to turn up an infected cow, federal quarantines are in place on "approximately" 34 farms in Alberta and 2 in southwestern Saskatchewan as of [Wed 16 Nov 2016], CFIA said.

In Alberta, CFIA veterinarians and inspectors are contacting cattle producers in Newell County, around Brooks; the part of Cypress County north of Medicine Hat; the Municipal District of Acadia; and Special Areas no. 2 and no. 3, north of those municipalities.

In Saskatchewan, producers are being contacted in an area west of Highway 4 and south of the South Saskatchewan River.

A federally reportable livestock disease, bovine TB has been subject to a mandatory nationwide eradication program since 1923.

Canada is still considered officially free of bovine TB and would lose that status only if another separate Canadian case is confirmed within 48 months. Other TB-positive animals found in connection to the current probe would not be considered a separate case.

[We appreciate the information Dr Levings and the USDA provided.

And it appears the Canadians are busy doing their traces to track down this disease. - Mod.TG
