Bluetongue: restrictions lifted in Bulgaria; re-imposed in the Balearics
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health yesterday agreed
on 2 European Commission proposals on bluetongue, a fast-spreading viral
disease of domestic and wild ruminants transmitted by insects. In view of
information received from Bulgarian authorities, based on the result of the
surveillance programme in place, the Bulgarian territory should now be
considered as free of bluetongue and the measures imposed at the end of
2001 can be lifted. The import of live animals and their semen, embryos,
and ova of species susceptible to bluetongue (sheep, goats, cattle, and
deer) from Bulgaria are now authorised.
On the other side, outbreaks of bluetongue have been confirmed at the end
of October in the Balearic island, Menorca, and in Corsica. As a result of
the outbreak in Menorca the ban on the dispatch from the Balearic Islands
of live animals susceptible to bluetongue, their semen, embryos, and ova
has been re-imposed.
The previous ban, lasting more than 2 years, had been lifted in January
2003 (see Midday Express of 1 Oct 2003). In relation to the outbreak in
Corsica, the ban remains in place. For more information on this disease

[The need to reevaluate EU requirements and measures pertaining to
bluetongue -- such as banning animal products, semen, embryos, and ova from
regions affected by bluetongue -- was discussed during the Office
International des Epizootie's 3rd International Bluetongue Symposium, held
in Taormina, Sicily from 26 to 29 Oct 2003. Bluetongue being an endemic and
expanding disease in a large part of the world, the participants exchanged
current knowledge about the vectors, the viral strains, the vaccines, and
the control methods related to the disease. Special attention was paid to
live attenuated vaccines used in Europe, mainly in Italy. France recently
decided to vaccinate sheep in Corsica against serotypes 2 and 4. According
to OIE's statement, the scientific conclusions of the symposium are
expected to allow the OIE to update its bluetongue chapter of the
Terrestrial Animal Health Code in order to achieve safe trade of animals
and animal products while avoiding unjustified barriers. - Mod.AS]
