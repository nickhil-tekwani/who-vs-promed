Cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL] is an ulcerous skin disease caused by a tropical parasite [_Leishmania_ spp.], all forms of which can be treated with the drug miltefosine.

Researchers from the National Institute of Pathology, Indian Council of Medical Research and Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi studied the responses of 86 patients treated with miltefosine over 18 months, which indicated a developing parasitic resistance to the drug, supporting a growing evidence base showing the rise of miltefosine resistance.

The researchers studied 86 patients, all confirmed to have post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Patients were initially treated with 50 mg 3 times daily for 60 days; however, some patients suffered gastrointestinal side-effects and were changed to a dose of 50 mg of miltefosine twice daily for 90 days. Due to the side effects, all patients from 2011 onwards were initiated onto this 2nd regime. The patients were followed for 18 months post-treatment and assessed monthly via a clinical and histopathological examination.

73 patients successfully completed the treatment and were cured. Four percent of patients suffered relapse in the 1st 12 months after treatment, while 15 percent relapsed in the 18 months following treatment, with a higher relapse rate seen in patients on the 60-day treatment regimen compared with the 90-day regimen. The number of parasites pre-treatment was found to be higher in the patients who later suffered a relapse.

In 6 of the relapsed cases, the researchers tested the susceptibility of the parasites to miltefosine post-relapse and compared this with susceptibility of parasites pre-treatment. Following the relapse, parasites were shown to have significantly reduced sensitivity to the treatment, suggesting the development of resistance.

Although all the patients in the study were cured through the use of miltefosine, the rate of relapse, along with the reduced drug susceptibility of the parasites following relapse, indicates that the development of drug resistance is a major concern. This indicates a pressing need for the development of new therapies or co-therapies to ensure the continued effective treatment of all forms of leishmaniasis.

[The study referred to in the text is: Ramesh V et al. Decline in Clinical Efficacy of Oral Miltefosine in Treatment of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in India. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015;9(10):e0004093.

PKDL develops up to several years after treatment of visceral leishmaniasis and leishmania parasites can be found in the cutaneous lesions in PKDL. PKDL develops in 5-15 percent of treated kala-azar case-patients in India (Salotra & Singh. Challenges in the diagnosis of post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Indian J Med Res. 2006;123:295-310), and in up to 50 percent of cases in the Sudan (Zijlstra & el-Hassan. Leishmaniasis in Sudan. Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2001;95(Suppl 1):S59-76).

Miltefosine is usually used for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis and has recently been reported to be less effective against visceral leishmaniasis (Monge-Maillo & Lopez-Velez; Miltefosine for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis: drug characteristics and evidence-based treatment recommendations. Clin Infect Dis. 2015;60:1398-404). This is certainly a concern, as miltefosine is the only oral drug available for treatment of leishmaniasis. If resistance against miltefosine is developing as suggested in these studies, a rational strategy to prevent it could be not to use miltefosine as single drug but combine it with at least one other anti-leishmania drug. - Mod.EP
