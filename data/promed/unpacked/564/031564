A true state of emergency was declared in the Doukkala region [in the administrative region of Casablanca-Settat]. A foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] crisis has been recognised. Containing its spread is currently urgent.

Sources on the ground have been surprised by the speedy spread, already involving 3 provinces: Sidi Bennour, Settat, and El Jadida. Drastic measures are being applied: zoning of suspected areas, restriction on movement of animals and prohibition of animal gatherings in the souks (markets) and fairs. Already, 2 weekly souks have been canceled. Casablanca's annual Red Meat & Milk Professional Trade Show, on 2-4 Dec 2015, will not exhibit live animals this year. "We are required to comply with the procedure," said Hammou Ouhelli, president of the Interprofessional Red Meat Federation, co-organizer of the event [details on this event, at http://www.eventseye.com/fairs/f-marocarne-milk-20886-1.html].

How did the virus reach areas that are remote from the border with Algeria? Have all Morocco's bovines been vaccinated? Are we sure of the effectiveness of the vaccine applied? Otherwise, why are revaccinations applied in the so-called closed zones? -- these questions remain unanswered.

For now, ONSSA [National Office for Food Safety] announced several measures to contain the disease outbreaks and limit its spread to other areas. In the pipeline, as reported, the vaccination of 10 000 cattle around contaminated foci.

ONSSA has already reported the slaughter and destruction of 42 cattle and 74 sheep [for an update, see commentary].

[On Wed 11 Nov 2015, Morocco submitted to the OIE its 1st follow-up report on the FMDV-O event, which reportedly started on 23 Oct 2015 and was confirmed on 29 Oct 2015. According to the current follow-up report, 4 additional outbreaks have been added to the single outbreak reported initially; all 5 are situated in the Casablanca-Settat region. The 1st outbreak was located in the Sidi Bennour province; of the added 4 outbreaks, 2 were similarly in Sidi Bennour, the 2 others in the provinces El Jadida and in Settat -- one outbreak in each. All affected farms included both cattle and sheep, but clinical cases were reported from cattle only. The report, with an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19067.

OIE's summary of the Moroccan FMD event since its start, as of 11 Nov 2015, is the following:
Total outbreaks = 5 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 52 / 16 / 0 / 52 / 0
Sheep / 74 / 0 / 0 / 74 / 0

The said summary, including a map (at the bottom) is available at http://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/t0071e/t0071e.pdff.

According to Morocco's information to the OIE, during 2014, 2 721 516 doses of FMD vaccine were used to vaccinate a national cattle population of 3 345 020 head (OIE statistics, 2014; other sources mention a national cattle population estimated around 2.7 million). However, the sheep (19 499 910 head) and goat (6 243 320; OIE statistics, 2014) populations were, reportedly, not included in the vaccination. It is extremely difficult if not practically impossible to prevent the introduction, and spread, of FMD virus (one of the most if not THE most infectious animal virus) in a country which maintains thousands of pasturing flocks, including nomadic flocks, which remained unvaccinated while neighbouring countries being FMD-infected and their flocks, at times, likely to cross borders in search of pasture/water sources. Including sheep in the mass vaccination seems crucial for the control of FMD in Morocco.

The significantly long distance of the affected region to the Algerian border is a cause for grave concern. One of the proposed explanations for this situation is the possible role of sheep in spreading the virus: infection smoldering within sheep flocks randomly moving from region to region. Another one is the illegal transportation of animals, within or across borders, to distant markets depending on periodic price fluctuations and demands, particularly before and during ritual or traditional festivities.

Other concerns relate to the efficacy of the applied vaccines and their use. According to the current follow-up report, the vaccine used during 2015 in Moroccan cattle includes (inactivated) vaccine strains covering the serotypes O-Manisa and O-3039. According to WRLFMD matching tests, the O-3039 vaccine matched the FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001, which was the one circulating during 2014 in Tunisia and Algeria, and during early 2015 in Algeria. The O-Manisa strain did not match the O/ME-SA/Ind2001 lineage. If it is confirmed that the O-3039 vaccine strain has been included in all vaccine doses administered to cattle to date (and that the strain currently circulating in Morocco is indeed the FMDV O/ME-SA/Ind2001), one can assume that the vaccine is adequate.

In addition: the figures on the number of "vaccinations", said (by Morocco's Department of Veterinary Services) to have covered (in 2015) 92 percent of the national cattle population may, in fact, express the number of vaccine doses distributed to veterinary practitioners for the vaccination campaign, and thus may exceed the number of animals eventually vaccinated (vaccine vials opened in small farms and could not be fully further utilised, possible difficulties in maintaining the cold chain during hot summer months, etc.). - Mods.AB/AS
