The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that it has yet to identify a
disease that has killed about 300 people in northeastern Afghanistan.
A team from the organisation has just returned from the affected area in
the remote district of Darwaz on the Tajik border, where the epidemic has
affected about 18 villages, according to Dr Graber Rana, an official with
WHO in Islamabad.
Some 9,000 people are suffering from the illness, according to the local
director of public health, Dr Assadullah Nalmi, who was with the team that
visited the area.
The symptoms include fever, coughs, respiratory problems and diarrhoea.
Some patients had "bloody diarrhoea" and others suffered from vomiting,
especially children, said Dr Rana. She said the deaths have usually
occurred about four to five days after onset of the illness.
In an effort to identify the disease, the team interviewed patients and
spoke to elders from villages in the area, but the disease remains a
mystery. Dr Rana said blood and stool samples collected by the team would
be analysed in Islamabad.
Two epidemiologists from WHO in Geneva are meanwhile due to reach the Tajik
capital, Dushanbe, on Wednesday at the earliest.
Most of the known affected villages lie along the border with Tajikistan,
from where access is easiest.
To help with relief efforts, she said WHO has sent a tonne of medical
supplies to the area.

Given the minimal amount of data given, the Associate Knowledge Base for
Infectious and Parasitic Diseases of Man projects the following diseases to
be the most likely in the Afghanistan region:
Cholera
Gastrointestinal anthrax
Listeriosis
Plague
Tularemia
The order given is alphabetical and does not imply that any one disease is
more likely than any other. The age specification of young and old
certainly makes listeriosis a possibility that should be pursued.

[Playing the armchair epidemiologist, I think itÂ´s unlikely that cholera
would baffle international experts for long. The others would be more
difficult to diagnose. - Mod.JW
