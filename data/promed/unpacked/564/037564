Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) can be fatal, particularly if the
characteristic rash is absent ("spotless fever"), leading to a delayed
diagnosis.
In RMSF, the rash occurs only rarely on day one following the onset of
fever and in only 50 per cent of subjects by day 3. By day 5 following the
onset of fever, the typical rash will be present in about 91 per cent of
patients. The typical palmar rash occurs in no more than about 80 per cent
of patients. Untreated, RMSF can cause death in 8-15 days, but there is a
fulminant form that can kill within only 5 days. Even with treatment, the
mortality rate is still 3-5 per cent. The point is that early treatment
(preferably with one of the tetracyclines) is essential, and we may not
have the luxury of waiting for the typical rash to occur, even when not
dealing with spotless fever.
