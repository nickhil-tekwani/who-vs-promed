SLOW LORIS DISEASES? RFI
========================
Subject: Slow loris disease- urgent
This was first posted on compmed, then wildlife rehab, then
epivet, then wildlife health. Even so, I think there are many
people abroad who would not have gotten it from any one of
the four lists.

Dear CompMedders/ Primate Talkers:
A few days ago, a slow loris female was found on the doorstep of a
veterinary surgery in Australia. The animal had obviously been
smuggled into the country and is now in quarantine at Melbourne Zoo.
On behalf of the Australian quarantine people, I ask you all:
Which diseases and zoonoses should be tested for? TB and the most
obvious ones are on the way but any replies especially speedy ones
would be appreciated.
Cheers all, Cobie
