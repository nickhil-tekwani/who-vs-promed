Thousands sick in Chile seafood bacteria outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
More than 6000 people in Chile have fallen ill after eating raw or under
cooked shellfish infected with a virulent bacteria related to cholera.
Climate change and rising sea temperatures are being blamed for the outbreak.
Chile has never seen anything like it, as 6300 people have fallen sick
since the start of January 2005 after eating seafood such as oysters and
clams. The normal symptoms of those infected are severe stomach cramps and
fever, but it could have killed at least one person.
The Government is warning people to cook shellfish for at least 5 minutes
to kill off the bacteria. Consumers can still buy shellfish, but sales have
plunged an estimated 80 per cent.

[The outbreak has expanded greatly since the last posting about 4 weeks
ago, when less than 400 cases were reported, although it is not stated
whether all of the cases (or all of the seafood involved) are from the
Puerto Montt area. The following are the abstract and conclusions regarding
outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in Chile, from Emerging Infectious
Diseases (Gonzalez-Escalona N, Cachicas V, Acevedo, C. _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ diarrhea, Chile, 1998 and 2004. Emerg Infect Dis 2005;
11: 129-31 <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol11no01/04-0762.htm>).
"_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infections that caused most seafoodborne
gastroenteritis were associated with multiple diverse serotypes until 1996.
Since then, however, most cases have been caused by the O3:K6 serotype.
Molecular studies with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), arbitrarily
primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR), and multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) have shown that these pandemic strains are clonally related. Most
isolates of this pandemic complex exhibit a unique sequence within the
toxRS operon (toxRS /new) and possess a unique open reading frame, orf8,
which corresponds to an associated filamentous phage. Other common
properties of pandemic strains are the presence of the structural tdh gene
and the absence of trh and urease gene. By using the criteria stated above,
strains of the pandemic clone have been identified as dominant isolates
from clinical cases of diarrhea reported in various Southeast Asian
countries, including India, Japan, Thailand, Bangladesh, Taiwan, and Viet
Nam, as well as from some cases in the USA, but not in the Southern
Hemisphere. Most epidemic isolates initially identified were classified
within serovar O3:K6, however, more recently, isolates classified in
serovars other than O3:K6 have been identified as also forming part of the
pandemic clone.
"From 1992 to 1997, the Institute of Public Health (ISP) reference
laboratory in Chile received 30 isolates from regional hospital
laboratories for identity confirmation. However, an outbreak that occurred
primarily in the northern city of Antofagasta from November 1997 to March
1998 caused this number to increase to more than 300 isolates. A 2nd
outbreak affecting approximately 1500 persons occurred from January to
March 2004, mainly in Puerto Mont, a region of usually cold coastal water.
Apart from its public health impact, this last outbreak had important
economic and social repercussions, because this region is one of the main
shellfish-producing areas in Chile. The presence of tdh-positive _V.
parahaemolyticus_ was confirmed in random shellfish samples, and the
extraction of seafood had to be suspended during the season of high demand.
"Our results show that the spread of the pandemic clonal complex reached
the Southern Hemisphere as early as 1998, only 2 years after the strain
abruptly appeared in Calcutta, India, in 1996. The diversity observed among
the isolates obtained in Puerto Montt did not appear among those from
Antofagasta. 5 isolates differed in only one property, one was from a
different serovar, and 4 lacked the toxRS/new sequence. These findings
raise the question of whether this diversity was originally present in the
introduced pandemic strain or whether it was locally generated. The serovar
O4:K12 observed in one of these isolates (PMC46) has been previously
observed among isolates from southern Thailand. How and when the pandemic
strain arrived to these remote regions in the Southern Hemisphere, and why
it caused the outbreaks during those years, remains a matter for
speculation. The outbreak in Puerto Montt was likely triggered by higher
than normal temperatures during the summer months in this region, which is
normally cool in all seasons and has an average daily superficial water
temperature <16 C year round."
It certainly appears that warming of the local waters along Puerto Montt
may have contributed to the outbreak. - Mod.LL]
