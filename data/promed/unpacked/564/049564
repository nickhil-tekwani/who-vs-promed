Health officials say vigilance is needed to halt the spread of dengue fever
to new areas. Nationally 270 cases of dengue fever have been reported -
compared to 188 last year. Dengue fever is restricted to northern
Queensland, where the carrying mosquito can be found. The biggest dengue
outbreak recently was in Cairns, with the strain originating in Thailand. A
year before 200 cases were a strain from African nation Burkino Faso. The
mosquito [vector] has now spread towards the Northern Territory and New
South Wales borders. The report says another [vector] mosquito from Asia
and Papua New Guinea is an ongoing threat, especially if it continues to
arrive in ships or on planes.
