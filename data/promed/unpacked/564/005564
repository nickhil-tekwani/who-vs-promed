Close on the heels of deaths of 2 persons due to dog bites, another
woman died of rabies in the government general hospital here
[Rajahmundry] on Sunday [15 May 2011]. Worried over the escalating
deaths due to dog bites, the state government has set up a 5-member
committee to study the situation even as it acknowledged that the
hospital was facing a severe shortage of anti-rabies vaccine for
treating the patients.

The 60-year-old woman, a resident of the Municipal Colony in
Rajahmundry died in the early hours of Sunday [15 May 2011]. She was
bitten by a street dog 2 months ago and treated at AP [Andra Pradesh]
Vaidya Vidhana Parishad Hospital, Rajahmundry. But, a few days back,
she was admitted to the same hospital for treatment. She was referred
to GGH [Government Hospital] on Saturday afternoon [14 May 2011] and
she died later. It may be recalled that 2 persons had died in the
government hospital on Saturday [14 May 2011] due to dog bites.

With 3 deaths in a week, the government has roped in 5 experts to
take stock of the situation. Health secretary PV Ramesh told newsmen
in Hyderabad that there was a shortage of anti-rabies vaccine in the
GGH, Rajahmundry. He said action would be initiated against the
medical superintendent.

"Efforts are on to set up special counters in both Kakinada and
Rajahmundry hospitals to ensure vaccines for dog bite victims," he
said.

[This press report attributes the deaths of these 3 patients to
deficiencies in the availability of post-exposure treatment. The
magnitude of the problem has been reviewed recently by P Chatterjee
(Bull World Health Organ. 2009; 87(12): 890-1;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2789368/) from which
escerpts are quoted below.

India accounted for 36 percent of the world's rabies cases (mainly
canine in origin). Currently, approximately 500 000 are given
post-exposure vaccination each year (35 percent to 40 percent of these
are children) consisting of cell-based vaccine administered through
government centers.

The federal government has also adopted national guidelines in favour
of intradermal vaccination, whereby a smaller quantity of vaccine is
injected into the outer layer of the skin and costs 60-80 percent less
than the USD 40-50 paid for intramuscular vaccination. This is an
important consideration in contexts where the cost of treatment is met
in part -- if not fully -- by the patient. 8 out of India's 28 states
and 7 federally administered Union Territories have announced plans to
introduce intradermal regimens this year [2009]. Finally, according to
government statistics, India is currently producing just under 15
million doses of human rabies vaccine and just over half a million
vials of equine rabies immunoglobulin annually -- quantities that meet
the national requirement.

Meanwhile the government is doing more to promote rabies awareness
with initiatives such as a pilot project to prevent human rabies
deaths launched by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) --
formerly the National Institute of Communicable Disease -- in 2008 in
5 Indian cities. The pilot includes training of health professionals
in animal-bite management and raising public awareness about the need
to seek post-exposure treatment, notably through posting messages on
buses and in other public places.

In the longer term, control of rabies in the canine population may be
the best solution.

Rajahmundry is a city and municipal corporation of the Andhra Pradesh
