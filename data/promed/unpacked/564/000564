Officials confirm Union County horse had eastern equine encephalitis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials on Tuesday confirmed that a sick horse put to sleep in the
north western edge of Union County last week had eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE), a mosquitoborne virus that can be fatal to humans.
While the state has reported at least 26 cases in horses so far this year,
compared with only several at this time last year, it is the first reported
case in Union County in at least 18 years, said the county's health
director, Lorey White. EEE, like West Nile virus (WNV), causes flu-like
symptoms in humans and can be fatal especially in infants, the elderly or
those with compromised immune systems. The virus attacks the central
nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain. Initial symptoms include
a sudden fever and headache several days to 2 weeks after a mosquito bite.
Wild birds serve as hosts for the virus. Mosquitoes bite the birds and then
can transmit the virus when they bite humans and animals. Unlike the flu,
it is not contagious when people are exposed to a person or animal with the
virus.
White would not identify the owners of the sick horse but said it lived
north of Unionville near the Cabarrus County border. Although humans cannot
be vaccinated against the virus, he urged all horse owners to get their
horses vaccinated for EEE and WNV.
