Abstract
The status of rabies as a neglected disease has made its eradication rather challenging in different parts of the world despite the availability of a successful vaccine. Lebanon, in particular, is a country endemic to the disease with several cases of rabies deaths reported over the past 30 years. The risk of rabies, however, has taken a new turn over the past few years in Lebanon with 2 emerging situations that have made the control of the disease rather challenging: the neighbouring Syrian war and the local garbage crisis. Both of these milestone events might have contributed to an increase in the number of disease vectors as well as individuals at risk, thus nourishing the cycle of disease transmission. In this observational study, the effects of these 2 events are investigated, with an update on the status of this preventable, yet often neglected, disease in the country. Both events were found to be concomitant with a notable increase in the number of dog bites and thus possible rabies exposure. Current regulations are explored through interviews with veterinarians, and customs recommendations, ranging from policies to control of dog populations to awareness campaigns in high-risk individuals, are then proposed to help control the disease.

[According to information included in the paper, between 2005 and 2016, a total of 7369 animal bites were reported to the LMOPH (Lebanese Ministry of Public Health), with an annual average of 614 bites per year. About 91 percent of the bites were caused by dogs, of which 53 percent were by domestic dogs and 47 percent by stray dogs. The remaining 9 percent involved cats, bats and rodents. It may be assumed that some events involved farm animals as well, not mentioned in the paper.

In 2013, a steep increase in numbers was observed and was sustained up to 2016. The yearly average of animal bites post-2013 was, reportedly, 1004 ± 272 bites per year, which is significantly higher than the average of 355 ± 145 bites per year prior to 2013 (span from 1991 to 1996 and 2001 to 2013). The highest number of bites (per 100 000 individuals) was observed in the northern governorate and in the (southern) Nabatieh governorate (Lebanon's administrative map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Lebanon).

Counting bites does not necessarily reflect the incidence of rabies in animals; it may serve as suggestive of increased rabies incidence in the vector animals. Unfortunately, no information about clinically suspected and/or lab confirmed rabies in animals is included in the paper. Lebanon has reported a rabies case in a dog to the OIE in March 2018 (20180314.5687339); this was the 1st reported animal rabies case from Lebanon since 1995(!).

As suggested by the authors, the Syrian war and the local garbage crisis are plausible explanations for increased rabies incidence in Lebanon. A wide circulation of the virus in Lebanon's canines/fauna, particularly in the Nabatieh governorate bordering northern Israel, was suggested in the past, most recently in 20180321.5701731 (item 4) and in ref 1. It could also be deduced from the data presented in Israel's rabies map of 2015 at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/kalevet_2015/PublishingImages/rabiesmap272016.jpg.
