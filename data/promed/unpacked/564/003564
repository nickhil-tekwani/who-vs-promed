China, Avian Influenza: Poultry Markets Closures; vaccinations
-----------------------------------------------
With regard to posting 20061221.3579, Chinese press reports confirm
that the temporary closure of Beijing's live poultry markets,
instituted in November 2005, has been made permanent. The decision
was announced by the city's Agriculture Bureau on 14 Dec 2006 during
its "Winter Season Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Prevention and
Control Working Conference."
Although this announcement applies to Beijing municipality only, it
follows the release of State Council Document #89 (2006) requiring
"...large cities to gradually eliminate market sale and slaughter of
live poultry." Beijing appears to have been 1st to act on the State
Council's national directive.
Beijing's Agriculture Bureau also announced that all districts of the
city must continue to implement RE-1 strain and RE-4 strain
immunizations. RE-1 is described as the original H5N1 strain while
RE-4 is described as "H5N1 mutated strain."

[China's avian influenza vaccines have been described in the document
"POULTRY AVIAN INFLUENZA VACCINATION IN CHINA," published in October
2006 by the Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture, P.R. China;
<http://www.agri.gov.cn/ztzl/gdztzl/P020061023368529330005.pdf>.
There is also an FAO listing of available vaccines worldwide,
including the Chinese ones; see below.
According to the Chinese document, there are 4 vaccines applied in
China against HPAI, namely (in brackets, the description as presented
in the FAO table):
1. The inactivated vaccine (subtype H5N2 strain). (FAO table: Strain:
A/Turkey/England/N-28/73 subtype H5N2, Low pathogenicity. Type:
Inactivated monovalent).
2. The recombined inactivated vaccine (subtype H5N1), "Re-1 strain;"
(FAO table: Strain: A/Goose/Guandong/1996, Subtype H5N1. Type: Low
pathogenicity Inactivated monovalent).
3. Recombined fowl pox vector gene engineered vaccine (subtype H5);
(FAO table: Strain: A recombinant virus from A/Goose/Guangdong/1996
and human influenza vaccine virus H5N1. Type: Inactivated recombinant.
4. Recombined live vaccine against Avian Influenza and Newcastle
Disease. (FAO table: Strain: A recombinant avian pox virus expressed
H5 from A/Goose/Guangdong/1996. Type: Live recombinant avian pox
virus vectored H5).
According to the Chinese document, all these 4 vaccines are developed
by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory.
The Chinese document does not mention the terminology "RE-4 strain."
The FAO tabled list covers 43 worldwide-available HPAI vaccines
against various AI serotypes, includes 15 preparations from China (10
laboratories), 6 from France (3 laboratories), 3 from the Netherlands
(one laboratory), 4 from Pakistan (4 laboratories), 7 from Mexico (5
laboratories), 5 from the USA (2 laboratories), one from Italy and
one from Germany. 29 of them are H5 vaccines. The table can be found

Pigs, Chickens Culled As Bird Flu Spread
-----------------------------------------------
Quarantine officials on Sunday [24 Dec 2006] culled more than 4000
pigs and 2000 chickens in Asan, South Chungchong province, the site
of the latest outbreak of avian influenza.
According to the province, about 100 quarantine officials were
dispatched early Sunday [24 Dec 2006] to cull 4177 pigs from one pig
farm located within a 500-meter radius of the outbreak site and 2000
chickens from one farm located about 3-km away.
Consequently, after the 4th outbreak of highly virulent bird flu was
found in Asan late Thursday [21 Dec 2006], about 21 000 ducks, 2820
chickens and 4177 pigs have been culled there.
"Although pigs were originally exempted as subjects for quarantine
measures along with dogs, since they are vulnerable to respiratory
diseases and might transmit a transformed strain of the virus, we
have decided to cull pigs within a 500-meter radius of the infected
zone," said an official from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
He emphasized that it was a measure to block any possibility for
further spread of the infection.
"I accepted the government's proposal to slaughter my pigs, as they
said that all the poultry within a 500-meter radius from the outbreak
site should be slaughtered to block any possibility of the spread of
the virus according to quarantine regulations," said the owner of a
pig farm, only identified by his last name Koo. "However, I expect
proper compensation from the government for my loss."
Also, quarantine officials have collected 1000 samples of excrement
from migratory birds near affected areas, including Chonsu Bay and
Pungse Stream, to find out whether the virus is present in them.
In addition, they have blocked the transportation of rice straw in
farmlands located near the habitats of migratory birds in the region.
Experts have been claiming that feeding rice straw to cows from
farmlands near habitats of migratory birds should be blocked since
the possibility that migratory birds could be the source of the bird
flu has not been ruled out yet.
100 tons of rice straw from farmlands that are located near habitats
of migratory birds such as Chonsu Bay, Sapkyo Lake, Sokmun Lake and
Kumgang Bank have been supplied to farmlands nearby to be fed to
their livestock on a daily basis until the government's move.
The government has also banned the movement of chickens, ducks and
eggs within a 10-km radius of the affected area.
South Korea reported 3 separate outbreaks of the disease before the
latest incident in Asan, about 90 km south of Seoul. The 1st outbreak
was reported on 22 Nov 2006 in Iksan, North Cholla Province.

previous item and ProMED post 20061225.3604. - Mod.AS]
3. Up to 30 million birds have been culled, causing an estimated loss
of USD one billion to the poultry industry.
4. The poultry sector had been producing over 2.5 million birds per
day, offering a cheap source of protein to the population.
5. Most of the approximately 40 000 commercial poultry farms have not
introduced bio-secure production systems.
6. Backyard poultry had been a very important source of income for
the poor, as well as their main source of protein intake.
7. Before the outbreak, 29.4 percent of the population were engaged
in backyard poultry production, whose average income from backyard
poultry represented 13 percent of their total income.
8. The Supreme National Committee was established with the Minister
of Health (Chair), Minister of Agriculture and Minister of
Environment, with representatives from 7 other relevant ministries
and UN agencies (WHO and FAO).
9. The Disaster Management Team (DMT), with representatives from UN
agencies, the government and donors, has been a regular forum for
update, information exchange and action planning for the
international community to better support government efforts.
10. Active surveillance for poultry is ongoing in 1202 villages to
date, where 22 289 samples were collected and 44 positive sites were detected.
11. A total of 10 475 people in 23 governorates have been trained in
the safe disposal of infected poultry.
12. Quick and decisive action has taken place in the culling of birds
in urban areas, preventing further spread of the virus.

Ho Chi Minh City: urgent measures against new bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
H5N1 has attacked many fowl, killing 600 chickens and 2100 ducks in
Khanh Binh and Khanh Hai communes, Tran Van Thoi district, Ca Mau
province from 11-20 Dec 2006. The epidemic has spread to Vinh Binh
commune, Hoa Binh district, Bac Lieu province.
According to Ms. Chau Thi Kim Tuyen, Vice Head of the Ca Mau province
Department of Veterinary Inspection, many local residents killed
diseased poultry and threw the corpses into Hiep Hoa canal, which
made the epidemic spread more rapidly among poultry breeding farms in
Khanh Binh commune and others nearby.
The Chairmen of the Bac Lieu and Ca Mau province People's Committees
immediately announced the bird flu outbreak in Khanh Binh and Vinh
Hoa communes, banning the transportation of poultry out of restricted
areas, and began spraying areas of high risk.
So far, the new outbreak of bird flu appeared in 3 communes of Ca Mau
and Bac Lieu provinces. The number of poultry killed and destroyed
has reached 8300: 1000 chickens and 7300 ducks.
In response to the spreading disease, authorities in Ho Chi Minh City
have initiated emergency measures to prevent the epidemic from
spreading to the city. Accordingly, many quarantine stations have
been reinforced to control the poultry transported into the city.
Staff at the quarantine stations will be on duty all day and night
with modern preventive equipment for thorough inspections. All the
slaughterhouses in the city will be carefully checked to ensure that
quarantine procedures are being strictly adhered to.
All other relevant agencies will strictly punish those found guilty
of raising diseased poultry or transporting it into the city.
