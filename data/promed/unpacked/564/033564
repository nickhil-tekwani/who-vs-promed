Blueberry rust was found recently in multiple locations in Western Australia (WA). Suspect detections have also been reported to the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD). It is a declared pest which means it is prohibited to move, sell or supply plants infected with blueberry rust to others.

Due to its spread in WA and the characteristics of the disease, DPIRD considers it not technically feasible to eradicate the rust from the state. Accordingly, DPIRD will update its biosecurity status to 'present'. This means removal of import and quarantine restrictions, but also that host material for export will need to meet biosecurity requirements set by importers.

DPIRD will support industry to adopt effective management practices for blueberry rust.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_, as is the case in Australia, and also another rust species, _Naohidemyces vaccinii_, elsewhere; a 3rd species, _N. fujisanensis_, is restricted to Japan. The disease affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including _Vaccinium_ species with crops like blueberry, bilberry, and cranberry, as well as ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides that release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely, resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and locally by splashing rain or mechanical means. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Commercial highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum. Attempts to eradicate established rust fungi anywhere have been largely unsuccessful.

In Australia, _T. minima_ has previously been detected in the eastern states (ProMED posts 20150105.3072963 and 20160817.4421210). Until now, spread to WA had been prevented by the extensive desert and dryland areas isolating the state from the eastern regions.
