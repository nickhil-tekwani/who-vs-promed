LEISHMANIASIS IN PANAMA
The Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies has been involved in
control and prevention studies for leishmaniasis in the Republic of Panama.
These studies include educational, epidemiological, entomological and
biomedical aspects; surveys in rich tropical rain forest barely touched by
man and also areas where agricultural and cattle activities have replaced
most of the forest.
Little was known about leishmaniasis in some regions in the country, since
previous studies were done on the eastern part of the country. At present,
most of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases are reported from the western part of
Panama. The role of the two-toed sloth as the principal reservoir for
_Leishmania panamensis_ and _Leishmaniasis colombiensis_ was again
demonstrated. These animals are abundant in the forest, and as previous
studies had indicated, the animal moves from tree to tree through the
canopy. As long as the forest is preserved, the animal is present.
The appearance of new cases seems to have a correlation with the presence
or not of the five anthropophilic species of sandflies that have been
incriminated as vectors of the parasite. In areas where the forest is
preserved the incidence is around 9.5%, with a prevalence of around 70%,
for which most new cases would be in children and new settlers. While when
the forest is destroyed the incidence is less than 1% and the prevalence
14%, an indication of a large susceptible population, with possible
outbreaks if agricultural boundaries are expanded.
There is a correlation between the disease, rural development processes and
the needy rural population; mixed patterns of transmission are present in
areas of agricultural colonization, where the problem becomes severe; and
also in areas of transition with vast deforestation, where the disease
turns endemic. These and other results of the study will be used for health
planning purposes by the Ministry of Health of Panama.
