Subject: CSF in Europe
The classical swine fever outbreak is still active in Europe.
Germany, who did not declare any other focus since the 7th of march,
declared two new ones on the 8th of April, at the EU's standing veterinary
comittee. These foci were identified by them at the end of March. They are
located in the previous active area, near Paderborn, in
Nord-Rhein-Westphalia. This would make the total number of foci to 29, since
the 1st of January this year.
In Netherlands, the situation is getting worse and worse. Up to the 7th of
April, the total of foci was of 76, and 24 had been identified within the
last week. This is a huge amount, the average number of foci identified
previously was under 10 a week. The surveilance area has been again extended
(12 areas) and is again in contact with the border of Belgium, under the
city of Eindhoven.
Belgium is still free of CSF and is maintaining a great effort to keep this
status.
In Netherlands, it seems that the spread of virus has benn helped by the use
of infected semen to inseminate sows. So far, two AI centers have been
declared infected by CSF.
No other foci has been recorded in any other EC country.
