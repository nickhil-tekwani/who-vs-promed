South African veterinarians will begin the slaughter of more than 3500
cattle, pigs and other cloven-hoofed animals to curb an outbreak of foot
and mouth disease (FMD), the agriculture ministry said. Animals on about 18
farms in a 3 kilometre radius around 2 farms where the disease has broken
out would be killed and burned over the next few
days, ministry spokesman Segoati Mahlangu said.
