The burning of fossil fuels has caused the largest die-off of coral ever recorded on the Great Barrier Reef, Australian scientists say. Two thirds of all coral in the northern third of the reef is dead after a mass bleaching event earlier this year [2016], new dive surveys show. Leading reef expert Professor Terry Hughes says warmer waters caused by human-induced climate change have cooked corals in the north, which had been the most pristine part of the World Heritage-listed ecosystem.

The worst-hit stretch is from Port Douglas north, where 67 per cent of shallow-water corals have died in the past 8 to 9 months. At Lizard Island, north of Cooktown, 100 per cent of corals are dead. The central and southern stretches of the reef fared far better, because the water didn't get as hot there.

In the central third of the reef, 6 per cent of bleached corals are dead. In the southern third -- where One Nation leader Pauline Hanson went this week to prove the reef isn't dying -- the reef is doing very well, with the coral death rate at just one per cent.

Professor Hughes is the director of the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University. He undertook extensive aerial surveys at the height of the bleaching and says follow-up dive surveys in recent months confirm that the north has taken "a giant step backwards."

The federal government is due to update UNESCO on its reef protection efforts as it tries to keep it off a list of World Heritage sites in danger. Hughes says coral death rates in the north are likely to make that task much harder: "In its ongoing dialogue with UNESCO, Australia has said the outstanding universal values of reef are intact because of the pristine condition of the northern reef. That's simply no longer the case." He noted [that] UNESCO [has not], so far, drawn links between the climate change policies of countries and the World Heritage sites they manage. "It seems that should be a logical step," he said.

Australia is relying on its Reef 2050 Plan to convince UNESCO to keep the reef off the in-danger list. But Prof Hughes, who sits on an independent panel set up to help implement the plan, says it's about fixing water quality problems and avoids the primary threat of climate change.

In defending its reef management plan, federal environment minister Josh Frydenberg pointed to Australia's participation in the Paris climate change pact. But a recent review by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) found existing international efforts to cut emissions are well short of what's needed to achieve the pact's goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees or less. "The Great Barrier Reef has seen 3 major coral bleaching events since 1998, and that's with one degree of global warming," Prof Hughes said. "With 1.5 or 2 degrees of warming, we will not be in a safe place for the reef, and we're not even on track for either of them."

Graeme Kelleher, who headed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for 16 years, last week said Australians must not buy the political lie that they can have the reef as well as projects like Adani's new Queensland coal mine: "We've lost 50 per cent of the coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef in the last 30 years, and the main cause of that is the burning of fossil fuel. I sincerely hope UNESCO rejects the claim that the government is doing enough."

[Coral diseases may have multiple interacting causes. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. Coral disease is recognized as another problem causing the degradation of reefs, which is demonstrated by a global increase in the number of coral diseases, coral species affected, and disease outbreaks.

Bleaching of corals has been shown to be associated with warming oceans. Rising sea surface temperatures and CO2 increases have produced large-scale disintegration of the critically important coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis, resulting in severe coral bleaching events. - Mod.PMB
