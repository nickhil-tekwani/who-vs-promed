The data sheet with chloroquine cautions its use in subjects with
G-6-PD [glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase] deficiency. The only evidence
I have discovered to support this is a letter by Sicard D
(Haemoglobinopathies and G6PD deficiency in Laos.
Lancet 1978; i: 571-572.) which reports acute
haemolysis in 50 soldiers after a 600mg dose of chloroquine. I am
surprised with the high prevalence of the condition and use of
chloroquine that if this problem exists it has not been further
recognised.

A lot of work has been done with G6PD deficiencies at the
Pasteur Institute in Dakar, Senegal. Studies started around 1965
(a long time ago), under the leadership of Jean Louis Oudart.
You may want to check the literature under that name or get in
contact with the Institute in Dakar which I am sure is on
Promed.
