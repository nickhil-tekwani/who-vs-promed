The Sydney water contamination crisis intensified last night after some of
the highest-ever levels of dangerous parasites were discovered in
previously unaffected areas of the city's water supply. The NSW Health
Department late last night expanded the number of suburbs affected by the
contamination - the second in a month - to include most of Sydney and some
surrounding areas. The new areas affected were Penrith, lower Blue
Mountains and Warragamba, a Sydney Water spokesman said. The Sutherland
Shire, Campbelltown, Illawarra and Macarthur areas were still unaffected.
On Tuesday, the department ordered three-quarters of Sydney's population,
some 3 million people, to boil their water following the discovery of
parasites. But the department expanded the order last night after a panel
of microbiologists discovered one of the highest-ever recordings of
cryptosporidia in Warragamba Dam - which supplies 80 per cent of the city's
water - and the main filtration plant at Prospect. Levels of giardia and
cryptosporidia were discovered last night at 2275 and 9445 oocysts per 100
litres just downstream from the Prospect plant - much higher than those
recorded during the first scare in late July.
Sydney Water and the NSW Government were highly criticised following the
first scare, which forced the resignation of Sydney Water managing director
Chris Pollett. Chairman David Hill also resigned. An independent inquiry,
headed by Peter McClellan QC, was ordered and a report is due for release
next week.
Overseas experts met with Sydney Water, Australian Water Services and
department authorities until 3pm yesterday in a bid to discover the
contamination source.
