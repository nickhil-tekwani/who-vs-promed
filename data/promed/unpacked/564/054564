It's not only dengue but malaria cases, too, that have seen a
significant rise in recent months in the province of Rizal, the
Provincial Health Office (PHO) reported Friday [6 Aug 2010].

Engineer Alberto Pinon, the malaria and dengue coordinator of the
PHO, said more than 300 cases of malaria have been recorded in
various parts of the province as of July [2010]. Most of the number
of cases came from the remote and upland villages of Taytay municipality.

Malaria-carrying _Anopheles_ mosquitoes were reported to be present
in the remote community of Hapay na Mangga and nearby sitios
[territorial enclave that forms part of a barangay (sub-district)] of
Taytay especially on areas where there are stagnant streams and
creeks, Pinon said.

Dr Iluminado Victoria, PHO chief, said the mosquito-borne diseases
are now the focus of the information drive of her office. Health
workers and other medical volunteers conduct lectures on dengue and
malaria prevention. She said that although the number of malaria
cases is considered high, only one fatality from Taytay was reported
to the PHO last April [2010].

It was also learned that the malaria fatality had traveled from
Africa, prompting Pinon to suspect that the patient got the disease abroad.

Rizal governor Casimiro "Jun" Ynares, III, who is himself a doctor,
has already instructed the PHO to intensify their health measures
particularly on the prevention aspect and include the remote areas of
the province in their information campaign.

Meanwhile latest statistics from the PHO also revealed that there
were around 200 suspected and confirmed cases of the dengue all over
the province. 2 deaths coming from Cainta and Antipolo respectively
were reported to the PHO monitoring center.

The PHO personnel including doctors and sanitation officers conducted
a lecture on dengue and malaria prevention among students of Teresa
National High School in Teresa town Friday afternoon.

Municipal health and sanitation officers of the various
municipalities in the province are being encouraged to coordinate
with the Provincial Health Office should they need additional
personnel from the provincial capitol, in their respective
information campaign on dengue and malaria prevention in their
localities. PHO officials said the local government units here are
also encouraged to regularly conduct information drive in their own
respective localities as they are familiar with their constituents
and their barangays more than the Provincial Health Office officials.

[Rizal is a province in Luzon, 20 kilometers [approx. 12 mi] east of
Manila. It is usually considered a low risk area for malaria. The
report does not mention how the diagnosis was made and it is
difficult to differentiate malaria and dengue on clinical grounds
alone. It is surprising that the one fatal case presumably was
infected in Africa. - Mod.EP]
