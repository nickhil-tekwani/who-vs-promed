Update on the Avian Influenza situation as of 28 Jul 2004
---------------------------------------------------
1. Latest information on Avian Influenza
Avian influenza devastated poultry farms throughout Asia earlier this
year, and has been notified again during the month of July in several
countries including Thailand, Viet Nam, China and Indonesia. The
reasons for the re-emergence of the disease at this period of the
year is still unexplained, but field epidemiological investigations
carried out since the beginning of the crisis should eventually
assist in better understanding the origin of the disease and its main
features. Vaccination, which is already in use and encouraged in
countries such as China and Indonesia, could be applied in other
affected countries if the disease becomes established. The
possibility of using vaccination as a tool to curb the spread of the
disease is currently being studied by national authorities of
Thailand and Viet Nam.
2. Thailand:
Since 5 Jul 2004, avian influenza (AI) was confirmed in 18 provinces
including Ayudhaya, Pathum Thani, Sukhothai, Uttaradit, Nakorn Sawan,
Arngthong, Supanburi and Chiang Rai, Chonburi, Satun, Nong Khai,
capital Bangkok, Nonthaburi and Phitsanulok provinces, with cases
being investigated in 20 others. Several large-scale duck farms have
been affected and consequently depopulated. The government has set up
a national-level committee, the National Veterinary Council, to study
possible strategies against avian influenza and given it 2 months to
decide on introducing bird-flu vaccination in critical areas. The
committee will review on: the disease situation; epidemiological
factors, especially the transmission mechanism between flocks as well
as to humans; poultry production systems; current control measures
and possibility to apply more stringent control measures such as
biosecurity in some sectors; the possibility to control and monitor
outcomes of vaccination; and possible impact of vaccination in
Thailand. The Government will only consider vaccination once it is
confident that it poses no harm to humans. Thailand had ordered its
livestock officials nationwide to employ the 3 preventive measures to
the bird flu situation: educating owners of poultry farms about the
disease and how to comply with the government's orders and measures;
collecting samples of dead fowl and tracing for indigenous chickens
to look for any suspicious signs; and cleaning markets and places
where poultry are sold. About 200 000 birds have been culled.
3. Viet Nam:
Since 1 Jul 2004, outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 have been found
in 11 provinces including the city of Can Tho and the provinces of
Bac Lieu, Hau Giang, Tra Vinh, Dong Thap, Vinh Long, Tien Giang, Ba
Ria Vung Tau, Kien Giang, Ben Tre and Long An. There is also a
suspected outbreak in Bac Ninh province in northern Viet Nam. At
least 2 000 chickens infected with the H5 strain of the avian
influenza virus were destroyed in Bac Ninh on 27 Jul 2004.
About 50 000 poultry including 35 000 chickens and ducks and 13 000
quails died/have been culled since the end of June 2004. The culling
policy is still in place but reduced to 1-km radius. Local farmers
were called to register their fowl numbers to facilitate the control
of poultry and potential outbreaks in the province. In order to curb
the potential spread, the Animal Health Department has asked cities
and provinces nationwide to strengthen surveillance on transport and
trade of poultry and their eggs. Under this scheme, fowl and eggs in
provinces stricken by bird flu are not allowed to be transported out
of the localities for 21 days.
In the north, Hanoi and 21 Northern provinces are stepping up their
preventive measures. By 25 Jul 2004, city officials have set up 16
animal checkpoints; disinfected all poultry farms, markets, and
slaughter houses. These operations will be repeated once a week over
the next month.
The department also allowed 2 foreign owned companies -- A Thai
company and an US company -- to test 50 000 doses of chicken flu
vaccinations against virus type H5 in breeding chickens. The Ho Chi
Minh City Service was also allowed to test vaccinations against virus
H5N1. Viet Nam had used a vaccine in February during the peak of the
outbreak. A conference of scientists and poultry farmers was convened
in Hanoi on 20 Jul 2004 to discuss a possible vaccination programme.

UN to recommend wider use of bird flu vaccine
----------------------------------------------
Experts meeting in Thailand's capital will consider increased use of
bird flu vaccines for chickens across Asia to try to tackle a
resurgence of the deadly disease, the Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) said on Wednesday [28 Jul 2004].
The chief of the United Nations agency's animal health service said
it was shifting its position to back a wider use of injections to
fight a virus that has left 24 people and 200 million chickens dead.
"The FAO is going to give revised guidelines and we will be in some
ways supporting more vaccination than before," Joseph Domenech said
at a meeting here of top veterinary officials from Southeast Asia.
"They won't protect 100 percent against infection, and some
vaccinated animals could carry the virus. But they will not
contribute to outbreaks."
The FAO has recommended vaccination policies "where appropriate and
practical" since the height of the crisis in February 2004, but
several nations including Thailand, the world's 4th largest poultry
exporter, have banned vaccines until more thorough research is
conducted.
Domenech acknowledged concerns that vaccinating large numbers of
chickens could expose humans to healthy-looking birds that carried
the lethal H5N1 virus, but said the potential for endangering humans
was minimal.
Key poultry populations that would be targeted include hens laying
eggs for human consumption and young birds needed to replenish
devastated poultry stocks, he said.
Thailand, Viet Nam, Indonesia and China have all reported new cases
after the worst of the outbreaks of the lethal H5N1 form of the virus
earlier this year that left 8 dead in Thailand and 16 in Viet Nam and
crippled poultry industries.
The outbreaks prompted the European Union this week to extend its ban
on chicken imports from 9 countries until at least December 2004 as
the economic effects continued to be felt across Asia.
The EU has also banned poultry imports from any country where
chickens had been vaccinated against bird flu, and there was no
immediate indication it would change its policy in the light of new
planned FAO guidelines.
Indonesia has carried out a vaccination programme to combat the
spread of the virus in several areas. About 21 million birds had been
inoculated in 17 provinces by June 2004, the FAO reported.
"There will be more animals sick, more outbreaks, and more sources of
the virus if there is no vaccine," said Domenech.
However, he said there were concerns about the cost of the programme
and the difficulty in getting it properly administered in remote
rural areas.

[Of the 7 Eastern Asian countries known to be infected since the end
of 2003 with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus, 2
countries -- Japan and Korea -- have managed to completely control
and eradicate the disease. This was feasible as a result of early
diagnosis followed by immediate notification accompanied by accurate
implementation of the prescribed control measures. Both successfully
accomplished stamping-out without vaccination to regain their
HPAI-free status.
Unfortunately, this was not the case in the other affected countries,
namely Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam, where the
disease is still present.
(see their follow-up report of 26 Jul 2004,
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Cambodia%20Follow%20up%20report%20No2.pdf>)
Initial diagnosis and official notifications of the disease seem to
have been delayed in some of these countries. China and Indonesia
applied vaccinations, combined with other control measures. According
to the above report of the FAO, Viet Nam applied vaccination as well,
at least on a limited level. Thailand, an exporting country, has so
far refrained from vaccination in order to be able to renew its
exports to the EU.
International organisations indicated in February 2004 that vaccine
alone is unlikely to lead to a successful eradication, while
vaccination combined with stamping out and adequate surveillance will
likely lead to eradication in less time. Strategic vaccination in
birds, if accompanied by appropriate surveillance, will reduce the
amount of virus excreted and lead to less viral exposure for humans.
Vaccine, if used, must be produced in accordance with OIE guidelines.
In view of the continued outbreak in Thailand, its vaccination policy
is undergoing revision. We are looking forward to the new guidelines
of the FAO on AI vaccination, possibly coordinated with the OIE and
WHO.
Again, we stress the importance of official control upon the
production, testing, certification and application of the vaccines.-
