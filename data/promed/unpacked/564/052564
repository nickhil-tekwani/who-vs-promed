Bluetongue serotypes 6 and 11 vaccine-like strains circulation
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health made the
following statement on 4 Mar 2009:

At the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of 4
Mar 2009, the Netherlands and Germany presented the results of their
surveillance and other investigations into bluetongue virus type 6
(BTV6). In October and November 2008, the Netherlands and Germany
reported laboratory findings of BTV6 circulation in cattle located in
neighbouring parts of their territories with very little, if any,
clinical signs of bluetongue disease. The detection was a result of
routine bluetongue surveillance. There was an immediate investigation
by the Community Emergency Veterinary Team, and the affected Member
States have followed its recommendations. Movement restrictions
similar to those applicable in a bluetongue outbreak have been
applied as a precautionary measure while the investigations were in
progress.

Information on the genetic sequence available from the virus isolates
indicates a high similarity with the BTV6 South African modified live
vaccine. This virus may have circulated to a limited extent in the
local midge vector population. No bluetongue clinical disease has
been observed in the field or under experimental conditions. The
results of these investigations suggest that no virulent BTV6 virus
strain has circulated in the Netherlands or Germany, while the
positive findings are most likely to be ascribed to the use of a
modified live vaccine.

On the basis of the assessment of these data, the Netherlands and
Germany have, therefore, concluded that further continuation of
precautionary measures with regards to restrictions on trade are not
justified, and they will be lifted as of 5 Mar 2009. However,
strengthened surveillance will continue, and control measures may be
applied if there is evidence of further virus circulation in the 2009
vector season or if a virulent strain is detected.

Belgium reported a similar situation with respect to circulation of
bluetongue virus type 11 (BTV11). Information on the genetic sequence
available indicates a high similarity with the reference strain that
was used to produce the South African modified live vaccine for
BTV-11. The epidemiological situation has been assessed. No virus has
been isolated, and no clinical signs of bluetongue disease have been
observed. In view of this situation, the precautionary measures in
the temporary control zones currently in force will be lifted as of 5
Mar 2009. Similar to the Netherlands and Germany, strengthened
surveillance will continue, and control measures may be applied if
there is evidence of further virus circulation in the 2009 vector
season or if a virulent strain is detected.

- Detailed epidemiological reports on the BTV6 and BTV11 vaccine
strain situation have been presented to this SCoFCAH by the
Netherlands, Germany and Belgium and are available here:

- Netherlands
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/BT_netherlands_report.pdf>
- Germany
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/BT_germany_report.pdf>
- Belgium
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/BT_belgium_report.pdf>.

The report of the Emergency Veterinary Team on the mission to the
Netherlands from 2-5 Nov 2008 can be found at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/docs/epidemiological_report_en.pdf>.

Updates from Member States affected by bluetongue are regularly
presented to the SCoFCAH. Presentations may be viewed at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/index_en.htm>.

[The most recent presentations, dated Wed 4 Mar 2009 (Joint meeting
of the SCFCAH Animal Health and Welfare and of the Standing Committee
on Zootechnics), are not yet available but are expected very soon. -
