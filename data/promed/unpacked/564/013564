Indonesia: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update 30
-----------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 8 Sep 2006, The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed a new case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The case is a 14-year-old female from Makassar, South Sulawesi
Province. She developed symptoms on 18 Jun 2006, was hospitalized on
23 Jun 2006 and died on 24 Jun 2006. The case had contact with
poultry near her home. This case was detected through the Ministry's
routine influenza surveillance system.
In addition to the above case and following the recent revision of
case definitions for H5N1 infection, WHO is adding 2 cases in
Indonesia, dating back to June and November of 2005. Inclusion of
these 2 cases now aligns figures given for Indonesia in the WHO
cumulative table of laboratory-confirmed cases with those officially
issued by the Ministry of Health. Prior to the revision, the cases
did not meet the WHO case definition for serologically confirmed
avian influenza H5N1 infection.
The first retrospectively confirmed case was an 8-year-old female
from Tangerang in Banten Province. She developed symptoms on 24 Jun
2005 and died on 14 Jul 2005. She was part of a family cluster
reported to WHO in July 2005.
The second retrospectively confirmed case is a 45-year-old male from
Magelang, Central Java Province. He developed symptoms on 25 Nov 2005
following direct contact with diseased poultry and subsequently
recovered.
The retrospectively confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to
63. Of these cases, 48 have been fatal.
