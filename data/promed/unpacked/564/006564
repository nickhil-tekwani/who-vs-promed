Two of the 3 recently diagnosed with leprosy in Florida [USA] have been in contact with 9-banded armadillos, according to Volusia County health officials. Armadillos, which are only found in the western hemisphere, are not naturally carriers of the disease, as they themselves were infected by European settlers who migrated to America.

The easily treatable disease can induce skin lesions and nerve damage if left untreated. The Daily Mail reports roughly 95 per cent of humans exhibit a natural immunity to the bacteria carried by the armadillos and that while there were roughly 250 000 cases worldwide in 2008, the CDC indicates that there are only about 100 cases of leprosy reported in the US each year. The report also notes that most Americans who have managed to contract the disease have done so while abroad. With an incubation period which can last years, it's not necessary for a patient who has contracted the disease from an armadillo to have come in recent contact with the animal. While the Daily Mail report indicates that it can take as long as 10 years, CBS News reports that the incubation period can last up to 20 years.

It is not uncommon to find armadillos incorporated into food dishes in southern states such as Texas. Consuming the animal presents a higher risk of contracting the disease than simply touching them. Ulcers, muscle weakness and eye problems are early signs of the disease. A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine back in 2011 indicates that the leathery animals are suspected to be carriers of the leprosy bacteria known as _Mycobacterium leprae_. Once in the human body, the bacteria slowly multiplies. It affects the skin, eyes, peripheral nerves and the lining of the respiratory tract. Claw hands, tumor-like growths, disfigured skin, and damage to bone, cartilage and tissue are common with the progression of the disease.

[About 70 per cent of people with leprosy in the US lived or worked abroad in regions where leprosy is prevalent and may have acquired their disease there. However, about 30 per cent of all patients in the US report no foreign residence and appear to have acquired their disease from within the US. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, where some people hunt, skin and eat armadillos and where wild _Mycobacterium leprae_-infected armadillos can be found.

The armadillo population in these south-central states (Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama) is derived from armadillos that migrated northward from Mexico and Central and South America and are naturally infected with _M. leprae_. Armadillos are particularly susceptible to leprosy due to their unusually low body temperature of 34 C (93 F), similar to human skin, which is hospitable to _M. leprae_. A picture of an armadillo can be found at the source URL.

Armadillos 1st arrived in Florida during the 1920s and 1930s, having been released from a zoo and escaped from a traveling circus (http://armadillo-online.org/expansion.html). _M. leprae_, however, has not yet been detected in the armadillo population residing in Florida or Georgia (http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw362).

A study reported in 2011 that 39 of 50 patients with multibacillary leprosy reported residence in Mexico or US states where leprosy-infected armadillos are found, and 29 of the 39 reported no foreign residence. Genotyping confirmed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ in 28 of the 33 armadillos that were captured in the wild in 5 southern states in the US (Arkansas, Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas) and in 22 of 29 patients who had never lived outside the US and Mexico and who resided in states with leprosy-infected armadillos (1). Interviews with 15 of the leprosy patients further revealed that 8 had had direct contact with armadillos. This genotype had not been reported previously elsewhere in the world. In patients whose risk was foreign residence only, the genotype was typical for the strains found in that foreign region.

It would be interesting to learn whether the 3 Florida patients had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions if genotyping _M. leprae_ from the 3 Florida patients reveals the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ found only in the Western Hemisphere, as well as if _M. leprae_ has been detected in any wild Florida armadillos.
