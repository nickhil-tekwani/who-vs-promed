JOHANNESBURG: South Africa has been hit by a new outbreak of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) 2 days after it lifted controls in KwaZulu-Natal province,
[according to agriculture minister Thoko Didiza. Government veterinarians
confirmed on Friday [2 Feb 2001 a case of FMD in a communal farmer's herd
in the Northern province, Didiza said. The area, about 250 miles north of
Johannesburg, was immediately quarantined and veterinary teams were sent to
the area to start inspections and surveillance.
FMD controls were lifted on 31 Jan 2001 in KwaZulu-Natal province, where
the disease was first discovered in South Africa in September 2000. The
disease broke out in Mpumalanga province a few months later. Didiza said
last week there had been no fresh outbreaks of the disease in
KwaZulu-Natal, making it safe for controls to be lifted in the province
beginning 31 Jan 2001. "Given our success in containing and eradicating the
FMD disease in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga, we are confident we will be
able to contain FMD in the Northern province," [she said.
The virus is believed to have been imported in pig swill bought from the
Middle East or the Far East. Australia, Botswana, Brazil, the European
Union, Kuwait, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, New Zealand,
Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Swaziland, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe have
suspended meat imports from South Africa. Swaziland has also imposed
controls after the disease spread there from South Africa. The disease is
estimated to have cost southern African meat exporters about $257.7 million
in lost sales.
