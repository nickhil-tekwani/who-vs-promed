The non-native _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been detected in Watsonville, Santa Cruz County officials announced Monday [17 Oct 2022].

The small mosquito displaying black and white spots has the potential to transmit dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow fever, though these viruses are not currently found in California, according to a county release.

This is the 1st _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito detected locally in a year and was confirmed by Santa Cruz County Mosquito and Vector Control near East Lake Avenue and Holohan Road. The mosquito has also turned up in Contra Costa, Sacramento, and Merced counties and is more common in southeastern areas of the US and Arizona. It is known for being especially aggressive and can attack both day and night.

"Our goal is to control and eliminate this mosquito population," said Vector Control Manager Amanda Poulsen in a prepared release. "We are doing everything to help ensure this mosquito does not become established in our communities."

Mosquito and vector control officials are collaborating with the county Health Services Agency to "evaluate the extent of the infestation" and "aggressively target problem areas to prevent its spread."

The local agency has expanded surveillance efforts for the tiny insect and has deployed a variety of traps aimed at capturing eggs and full grown adults. It has also begun door knocking efforts at nearby residences, as it looks to inspect properties for potential standing water areas.

According to the release, _A. aegypti_ lays its eggs just above the water line in small containers and vessels that hold water such as dishes, potted plant basins, bird baths, feeders, ornamental fountains, tin cans, children's toys, and discarded tires.

"It's important for residents to look around their property and dump out even the smallest amount of standing water," writes county staff. "Their eggs stick to surfaces they are laid on, so it is important to clean and scrub bird baths and pet watering dishes weekly and dump the water from overflow dishes under potted plants."

Community members that are sick with fever, headache, and joint or muscle pain after returning from areas where dengue, chikungunya, or Zika commonly occurs should contact their doctor and stay indoors as much as possible to avoid mosquito bites, public health officials advise.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, areas with past outbreaks of chikungunya and dengue are at higher risk for Zika. These areas include Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and Guam.

Mosquito bite prevention
- Apply repellents with EPA-registered ingredients such as DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Apply as directed on the product label.
- Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, socks, and shoes when mosquitoes are most active.
- Double-check that window and door screens are in good repair.
- Residents experiencing mosquito bites during the day should report them immediately to county mosquito and vector control by visiting https://www.agdept.com/ or calling (831) 454-2590.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to be detected in new locations in California, in this case, Santa Cruz County. This is the 1st report of _A. aegypti_ in this county but not the 1st in California. _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California. There are 18 counties in the state that have _A. aegypti_ and 4 that have both _A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ (see the map at https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/AedesDistributionMap.pdf). The open question is whether these mosquitoes have been established in these localities or eradicated there? Breeding sites can be difficult to find and eliminate.

Although the report above points out that _A. aegypti_ is capable of transmitting any of the mentioned viruses, ongoing transmission is unlikely; however, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito as quickly as possible in the localities where it has recently been found is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
