Re: Foot & mouth disease - Saudi Arabia: east, RFI
--------------------------------------------------
There are 2 vaccines in use in Saudi Arabia:

1) Septavalent:
O - 3039 (Manisa)
O1- BFS
A Iran 96
A Iraq 22
A 4165
Asia - 1 (Shamir)
SAT - 2 (Saudi 2000)

2) Monovalent:
O - 3039 (Manisa)
O1- BFS

I do not know which of these vaccines is being used by the Ministry
of Agriculture.

A supplementary vaccine, also available but not in common use, is:
A Iran99
A Eritrea.

[ProMED-mail's posting 20090128.0387 included media-derived
information on outbreaks of FMD in Eastern Saudia, namely in the
counties AlQateef and AlGebeel. A request for data on the composition
of the applied vaccine was appended. The above firsthand response is
gratefully acknowledged.

It remains to be clarified which FMD virus serotype is responsible
for the current outbreak, whether it is covered by the strains
included in the vaccines, and whether the affected animals had been
vaccinated according to schedule. - Mod.AS]
