About 100 000 people in Northern Ireland have been advised to boil tap
water following a increase in the numbers infected by a bacteria [parasite
believed to be contaminating the supply.
Householders in Lisburn, County Antrim, received the warning on Friday
morning [1 Sep 2000, just a day after people on the periphery of Belfast
received similar instructions from the Eastern Health and Social Services
Board. The latest alert comes as the numbers showing symptoms of the
_Cryptosporidium_ bug rose from 54 to 61.
The Eastern Health and Social Services Board delivered leaflets to 17 000
homes in the area supplied by Poleglass reservoir on Thursday. Tests have
been carried out by health officials on the reservoir showing a "slightly
higher" level of the bug [_Cryptosporidium_ in recent days. Similar tests
have shown no trace of the bug in samples taken from taps in homes and
businesses, leading to uncertainty as to the cause of the outbreak. An
environmental expert has criticized the handling of he outbreak of the
bacteria [parasite by health officials.
Des Loughridge, of the Institute of Environmental Management and
Assessment, has said a recent outbreak of the bug in England appeared to
have been treated with greater urgency. "That reservoir was closed off,
boiled water notices issued immediately and people were compensated," he said.
The outbreak is the most widespread this year.
The Eastern Health Board said that people were being advised to boil water
as a "purely precautionary measure". But Patrick Dunlop, a research
scientist at the University of Ulster, said water was not the only way the
_Cryptosporidium_ parasite could have infected people.
He said: "There are a number of ways of becoming infected - by not washing
fruit and vegetables, from person to person contact or from swimming in a
swimming pool that someone has had a fecal accident in. Personal hygiene is
also very important. People should wash their hands well after going to the
toilet and after changing babies' nappies."
Local pharmacist Maurice Currie said: "I would say about 50% of the
prescriptions at the moment are diarrhea related or some sort of vomiting,
sickness, across the range form everyone from the elderly, young adults and
babies as well."

[Outbreaks have been reported from the UK at regular intervals. Even though
the infection can be transmitted through food contaminated with cysts, a
waterborne outbreak is still the most likely when so many people are
affected at the same time.-Mod.EP
