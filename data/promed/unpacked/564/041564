Citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC) is an important disease, mainly of sweet
orange (_Citrus sinensis_ (L.) Osbeck) cultivars. It was 1st described in
Brazil in the state of Sao Paulo in 1987 (4). The disease has spread to all
Brazilian states that grow citrus and is affecting more than 1/3rd of the
orange trees grown in Brazil. CVC is caused by _Xylella fastidiousa_, a
xylem-limited, gram-negative bacterium.
During the last 4 years, symptoms, including leaf interveinal chlorosis,
stunting, canopy dieback, and hard and undersized fruits, similar to those
caused by CVC (3), appeared in sweet orange trees used as shade plants for
coffee plantations and as fence posts in Costa Rica. Necrotic lesions on
the abaxial side of the leaves as reported in Brazil were rarely observed.
Leaf petiole samples from 25 symptomatic sweet orange trees reacted
positively with a _X. fastidiosa_-specific antiserum (AGDIA Inc., Elkart,
IN) in a double-sandwich antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(DAS-ELISA). A fastidious, gram-negative bacterium identified as _X.
fastidiosa_ using DAS-ELISA was isolated on periwinkle wilt (PW) medium
plates (1) from citrus stems showing CVC symptoms, but not from
asymptomatic trees. The isolated colonies were circular and opalescent with
diameters of 2 to 3 mm and were clearly visible within 6 to 7 days after
streaking.
Petiole sections from symptomatic plants observed with scanning electron
microscopy showed rod-shaped bacteria with rippled cell walls tightly
packed in xylem vessels, as described for _X. fastidiosa_ previously (2),
and with transmission electron microscopy, the bacteria were
morphologically similar to those reported previously for CVC (2).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _X. fastidiosa_ associated with
citrus in Costa Rica.

[Brazil currently produces more than 1/3rd of the world's oranges. Citrus
production in several states in Brazil is threatened by Citrus variegated
chlorosis (CVC), a bacterial disease that affects primarily sweet orange
(_Citrus sinensis_) cultivars. A xylem-limited gram-negative bacterium,
_Xylella fastidiosa_ [Xf] is the confirmed pathogen of CVC. CVC symptoms
include foliar necrotic spots, leaf scorch, tree-stunting, and reduction of
fruit size and yield. Xf is spread from plant to plant by grafting with
infected bud material and by sharpshooter leafhoppers (_Hemiptera_:
_Cicadellidae_). Xf causes citrus variegated chlorosis disease in Brazil
and Pierce's disease of grapevines in the United States. Both of these
diseases cause significant production problems in their respective
industries. The recent establishment of the glassy-winged sharpshooter in
California has radically increased the threat posed by Pierce's disease to
California viticulture. Control of CVC by pruning of symptomatic branches
is effective under certain circumstances.
