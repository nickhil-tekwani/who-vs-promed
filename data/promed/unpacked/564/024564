Family of deceased child in Pekanbaru (Riau) develop fever
----------------------------------------------------------
The death of a 2-year-old child in Pekanbaru (Riau), subsequently
confirmed as due to bird flu (see ProMED-mail archived reports
below), has alarmed his family and neighbours. They are afraid that
virus is still circulating and taking lives. In particular the
child's 42-year-old father has developed a high fever. This
occurrence is mentioned by the Head of Monitoring and Disaster
Section of the Health Service Pekanbaru, Naviri (Wed 1 Apr 2009)
while her team was inspecting the victim's house. She also mentioned
that the victim's 59- and 67-year-old grandparents were also
developing high fever. They latter have been treated intensively at
Arifin Ahmad regional hospital. Meanwhile, the victim's father
remains under intensive care. The hospital has collected their blood
samples for further test.

Naviri said the health service is now engaged in data recording and
surveillance around the outbreak location. Agriculture service
officers of Pekanbaru, Sentot Djoko Prayitno have carried out chicken
depopulation measures and disinfection within an area of 100 square
metres [approx. 1000 sq ft] around the victim's house.

[Further information is awaited. There have been few occurrences of
human-to-human transmission of avian influenza anywhere during the
course of the current epidemic.
