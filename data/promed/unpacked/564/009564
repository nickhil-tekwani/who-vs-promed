[It is not clear what is meant by "a suspected case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever has been confirmed" -- which is it, suspected or confirmed?

I doubt if there has been time to send a specimen to a reference lab and get a result back. But Nigeria's vigilance is commendable. Perhaps it is time for WHO to review its position on travel restrictions. - Mod.JW
