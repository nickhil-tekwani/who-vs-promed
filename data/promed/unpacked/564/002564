Date of start of the event: 17 Dec 2018
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 5 Jan 2019
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Equine influenza virus
Serotype: Pending
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Gidan Karo, Wamakko, Sokoto
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Dec 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 217 / 93 / 37 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Donkeys species (170 females and 47 males) of different age group in a rural community kept essentially as beast of burden.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 217 / 93 / 37 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 42.86 / 17.05 / 39.78 / 17.05
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, illegal movement of animals; the donkeys are mostly sourced [from] a neighboring country.

Epidemiological comments: Further investigations revealed that the bulk of donkeys in the affected village comes from a border town of Ruwa Wuri in Tangaza Local Government Area.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, vaccination prohibited, treatment of affected animals (Symptomatic treatment with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agent.)
Measures to be applied: traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Research Institute Vom, Nigeria (Regional Reference Laboratory) / Equidae / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 5 Jan 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, mules and zebras caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi2) of influenza A virus within the genus Influenza virus A of the family Orthomyxoviridae. Viruses of the H7N7 subtype have not been isolated since the late 1970s. Equine influenza viruses of both subtypes are considered to be of avian ancestry, and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 has been associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys in Egypt. In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia and a harsh dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent. Vaccinated infected horses can still shed the virus and serve as a source of virus to their cohorts. Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The disease is endemic in many countries with substantial equine populations. In recent years, infection has been introduced into Australia and re-introduced into South Africa and Japan; to date New Zealand and Iceland are reported to be free of equine influenza virus.

While normally confined to Equidae, equine H3N8 influenza has crossed the species barrier to dogs. Extensive infection of dogs has been reported in North America where it normally produces mild fever and coughing but can cause fatal pneumonia. While equine influenza has not been shown to cause disease in humans, serological evidence of infection has been described primarily in individuals with an occupational exposure to the virus. During 2004-2006 influenza surveillance in central China (People's Rep. of), 2 equine H3N8 influenza viruses were also isolated from pigs."

The following abstract is from the article entitled "Serological evidence of equine influenza virus in horse stables in Kaduna, Nigeria", Meseko CA, Ehizibolo DO, Nwokike EC, Wungak YS. Published in J Equine Sci. 2016;27(3):99-105. The full article is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048356/.

Abstract:
"Equine influenza virus (EIV) is a major cause of acute respiratory diseases in horses in most parts of the world that results in severe economic losses. Information on the epidemiology of EIV in tropical Africa is scanty. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the presence of influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) in 284 horse sera in Kaduna State, Northern Nigeria. The ELISA-positive sera were further examined for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies to 2 strains each of H3N8 and H7N3 subtypes of influenza A virus. The results showed that antibodies against influenza A virus nucleoprotein were detected in 60.9 percent (173 of 284) of horses examined by NP-ELISA. Equine H3 and H7 subtypes were detected in 60 percent (21 of 35) and 20 percent (7 of 35) of horse sera respectively across the stables. Adequate quarantine of all imported horses, a national equine influenza surveillance plan and an appropriate EIV control program in Nigeria are recommended to safeguard the large horse population." - Mod.CRD
