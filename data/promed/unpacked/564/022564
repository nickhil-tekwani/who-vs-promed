Uruguay has ceased importing meat from Brazil after August 23, upon
receiving confirmation of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Brazil's
southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Minister of Livestock, Agriculture and
Fishing Gonzalo Gonzalez said Thursday.
Uruguay has adopted severe health control measures at the borders with
Brazil and forbids the entry of meat products, as well as of subproducts
and elaborations of Brazilian provenance, said the minister.
Uruguay has arranged to send a commission of veterinarians to the focus
where the illness appeared in Cruz Alta, north of Santa Maria, Rio Grande
do Sul, to observe the situation.
On the short term, exports of Uruguayan meats won't be affected toward
markets free of foot-and-mouth disease like the United States, Canada,
Mexico, Japan and other countries, as long as Uruguay adopts precautions,
said the official.
Uruguay's government forbade cattle and meat imports from Argentina and
Paraguay since August 15, due to the discovery of aphthouse virus [Foot and
Mouth Disease - Mod.PC in northern province of Formosa, apparently coming
from Uruguay [sic -- presumably a misprint for "Paraguay" - Mod.PC.
Uruguay exports about 270 000 tons of meat each month.
