[On Fri, 20 Oct 2006, EU's Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH),
Section : ANIMAL HEALTH & ANIMAL WELFARE, held
its scheduled meeting in Brussels, with the
bluetongue disease situations and/or surveillance
activities (Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands and the UK) as first topic
on the agenda. In view of the recent notification
on BT from Bulgaria, it seems of interest to
introduce here highlights from the text of the
Bulgarian report, transcribed from their
presentation. - Mod. AS].

Presentation: Bluetongue, Bulgaria, SCoFCAH, Brussels 20 Oct 2006
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Historical data
------------------
Bluetongue in ruminants (BT) was identified for
the first time in Bulgaria in the village of
Slivarovo, the municipality of Malko Tarnovo, the
administrative district (county) of Burgas, which
is an area of immediate nearness to the borders
with Republic of Turkey, based on clinical signs
in sheep found on 07.07.1999.
Then the disease has been laboratory confirmed
and the BT virus serotype identified as BTV-9.
This was the first case of BT ever found at
latitudes north to the 42th parallel.
In order to achieve the proper confinement,
surveillance and eradication of the disease, the
assistance, knowledge and experience of Dr.
Philip Mellor of the BT Community Reference
Laboratory in Pirbright, the UK has been used
and highly appreciated at that time.
BT Surveillance Programme(s) have been developed
and then updated each year since 1999, being
accurately implemented by the experts of the
National Veterinary Service (NVS).
Till the beginning of November 1999, the disease
has spread all over the territories of the
administrative districts of Yambol, Haskovo and
and Kardzhali.
Then, the winter months and the low temperatures
thereof resulted in ceisure [sic] of flight of
the BT vector. No BT case has been identified in
the next year 2000, within the framework of the
next year (2000) BT Surveillance Programme.
In the beginning of September 2001, BT was
identified and then confirmed in samples taken of
certain areas at the western borders of Bulgaria,
but clinical signs have been identified in
animals of only 12 settlements of the
administrative district of Kyustendil. The
further and more intensive serological
surveillance performed demonstrated that there
have been serologically positive animals without
any clinical signs.
In September 2002, BT serologically positive
animals have been detected, but these have not
demonstrated any BT clinical signs. Such animals
were of areas alongside Bulgarian borders with
Republic of Greece to the south, and in
particular of the areas of the administrative
districts of Smolyan and and Blagoevgrad.
The BT Surveillance Programmes for the years
2003, 2004 and 2005 have not revealed any
presence of BT serologically positive animals
neither anywhere alongside the southern and/or
western borders of Bulgaria, nor anywhere else
countrywide.
2. BT Surveillance Programme for 2006
-------------------------------------
In 2006, the NVS is also implementing a BT
Surveillance Programme, approved also by the
Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.
This Programme, among the others, foresees that
samples have to be taken from 10 cattle and 10
goats, serving as �sentinel� animals, from
specially designated settlements located along
the southern and western borders of the country.
These animals are sampled once per month and
then tested for eventual presence of BT
antibodies.
This sampling starts in May and finishes at the end of October.
Depending on the BT epidemiological situation in
the neighboring countries and in case of
temperatures of more than 10�C, sampling and
testing under the BT Surveillance Programme is to
be extended till the end of November.
Furthermore, under this same programme there are
traps for and catches of the BT vector, the data
of these catches being then used for determining
the dynamics and phenology of these vectors
(carriers).
3. BT Serologically Positive Samples in 2006
--------------------------------------------
On 10 Oct 2006, when performing the routine
testing of 20 blood samples taken under the 2006
BT Surveillance Programme, 11 BT positive samples
were detected by tests performed under the
competitive ELISA method. These 20 blood samples
have been taken from the 20 sentinel goats of the
village of Slivarovo, the municipality of Malko
Tarnovo, the administrative district (county) of
Burgas. [See map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=41.9505&lon=27.6232&scale=1000000&icon=x>].
The clinical examinations performed on all the BT
susceptible animals of that same village by
veterinary experts have not revealed any clinical
signs of BT.
The aforementioned cases led to immediate taking
of all the relevant measures provided for in our
Ordinance No. 19 of 14 December 2005, which is
completely harmonized with Council Directive No.
2000/75/EC.
On 11 Oct 2006, the Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry issued his Order No. RD 09-893 to enter
into effect all necessary measures against the
spread and ensuring the proper control of BT.
4. Surveillance of the BT �vector� (carrier)
--------------------------------------------
Within the implementation of the BT Surveillance
Programme there is also surveillance of the
spread and intensity of Culicoides. For this
purpose, light traps (produced by the Institute
in Ondestepoort, the Republic of South Africa)
have been placed in various areas along the
borders of Bulgaria with republics of Turkey,
Greece, Macedonia and Serbia. These traps are
used once per month, for 2 consecutive nights
(between 18:00 and the morning of the next day).
Taking into account the phenology and the
seasonal dynamics of the the Culicoides family in
our country, placing of these traps and
collection of catches starts in the end of April
(or early May) and continues till September or
October each year.
All the catches of Culicoides collected till now
in Bulgaria in 2006 are not different anyhow
from the species previously found in our country.
These catches miss the _Culicoides imicola_ that
is the main vector typical for other countries of
BT presence. The most numerous, as a whole, are
the _Culicoides obsoletus_ collected (of more
than 75 percent) and the ones of the group of
_Culicoides pulicaris_ (of more than 15 percent).
The most frequently found species Mono-culicoides
group (of not more than 1 percent of the total
amounts collected) are the _Culicoides
puncticollis_ and _Culicoides nubeculosis_. The
catches collected in the administrative district
of Burgas in the end of September of this year
could be characterised by certain predominance of
the species of the _Pulicaris_ group. The
numbers of the Culicoides per one catch of this
district for this same period is between 115 and
242.
***[In view of the recent identification of
_Culicoides dewulfi_ as a suspected vector of
BTV-8 in the Netherlands and the indicated wide
distribution of this species (where cattle is
grown) within the palearctic region, including
all parts of Europe, it could be interesting to
note if attempts have been made to check the
trapped culicoides batches from Bulgaria for the
possible presence of _C. dewulfi_. As recently
remarked by Rudy Meiswinkel (see ProMED archive
20061024.3042), there might be difficulty in
confidently distinguishing _C. dewulfi_ from
other sympatrically captured species of the
subgenus _Avaritia_ i.e. _C. obsoletus_ and _C.
chiopterus_.- Mod. AS].
5. Measures for Control, Confinement and Eradication
----------------------------------------------------
The following measures have been entered into
effect by Order No. RD 09-893 of 11 Oct 2006
issued by the Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry:
1. Ban on movements of small and large ruminants
of the municipalities of Malko Tarnovo and
Tsarevo to any other municipalities of the
administrative district of Burgas or any other
district of the country;
2. Ban on movements of small and large ruminants
of the other municipalities of the administrative
district of Burgas to any other administrative
districts of the country located within the area
of the 150-km zone;
3. Ban on any transfers and/or settling of wild
ruminants coming from the administrative district
of Burgas
4. Carrying out of daily clinical examinations to
be performed for detection of BT in all
settlements located within the municipalities of
Malko Tarnovo, Tsarevo and Sredets, while in all
other municipalities of this administrative
district such examinations shall be performed at
least once per week.
5. For the surveillance of the disease spread,
sampling and serological testing of blood
samples of ruminant animals kept in the
municipalities of Malko Tarnovo, Tsarevo,
Sredets, Sozopol and Burgas.
6. Ban on grazing of ruminants of the
municipalities of Malko Tarnovo, Tsarevo and
Sredets within the time period between 18:00
(06:00 pm) and 08:00 (08:00 am);
7. Ban on all markets of ruminants in the administrative district of Burgas.
8. The bodies of the Ministry of Interior of the
administrative district of Burgas have been
ordered to strengthen the control on any vehicles
transporting ruminants. Each case of infringement
is to be notified to the Regional Veterinary
Service of Burgas together with the measures
taken thereto.

[It will be of value to note the identify of the
BTV serotype which has provoked the positive
serology in the tested goats, when available.
The original Bulgarian presentation includes
abundant additional information, tables, maps and
other useful and important data, accessible at
the above URL. We have not, however, been able to
find therein information on vaccination and
vaccines. According to previous information, a
pentavalent, live-attenuated South-African
vaccine (serotypes 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11) had been
used in Bulgaria in 1999/2000 (see ProMED archive
20011122.2864, 20060915.2615).
