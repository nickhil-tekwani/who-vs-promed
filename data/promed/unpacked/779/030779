[As of today, 28 Nov 2014, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV reported in Saudi Arabia is now 813 including 349 deaths (case fatality rate 42.9 percent). The newly reported cases today include a 34-year-old male from Sakaka with a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the community and a 40-year-old male from Taif whose history of contact with other suspected or confirmed cases in either the healthcare environment or the community is currently under investigation. On 13 Nov 2014 there were 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Sakaka -- the capital city of Al Jawf province. While not specified, it is highly likely that today's newly confirmed case had contact with one or both of the 2 cases reported on 13 Nov 2014. The newly reported recovered case today was most likely the 53-year-old male reported from Sakaka on 13 Nov 2014 with a history of exposure to animals.

The reported fatality today was most likely the 42-year-old male from Taif reported as a newly confirmed case on 24 Nov 2014 at which time he was reported to be in critical condition, and a history of possible contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment was under investigation.

[This is the 5th case of MERS-CoV infection reported in Alkharj since the beginning of November 2014, suggesting there is continued ongoing transmission of the MERS-CoV. This case, the 79-year-old Saudi female, was found to have had contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment.

Information on newly reported deaths:
1. Riyadh: 30-year-old expat female, healthcare worker, no history of pre-existing co-morbidities

2. Riyadh: 75-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, history of pre-existing co-morbidities

[Of the 2 fatalities reported on 25 Nov 2014, the 30-year-old expat female healthcare worker from Riyadh was most likely reported as a newly confirmed case on 29 Oct 2014 at which time she was noted to be in stable condition and had had contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment. The 2nd reported fatality, the 75-year-old Saudi male from Riyadh, was most likely reported as a newly confirmed case on 3 Nov 2014 at which time he was reported to be in the ICU, and a history of possible contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment was under investigation.

In the big picture, it is clear that there is continued circulation of the MERS-CoV in multiple locations in Saudi Arabia -- since the beginning of November 2014 there have been 24 newly confirmed cases. As previously described by the MOH, there is significant person-to-person transmission ongoing, in the healthcare environment and to a lesser documented sense within the community.

One can't help but wonder why only Saudi Arabia has been reporting cases in the Middle East in November ... were all other index cases occurring in other countries in the region related to either known or "missed" contact with Saudi Arabia, or is Saudi Arabia testing more individuals with febrile respiratory illnesses? What is different about Saudi Arabia?
