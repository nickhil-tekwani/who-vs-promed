Blood from a donor infected with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the virus that causes AIDS, was transfused into 2 patients, as the donated blood slipped through checks by the Japanese Red Cross Society, it was learned Tuesday [26 Nov 2013].

The Japanese Red Cross Society and the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry have identified the recipients of the blood transfusions and are checking whether they were infected with the virus. The ministry's Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council will discuss steps to be taken at a panel on blood product operations.

It is the 1st time that blood from a donor infected with HIV was found to have been transfused to patients [in Japan] since the Japanese Red Cross Society reinforced its checking systems in 2004, after a case of HIV infection through blood transfusion was found the previous year. According to the ministry and the Japanese Red Cross Society, HIV antibodies were detected in blood that was donated earlier this month [November 2013]. Although that blood was not used for transfusion, it was found that the same donor had also given blood in February this year [2013].

The society checked a stored sample from the earlier donation, and HIV genes were detected. The society also confirmed that the blood, given by an unnamed man, was transfused to 2 patients at 2 different medical institutions.

The Japanese Red Cross Society said the man wrote untrue answers on a 23-point checklist at the time of his recent donation, including a question about whether he was making the donation to receive an HIV test because he was worried about AIDS. The ministry's position is that the man possibly donated blood aiming to check whether he was infected with AIDS.

The checks are conducted in 2 stages. 1st, each blood sample undergoes tests to detect antibodies of viruses. Since 1999, this has been followed by higher-accuracy tests conducted on groups of 20 samples. If any group is found to contain a sample that is HIV-positive, all the samples are checked in more detail to pinpoint the donor in question. The blood that was transfused to the 2 patients this year [2013] was not found to be HIV-positive when it was checked in February 2013. However, this may be due to the fact that HIV infection has an initial stage called a window period, during which HIV viruses cannot be detected, because there is such a small amount of them in the blood.

The test the Japanese Red Cross Society introduced in 1999 is called the nucleic acid amplification test (NAT), which multiplies the number of virus genes in a sample to more accurately detect their existence. But in 2003, a quantity of donated blood passed through the NAT check and was transfused to a patient, who was later found to be infected with HIV.

To further improve the accuracy of the checks, the Japanese Red Cross Society tightened procedures in 2004. The NAT tests, which had been conducted on samples from groups of 50 donors, are now conducted on samples from groups of 20. The society is considering further reducing the number in the group checks. "We want to shorten the period during which viruses cannot be detected as far as possible," an official of the society said.

Health, Labor and Welfare Minister Norihisa Tamura said at a press conference Tuesday [26 Nov 2013] morning after a Cabinet meeting: "I want to consider an option that [samples] of each donor will be checked [individually rather than in groups]."

[Screening of HIV-contaminated blood for transfusion is a continuing problem, and in the Japanese experience, there may be no sure alternative to the screening of individual donations. Information on the final procedure adopted by the Japanese government and the Japanese Red Cross would be appreciated. - Mod.CP
