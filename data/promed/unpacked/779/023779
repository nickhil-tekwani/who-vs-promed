Health authorities in South Sudan's Eastern Equatoria state said there have been 89 cases of cholera in the state with 3 deaths. The state's Health Minister Margaret Itto told Radio Tamazuj Tue 24 Jun 2014, that the 3 fatalities were from Nimule, Magwi, and Lopa Lapo localities.

Itto said the cases were confirmed as cholera after the samples by the Central Laboratory in Juba, and that the state Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak on 14 Jun 2014. She said locals fetching drinking water directly from rivers and streams has raised concern among health officials, who have issued strong directives to staff to educate citizens on sanitation and chlorination of water to contain the outbreak. Cholera symptoms include diarrhea. The spread of the disease can be limited by washing hands with soap or ash and clean water, and by using clean water for cooking, bathing, and drinking.

A cholera outbreak in Juba since May 2014 has affected over 1700 people with nearly 40 deaths.
