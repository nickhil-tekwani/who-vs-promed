[ProMED-mail would like to congratulate all those countries which reached and/or advanced with their FMD status. During the recent General Session of the World Assembly in May 2014, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) granted official FMD status recognitions to several Member countries.

ProMED-mail recognizes the efforts invested by the country animal health professionals (both private and public) as well as the associated allied industries and congratulates these countries for attaining their new FMD status.]

OIE Resolution no 15
--------------------
(http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/2014_A_RESO-15_FMD.pdf). Adopted during the 82nd General Session in May 2014, the following countries and/or zones within certain countries received FMD status recognition:
- Republic of Korea as a "FMD free country where vaccination is practised"; and
- In South America, the following countries expanded their FMD free zones:
-- Argentina expanded its free zones by adding Patagonia North as a "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised;"
-- Brazil added a new zone covering the States of Alagoas, Ceara, Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, Rio Grande do Norte, and the northern region of State of Para, as a "FMD free zone where vaccination is practised;"
-- Bolivia, added one zone consisting of 4 merged zones covering the regions of Amazonas, Chaco, Chiquitania, Valles, and part of Altiplano, as a "FMD free zone where vaccination is practised."

In addition, it is important to recognize all those countries that continue to maintain their country or zones within their territories FMD free with or without vaccination. The complete list identifying the FMD free status of OIE Member countries can be found at, http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/list-of-fmd-free-members/.

[Looking at the specific situation in South America, Venezuela has not submitted any information to the OIE for status recognition. According to that country's last available annual report submitted to the OIE (2012), Venezuela reports FMD as being absent in domestic animals, but suspect in wildlife (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2012&semester=0&wild=0&country=VEN&this_country_code=VEN&detailed=1).

Quantitative information obtained from OIE's WAHID database section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence", shows that from 2005 to 2011, 159 outbreaks were reported in Venezuela. These outbreaks were spread across 19 states (Anzoategui, Apure, Aragua, Barinas, Bolivar, Carabobo, Cojedes, Falcon, Guarico, Lara, Merida, Miranda, Monagas, Portuguesa, Sucre, Tachira, Trujillo, Yaracuy, and Zulia). This, as well as additional information, can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view the information on FMD in the region of Venezuela, scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region, country, and time period).

According to the official information on Suriname, that country has no official status with respect to FMD. Based on their 6-monthly reports (last one submitted to the OIE was the January-June 2013 report, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2013&semester=1&wild=0&country=SUR&this_country_code=SUR&detailed=1), FMD has never been reported in the country. However, they have no official OIE status -- probably because they have not presented their dossier with the required information to be evaluated and recognized as an FMD free country. - Mod.CRD]
