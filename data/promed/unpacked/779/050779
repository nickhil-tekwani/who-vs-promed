Federal agriculture officials say they have found avian influenza in a commercial turkey flock in central California.

The US Department of Agriculture said [Sat 24 Jan 2015] that the facility in Stanislaus County has been quarantined and birds from the affected flock will not enter the food system.

Testing occurred after the flock experienced a spike in deaths.

Officials say there is no immediate public health concern and the detected strain -- H5N8 -- is not known to harm humans.

The bird flu strain H5N1 ravaged poultry across Asia in 2003 and is more easily spread among humans.

[Considering the rapid spread of this disease in the Western and Pacific Northwestern states in recent weeks, this is unfortunate, but not totally unexpected. Biosecurity is critical when this virus and wild birds are around. We are sorry for all producers that have had their flocks affected by this virus.
