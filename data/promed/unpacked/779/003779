Oakville [Southern Ontario] residents are being warned after a bat found in the Honeyvale Road and Swansea Drive area last week [week of 13 Jun 2016] tested positive for rabies.

The Halton Region Health Department confirmed the positive test result in a release, advising anyone who may have had contact with a bat in the area to seek help immediately.

"The Health Department is reminding residents to avoid all contact with bats and other wild animals," said the region's director of communicable disease, Matt Ruf. "Anyone who comes in physical contact with a bat or other wild animal should see a physician immediately and contact the Health Department."

Rabies is spread through the saliva of an infected animal, usually through a bite. It can cause severe damage to the brain and spinal cord, with potentially fatal results.

In humans, speedy treatment is crucial if you suspect you may have been infected.

A rabies vaccine can prevent illness, but only if it's administered before symptoms occur.

[Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Bat rabies viruses of bats are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species.

Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species. - Mod.PMB
