----------------------------------------------------------------------
Frosty pod rot (FPR) is a devastating cacao disease [that has so far been reported from] 13 countries in Central and South America and constitutes a permanent threat for cacao cultivation worldwide.

In 2012, FPR was detected in Alto Beni [municipality], La Paz Department [see ProMED-mail post 20130504.1690667] where 85 per cent of [Bolivia's] cacao is produced by approximately 3000 small-holders. Typical FPR symptoms and signs were observed [which] included premature ripening, deformation, chocolate brown lesions, and mummies (dehydrated, sporulated pods). Some lesions were covered by the distinctive mycelium. When cut in half, infected pods showed internal necrotic lesions. The fungus was isolated from necrotic lesions. The morphological observations agree with the descriptions [in the literature].

PCR amplification was done to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and 28S -- large ribosomal subunit (LSU). Sequencing of the isolates confirmed the presence of _M. roreri_ in Bolivia and their genetic affinity to the Orientalis group, which also comprises isolates from Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru. Current average losses are estimated at 54 per cent in Alto Beni, but many other wild and cultivated cacao populations are now threatened by the disease.

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease originally identified in Ecuador in 1917. It spread rapidly to other countries in Latin America during the 1970s and reached the northern boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. FPR can cause complete loss of production and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production in the region.

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies (shriveled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores giving affected pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as reservoirs. Conventional control measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

In Bolivia, pod rot of cocoa was reported in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130504.1690667) as one of the results of a national survey of emerging crop diseases. It was not specified in that report whether this referred to the detection of FPR or black pod caused by _Phytophthora_ species, or both.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in Brazil (Bahia) and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both pathogens pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.
