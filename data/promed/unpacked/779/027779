The state of Nevada is recommending all equine events scheduled for this weekend [23-24 Mar 2019] in the Silver State be canceled due to 3 horses in southern Nevada recently testing positive for herpes.

In a Tuesday morning [19 Mar 2019] statement from the Nevada Department of Agriculture, state veterinarian JJ Goicoechea "strongly urges" equine events, especially in southern Nevada, be shut down in efforts to slow the spread of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1), which can cause neurologic disease in horses.

"Our recommendation is based on the likelihood of statewide exposure at an event 8-10 Mar 2019 in Fernley, and we are coordinating with event managers to take every precaution to mitigate continued spread," Dr. Goicoechea said in a statement.

On Monday [18 Mar 2019], the state confirmed in a statement 2 additional Clark County horse facilities have been quarantined since the 1st case of EHV-1 in a southern Nevada horse was confirmed on Friday [15 Mar 2019].

The facilities have not been identified because the state says there is no public health risk.

According to the state's initial press release on 15 Mar 2019 reporting the 1st positive case, horses at the Nevada State Junior/High School Rodeo, which took place 22-24 Feb 2019 in Pahrump, "may have been exposed."

The average incubation period for EHV-1 is 4-7 days, but some may take up to 14 days. Eight to 12 days after infection 1st appears, neurological disease may occur.

EHV-1 is a reportable disease, meaning when veterinarians diagnose it, they are required to notify the Nevada Department of Agriculture.

"I urge all horse owners to monitor their horses closely, taking temperatures twice daily and seeking veterinarian care for any fevers over 102 deg F [39 deg C]," Dr. Goicoechea said in a statement. "It is especially important to practice biosecurity to minimize the risk of spreading disease."

[This is a very serious disease. Heed the warning and start monitoring your horse. Be sure to write down the temperatures. Do not depend upon your memory. You may need to know how fast the temperatures are rising.

Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus type 4 (EHV-4) infect the respiratory tract, the clinical outcome of which can vary in severity from sub-clinical to severe respiratory disease. Clinical infection is characterized by fever, lethargy, anorexia, nasal discharge, cough, and mandibular lymphadenopathy. Infection of the respiratory tract with EHV-1 and EHV-4 typically 1st occurs in foals in the 1st weeks or months of life, but recurrent clinical infections are seen in weanlings, yearlings, and young horses entering training, especially when horses from different sources are commingled. Equine herpesvirus type 1 can cause major outbreaks of abortion in naive mares, the birth of weak nonviable foals, or a sporadic neurologic disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy-EHM) secondary to lytic infection of endothelial cells resulting in the development of thombi in the small blood vessels supplying the spinal cord and brain.

Both EHV-1 and EHV-4 spread primarily by the respiratory route, by direct and indirect (fomite) contact with nasal secretions, and, in the case of EHV-1 and infrequently EHV-4, by contact with aborted fetuses, placental and fetal fluids, and placentae. Like herpesviruses of other species, these viruses establish latent infection in the majority of horses, which become asymptomatic carriers of one or both viruses. Such horses may experience reactivation of either virus, resulting in replication in certain white cell elements in the blood and short-term shedding of the virus when stressed. Some pregnant mares in which reactivation of virus occurs, may abort. Existence of a carrier state seriously compromises efforts to control these diseases and explains why outbreaks of EHV-1 or EHV-4 can occur in closed populations of horses.

Because both viruses are endemic in many equine populations, most mature horses have developed some immunity through repeated natural infection; thus, most mature horses do not develop serious respiratory disease when they become re-infected but may be a source of infection for other susceptible horses. In contrast, horses may not be protected against the abortigenic or neurologic forms of the disease, even after repeated infection, and mature or aged horses are in fact more commonly affected by the neurologic form of the disease than juvenile animals.

Recently, a genetic variant of EHV-1 has been described (defined by a single point mutation in the viral DNA polymerase [DNApol] gene) that is more commonly associated with neurologic disease (EHM). This mutation results in the presence of either aspartic acid (D) or an asparagine (N) residue at position 752. Molecular diagnostic techniques can identify EHV-1 strains carrying these genetic markers. The finding of a neuropathogenic variant of the virus can have implications for the management of EHV-1 outbreaks or individual horses actively infected with these strains. It is important to understand that both virus genotypes can and do cause neurological disease. However, infection with D752 strains can result in a higher clinical attack rate and a higher case fatality rate. It is estimated that 80-90% of neurological disease is caused by D752 isolates, and 10-20% by N752 isolates. It is possible that 5-10% of all horses normally carry the D752 form (this estimate is based on limited studies at this time). In the face of an active outbreak of EHV-1 disease, identification of a D752 isolate may be grounds for increased concern about the risk of development of neurological disease.

Primary indications for use of equine herpesvirus vaccines include prevention of EHV-1-induced abortion, and reduction of severity and duration of signs of respiratory tract disease (rhinopneumonitis) in foals, weanlings, yearlings, and young performance and show horses that are at high risk for exposure. Many horses produce post-vaccinal antibodies against EHV, but the presence of those antibodies is not indicative of protective immunity. Repeated vaccination appears to reduce the frequency and severity of disease and limits the occurrence of abortion storms. As with all forms of equine herpes viral disease, biosecurity management is of primary importance for control of abortion caused by EHV-1.

Please check with your state or provincial animal health office about which diseases are reportable.

Vaccines:
Inactivated vaccines
A variety of inactivated vaccines are available, including those licensed only for protection against respiratory disease, and 2 that are licensed for protection against both respiratory disease and abortion. Performance of the inactivated respiratory vaccines is variable, with some vaccines outperforming others. Performance of the inactivated abortion/respiratory vaccines is superior, resulting in higher antibody responses and some evidence of a cellular response to vaccination.

Modified live vaccine
A single manufacturer provides a licensed modified live EHV-1 vaccine. It is indicated for the vaccination of healthy horses 3 months of age or older as an aid in preventing respiratory disease caused by equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1).

EHM
None of the available vaccines have a label claim to prevent the neurologic form of EHV-1 infection. It has been suggested that vaccines may assist in limiting the spread of outbreaks of EHM by limiting nasal shedding of EHV-1 and dissemination of infection. For this reason, some experts hold the opinion that there may be an advantage to vaccinating in the face of an outbreak. If this approach is pursued, only afebrile and asymptomatic horses should be vaccinated, and protection against clinical EHM should not be an expectation. The vaccines with the greatest ability to limit nasal shedding and viremia of the neuro virulent strain include the vaccines licensed for control of abortion (Pneumabort-K and Prodigy), the MLV vaccine (Rhinomune and Calvenza).
