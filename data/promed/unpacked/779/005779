TWO MORE DEATHS SAID CAUSED BY ENTEROVIRUS
Taipei, Oct. 3 The deadly enterovirus is being blamed for two more
deaths, increasing the number of victims claimed to seven since 25
Sep 1998, the Department of Health (DOH) reported on Saturday.
The latest victims were an 8-month-old baby in Taoyuan County who
died from meningitis, and a 2 year old in central Taiwan who died of
heart and lung failure, the DOH report showed.
The report also indicated that from 25 Sep to3 Oct, a total of 812
patients suspected of having contracted enterovirus were reported. Of
these, 93 children were categorized as seriously ill.
Regarding the sudden recent spread of the virus, the DOH decided to
resume its daily reports on the epidemic and call on the public to be
vigilant against the enterovirus, a DOH official said.
The health department had gone from daily reports to weekly reports
on the enterovirus epidemic since July 24 when the contagion was
believed to be under control. (By Elizabeth Hsu)
