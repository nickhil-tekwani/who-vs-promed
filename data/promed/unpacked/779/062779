AVIAN INFLUENZA (157): ITALY, LPAI H5N2, H7N3

I would like to submit to you recent reports posted by IZSVE (Istituto
Zooprofilattico delle Venezie-Legnaro-Padova, Italy, OIE (Office
International des Epizooties; World Organization for Animal Health)
Reference Laboratory for avian influenza) regarding multi-focal epizootics
of LPAI [low pathogenic avian influenza] A/H5N2 and A/H7N3 in several
northern provinces of Italy, which have appeared during the last few weeks.
Animals affected were mainly birds in farms (turkeys, broilers, ducks,
geese) as well as free-range poultry in vocational farms.
The reports are dispatched in PDF format and contain analytical tables with
phylogenetic trees of A/H5 and A/H7 viral strains isolated at infected
farms (there were only asymptomatic animals, or -- in one instance -- mild,
subclinical signs). The documents include maps and description of outbreaks
with the number of susceptible animals:
<http://www.izsvenezie.it/dnn/Default.aspx?tabid=312> (Epidemiological
situation on 19 Sep 2007, in English and Italian).
I am a bit surprised because there isn't -- to date -- any official report
to OIE. Epizootics recur for several months but no OIE confirmation reports
were published on the WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database) site.
Northern provinces of Italy contain larger poultry industrial farms with
extremely high numbers of birds.
