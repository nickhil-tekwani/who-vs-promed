5-person Family Test Positive for Avian Influenza Virus
--------------------------------------------------
A 5-person family from Viet Nam's northern city of Hai Phong have been
infected with avian influenza (H5N1) virus, the local newspaper Labor
reported on Tue 29 Mar 2005. According to initial testing by the Viet Nam's
National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology, specimens from the 5
patients, including a 39-year-old man, his wife and 3 children from Kien
Thuy rural district, have tested positive to the virus. They were admitted
to the city-based Viet-Tiep Hospital on 22 Mar 2005 after having cough,
fever and breathing difficulty.

The parents and their daughters aged 4 months old, 3 years old, and 10
years old are now in stable health condition. Before exhibiting bird flu
symptoms, they ate sick chicken raised by the family. The family, who live
in an avian influenza-hit area, had their flock of nearly 200 chickens
culled by local veterinarians recently. Earlier, over 200 chickens in the
flock had died.

Several days after admitting the 5 patients from the same family, the
hospital received 2 suspected cases of bird flu infections: a 41-year-old
man and a child. All the 7 patients live in the same commune.

On 23 Mar 2005, the Hue Central Hospital in central Hue city received a
suspected case of H5N1 infection. The 30-year-old patient comes from the
neighboring province of Quang Tri. The patient has not had contact with
sick poultry, said the report.

Last week, Viet Nam's Health Ministry confirmed that 28 local people have
been infected with the H5N1 virus since late December 2004, 14 of whom have
died. Avian influenza has hit 35 Vietnamese cities and provinces since
January 2005. 27 localities have detected no new affected spots for 3
weeks, meeting [a criterion for eradication of the disease]. The 8
remaining localities include Ben Tre, Can Tho, Dong Thap, Hau Giang, Tra
Vinh and Vinh Long in the southern region, and Hai Phong and Hai Duong in
the northern region.

[The number of human cases of suspected avian influenza virus infection
continues to rise. This report describes 3 new suspected cases, 2 of whom
are residents of the same commune as the family of 5 who have been upgraded
from suspected to confirmed cases. The cluster of 5 confirmed cases does
not yet constitute evidence for person-to-person transmission, as members
of the family were in contact with a flock of diseased chickens, and all 5
are reported to have consumed diseased chickens. - Mod.CP]
