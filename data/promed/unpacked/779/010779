Update: Influenza Activity United States, 1998-99 Season
---------------------------------------------------------
Flu activity in the United States began to increase in mid-January and
remained at increased levels in most regions of the country as of the week
ending February 27, 1999. Both influenza A and influenza B viruses have
been detected from all flu surveillance regions, although, nationally,
influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominate.
Circulating strains are well matched to influenza strains recommended for
the 1998-99 flu vaccine. Although the flu vaccine this year is effective and
well-matched to circulating strains, outbreaks have occurred among
vaccinated residents of long-term care facilities (LTCF). Unvaccinated
health-care workers may introduce flu-like illnesses into long-term care
facilities (LTCF).
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that health-care
workers and others working in LTCFs receive a flu shot each year. The
findings were
published in the March 12 issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
(MMWR) published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
