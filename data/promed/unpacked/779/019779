Malaysian officials fear new outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------
A 13-year-old Malaysian girl is believed to have died of the dreaded
mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis (JE), while 2 others have been
hospitalized, news reports said on Sunday [29 Jan 2006].
Health authorities are trying to contain the spread of the disease
after the 3 cases were detected in separate villages in northeastern
Kelantan state, the New Straits Times newspaper reported.
Marzukhi Md Isa, the Health Ministry's deputy director of disease
control, said they might cordon off the area if more people showed JE symptoms.
The disease, transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, is one of several
mosquito-borne viruses that can affect the central nervous system and
cause severe complications and death.
Health officials said a 13-year-old girl died on Thursday [26 Jan
2006] morning, 2 days after being hospitalized. She was suffering
from high fever, headache and discomfort, all symptoms of JE.
Tests on another hospitalized patient, a 27-year-old woman, has
conclusively shown that she has contracted JE, Marzuki told the New
Straits Times.
Another teenage girl was also hospitalized on Thursday [26 Jan 2006]
for the same symptoms, and her condition is critical.
50 Health Department workers began a large-scale operation, visiting
houses in the village. Villagers were told to clean their
surroundings and clear stagnant waterways, ponds and puddles, where
_Culex_ mosquitoes can breed.

[Japanese encephalitis can be transmitted between vertebrates,
including humans, by several mosquitoes in at least 6 different
genera, but mostly the vectors are _Culex_ species. The most
important vector is _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, a very common mosquito
that frequently breeds in rice fields and feeds on large vertebrates
and birds. Other vectors include _Cx. gelidus_, which commonly feeds
on pigs, and species in the _Cx. vishnui_ group; these species breed
in streams, ditches and rice fields. - Mod.MS]
