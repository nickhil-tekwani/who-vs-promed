Horses in 2 municipalities in Saskatchewan, Canada, have tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 2 May 2019.

On 17 Apr 2019, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) national reference laboratory confirmed a positive EIA result for a horse residing in the rural municipality of Beaver River.

"The horse had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian at the owner's request after they became aware of a potential epidemiological link to other recently identified EIA cases," the EDCC said. "No clinical signs of disease were noted at the time of sampling."

Then, on 25 Apr 2019, the CFIA lab confirmed an EIA case in a horse residing in the rural municipality of Meadow Lake.

"The horse had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian at the owner's request to comply with a show pre-entry requirement," the EDCC said. "No clinical signs of disease were noted at the time of sampling."

In both cases, CFIA investigations are underway, and, as per program policy, quarantines have been placed on the infected horses and animals they've contacted on their home premises.

"The quarantine(s) will remain until all disease response activities have been completed, including follow-up testing and ordering the destruction of positive cases," the EDCC said. "Trace-out activities may require the CFIA to undertake actions at additional premises as outlined in the current policy."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:

Progressive condition loss;
Muscle weakness;
Poor stamina;
Fever;
Depression; and
Anemia.

There is no vaccine and no cure for EIA.

A horse diagnosed with EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

["Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or cell-associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal.

Additionally, EIA can be readily transmitted iatrogenically through use of blood-contaminated syringes, needles, or surgical equipment, or by transfusion of infective blood or blood products. Infrequently, transplacental transmission can occur in infected mares that experience one or more clinical episodes during pregnancy. There is evidence, although circumstantial, from a significant outbreak of EIA in an equine hospital in Ireland, of probable spread of the virus by direct or indirect transfer between horses in stalls sharing the same barn.

No specific treatment or safe and effective vaccine is available. Because equids infected with EIA virus present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m [219 yd]) from other equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of seropositive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to the virus after ingesting colostrum. In most cases, passive antibody against EIA virus wanes and is no longer detectable in the Coggins test by 6-8 months of age; detectable antibody may persist up to 12 months, however, if ELISA testing is used."

Yet with all of this knowledge, there is no vaccine.
