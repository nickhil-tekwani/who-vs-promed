Reptile owners who have been feeding rats, mice, and chicks to their
pets may be at risk for salmonellosis. The company that sells the
reptile food, Mice Direct, announced a recall of the frozen rats,
mice, and chicks [Tue 27 Jul 2010], saying that human illnesses
possibly related to the frozen reptile feed have been reported in 17
states.

The company says the recall is based on Food and Drug Administration
sampling of the frozen mice.

[2] FDA recall
Date: Mon 26 Jul 2010

<http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm220367.htm>


Biggers & Callaham LLC, D/B/A [doing business as] Mice Direct of
Cleveland, Georgia, is recalling frozen reptile feed (mice, rats,
chicks), because it has the potential to be contaminated with
_Salmonella_.

_Salmonella_ can affect animals and there is risk to humans from
handling contaminated pet products. People handling contaminated pet
food can become infected, especially if they have not thoroughly
washed their hands after having contact with the product or any
surfaces exposed to these products.

The frozen reptile feed was distributed in all states except Hawaii,
through pet stores and by mail order and direct delivery. Frozen
reptile feed was shipped in plastic bags with the following product
codes M-SP100, M-P100, M-PF100, M-F100, M-H100, M-W50, M-A50, M-JA25,
R-P100, R-F50, R-PUP50, R-W50, R-S50, R-M20, R-L10, R-J5, R-C5, R-M3
followed by E9, F9, G9, H9, I9, J9, K9, L9 or A10, B10, C10, D10, E10,
F10, G10, and whole frozen chicks in 25 count bags.

Human illnesses that may be related to the frozen reptile feed have
been reported in 17 states. The recalled product should not be fed to
animals, even after heating in a microwave oven, since the heating may
not be adequate to kill _Salmonella_. The recall is based upon
sampling by the FDA of frozen mice. The company continues their
investigation.

Products shipped after 24 Jul 2010, will have been irradiated in a
similar manner as raw food for human consumption in order to address
the issue associated with these products.

[It appears from the report narrative that the mice were the source of
the salmonellosis cases. The reptile handlers could have acquired the
infection directly from the food or indirectly from the reptile. The
serotype or serotypes of _S. enterica_ are not stated.

Rodents are not often thought about as sources of human salmonellosis
but these mammals can clearly be a reservoir for the infection.
ProMED-mail has previously posted several clusters of cases in this
regard including the group of elementary school students acquiring
salmonellosis from dissection of owl pellets, containing the residue
of eaten rodents. A discussion regarding the origin of owl pellets is
found below:

Like all birds, owls have no teeth to chew their food. Their food is
usually swallowed whole, or in large chunks. After an owl swallows a
mouse, strong acids in the owl's stomach begin to digest the mouse's
muscle and other soft parts. The owl can't digest the bones and fur
that come along with the meal, so the owl's stomach forms these
indigestible materials into tight packages called pellets. Several
hours after a meal, an owl will regurgitate one of these pellets. The
pellets, along with feathers and other remains, can be found under owl
roosts. - Mod.LL]

[Human salmonellosis from contact with contaminated dry dog food and
dog treats has also been reported -- see ProMED archives 2008, 2000 &
1999 below. - Mod.JW]
