A mosquito-borne virus with symptoms similar to dengue fever is
spreading rapidly in Burma [Myanmar], according to doctors who
asserted, however, that it has a low fatality rate.

The chikungunya virus only became commonplace in Burma [Myanmar] in
mid-2009, although cases were reported as far back as 1975. It comes
as doctors warn of a new wave of the A(H1N1) and A(H5N1) viruses in
Burma [Myanmar] that have struck more than 60 people in the past
fortnight.

"Chikungunya [disease] begins like a normal flu with symptoms such as
aches and pains, especially in the joints," [said] a specialist
doctor in Rangoon [Yangon]. "The joint pain can be so severe that
elderly patients may be unable to walk." Although the flu has strong
symptoms, it has a low fatality rate, particularly if the patient
receives proper treatment at inception, the doctor said. "Personal
hygiene is important for flu diseases. Wash hands properly and avoid
getting bitten by mosquitoes. Chikungunya [virus] is mainly
contracted [transmitted] by mosquitoes," he said.

[Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of
infected mosquitoes. It was relatively common in southern and
southeastern Asia in the 1960s. The localized outbreaks and sporadic
cases continued in Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines in the
1980s.

Chikungunya causes high fever, prominent lymphadenopathy, and
leucopenia. The disease resembles dengue fever and is characterized
by arthralgia or arthritis, primarily in the wrist, knee, ankle, and
small joints of the extremities, lasting days to months. It is rarely
life threatening. Diagnosis may be made by RT-PCR on blood.
Serological tests show IgM in acute serum samples and a rise in
titers to alphaviruses between acute and convalescent samples (see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs327/en/>).

In 2009, chikungunya outbreaks were reported in various southern
provinces of Thailand after the re-emergence of chikungunya fever
started in Narathiwat province, Thailand in October 2008 (see prior
PRO/MBDS postings listed below).

According to the Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance Report (WESR) of
the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand,
dated 23 Jan 2010 and available in Thai language at
<http://203.157.15.4/wesr/file/y53/F5352.pdf>, there were 49 069
cases attributable to chikungunya fever, attack rate 77.41 per 100
000 population, between 1 Jan 2009 and 28 Dec 2009. Those cases were
reported in 58 provinces in Thailand. The highest attack rate (per
100 000 population) was reported from Narathiwat province (1130.67),
followed by Phuket (1027.81), Songkha (732.39), Pattani (703.55), and
Yala (594.55).

In 2010, according to the Weekly Epidemiological Surveillance Report
(WESR) of the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health,
Thailand, dated 23 Feb 2010 and available in Thai language at
<http://203.157.15.4/chikun/chikun/situation/y52/chikun_201003022314.pdf>,
344 chikungunya fever cases in 21 provinces in Thailand have been
reported. Among these, 123 cases in 13 provinces were reported in
January 2010, including one case reported from Tak province, whose
western edge shares a border with Kayin State of Myanmar. 289 out of
344 cases (84 percent) were reported in southern provinces. A high
number of cases were found in Pattalung province (149 cases), Nakhon
Srithammarat (38 cases), and Rayong (36 cases).

Maps of Thailand showing the distribution of cases in January and
February 2010 are available on the last page of the report. In the
map, red color represents provinces that reported cases in the last 2
weeks; yellow represents provinces that reported cases in the last
2-4 weeks; grey represents provinces that reported cases more than 4
weeks ago; and in white, provinces that have not reported cases.

The newswire above mentions that chikungunya is spreading rapidly in
Myanmar; however, there is no information about the number of
confirmed cases and the geographic distribution of cases. PRO/MBDS
would greatly appreciate receiving information from knowledgeable
sources about the chikungunya outbreak in Myanmar.
