Russia: Outbreak of Hepatitis A in Murmansk Region
--------------------------------------------------
The city of Apatit in the Murmansk region is experiencing a serious
outbreak of hepatitis A. The 1st patients were admitted to the
hospital 2 months ago. At the present time, 130 people in the city of
Apatit have been diagnosed with hepatitis A. The number is increasing
day by day, and many children are among the infected.
Epidemiologists are suggesting that water is the source of the
outbreak. A regulation improving the chlorination of water supplies
was issued recently, but so far this measure has not produced the
expected result. Although physicians regard water as the source of
the outbreak, infection is spreading geometrically by contact.
Yuriy Evdokimov, the Mayer of Murmansk, is appealing to the
population to observe simple rules such as careful hand-washing and
avoidance of visits to neighbors/relatives in Apatit. If these simple
rules are not observed, emergency measures will be implemented and a
state of quarantine will be declared in the city of Apatit. The
officials had allocated 4.5 million rubles [USD 162 000] for urgent
vaccination of the population.
According to the Chief of the City Health Department, several
vaccination centers are being opened throughout the city.
Vaccination will be carried out on weekdays and also during the
week-end. People at risk (those living in dormitories and
schoolchildren) are the 1st priority for vaccination.

[The Murmansk Region is located in northwest Russia on the Kola
Peninsula, above the Arctic Circle. However, the severity of the
climate is ameliorated by the warming influence of the Gulf Stream.
The region borders Finland to the west, Norway to the north, and the
Republic of Kareliya (another region of northwest Russia) to the
south. - Mod.NR]
