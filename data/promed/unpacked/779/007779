Traces of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have so far linked infected animals to an auction facility in Limpopo, with at least 5 commercial facilities affected as a result.

In a joint statement, the Departments of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development and the National Animal Health Forum (NHF) on FMD said there are more concerns that purchased animals at the same auction could be affected.

"All known infected properties have been placed under quarantine, suspect properties under precautionary quarantine (and) plans to resolve the situation are being implemented," the statement read.

On 1 Nov 2019, veterinary services were alerted to clinical signs of FMD in a herd of cattle on a farm in the Molemole Local Municipality in the Capricorn district, Limpopo.

So far, at least 5 properties have been confirmed affected.

A technical task team has been established, comprising the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries veterinary officials, provincial veterinary officials, as well as industry commodity groups led by the NHF and experts in the specific disease.

FMD is a highly contagious viral disease that affects cattle, pigs (domestic and wild), sheep, goats, and other cloven-hoofed animals.

Signs of disease in animals may include symptoms of depression, sores in the mouth of animals causing reluctance to eat, and lameness. FMD, however, may show no clinical signs for up to 14 days ["incubation time"].

The department has advised farmers and livestock owners that all parties transacting with cloven-hoofed animals should observe the utmost caution.

All gatherings of animals from more than one source -- including auctions, livestock shows, and speculative transactions -- were being discouraged.

[On Wed 6 Nov 2019, South Africa submitted to the OIE an immediate notification reporting an FMD outbreak in Limpopo (coordinates of the outbreak's location were modified to protect confidentiality as required by South African Legislation). The serotype was indicated as pending (see 20191107.6766426).

A follow-up report was submitted on 15 Nov 2019, reporting 4 additional outbreaks in Limpopo; the established serotype of the causative agent was reported as FMDV SAT2. The 4 new outbreaks, combined, involved a total of 8354 susceptible animals, of which 33 were clinical cases.

A summary of the event since its start and as of 15 Nov 2019, including an interactive map presenting the 5 accumulated outbreaks, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=32311.

In 2014, South Africa was officially recognised by the OIE as a 'country having a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)-free zone where vaccination is not practised.' Following a previous outbreak, the FMD-free status was suspended with effect from 2 Jan 2019. This suspension is in force.

According to South Africa's Red Meat Producers' Organisation (RPO), the resulting temporary ban on livestock auctions in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and the North West places significant financial strain on the livestock industry. The estimated weekly turnover for inland auction houses in big producing areas is R180 million (nearly USD 12.3 million). This outbreak has a huge impact on farmers' profits, especially on small- and medium-scale farmers that utilise auctions as cash-flow management tools (see https://www.agriorbit.com/biosecurity-in-sa-taking-up-the-mantle-of-accountability/). - Mod.AS
