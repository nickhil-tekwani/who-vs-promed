Swans tested for bird flu in Caernarfon
---------------------------------------
Bird flu tests will be carried out today [13 Jun 2008] on 7 swans found
dead in a river near Caernarfon [Gwynedd county, north west Wales;

<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701520044/Caernarfon_Bay.html> - Mod.AS].

The carcasses were discovered floating in the Seiont not far from the
town's historic castle. Locals alerted harbour master Richard Jones on
Wednesday [11 Jun 2008], and his team recovered 3 dead swans in the
morning, followed by 4 more in the afternoon.

Yesterday the team were back at the riverbank after residents reported
another swan appeared to be ill. Mr Jones said he was initially advised by
DEFRA [Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] that the
government would not test for bird flu in cases involving fewer than 10
dead wild birds.

He was advised to safely bag up the birds in black bin liners and throw
them into a waste bin. But last night the Welsh Assembly confirmed experts
would test the carcasses today, as part of the avian flu surveillance
programme. They stressed at this stage there was no evidence [to suggest
that] bird flu could be the cause of death.

The harbour master and his team were baffled as to how the animals had
died. The Environment Agency said as there were no dead fish in the river;
it was not believed they had been poisoned. But some local fishermen feared
an unusual foam they had spotted on the surface could be to blame.
Questions were last night being asked about why officials had not
investigated earlier.

Mr Jones said: "I had the 1st report about 10:30 am from a lady walking her
dog who said she'd seen a dead swan near the Aber swing bridge. I had to
get into the water myself and pick them up using gloves. I placed each one
in a plastic bag tied it and put the bag and the gloves in another bag and
tied that up Â­- which meant they were double-bagged. Half of them had been
dead a while. They were starting to smell, and rigor mortis was setting in.
I asked the DEFRA helpline operator about the possibility of avian flu and
she was quite surprised their system had not come up with any alarms. My
information wasn't telling her to take any action."

Richard said he counted 14 healthy swans a few days ago and there had been
as many as 60 in the past. "I am obviously worried," he said. "I probably
would be more alarmed but DEFRA and the Environment Agency are not taking
it seriously. We're obviously monitoring the situation."

Yesterday Richard took a call from local fishermen who had come across foam
in the river. Richard said: "They thought it could have been the cause of
the deaths. I reported it to the Environment Agency but I haven't heard
anything since. You would have thought it would warrant further investigation."

Later yesterday Mr Jones had a call from DEFRA's chief veterinary officer
asking them to take the swans out of the bins, and telling them somebody
would collect them today.

A Welsh Assembly Government spokesperson said: "We are aware of the
situation. As a precaution the birds will be collected and samples taken
for testing as part of the avian influenza wild bird surveillance
programme. Wild birds die for a variety of reasons and there is currently
no evidence to suggest in this case that bird flu is present."

Gwynedd council and the Environment Agency said they had not been contacted
by any other agencies that required them to take action.
