[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers because they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

According to the data on the Johns Hopkins website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 119 132, with 80 954 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 38 034 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 114 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 5183 cases reported in the past 24 hours, with Italy accounting for 977 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 881 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 277 of newly reported cases. There were 12 other countries with more than 50 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were: Spain, 622; France, 575; Germany, 389; USA, 367; Norway, 195; Denmark, 172; Switzerland, 117; Sweden, 107; Japan, 70; Netherlands, 61; UK, 61; and Austria, 51. Of the 12 countries, 10 are in Europe. A global total of 4284 deaths have been reported, 1126 outside mainland China.

For the 13th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. - Mod.MPP]

At 04:00 on [10 Mar 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 24 new confirmed cases, 22 new deaths (22 in Hubei), and 31 new suspected cases.

On the same day, 1578 cases were cured and discharged, 3235 persons were removed from close contact with medical observation, and 302 severe cases were reduced.

As of 24:00 on [10 Mar 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 16 145 confirmed cases (including 4492 severe cases), 61 475 cured cases, and 3158 who died. A total of 80 778 confirmed cases have been reported, and there are currently 285 suspected cases. A total of 675 886 close contacts have been tracked, and 14 607 close contacts are still in medical observation.

There were 13 new confirmed cases in Hubei (13 in Wuhan), 1471 new cases cured (1212 in Wuhan), 22 new deaths (19 in Wuhan), and 15 671 confirmed cases (14 514 in Wuhan). Among them, 4412 were severe cases (4217 in Wuhan). A total of 49 056 discharged patients were cured (33 041 in Wuhan), a total of 3046 deaths (2423 in Wuhan), and a total of 67 773 confirmed cases (49 978 in Wuhan).

[According to the report above, a total of 80 778 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from China, representing an increase of 24 cases in the past 24 hours, of which 13 (54.2%) were in Hubei province. It is the 4rd consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. As I mentioned in yesterday's post (20200310.7070560), daily case counts less than 20 were last reported in mid-January 2020 when the conclusion was there still had not been person-to-person transmission identified (see Novel coronavirus (04): China (HU), Thailand ex China, WHO 20200114.6889527, section [3] for discussion). While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, 22 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. Five new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

Of note is the increasing numbers of imported cases mentioned with 10 newly imported cases (6 in Beijing, 2 in Shanghai, 1 in Shandong, and 1 in Gansu), bringing the total number of imported cases to 79. If the imported cases are counted in the daily totals, then 41.7% of the newly confirmed cases mentioned in today's (10 Mar 2020) update were imported cases. A challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 10 149, including 631 deaths, up from 9172 cases and 463 deaths reported on 9 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (5791), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (1533), and Venice (856), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 59.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

72 hours ago, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. 48 hours ago this was changed to be country wide. We shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least 1 incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period. The Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

A dashboard similar to the Hopkins dashboard, including a map, produced by Italy showing the situation in real time, can be found at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1.

C. Iran: 7161 cases, 237 deaths
Date: Wed 11 Mar 2020 12:29 AM IRST
Source: Rappler, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.rappler.com/world/regions/middle-east/254046-iran-coronavirus-death-toll-march-10-2020


Iran on Tuesday [10 Mar 2020], reported 54 new deaths from the novel coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day toll since the start of the country's outbreak. The latest deaths bring the number of those killed by the virus in the Islamic republic to 291, the health ministry's spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised conference.

He added that 881 new cases had been confirmed, bringing the total number of people infected to an official 8042. But "2731 people, which is about 10 times the number of dear countrymen we've lost, have recovered and been discharged from hospitals," Jahanpour said.

The outbreak of the virus in Iran is one of the deadliest outside China, where the disease originated.

With 2114 cases, the capital Tehran remains the worst-hit province. The northern province of Mazandaran climbed to 2nd place with 253 new cases, bringing the total there to 886, followed by 751 in Qom, the Shiite pilgrimage city south of Tehran where the country's 1st cases were reported.

Mazandaran is a popular tourist spot bordering the Caspian Sea, and is particularly popular during holidays for the Iranian New Year, which this year starts on [20 Mar 2020]. Iran is yet to officially impose quarantines but authorities have repeatedly called on people to refrain from travelling and have resorted to closing hotels and other accommodation to discourage travel. "As we said and expected in recent days, Mazandaran has almost reached the top of the chart" in terms of infections and is second only to Tehran, Jahanpour said. "Our warnings against travelling to Mazandaran may be more understandable today," he added.

Iran's fatalities include several politicians and government officials, as well as some hospital staff.

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei agreed on Tuesday [10 Mar 2020] to designate hospital staff who died after contracting the virus as "martyrs," following a suggestion by the health minister, according to the official IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency] news agency. In the Islamic republic, the families of those designated martyrs usually receive financial aid and other benefits from the state.

The supreme leader also cancelled his annual speech in Mashhad city to mark the Persian new year due to concerns about the virus outbreak and health authorities' calls "to avoid gatherings and travel." According to health ministry figures, 222 people have been infected by the virus in the Khorasan Razavi province, where Mashhad is located.

Apart from direct fatalities, 44 people have died from methanol poisoning in Iran after rumors that drinking alcohol could help cure or protect from the disease.

[In the past 24 hours, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran has grown from 7161 to 8042 an increase of 881 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 237 to 291, an increase of 54 deaths in the past 24 hours.

Qom, while the apparent original epicenter of this outbreak, is located to the south west of Tehran in central Iran. Tehran is now the epicenter of the outbreak with 2114 confirmed cases (an increase of 309 cases from yesterday, 10 Mar 2020). Mazandaran reported 886 cases (an increase of 253 cases in the past 24 hours, and Qom, with 751 cases in 3rd place. Cases have now been confirmed in all of the 31 provinces in the country.

Another media report mentioned that drones were being used to disinfect grounds around hospitals treating COVID-19 cases, spraying sterilizing liquids in areas around hospitals and other high risk areas. 3 10-minute rounds spraying the emergency unit entrances, the hospital buildings, and areas where COVID-19 patients were treated.

[5] USA, NY containment zone
Date: Tue 10 Mar 2020
Source: New York State Governor press release [edited]
https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-accepts-recommendation-state-health-commissioner-new-emergency-measures-contain


Governor Andrew M Cuomo today [10 Mar 2020] accepted the recommendation of State Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker for new emergency measures to contain the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] cluster in New Rochelle. The area currently has 108 confirmed cases and is considered a "cluster." The protocols include closing schools, houses of worship, and other large gathering facilities within a 1-mile radius [1.6 km] in New Rochelle for a 2-week period, from [Thu 12 Mar 2020 to Wed 25 Mar 2020].

The Governor has deployed National Guard troops to a Health Department command post in New Rochelle to assist with the outbreak. The troops are mobilizing to deliver food to homes and help with cleaning public spaces in the containment area.

The Governor confirmed 31 additional cases of novel coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 173 confirmed cases in New York State. Of the 173 total individuals who tested positive for the virus, the geographic breakdown is as follows:
Westchester: 108 (10 new)
New York City: 36 (17 new)
Nassau: 19 (2 new)
Rockland: 6 (2 new)
Saratoga: 2
Suffolk: 1
Ulster: 1

The Governor also announced the State will partner with Northwell Health to set up a satellite testing facility in New Rochelle. Visits would operate by appointment only. More information will be posted soon on the State Department of Health website.

"The largest cluster of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country is located in New Rochelle, and as the numbers continue to go up we need a special public health strategy to contain it," Governor Cuomo said. "We are moving from containment to mitigation, and because much of the transmission of this disease tends to happen on a geographic basis, we are attacking this hotspot at the source. As the number of positive cases rises, I am urging all New Yorkers to remember the bottom line: we talk about all this stuff to keep the public informed -- not to incite fear -- and if you are not a member of the vulnerable population then there is no reason for excess anxiety."

New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said, "As we see the number of cases continue to rise based upon close contacts with persons who are positive for COVID-19, there is a particular need to reduce the opportunity for further close contacts. These opportunities include schools, churches, synagogues, and other event spaces where large numbers of people gather and remain together for extended periods of time. Although we believe that the risk generally to New Yorkers is low, I have recommended this strategy to reduce opportunities for further spread with the goal of reducing the number of new cases we are seeing in New Rochelle."

The list of facilities in the containment area is being promulgated in consultation with local partners including the County Executive and the Mayor of New Rochelle. The State will work with impacted schools to ensure any child who currently depends on food assistance programs will continue to relieve those benefits during the 2-week period.

The mitigation measures as described are not as strict as those implemented by China and Italy. They are primarily directed towards eliminating large people gatherings, in schools, event locales, and religious houses of worship. It does not mention if movie theaters and other theaters will be closed. Will these measures slow down the transmission? 2 weeks is one incubation period, is that long enough to demonstrate an impact? We await the results of this strategy.

[6] Hypertension as risk factor for poor outcome
Date: Tue 10 Mar 2020 3:41 AM GMT+1
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-09/top-virus-doctor-says-high-blood-pressure-is-major-death-risk


Patients with hypertension appear to be at a higher risk of dying from the coronavirus, said a top Chinese intensive care doctor who's been treating critically ill patients since mid-January [2020]. While there's been no published research yet explaining why, Chinese doctors working in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged, have noticed that infected patients with that underlying illness are more likely to slip into severe distress and die.

Of a group of 170 patients who died in January [2020] in Wuhan -- the 1st wave of casualties caused by a pathogen that's now raced around the world -- nearly half had hypertension. "That's a very high ratio," said Du Bin, director of the intensive care unit at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, in an interview with Bloomberg over the phone from Wuhan. He was among a team of top doctors sent to the devastated city 2 months ago to help treat patients there.

"From what I was told by other doctors and the data I can see myself, among all the underlying diseases, hypertension is a key dangerous factor," said Du, one of the most respected critical care experts in China. "Though there is no research published on that yet, we believe hypertension could be an important factor causing patients to deteriorate, leading to a bad prognosis."

As the outbreak picks up speed in Europe and the US, plunging countries like Italy into crisis, doctors are struggling to treat the highly-infectious pathogen that's infected over 108 000 people globally in just 3 months. Understanding the course of the disease and identifying individuals at greatest risk are critical for optimizing care for a global contagion that's killed more than 3700 people since emerging in China in December [2019]

Answers may lie in studying the large pool of patients in China, where more than 15 000 remain hospitalized although new infections have slowed dramatically. The disease turns critical in 6% of patients and deterioration can happen very quickly. "We'll keep an eye on old people and those with high blood pressure. They are the key focus," said Du.

Besides the hypertension factor, Du's other insights into treating the disease are:
- Move aggressively to ventilate
Du said that doctors should not hesitate to escalate measures for patients facing respiratory distress, as organ failure can set in quickly after. That means doctors should intervene aggressively with invasive ventilation measures -- inserting a tube into a patient's throat or cutting the throat open to create an airway -- when low blood oxygen levels can't be improved by less invasive measures.

Almost half of the patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation end up dying, but most of those who recover are those who were put on invasive ventilation early, said Du. "Patients need to use invasive ventilation as early as possible, there's no point of doing it late," he said.

Respiratory therapists -- doctors that specialize in ventilation and oxygen treatment -- are becoming all the more important in treating patients critically ill with COVID-19 as they are more knowledgeable and can fine-tune ventilators to suit patient conditions.

- No 'magic bullets' in drugs
There is growing anticipation over drugs being developed to treat the virus, with investors adding billions to the market value of pharmaceutical companies testing treatments now. But Du said drugs alone cannot save patients, especially those in severe condition. The experience of SARS, the epidemic 17 years ago that sickened almost 8000 people, showed that most patients can be cured without a specific anti-viral drug, said Du. And the abundance of antibiotics has not prevented deaths by bacterial infections, he added. "When there's a virus infection, we hope there's a drug that can kill the virus and change the clinical outcome. But there's no magic bullet."

Instead, teamwork among specialists and nurses in intensive care units can be more crucial in keeping patients alive, he said. "An ICU doctor should work like a conductor in an orchestra to provide life-sustaining treatment while taking into consideration different specialist views," he said.

- Threat of re-infection
Reports that people who have recovered and been discharged from hospital later test positive again -- and even die from the disease -- have ignited fears that the virus can somehow re-emerge. Du said that patients becoming re-infected again within days of leaving the hospital makes no sense "theoretically" as the antibodies in their bloodstream generated from fighting the disease do not disappear so quickly, although they don't necessarily stay forever.

"What we need to look at in terms of those who tested positive again is concerns over the authenticity of their negative results," he said. For example, samples taken from different areas of the same patient could test differently depending on where the virus resides. Test kits made by different manufacturers could also have inconsistencies that impact test results, he said.

- Mild impact on pregnant women, children
Despite their seeming physical vulnerability, pregnant women and children do not seem to be affected by the coronavirus in a serious manner, Du said. This is in contrast to other viruses like influenza. "From what we known, infected pregnant women do not get into a serious situation with the coronavirus," Du said. "With influenza, pregnancy is a high risk factor that can cause severe symptoms and lead to bad outcomes, but not this time."

Children infected with the coronavirus also seem to experience only mild symptoms, said Du. He has not seen any child infections deteriorate to a state which requires intensive care.

[This observation was also given by Dr Bruce Aylward, head of the WHO mission that went to China, in an interview upon his return, although I have been unable to locate the interview to link it here. It has been demonstrated that the ACE-2 receptor site is cell entry site for the SARS-CoV-2, The observation that more serious outcomes including death were observed in individuals with hypertension makes one wonder if data are being collected looking at those with hypertension treated with ACE inhibitors versus those using other types of antihypertensive medications.

Kuba K, Imai Y, and Penninger JM postulate that stimulating ACE2 activity might be a means of mitigating acute lung injury, including those seen with ARDS (Acute respiratory distress syndrome) such as seen with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast, I wonder if suppression of the ACE2 activity to maintain good blood pressure control may well predispose individuals to more severe acute lung injury due to the absence of ACE2 activity.

Kuba, Imai, and Penninger postulate that enhancing ACE2 activity (as opposed to inhibiting it through ACE inhibitors used for hypertension control,) may well be a strategy for reducing lung damage during events associated with acute lung injury.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance. Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays a central role in generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, and capillary blood vessels in the lung are one of the major sites of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body. The RAS has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, both commonly seen in chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive lung disease. Recent studies indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ACE2, a close homologue of ACE, functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system and was identified as a key receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus infections. In the lung, ACE2 protects against acute lung injury in several animal models of ARDS. Thus, the RAS appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Indeed, increasing ACE2 activity might be a novel approach for the treatment of acute lung failure in several diseases.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CET.

Highlights
----------
- Five new countries/territories/areas (Brunei Darussalam, Mongolia, Cyprus, Guernsey, and Panama) have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- As of 9 Mar 2020, a total of 45 States Parties informed WHO of additional health measures they implemented in relation to COVID-19 and provided the public health rationale for these measures. WHO reiterates that measures that restrict the movement of people during this outbreak should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in duration and reviewed regularly as more information about the virus, the disease epidemiology, and clinical characteristics becomes available. For more information, please see 'subject in focus'.

- WHO Director-General in his regular media briefing on [10 Mar 2020] stated that the threat of a pandemic has become very real; however, this would be the 1st pandemic in history that could be controlled. For details, please see https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---9-march-2020

Subject in focus: travel measures
---------------------------------
Travel measures As of [9 Mar 2020], a total of 45 States Parties informed WHO of additional health measures they implemented in relation to COVID-19 and provided the public health rationale for these measures. Many States Parties are implementing additional health measures against countries other than China. WHO has shared this information with States Parties through the Event Information Site secure platform on a weekly basis. In addition, WHO Director-General informed States Parties of the measures and public health rationale provided through 2 Circular Letters - on [6 and 17 Feb 2020].

Table 1. Number of States Parties officially reporting additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (that is, more than 24h delay), under Article 43 of the IHR (2005) (by WHO region) [figures and tables available at the source URL above]

As virus transmission shifts to other countries, measures are currently being implemented against countries other than China (figure 1). The main reasons given for implementing such measures continue to be perceived vulnerabilities/limited country capacity and the nature of the virus epidemiology (figure 2).

WHO also monitors other sources of information: IATA (1), SOS international (2), and countries' official websites. Measures such as flight suspensions are often implemented by industries, which are not bound by the IHR (2005; and such measures are often driven by economic considerations, such as reduced demand, or concerns for crew staff (3). Preliminary analysis shows that in some countries such travel measures may have delayed the importation of new cases, while in other countries the "restrictions" did not stop the importation of new cases.

WHO reiterates that measures that restrict the movement of people during this outbreak should be proportionate to the public health risk, short in duration and reviewed regularly as more information about the virus, the disease epidemiology and clinical characteristics becomes available. See also updated WHO recommendations on international traffic, published on [29 Feb 2020] (4).

*The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

****"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 109. This includes 11 countries from the Western Pacific region, 51 countries (including 3 territories) from the European region, 8 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 17 countries (including 4 territories) from the Americas region, and 6 countries from the African region. 61 countries/territories are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Pakistan, Poland and North Macedonia newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission and clusters of cases were also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess) and the cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 28 674 including 686 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
