[This immediate notification confirms the request for information published in the ProMED-mail posting 20160204.3995465. Unfortunately the disease has spread across the whole country, and is not just limited to the governorate of Dohuk, as was noted by the veterinary authorities in the February 2016 posting above.

A map of Iraq can be accessed at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/iraq_map.htm. - Mod.CRD

In view of the recent detection of HPAI H5N1 in eastern Lebanon, adjacent to the Syrian border, reportedly due to "illegal movement of poultry", and the current alarming report from Iraq, the circulation of the virus in Syria is most probable. Alertness in other countries in the region is essential.

In Lebanon, an HPAI H5N1 contingency plan, prepared with FAO support in 2007, has been activated. - Mod.AS
