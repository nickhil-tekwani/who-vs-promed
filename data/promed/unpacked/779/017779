A total of 16 people were admitted into hospitals in the city of Zarqa (east of Amman), on Friday [6 Jan 2012] after suffering from food poisoning symptoms.

All the patients were taken to Prince Hashim and Prince Faisal Military Hospitals were suffering from similar symptoms after apparently eating poisoned food in Awajan district. All the patients received medical treatment at the hospitals and are in stable condition, a source of civil defense department said.

It is not clear what the etiology of this foodborne illness is given the lack of further information. Data needed in order to speculate on the etiology of the illness would include type of food ingested, incubation period of illness, presence or absence of fever, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea and the length of the illness. - Mod.LL
