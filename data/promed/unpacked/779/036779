After having read both the posting by Dr. Strakrle and the further
comment of the ProMED Moderator, I do think that some confusion
remains in how to interpret brucellosis and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 serology.
May I make 3 comments?
1) Brucellosis serology
-----------------------
I understood that acute brucellosis was diagnosed based on
serological titers using _B. abortus_ antigens. One has to
re-emphasize that positive serological titers is either indicative of
a smooth _Brucella spp._ infection (one cannot make any inference as
to whether _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ or _B. suis_ is involved
unless the most likely source of infection is identified) or/and _Y.
enterocolitica_ O:9 infection.
Clinical symptoms help in classifying the case as probable or
confirmed brucellosis, according to the CDC case definition. In this
particular case, given the patient was in Turkey (where _B.
melitensis_ is enzootic in sheep) and given the fact that sheep
cheese has been consumed, one can reasonably assume that _B.
melitensis_ is involved, not _B. abortus_. _B. abortus_ is seldom
reported to infect sheep, but _B. melitensis_ is reported to
regularly infect cattle in the Mediterranean basin (1).
One can argue that _B. abortus_ infects cattle in Turkey. Human
brucellosis cases reported in that country have predominantly been
attributed to _B. melitensis_
2) _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 serology
----------------------------------
Serological cross-reactivity after Smooth _Brucella spp_ (not just
_B. abortus_) and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection both in animals
and humans has been well documented. This is why the antibody test
for _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 is likely to be a cross-reaction, unless
the diagnosis of the extraintestinal form of yersiniosis can be
further substantiated.
3) In the veterinary field
-------------------------
Brucellosis control or eradication programs are implemented
worldwide, mainly for cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. In this
context, the objective is not primarily to diagnose _Y.
enterocolitica_ O:9 infections, but to exclude brucellosis. In other
words, the _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 status will not tell anything
about the brucellosis status. In this context, serology seems so far
unable to differentiate beyond certain smooth _Brucella spp_
infection and _Y. enterocolitica_ O:9 infection. This is why
measurement of the cell-mediated immunity via the brucellosis skin
test is the only means by which one can beyond any reasonable doubt
differentiate smooth _Brucella spp_ infection and _Y. enterocolitica_
O:9 infection (2).
May I take this opportunity to thank for you for the invaluable
source of information ProMED is, particularly for those living and
working somewhere "at the end of the world."
