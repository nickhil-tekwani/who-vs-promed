[1] _Dickeya solani_ - Scotland: new outbreak

Potato industry 'at risk' after latest outbreak of disease
----------------------------------------------------------
The Scottish seed potato industry has reacted with anger to the
confirmation of another crop of potatoes being infected with the
highly infectious and transmissible potato disease _Dickeya solani_,
which was found in a sample of ware potatoes grown in 2009 outside
Arbroath. The outbreak has similarities with the 1st discovery near
Coupar Angus [ProMED-mail post 20100528.1775] in that it originally
came in via certified seed from England and that prepackers Albert
Bartlett were involved.

One difference this time is that the disease has been found in the
variety Vivaldi, whereas on the 1st occasion the variety was
Innovator. The infected sample was found in the heartland of potato
growing in Scotland with almost half the total crop grown within a 30
mile [48 km] radius. This is putting the whole Scottish potato
industry at risk. In 2009, seed was exported to more than 30
countries. When the disease first swept through Holland, in one year
GBP 20m [approx. 30.25m] was wiped off profits. The Dutch also
suffered a loss of several export markets.

Bartletts confirmed that the seed had gone to a number of farms which
had been inspected and no disease was found. The crop near Arbroath
was in cold store when the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency
[SASA] took a random sample in November 2009 and found the disease.
Industry leaders were reluctant to discuss the matter and said it was
for SASA to deal with. Crop inspectors will take samples from plants
showing blackleg symptoms from all crops of non-Scottish origin seed
and also from 10 percent of Scottish origin crops.

[2] Early blight, high risk

Dry weather increases alternaria risk in potatoes
-------------------------------------------------
Potato growers should consider spraying varieties susceptible to
alternaria at the end of the rapid growth stage, especially those
that have suffered heat or drought stress. The long, hot spell is
raising concerns that the disease, also known as early blight, could
build over the next few weeks. Dry weather poses a double risk -- it
initiates spore release and causes plants to wilt, predisposing them
to infection during the next humid period.

"That doesn't have to be irrigation -- a heavy dew is probably
enough," says SAC's [Scottish Agricultural College] John Sarup. "It
can cause 30 percent yield loss in severe cases." The key thing is to
apply fungicide before the disease takes hold and watch susceptible
varieties closely.

[Blackleg
--------
Blackleg caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp. _atrosepticum_
can cause severe losses in potato crops. However, an even more
virulent form of blackleg emerged in recent years as a major threat
spreading in Europe and Israel. The cause has only been identified as
a new bacterial species in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162)
currently referred to as _Dickeya solani_. Symptoms resemble
"traditional" blackleg and include wilting of plants and tuber rot,
but the disease appears to be more aggressive and causes damage under
a wider range of conditions and at lower bacterial loadings.
Preliminary results from Europe indicate that the new species will
rapidly take over as the principal cause of blackleg-like symptoms in
potato crops.

The bacterium is spread with contaminated plant or other material
(including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease
management includes seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use
of clean planting material, and phytosanitation to prevent
introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of
seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread and appear
to have been the cause for both outbreaks in Scotland, despite
quarantine measures and certification schemes. An alert was issued to
regional growers earlier in 2010 (see ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421).

Early blight
-------------
Early blight of potato and tomato is caused by the fungus _Alternaria
solani_. It causes leaf spots and tuber blight on potato, and leaf
spots, fruit rot, and stem lesions on tomato. The disease can occur
over a wide range of climatic conditions and can result in complete
defoliation and severe yield losses. The pathogen often causes no
visible symptoms until plants approach maturity. It is spread with
infected plant material (including tubers, transplants, and seed), by
mechanical means, wind, and rain. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer
crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management
includes use of certified clean propagation material, fungicides,
crop rotation, and use of cultivars with reduced susceptibility. New
strains with fungicide resistances are emerging (see, for example,
ProMED-mail post 20090325.1163). An alert for early blight was issued
for the UK for the 2010 season (ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421).
