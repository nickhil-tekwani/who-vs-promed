The controversial practice of giving antibiotics to cattle apparently led
to the development of salmonella resistant to the antibiotic ceftriaxone,
according to a study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. The
work fuels a controversy in which some scientists believe the addition of
antibiotics to animal feed and the practice of using them to treat sick
livestock is breeding new generations of bacteria resistant to those
antibiotics.
The newest case is alarming because ceftriaxone is one of the few
antibiotics to which most bacteria have not developed a resistance. But
there are signs that resistance is emerging as more ceftriaxone is used --
and abused.
In the latest study, a group led by Paul Fey of the Nebraska Public Health
Laboratory examined the case of a 12-year-old boy infected with salmonella.
The bacterium was found to be resistant to ceftriaxone and a dozen other
antibiotics. Tests revealed the same resistant strain of salmonella in
local cattle, the researchers said.
The boy had apparently picked up salmonella from the family's cattle, which
had been treated with the antibiotic during an outbreak of diarrhea, the
researchers said. Precisely how the boy was infected or how many other
antibiotics the cattle had been exposed to could not be determined.
"Our findings add to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting that the
use of antimicrobial agents in livestock is the dominant source of
resistance" in salmonella, a disease that can be fatal, they said. The
results also "illustrate the need to use antimicrobial agents prudently
both in domestic animals and in humans," the Fey team said. "Restricting
the use of certain antimicrobial agents in livestock (and other techniques)
may slow the evolution of antimicrobial resistance in salmonella and
prevent the transmission of resistant strains of salmonella from livestock
to humans," they said.
Ceftriaxone is sold under the brand name Rocephin by Roche Laboratories, a
unit of Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche Holding AG .

Animal Health Institute Responds to Antimicrobial Resistance Study
The Animal Health Institute (AHI) released the following statement
regarding a study published in the 27 Apr 2000 issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine regarding antibiotic use in animals.
The article's conclusion that the antibiotic resistant strain of _Salmonella_
evolved primarily from cattle is speculative and is not supported by the
data. No evidence is provided to show cattle were treated with the
antibiotic in question or, with other antibiotics. In fact, the researchers
concede they "were unable to establish its use (Ceftriaxone) in these
herds" and "unknown environmental factors" could have been the source of
the resistant pathogen.
Ceftriaxone is a human prescription drug and is not approved for use in
animals. The AHI and its members are concerned about antimicrobial
resistance. AHI and its members have worked with the veterinary community
to develop judicious use guidelines for these important medicines.
These antibiotics undergo years of research and are approved only when
deemed safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
FDA regulates all antibiotics for animals and is currently reviewing its
approval process for animal antibiotics.
The current approval process is stringent and scientific-requiring all
antibiotics be proven safe for both humans and animals. Any changes to this
process must be based on science and on a true determination of the actual
risk to human health.

[The analysis of the NEJM article by the Animal Health Institute is
presented, above, without editing. One thing that is clear is that cattle
do NOT need to have been treated with ceftriaxone to have bacteria
resistant to the antibiotic, since multiple drug resistance (which may
include resistance to ceftriaxone) encoded on transmissible plasmids can be
selected for with a different antibiotic. This has been known since the
discovery of MDR _Shigella_ species in humans in Japan about 40 years ago
which had genes for drug resistance to antibiotics that the humanshad never
seen. For the interested reader, there is an excellent discussion of this
topic in Stanley Falkow's book "Infectious Multiple Drug Resistance",
London, Pion/Academic Press, 1975.
It is also worth noting that with the exception of _Salmonella typhi_ and
_S. paratyphi_, the sources of human infections with _Salmonella_ species
are, ultimately, animals.
ProMED-mail would be interested to hear from individuals with expertise in
this area, but will likely have to limit this thread. -Man. Ed. DS
