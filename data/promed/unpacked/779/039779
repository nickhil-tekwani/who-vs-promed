Italy: More Cases of BSE Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------
ROME: Italy confirmed 2 more cases of mad cow disease Tuesday, bringing the
total number of infected animals to 9. Another suspected case in central
Italy awaits final results. The infected cows were found in 2 separate
farms in the northern Lombardy region, said the Health Ministry. Final
analyses of the brain tissue were conducted in a Turin-based zoological
institute.
Italy has tested more than 54 500 animals since the beginning of the year,
when the European Union began requiring tests on cattle older than 30
months destined for slaughter. About 1000 tests await final results, the
Health Ministry said.
So far, Italy has had no human cases [of vCJD.

21 Texas cattle to be tested for mad cow disease
------------------------------------------------------------
AUSTIN -- A handful of cattle imported from Germany before a 1997 ban on
European livestock will be destroyed to test whether the animals were
exposed to mad cow disease, officials said Wednesday. The 21 animals from 5
ranches around the state will be killed and their remains incinerated while
samples of their brain tissue will be sent to a national laboratory in
Ames, Iowa, Animal Health Commission officials said.
The cattle are being destroyed as a precaution because of public concern
over mad cow disease, state officials said. The cattle had been under
quarantine since March 1997, after health officials traced them to their
current owners. The owners, who were not identified, had declined to sell
the animals for $2000 per head to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. They
waited until the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Texas Beef
Council and the Texas Cattlefeeders Association raised an additional $57
000 for total compensation of $99 000.
