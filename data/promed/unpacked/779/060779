[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2015, Chapter 2.3.3 Infection with _Gyrodactylus salaris_ at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.03_GYRO.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"_Gyrodactylus salaris_ is an ectoparasite affecting mainly Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), but can survive and reproduce on several salmonids, such as rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), Arctic charr (_Salvelinus alpinus_), North American brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), grayling (_Thymallus thymallus_), North American lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_), and brown trout (_Salmo trutta_) (in declining order of susceptibility).

"_G. salaris_ is restricted in its distribution to Europe. It has been recovered from farmed Atlantic salmon or farmed rainbow trout in several (mainly northern) European countries. In the wild, the parasite has been found on wild salmonids, mainly Atlantic salmon parr, in rivers in Russia, Sweden, and Norway. _G. salaris_ is more common in farmed rainbow trout than previously thought, and is likely to be present in more countries than those currently known. In 2006, _G. salaris_ was reported from fish farms in Italy and, in 2007, from fish farms in Poland and Macedonia. In 2009, _G. salaris_ was identified by the OIE reference laboratory, from fish farms in Romania. Great Britain and Ireland have been demonstrated to be free of the parasite."

"Usually there are no clinical signs in fish with one or up to a few tens of parasite specimens. In the early disease phase, increased flashing (fish scratch their skin on the substrate) is typical. Later, fish may become greyish because of increased mucus production and the fins may be eroded. Diseased fish are lethargic and are usually found in slower-moving water."

In August 2015, Sweden reported one outbreak in rainbow trout to the OIE. The event was reported as resolved on 5 Aug 2015. See final report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000018414_20150814_181857.pdf.
