Swimmer's itch outbreak, Mormon Island Beach, Nebraska, US
----------------------------------------------------------
People hoping to take a swim at the Mormon Island Recreation Area may have to wait a while, after a possible outbreak of swimmer's itch has closed the beach and swimming area indefinitely.

Nebraska Game and Parks officials say they'll continue testing the water and will reopen the swimming area when they've determined it's safe for use. People are still allowed to camp, fish, and boat at the recreation area. Nebraska Game and Parks officials say that, by this time each year, the beach at Mormon Island State Rec Area is typically packed.

Central District health officials say they received reports of the possible swimmer's itch on Monday [4 Jun 2012]. The condition is caused by parasites entering the skin. "It can be very troublesome for those affected people," environmental health specialist Grady Erickson says.

Erickson says the itching and swelling will go away eventually, even though there's no specific treatments for it. He says the itching and swelling can last 5-10 days. So those people hoping to catch some rays on the beach or in the water at Mormon Island will have to wait out the parasite too. An outbreak last summer kept the swimming area closed 3 to 4 weeks.

[Swimmer's itch is found worldwide in temperate zones and is caused by the avian schistosomes _Trichobilharzia_ spp. and _Gigantobilharzia_ spp. (see the moderator's comment at ProMED-mail posting number 20061208.3464). The cercariae penetrate the skin and die, resulting in an inflammatory reaction that causes the rash. The infection never develops into schistosomiasis. Drying the skin immediately after swimming may reduce the number of cercariae on the skin.
