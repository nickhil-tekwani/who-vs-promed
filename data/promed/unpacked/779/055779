[The number of active cases remains the same at 12 with 3 still considered "unstable" or in critical condition. In addition, 11 of the 12 active cases are no longer PCR positive for the MERS-CoV, suggesting that there is still one individual who is PCR positive for the virus and potentially still infectious to others.

As mentioned in the previous post, declaration of the end of the outbreak is made by WHO when 2 incubation periods (an incubation period is considered to be 14 days) have passed since the last case has tested negative for the virus twice. Hence, since there is still one individual who has not tested negative for the virus, the outbreak is still considered active, even though the date of onset of the most recent case was 4 Jul 2015.

The website continues to provide details on new suspected cases identified among individuals coming from the Middle East to South Korea. All of the individuals identified to date appear to be nationals of Middle Eastern countries... a curious observation.

[During the period since the last update information was posted (30 Jul-3 Aug 2015) there were 4 days with no new cases reported, followed by reports of 2 new cases on 3 Aug 2015 -- both from Riyadh. That being said, it does appear as though there is an ongoing outbreak in Riyadh. It is unclear if this outbreak is community based, involving close contacts of cases in the community environment alone, or if this is another healthcare environment (hospital) related outbreak. Tracing back there were sporadic cases reported from Riyadh in March and April 2015. On 11 May 2015 there were 4 cases reported, presumed to be sporadic as there was no history of contact with other known cases identified (only one of whom gave a history of frequent contact with camels). Including the cases reported on 11 May 2015 there have been 19 cases reported from Riyadh since 11 May 2015, with 9 cases reported since 21 Jul 2015, all of whom either gave a definite history of contact with other known cases (2 were stated to be family members of confirmed cases) or a possible history of contact with other known cases was under review.
