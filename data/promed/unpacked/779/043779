- Thu 16 Apr 2020. 1st death after 52 days
[Vanguard, abridged, edited]
https://www.vanguardngr.com/2020/04/drc-buries-ebola-victim-who-starts-new-vaccinations/

The Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday [11 Apr 2020] buried the patient who died of Ebola in Beni Friday [10 Apr 2020]. The death reset counter of the haemorrhagic fever epidemic as the country was set to declare its official end Monday [13 Apr 2020].

But for the victim's parents, the patient was asymptomatic. The victim's mother said they had all along not once suspected Ebola till last Friday [10 Apr 2020].

"I was convinced that my child was suffering from chest pains. I didn't see any signs of blood. He had no diarrhea and was not vomiting. He was doing well without showing any of these signs. He just had pains in his chest. If he had had diarrhea or vomited, we would have gone to the general hospital. Then we would have known it was Ebola."

The case of the 26-year-old was the 1st after 52 days of respite for the country. As of Mon 13 Apr [2020], the WHO Africa region reported that vaccinations have begun in parts of Beni.

"We were going to declare the end of Ebola on Monday [13 Apr 2020], but it's normal, it can happen. That's why we have put a 42-day window, twice the incubation period, to make sure no transmission chain has been missed," Steve Ahoka, Public Health Officer, said.

The DRC is still in the grip of the Ebola epidemic, the 10th in the country's history. The current outbreak dates back to 1 Aug 2018 and has already caused 2273 deaths, according to the WHO.

- Thu 16 Apr 2020. Beni: Paralysis of socio-economic activities
[Radio Moto; in French, machine trans., edited]
http://www.radiomoto.net/2020/04/16/beni-la-resurgence-controversee-de-cas-ebola-a-la-base-dune-paralysie-des-activites-socioeconomiques/

The new resurgence of cases of Ebola virus disease in Beni was the basis of a paralysis of socioeconomic activities in the city center on Thu 16 Apr [2020]. The city of Beni woke up this Thursday [16 Apr 2020] under social tension.

Young people from this city have barricaded the main arteries since early in the morning to express being fed up with the reappearance of new cases of Ebola in the city.

The Congolese National Police, PNC Beni, deployed its elements on the ground to disperse the demonstrators. The police used tear gas to carry out their mission. Since Fri 10 Apr 2020, Beni has registered 4 positive cases. Among the 4 cases, 3 died.

How did we get here?
Everything would go up on Wednesday evening [15 Apr 2020] after the media release from the urban coordination of civil society, which insists on the publication of the results of the 1st new Ebola case in Beni. The 72 hours promised by the authorities and its technical services have expired.

This communication past, leaflets of unknown origin were launched here and there, and even on social networks calling for paralysis of social activities in the city to demand the declaration of the end of the epidemic of the Ebola virus in Beni and denounce what the authors call Ebola Business.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 16 Apr 2020. Ebola scan
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/ebola-scan-apr-16-2020

The World Health Organization (WHO) today fleshed out more details on the 3 recently reported Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) city of Beni, noting that all are epidemiologically linked and that samples have been sent for genetic testing to see if they are part of a known transmission chain.

In its update, the WHO said 2 of the patients died in the community after visiting several healthcare facilities, a situation known to raise the risk of virus spread. The 3rd patient is being treated at an Ebola treatment center.

So far, 332 contacts have been identified, and 200 have been vaccinated. Though there are about 6000 vaccine doses in Beni, the WHO said the supply pipeline is likely challenged because of COVID-19 flight restrictions.

Other challenges are armed groups and limited access in some areas, with possible under-reporting. On 9 Apr [2020], health officials validated 2 probable cases in patients who were sick in November and December [2019].

Regeneron announced today [16 Apr 2020] that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted priority review for its monoclonal antibody cocktail drug for treating Ebola. The drug, REGN-EB3, is a triple-antibody drug that was studied in Ebola treatment centers in the current Democratic Republic of the Congo (DCR) outbreak and was one of 2 drugs that stood out as more effective than other options.

In a statement today [16 Apr 2020], Regeneron, based in Tarrytown, New York, said the target dates for the FDA decision is 25 Oct 2020. It said its licensing data are based on a randomized controlled study in the DRC that was stopped early in August 2019 when it showed pre-specified superiority over the control drug ZMapp. The company said it has also used the same approach to develop an antibody drug to treat COVID-19, with clinical trials expected to be begin in June [2020].

REGN-EB3 had already received orphan drug and breakthrough designation from the FDA. The drug was developed through a collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).

- Thu 16 Apr 2020. WHO: Disease Outbreak News
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/16-April-2020-ebola-drc/en/

From 10-14 Apr 2020, 3 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Figure 1). All of the cases were reported from Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Two individuals passed away in the community after visiting several healthcare facilities. The infection of the 3rd individual has been epidemiologically linked to one of these cases. The individual is currently receiving care at an Ebola treatment centre. Prior to this development, the last person confirmed to have EVD tested negative twice and was discharged from a treatment centre on 3 Mar 2020.

Specimens from all confirmed cases were sent to the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Katwa and in Kinshasa for genetic sequencing in order to support surveillance teams in the investigation of the source of infection and to determine whether these cases were linked to a known chain of transmission. A total of 332 contacts of these cases have been registered, 248 of whom were followed on 14 Apr 2020, and 200 of whom were vaccinated by 3 vaccination teams that have been activated. While approximately 6000 doses are available in Beni Health Zone, WHO anticipates potential challenges with the vaccine pipeline due to limited flight ability as a result of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

From 8-14 Apr 2020, an average of 2015 alerts were reported and investigated per day. Of these, an average of 177 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. The alert rate has decreased for the past 3 weeks as teams are pulled into other emergencies, including COVID-19. Other challenges include the presence of armed groups and limited access to some affected health areas, movement of contacts, and possible under-reporting to the central coordination of the outbreak response. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 11 laboratories.

From 6-12 Apr 2020, 968 samples were tested including 466 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 274 swabs from community deaths; and 228 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities decreased by 28% compared to the previous week.

On 9 Apr 2020, 2 new probable cases, with onset of symptoms in November 2019 and December 2019, were retrospectively validated. As of 14 April 2020, a total of 3458 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1), including 3313 confirmed and 145 probable cases, of which 2277 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1943) were female, 28% (n=982) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were healthcare workers.

An urgent injection of USD 20 million is required to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations through to the beginning of May 2020. More information is available from https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/06-03-2020-end-in-sight-but-flare-ups-likely-in-the-ebola-outbreak-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo.

The new confirmed cases 40 days after the last person tested negative and was discharged from care are not unexpected. The WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak [https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/who-recommended-criteria-for-declaring-the-end-of-the-ebola-virus-disease-outbreak] includes a 42-day waiting period because undetected chains of transmission or new flare-ups may arise. The sequencing analysis will be critical to inform the investigation of the source of infection and to help detect any missed cases in the chain of transmission that led to this cluster. It is essential to remain vigilant and maintain enhanced surveillance, rapid detection and response capacities, as well as continue to engage community leaders to address or mitigate community mistrust in affected areas.

[The WHO has put out a plea for USD 20 million "to ensure that response teams have the capacity to maintain the appropriate level of operations" to not lose ground in the control effort. It is a huge mistake for the US to cut funding to WHO at this critical time in the middle of a pandemic and a point tantalizingly close to ending the Ebola outbreak in the DRC. The loss of crucial funding from the US will significantly increase the financial burden on this organization at a time that even more support is needed, as requested above. Inability of the WHO to meet the demands imposed by Ebola and COVID-19 may lead to both battles being lost in the region, leading to further human suffering and global destabilization.

It is also concerning that WHO anticipates potential challenges with the vaccine pipeline due to limited flight ability as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccinations are the key to controlling this lethal disease. - Mod.LK

[3] Vaccine research: new approach
Date: Thu 16 Apr 2020.
Source: EurekAlert! [edited]
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-04/cchm-nue041620.php


Infectious disease scientists report early development of a potential universal vaccine for Ebola viruses that preclinical tests show might neutralize all 4 species of these deadly viruses infecting people in recent outbreaks, mainly in Africa.

Scientists at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center report their preclinical results in the Journal of Virology [see ref below], published by the American Society for Microbiology.

Although still in early preclinical testing, researchers report that their data indicate that the prospective vaccine has potential to be a stand-alone protection from Ebola. It also could broaden and extend the durability of protective immunity induced by current live vaccines already being tested in clinical trials against individual Ebola virus species, said Karnail Singh, PhD, the study's co-principal investigator in the Division of Infectious Diseases.

"This could be a significant advancement in the global effort to prevent or manage Ebola outbreaks, especially if this vaccine used alone or in combination with another Ebola vaccine results in long-term and durable protective immunity against different Ebola viruses," Singh said.

A deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 accelerated international efforts to develop vaccines for these highly infectious and harmful viruses. This led to development of recombinant Ebola vaccines in which glycoprotein from Zaire Ebola virus is engineered into another modified live viral vector. When administered, these live vaccines induce immune responses against the Ebola glycoprotein that, in turn, protect against any subsequent attack by the Ebola virus.

Singh and colleagues report that while the live-vector vaccines are producing encouraging results in clinical trials, until the current study none of the new vaccines under development have been shown to induce immune responses that cross-react against multiple Ebola virus species that cause the deadly disease in humans.

A different approach
--------------------
The new vaccine takes a novel approach, according to the study. The researchers designed a bivalent, spherical Ebola virus-like particle (VLP) that incorporates 2 genetically diverse glycoproteins (one each from the Zaire Ebola virus and Sudan Ebola virus) on a spherical core.

This approach will not cause illness in the recipient as the VLPs lack the genetic material and do not multiply. The vaccine works by stimulating immune responses against Ebola that generate virus-fighting antibodies to attack the different virus species.

When the researchers administered their new Ebola VLP vaccine to appropriate animal models, it produced robust immune responses against Ebola virus species known to be pathogenic in humans.

Although the new vaccine uses glycoproteins from 2 Ebola virus species, Singh said it might work against all 4 known pathogenic Ebola viruses, as responses to one of the glycoproteins generates cross-reactive responses against 2 other Ebola virus species.

More testing needed
-------------------
The researchers emphasize that extensive additional preclinical testing of the prospective Ebola VLP vaccine is needed before it could potentially be tested in clinical trials.

A key collaborator on the multi-institutional study -- which included the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, the Emory University School of Medicine, and the University of Louisiana's New Iberia Research Center -- was Paul Spearman, MD, division director of Infectious Diseases at Cincinnati Children's.

Spearman said at the moment, vaccine challenge experiments are in the planning stages. They will involve working in collaboration with an institution that has Level 4 biosafety facilities and will require additional external funding to move this promising research forward.

"If the data from those studies is equally encouraging, the vaccine should be ready to progress to generation of clinical grade material for human trials," he said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa led to accelerated efforts to develop vaccines against these highly virulent viruses. A live, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine has been deployed in outbreak settings and appears highly effective. Vaccines based on replication-deficient adenovirus vectors either alone or in combination with a multivalent modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) Ebola vaccine also appear promising and are progressing in clinical evaluation. However, the ability of current live vector-based approaches to protect against multiple pathogenic species of Ebola is not yet established, and eliciting durable responses may require additional booster vaccinations. Here, we report the development of a bivalent, spherical Ebola virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that incorporates glycoproteins (GPs) from Zaire Ebola virus (EBOV) and Sudan Ebola virus (SUDV) and is designed to extend the breadth of immunity beyond EBOV. Immunization of rabbits with bivalent Ebola VLPs produced antibodies that neutralized all 4 pathogenic species of Ebola viruses and elicited antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses against EBOV and SUDV. Vaccination of rhesus macaques with bivalent VLPs generated strong humoral immune responses, including high titers of binding, as well as neutralizing antibodies and ADCC responses. VLP vaccination led to a significant increase in the frequency of Ebola GP-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. These results demonstrate that a novel bivalent Ebola VLP vaccine elicits strong humoral and cellular immune responses against pathogenic Ebola viruses and support further evaluation of this approach as a potential addition to Ebola vaccine development efforts.

Importance
Ebola outbreaks result in significant morbidity and mortality in affected countries. Although several leading candidate Ebola vaccines have been developed and advanced in clinical testing, additional vaccine candidates may be needed to provide protection against different Ebola species and to extend the durability of protection. A novel approach demonstrated here is to express two genetically diverse glycoproteins on a spherical core, generating a vaccine that can broaden immune responses against known pathogenic Ebola viruses. This approach provides a new method to broaden and potentially extend protective immune responses against Ebola viruses.
