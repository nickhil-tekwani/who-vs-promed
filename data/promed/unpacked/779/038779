Even as the Union Health Ministry officials predicted that the menace of
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) will continue till December 2005, as many as 21
more deaths were reported during the last 24 hours, taking the toll in
Uttar Pradesh to 713.
Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) in Gorakhpur, hub of the JE menace
in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, King George Medical University (KGMU) Hospital in
Lucknow, and other district hospitals are still receiving patients on a
regular basis.
As many as 25 districts in the state have been affected by the deadly
virus, and Allahabad has been newly added to the list of sensitive
districts. Of the fresh casualties reported, 7 deaths occurred at Allahabad
during the last 24 hours, a report said.
Meanwhile, a report quoting Union Health Ministry officials said that the
JE menace could continue till December 2005. More than 3000 patients have
so far been registered in the state since 28 Jul 2005, when the first case
was reported.
The eastern part of the state has been the worst affected with more than
2600 JE patients registered at BRDMC alone, official sources said here.
Patients from Maharajganj, Basti, Kushinagar, Ghazipur, Mau, Azamgarh, Sant
Kabirnagar, Deoria, Balrampur and Gonda have been admitted at the Gorakhpur
Medical College, sources added.

The death toll from an outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in northern India
rose to 675 Tuesday after 11 more victims were reported but health
authorities said the illness was under control.
"At least 11 more persons died overnight, taking the toll to 675," said OP
Singh, health department chief in Uttar Pradesh.
Singh said 60 cases were admitted to hospitals overnight but the number of
arrivals had started to slow.
"The outbreak is under control and the influx of patients to hospitals has
come down," Singh said. "Fogging of insecticide in affected areas has
started. People have been advised to sleep under mosquito nets."
Doctors, however, said many children were being brought to the hospital
when they were already extremely unwell, making it hard to save them.
"People are still coming to hospitals with unconscious children in their
arms. Some of them are coming to us very late," said KP Kushwaha, of the
paediatrics department in BRD Medical College Gorakhpur.
Doctors have said they are struggling to treat the children in deplorable
medical conditions. They say there is a severe lack of life-saving
medicines, oxygen and medical staff and that a number of children are lying
2 to a bed.
Health workers say a lack of preventive action, such as widespread
vaccination, is to blame for the scale of the outbreak. The illness is
endemic to the region.
A court in Allahabad city, 200 kilometers (135 miles) southeast of the
state capital Lucknow, ordered the state and federal governments Tuesday to
supply anti-encephalitis vaccines in disease-ravaged areas. It also told
the governments to submit a progress report within 2 weeks on measures
taken to check the disease.
The court order followed a petition filed by a schoolteacher whose son died
of encephalitis in August 2005.
The disease, which is transmitted from pigs to humans via mosquitoes,
strikes during the annual monsoon rains from June to September.
Japanese encephalitis first surfaced in Uttar Pradesh in 1978, killing 721.
In 1980, 496 died from the disease and deaths reached a record 1228 in
1988. More than 4000 people have died in the state since the disease first hit.
In the neighboring Himalayan kingdom of Nepal, meanwhile, state media said
at least 204 people had died of encephalitis since it surfaced in mid-June
2005.

Japanese Encephalitis (JE) in India - 13 Sep 2005
1145 cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported from 14 districts of
Uttar Pradesh Province, India from 29 Jul to 30 Aug 2005. About 1/4 of
these (n=296) have died. 90 cases from the adjoining districts of Bihar
have also been admitted to the hospitals in Uttar Pradesh.
The majority of the affected villages have reported only single cases.
Entomological surveys in the affected villages have revealed high density
of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and _Culex vishnui_ group -- the vectors of
Japanese Encephalitis (JE).

[The crucial vectors (the Culex mosquitoes) that carry JEV and transmit to
humans were surveyed. We would like to know if further data corroborating
the entomological surveys are available. Entomologists are invited to share
their opinions with us regarding how and why the JE epidemic in the Uttar
Pradesh area has progressed so far this year. - Mod.RY]
