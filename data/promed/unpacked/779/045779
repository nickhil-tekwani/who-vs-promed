Five cases of French patients with alveolar echinococcosis were identified in the departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais [Hauts-de-France region].

This parasitic disease from foxes, is caused by a tapeworm that lays eggs in the intestines of the fox. They later appear in his feces and they survive 2 months in nature and can settle on a vegetable or on the fur of a dog.

Often, alveolar echinococcosis is detected late. Pain in the liver, swelling of the abdomen, are signs that may appear years after infection took place, and can be confused with liver cancer, jaundice, or hepatitis.

As explained by France 3, there are some rules to follow if you live in an area where foxes are present. You need to set fences around the places which can attract the animal. Cook your meals, because the eggs of tapeworms are destroyed when cooking at 60 deg C [140 deg F]. For the raw products, it is recommended to clean them thoroughly.

If you have a pet, be sure to deworm it at least twice a year, and avoid touching a fox or its feces without disposable gloves.

[The metacestode (larval) form of _Echinococcus multilocularis_ causes alveolar hydatidosis in humans. The natural intermediate hosts are rodents and the definitive hosts (where adults are found) are wild canids like foxes. Domestic dogs and cats can become infected and act as a definitive host if they eat infected wild rodents. Alveolar echinococcosis has been reported in parts of central Europe, much of Russia, the Central Asian republics, and western China, the northwestern portion of Canada, and western Alaska. A picture of an adult form of _E. multilocularis_ can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcus_multilocularis#/media/File:Echinococcus_multilocularis.jpg. - Mod.PMB
