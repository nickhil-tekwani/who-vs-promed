The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority will destroy all of the farmâ€™s 42 700 turkeys this very Sunday 18 Mar 2012].

A transport ban on poultry, eggs and poultry droppings with a 3km radius around the farm has been in force since midnight on Sat [17 Mar 2012]. There are some 25 poultry farms in the region.

Bird flu is an extremely contagious disease that can be transmitted not just to poultry but to other bird species as well. In extremely rare cases humans too can be infected with the virus. Last year, there were several bird flu outbreaks across the country, most of them in the provinces of Gelderland, Zeeland and Flevoland.
