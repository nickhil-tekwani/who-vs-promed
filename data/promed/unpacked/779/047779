At least 2 people have been infected with tularemia, or hare plague in the Netherlands during the first 6 months of 2016, according to a Wageningen UR report Monday [27 Jun 2016] (computer translated).

The report notes that the 1st individual, from the province of Utrecht, most likely contracted the serious bacterial infection while skinning a hare. The 2nd patient with tularemia in 2016 is from the province of South Holland in the Vijfheerenlanden region. This patient had no known contact with hares. The report notes that human tularemia has not been seen in the Netherlands since 2011.

Also known as rabbit fever and deer fly fever, tularemia is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. This bacterium is found in nature in rabbits, rodents, beavers, squirrels and several domestic and farm animals.

People commonly get infected from the bites of infected ticks (wood, dog) and deer flies. Hunters are at risk of infection following skinning, dressing and eating infected animals. Drinking contaminated water has been implicated in tularemia infection. People also contract it through inhaling dust and hay that have rodent feces and carcasses. There have been cases where people got infected from a domestic cat. It is believed that cats get the organism from contaminated prey and their mouth and claws become infected. Certain animal-associated occupations are also associated with the disease: farmers, veterinarians, sheepherders and shearers.

The disease in people depends on how it is acquired. After infection, incubation can be a couple of days to weeks, with non-specific symptoms like fever, chills, headache, sore throat and diarrhea. The way the organism enters the body frequently dictates the disease and degree of systemic involvement. The 6 syndromes are ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, typhoidal and the one with the highest mortality rate, pneumonic tularemia.

[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, Fact Sheet on Tularemia, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf:

"Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals. Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Francisellaceae. A total of 4 subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. tularensis (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. mediasiatica and _F. tularensis_ subsp. novicida, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed.

"With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa. A single human case, caused by _F. tularensis novicida_, was acquired in Australia.

"Among the Northern Hemisphere, _F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. Contrarily, _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.

"Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported." - Mod.LL
