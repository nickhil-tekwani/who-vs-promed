A total of 87 horses have been affected by vesicular stomatitis since the outbreak in Texas and Colorado began in May 2014, latest figures show.

The latest update from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), released on Thursday [31 Jul 2014], said 77 horses were currently positive for the disease, which has symptoms similar to foot and mouth disease. Four cattle are also affected. All cases have been identified as the New Jersey serotype.

APHIS says there are now 35 positive premises under quarantine, 12 horse properties and 2 cattle properties in Texas, and 21 horse properties in Colorado.

In Texas, Bastrop County had the most number of affected animals, with 15 horses and 2 cows across 12 premises. Travis County has one premises under quarantine, where 2 horses have tested positive. The 1st case has been confirmed this week in Val Verde, with one horse affected.

In Colorado, Boulder County has 10 affected horses across 8 premises, while Weld County has 14 infected horses across 11 premises. Two counties had their 1st confirmed cases this week, with El Paso and Larimer counties each having an infected horse.

APHIS said 63 positive premises have so far been identified across the 2 states.

There have been 4 counties affected in Colorado (Boulder, El Paso, Larimer, and Weld counties) and 9 counties in Texas (Bastrop, Guadalupe, Hidalgo, Jim Wells, Kinney, Nueces, San Patricio, Travis, and Val Verde counties).

Six premises in Texas (one in Kinney County, 2 in Nueces County, 2 in San Patricio County, and one in Hidalgo County) have been released from quarantine, and there are currently 4 other premises in Texas on a 21-day countdown to quarantine release.

Since the outbreak began, 87 horses and 4 cattle have tested positive. The 1st case in the current outbreak, in Texas, was confirmed through testing on 23 May 2014.
