Disease has had Remarkable Effect.
------------------------------------------------------------------
From 1 to 25 Oct 2007, there were 29 outbreaks of highly pathogenic
pig blue ear disease, sickening 3608 pigs with 710 deaths. Compared
with September 2007, this represents a drop of 65 percent, 87 percent
and 91 percent, respectively.

Statistics for 2006 show that 3 798 000 pigs contracted "high fever
disease" and 992 000 [of them] died.

From 1 Jan 2007 to 25 Oct 2007, only 310 000 pigs contracted highly
