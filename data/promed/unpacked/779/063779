re: ProMED-mail African swine fever - Russia (08) 20081030.3418
---------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to point out 2 possible inaccuracies in the latest report (08)
on African swine fever in Russia.

Firstly, while it is possible that the outbreak of a fatal swine fever in
South Africa in 1903 may have been African swine fever [ASF], at the time
not a known disease, we will never know. It was diagnosed as European or
classical swine fever [CSF] (hog cholera), which was eventually eradicated
in 1918. ASF was first diagnosed as a separate entity from CSF in Kenya,
reported by RE Montgomery in 1921 (On a form of swine fever occurring in
British East Africa (Kenya Colony). Journal of Comparative Pathology 1921;
34: 159-191 and 243-262). The 1st report for South Africa was in 1928,
followed by a confirmatory report in 1932 (Steyn, DG 1928: Preliminary
report on a South African virus disease amongst pigs. 13th & 14th reports
of the Director of Veterinary Education and Research, Union of South
Africa, 414-428 and 1932. East African virus disease in pigs. 18th report
of the Director of Veterinary Services and Animal Industry, Union of South
Africa, 1: 99-109). We can't claim a first there, and in fact in some
circles ASF is still known as 'Montgomery's disease'.

The other possibly contentious statement is the exact point of entry of ASF
into the Caucasus. Initial investigations strongly suggested that it was
the Georgian Black Sea port of Poti. ASF was only reported from infection
to have come from Georgia. The reverse could be true, but it is unlikely
that anything will be proven, since the disease had certainly been around
for quite some time before it was confirmed in Georgia in June 2007.

[Both observations of Dr Penrith are correct and much appreciated. The
information about the history of ASF in ProMED-mail posting 20081030.3418,
mentioning 1903 and South Africa as the year and site of ASF's "world
premiere", had been included also in a previous posting (20080726.2278)
from the same news agency; in both cases, this statement deserved to be
edited out.

As to the introduction of ASF into the Caucasus, Dr Penrith's correction
falls in line with ProMED-mail postings since June 2007, including the
EC/FAO/OIE [European Commission/UN Food and Agriculture Organisation/World
Organisation for Animal Health] and SDC [Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation] mission reports, identifying the Georgian port of Poti as the
likely point of ASF entrance. It was stated that the most likely hypothesis
of introduction of the virus was importation of contaminated pork or pork
waste from international ships.

The genotyping of the isolate gave some indication that its origin may have
been the eastern side of southern Africa. - Mod.AS]
