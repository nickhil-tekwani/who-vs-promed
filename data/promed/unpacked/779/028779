Cancers which can be spread from one organism to another may be more common than previously thought.

Scientists have found these contagious cancers in Tasmanian devils, which spread from one animal to another through bites, as well as in dogs and soft shell clams.

But the latest study reveals more species of shellfish are vulnerable to transmissible forms of cancer, and there is even evidence it can make the jump from one species to another.

An international team led by researchers at Columbia University in New York [USA] found mussels and cockles collected in Spain and Canada had cancerous growths, called neoplasms, which can be passed from one animal to another through seawater.

Analysis showed that within each species, these cancers were started by cloned cancer cells which had a different DNA fingerprint to the host Â­- indicating the cells had come from another animal.

They also found evidence of these transmissible cancer cells in another species of mollusc, golden shell carpet clams, doubling the previously known number of affected species from 3 to 6 -- with 4 molluscs and 2 mammals.

"At least in the oceans, transmissible cancers are much more common than we thought," said Professor Stephen Goff, a microbiologist at Columbia who led the research.

But in the golden shell carpet clams, the genetic fingerprint of the cancer cells was so unlike that of the host, it hinted that the cells didn't just come from another animal, but from another species.

The abstract reads:

"Most cancers arise from oncogenic changes in the genomes of somatic cells, and while the cells may migrate by metastasis, they remain within that single individual. Natural transmission of cancer cells from one individual to another has been observed in 2 distinct cases in mammals (Tasmanian devils and dogs), but these are generally considered to be rare exceptions in nature. The discovery of transmissible cancer in soft-shell clams suggested that this phenomenon might be more widespread. Here we analyse disseminated neoplasia in mussels (_Mytilus trossulus_), cockles (_Cerastoderma edule_), and golden carpet shell clams (_Polititapes aureus_) and find that neoplasias in all 3 species are attributable to independent transmissible cancer lineages. In mussels and cockles, the cancer lineages are derived from their respective host species; however, unexpectedly, cancer cells in _P. aureus_ are all derived from _Venerupis corrugate_, a different species living in the same geographical area. No cases of disseminated neoplasia have thus far been found in _V. corrugata_ from the same region. These findings show that transmission of cancer cells in the marine environment is common in multiple species, that it has originated many times, and that while most transmissible cancers are found spreading within the species of origin, cross-species transmission of cancer cells can occur."

Transmissible neoplasms in invertebrates have only been previously reported in the soft shell clam _Mya arenaria_. In this species, these neoplasms cause a leukemia-like disease characterized by the presence of abnormal, rounded, rapidly proliferating hemocytes containing large pleiomorphic nuclei and multiple nucleoli. - Mod.PMB
