More than 55 persons have died so far from the Lassa fever epidemic
between January 2008 and February 2009, out of the over 390 patients
admitted as a result of the illness. More than 51 million Nigerians
are at risk, with the annual number of illnesses estimated at 3
million and with the number of deaths estimated at about 58 330.

This disclosure came as the Guild of Medical Directors yesterday [18
Mar 2009] in Abuja demanded an adequate supply of Ribavirin (the
antiviral drug for the treatment of Lassa fever) in the Federal
Capital Territory (FCT) and its environs. Chief Medical Director of
the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Irrua Edo State, Prof. George
Akpede, made the disclosure yesterday on the occasion of the
commissioning of the Lassa Fever Diagnostic and Research Laboratory,
Institute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the Irrua
Specialists Teaching Hospital, Irrua, Edo State. He said the Lassa
fever epidemic was no longer limited to some states as it was thought
but had assumed virtually a country-wide dimension.

The outbreak of Lassa fever has been confirmed in the FCT and its
environs, and out of the 12 cases reported since February [2009], 5
patients have died.

Meanwhile, in a presentation on Lassa fever during the monthly
meeting of the Abuja Chapter of the Guild, the National President, Dr
Charles Cudjoe, called for more rapid diagnostic test centres for
Lassa fever. "The Guild did a survey at the outbreak of this disease,
and, disturbingly, we discovered that there was not enough Ribavirin.
We discovered that the drug that is in stock in some pharmaceutical
stores would expire this month [March 2009]. That is a bit of a
problem, because we need to tackle this as quickly as possible. All
hands must be on deck to import these drugs from the companies that
make them. Even if the epidemic does not expand, we should be able to
handle the few cases that come in," he said.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) discovered that a pack of 45 tablets
of Ribavirin 400 mg is sold for 115 pounds sterling [USD 167] in the
UK, while 84 tablets of the same drug went for 274 pounds sterling
[USD 398]. A survey had shown that Roche and Swipha are the 2
companies that manufacture this drug. In Abuja, 45 tablets of
Ribavirin 400 mg went for Naira 25 000 [USD 169] for a stock that is
due to expire this month [March 2009], while the cost for the same
drug with a later expiration date is about Naira 120 000 [USD 807].
Cudjoe expressed reservation over the handling of the epidemic that
was 1st discovered in the town of Lassa in Borno.

[Since January 2008, Lassa fever virus infection has affected more
than 390 people and been responsible for 55 deaths in Nigeria. Since
February 2009, there have been 12 additional cases and 5 deaths in
the proximity of the Federal Capital Territory. From these figures,
it is difficult to predict the future course of the epidemic.

Ribavirin is an anti-viral drug indicated for severe respiratory
syncytial virus infections (individually), hepatitis C infection
(used in conjunction with peginterferon alfa-2b) and other viral
infections. It has been used successfully in hospitals in the
treatment of Lassa fever virus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug,
which, when metabolized, resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this
form, it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral
replication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown.
Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary
observed serious adverse side-effect of Ribavirin is hemolytic
anemia. Ribavirin is also a teratogen in some animal species and thus
poses a theoretical reproductive risk in humans, remaining a hazard
as long as the drug is present, which can be as long as 6 months
after a course of the drug has ended (see:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribavirin>).
