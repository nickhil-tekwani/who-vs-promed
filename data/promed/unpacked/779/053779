Health officials are investigating 2 suspected botulism cases
involving King County residents who may have been infected by
injecting contaminated "black tar" heroin.

In late August 2011, a King County woman with a history of "black tar"
heroin injection arrived at a hospital with slurred speech, double
vision, and drooping eyelids, according to a statement issued Wed 14
Sep 2011, by Seattle & King County Public Health. About a week later,
a man with a similar history of injection drug use was admitted with
similar symptoms. Both saw their conditions worsen and were admitted
to an intensive care unit. Botulism, a life-threatening but rare
illness caused by a toxin produced by 1 of the serotypes of
_Clostridium botulinum_, is strongly suspected in both cases, and
testing to confirm the diagnosis is pending at a state laboratory.

Botulism-producing bacteria can contaminate "black-tar" heroin, and
injection drug users can develop botulism after injecting even if
infected wounds are not apparent. Botulism can also be transmitted by
consuming food that is contaminated with toxin-producing bacteria or
their spores.

Initial symptoms include blurred vision and difficulty speaking or
swallowing; the initial fatigue, dizziness, and worsening weakness
that can lead to paralysis. In serious cases, people experience
paralysis of breathing muscles, which may lead to death without
hospital treatment. Some need to be on a breathing machine until they
can breathe on their own. Symptoms of botulism can occur days or up to
2 weeks after exposure to the bacteria. Full recovery may take
months.

Texas has reported 4 similar cases among injection drug users since 26
Aug 2011. No link between the King County and Texas cases has been
identified.

"There is no way for a person on the street to tell if black tar
heroin is contaminated, nor any way to clean it to make it safe," said
Dr Jeff Duchin, chief of the communicable disease epidemiology and
immunization section for the health department. "The best way for
injection drug users to prevent getting the disease is not to use
heroin, but for those who do, they need to be aware of the risk of
botulism and seek medical attention immediately if they develop
symptoms."

Those who continue to use heroin should refrain from the "black tar"
variety, use new syringes or, if none are available, clean the syringe
with bleach, keep their skin clean, and get a tetanus shot every 5
years, the health department suggests. Public Health has also alerted
local health care providers to be alert for the signs and symptoms of
botulism and consider the diagnosis early so that treatment can be
administered.

[Black tar heroin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin)
can contain a variable percentage of heroin, but despite the name,
what makes black tar heroin specific as a type is not actually its
heroin (diacetylmorphine) content, but rather the greater mixture of
lesser acetylated morphine derivatives, predominantly 6-MAM
(6-monoacetylmorphine) and 3-MAM (3-monoacetylmorphine). This is
caused by the use of the antiquated Wright-Beckett process (c. 1874),
which produces a relatively crude and unrefined opiate product but
does not require the complex lab equipment, high-purity acetylating
chemicals, or lengthy reflux steps necessary to produce pure heroin,
making it attractive to clandestine drug producers.

Black tar heroin is produced in Latin America, and is most commonly
found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being
occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying
consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and
moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown, tarry goo in
unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed
and cut with lactose.

Users who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of
venous sclerosis (a condition where the veins narrow and harden,
making injection there nearly impossible) than users of powder heroin,
forcing users to inject subcutaneously. Injecting the drug below the
skin can produce a local anaerobic, necrotic environment allowing
germination of spores of _Clostridium_ species producing necrotizing
infections due to _C. perfringens_ or toxin-induced diseases such as
tetanus or botulism. - Mod.LL]
