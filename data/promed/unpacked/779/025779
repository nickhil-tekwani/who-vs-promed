Final BSE update ­ Mon 9 Feb 2004
---------------------------------
On Mon 9 Feb 2004, Dr Ron DeHaven, deputy administrator of veterinary
services for USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, announced
that the field investigation of the case of BSE in a cow in the state of
Washington is complete. This will be the last written daily update. But
information will be provided in the future on an as-needed basis. A summary
of the investigation follows.

Investigation
The epidemiological tracing and DNA evidence proves that the BSE-positive
cow slaughtered in the state of Washington on 9 Dec 2003, was born on a
dairy farm in Calmar, Alberta, Canada, on 9 Apr 1997. She was moved to the
United States in September 2001 along with 80 other cattle from that dairy.
A brain sample collected from the cow at slaughter tested positive for BSE
on 23 Dec 2003.

The epidemiological investigation to find additional animals from the
source herd led to a total of 189 investigations (these were
investigations, not premises, and one investigation may or may not equal
one premises; in some cases there are no premises [a dealer that just
trucks animals from one place to another] but, more likely, one
investigation can equal more than one premises), leading to complete herd
inventories on 51 premises in 3 States: Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The
inventories involved the examination of the identification on more than 75
000 animals. All herd inventories have now been completed and appropriate
analysis of those inventories performed. There are no premises remaining
under hold order.

A total of 255 "Animals of Interest" were identified on 10 premises in
Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. "Animals of Interest" are defined as animals
that were -- or could have been -- from the source herd in Alberta, Canada.
All 255 animals were depopulated and BSE testing was negative on all of
them. The carcasses from all of the euthanized animals were disposed of in
landfills in accordance with all federal, state, and local regulations.

Included in the 255 animals of interest were 28 cattle positively
identified as part of the group of 80 that entered the US with the index
cow, as well as 7 heifers out of a group of 17 heifers which were also
known to be from the source herd. It is not believed that all of these 17
entered the United States, but all of them would be considered minimal risk
and not significant to the investigation.

Guidelines on bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) issued by the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the international animal health
standard-setting organization, state that animals born on a premises within
one year (before or after) of a BSE-affected animal should be considered of
greater risk to the country reporting the BSE detection. As such, USDA has
focused on 25 of the 81 animals also born into the birth herd of the index
animal. Based on normal culling practices of local dairies, APHIS estimated
that the Agency would be able to locate approximately 11 of these animals.
APHIS definitively located 13 of these animals, plus the index cow, for a
total of 14.

We feel confident that the remaining animals represent very little risk.
Even in countries like the United Kingdom where the prevalence of BSE has
been very high, it is very uncommon to find more than one or maybe 2
positive animals within a herd. Any of these animals showing nervous system
disorder -- or any that are nonambulatory at the time of slaughter -- will
be condemned and not allowed into the human food chain. Any animals
slaughtered after 12 Jan 2004 would have the SRMs removed and not allowed
into the human food chain. SRMs, or Specified Risk Materials, are those
tissues or portions of the carcass likely to contain the infectious agent
in an infected animal. And finally, we have had an effective feed ban in
place for over 6 years, thus preventing the transmission of the disease to
other animals.

Over 2000 tons of meat and bone meal being held due to potential
contamination with protein from the positive cow is on hold and will soon
be disposed of in a landfill in accordance with all Federal, State, and
local regulations.

Breakdown Summaries
Summary of the 255 depopulated:
- 28 were part of the 81
- 220 could have been part of the 81
- 7 heifers that were part of group of 17 heifers, some, but not all of
which, entered the US

Of the 81 that came in from Canada (29 definitively accounted for)
- 1 is the BSE-positive cow and was located in the Index herd in Mabton, WA.
- 9 were located in the Index herd in Mabton, WA.
- 3 were located at a facility in Tenino, WA.
- 6 were located at a facility in Connell, WA.
- 1 was located at a facility in Quincy, WA.
- 3 were located at a facility in Mattawa, WA.
- 1 was located at a facility in Moxee, WA.
- 3 were located at a facility in Burley, ID.
- 1 was located at a facility in Othello, WA.
- 1 was located a facility in Mabton, WA.

Of the 17 other cattle from the Canadian birth herd (these heifers are not
part of the original 81 animals, and it is not known how many of the 17
actually entered the United States). To date, 7 animals have been
identified in the United States:
- 3 were at a facility in Quincy, WA.
- 1 was at a facility in Boardman, OR.
- 1 was at a facility in Othello, WA.
- 1 was at a facility in Burley, ID
- 1 was at the second facility in Mabton, WA

Depopulation Activities
USDA has conducted selective depopulation activities at these facilities:
- Sunnyside, WA (bull calf premises) - a total of 449 animals depopulated
- Mabton, WA (index premises) - a total of 131 animals depopulated
- Mattawa, WA - a total of 39 animals depopulated
- Connell, WA - a total of 15 animals depopulated
- Boardman, OR - a total of 20 animals depopulated
- Quincy, WA ­ a total of 18 animals depopulated
- Tenino, WA ­ a total of 4 animals depopulated
- Moxee, WA ­ a total of 15 animals depopulated
- Othello, WA ­ a total of 3 animals depopulated
- Burley, ID ­ a total of 7 animals depopulated
- Mabton, WA (second premises) ­ a total of 3 animals depopulated

Testing Activities
All adult animals depopulated were sampled and tested for BSE. The bull
calves depopulated at Sunnyside, WA, were not sampled because they were too
young for the BSE agent to be detected. There have been a total of 255
samples taken from the animals depopulated in the Mabton index herd, the
herds in Mattawa, Connell, Quincy, Tenino, Moxee, Othello, and the second
Mabton facility, as well as facilities in Boardman, OR, and Burley, ID. All
samples have tested negative for BSE.

International Review Subcommittee Report
The report from the International Review Subcommittee was delivered to the
Secretary's Advisory Committee for Foreign Animal and Poultry Diseases Wed
4 Feb 2004. That same afternoon, the Co-chairs of the Advisory Committee
and members of the Subcommittee provided the Secretary of copy of the
report and briefed her on its content.

The International Team commended the Secretary on the open and transparent
manner in which this investigation was conducted and the manner in which
their findings were reported to the public and media.

The report identified several positive findings and actions taken by the US
since finding this BSE-positive cow:
- they commended the Department on the comprehensive and thorough
epidemiological investigation, and suggested all relevant information had
been obtained at this point. Their recommendation to conclude the
investigation is consistent with the actions we have taken to do just that.
- they stated that the tracing and recall of the rendered meat and bone
meal (MBM) that may have been contaminated with specified risk materials
from the index case was effective and appropriate.
- they indicated that the US ban on SRMs from cattle over 30 months of age
removes the highest-risk tissues from the human food supply and is in
accordance with international standards
- the Subcommittee confirmed the action taken by the Secretary in her 30
Dec 2003 announcement to prohibit air injection stunning for slaughter animals.
- in addition, the Subcommittee confirmed the validity of the Secretary's
announcement to prohibit Advanced Meat Recovery (or AMR) and mechanically
separated meat from cattle over 30 months [old].
- the Subcommittee recognized the food safety merit of prohibiting
nonambulatory cattle from entering the human food supply, while cautioning
[about] the challenges this action presents to our surveillance efforts.
- they confirmed that the testing of all normal cattle slaughtered for
human consumption [was] scientifically unjustified, both in terms of
protecting human and animal health.
- they recommended the adoption of rapid screening tests, which is
consistent with the Department's announcement to accept applications for
licensure of such tests.
- the Subcommittee acknowledged the importance of effective animal
identification and traceability systems, again consistent with the
Secretary's announcement to accelerate the implementation of such a plan
within the US.
- the subcommittee acknowledged the efforts of the US government to follow
a science-based approach to policy formulation.
- they also recognized the US efforts to act responsibly with regard to
containment and proper destruction of risk materials in order to protect
human health, animal health, and the environment.

The Subcommittee also made several recommendations, all of which are being
fully analyzed by USDA and our FDA colleagues. These include:
- a recommendation for a very aggressive surveillance program that tests
all high-risk animals (that is, nonambulatory animals and animals with
central nervous system disorders) greater than 30 months of age. This
testing would be for a one-year period. The results from that intensive
surveillance could then be considered in an evaluation of the overall BSE
program. The Subcommittee also suggested that consideration be given to
random sampling of animals greater than 30 months of age at slaughter, to
encourage disease reporting at the farm level.
- the Subcommittee recommended that a number of laboratories throughout the
US should be approved by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories
or "NVSL" to conduct screening tests as part of the national surveillance
program. The national reference laboratory should remain within NVSL, and
NVSL should be responsible for confirmatory and proficiency testing.
- the subcommittee urged the US to collaborate with the global community in
the evaluation and validation of new BSE diagnostic tests.
- as for feed issues, the Subcommittee recommends banning SRMs from all
animal feed as well as excluding all mammalian and poultry protein from
ruminant feed. This recommendation is based on the possibility of
cross-contamination in a ruminant-to-ruminant feed ban
- the Subcommittee emphasized the need for an effective educational and
outreach program on BSE.

The Subcommittee recognized that the North American BSE situation vividly
demonstrates the unwarranted and very significant social and financial
impact when importing countries fail to comply with science-based
international rules regarding trade. The subcommittee hopes that the US
will continue to demonstrate leadership in trade matters by adopting
import/export policy in accordance with the science and international
standards. By continuing to do so, we can help to discourage irrational
trade barriers when countries identify their first case of BSE.
