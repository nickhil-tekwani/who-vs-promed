Health officials said a mass illness in Caldwell Parish that caused hundreds of people to get sick is salmonellosis. So far, they've confirmed 49 cases of a gastrointestinal illness and 31 of those people have been hospitalized, but officials expect that more people will get sick soon.

According to state health officials, the source is believed to be plates of jambalaya that were served at a community fundraiser on [Mon 16 Oct 2017]. They believe anyone who ate the jambalaya is at risk of developing symptoms if they haven't already. They estimate at least 300 people were given jambalaya from the fundraiser.

Anyone who has or knows of a case of suspected salmonellosis is asked to call (800) 256-2748. You are also asked to call this number if you are not sick but did come in contact with the jambalaya from the fundraiser. Officials also advise anyone who still has jambalaya from that fundraiser to throw it away. That includes any food that may have come in contact with the jambalaya. They say salmonellosis a serious threat to a person's health and no risk should be taken with any food that may be contaminated. People who are in close contact with others who have salmonellosis are also in contact of being infected.

According to the sheriff and several residents we spoke with, everyone started getting sick around the same time Monday evening [16 Oct 2017]. This includes a man who later died. Health officials are still working to determine whether the death of that man is linked to the mass illness. The Sheriff of Caldwell Parish said that shortly before the man's death, he complained of symptoms similar to those experienced by the others now hospitalized.

Epidemiologists with the Louisiana Department of Health are contacting people known to have purchased food from the fundraiser, and are asking anyone else who might have eaten the jambalaya to call (800) 256-2748.

[This is the 2nd large outbreak of salmonellosis in the USA this month [October 2017]. The 1st was related to a chili and chowder festival in coastal Virginia, which had about 150 cases and is still under investigation. ProMED awaits more definitive numbers.

The source of the salmonellosis in the dish is unclear but clearly either something was undercooked or there was a gross deviation from standard kitchen hygiene.

Jambalaya (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambalaya) is a Louisiana origin dish of Spanish and French (especially Provençal cuisine) influence, consisting mainly of meat and vegetables mixed with rice. Traditionally, the meat always includes sausage of some sort, often a smoked sausage such as andouille, along with some other meat or seafood, frequently pork, chicken, crawfish, or shrimp. The vegetables are usually a soffritto-like mixture known as the "holy trinity" in Creole and Cajun cooking, consisting of onion, celery, and green bell pepper, though other vegetables such as carrots, tomatoes, chilis, and garlic are also used. After browning and sautéing the meat and vegetables, rice, seasonings, and broth are added and the entire dish is cooked together until the rice is done.

For those who are culinary inclined, here is a good recipe for the dish (https://www.louisianacookin.com/chicken-andouille-and-shrimp-jambalaya/):

Ingredients
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 pound andouille sausage, sliced
2 pounds boneless-skinless chicken thighs, cut in 1-inch cubes

1 1/2 cups chopped celery
1 1/2 cups chopped green bell pepper
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 cups long-grain rice
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
5 cups chicken broth
2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme
2 fresh bay leaves
1 1/2 pounds large fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined
2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided
1 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

Instructions
In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium high heat; add sausage and chicken, and cook about 5 minutes or until browned. Add onion, celery, and bell pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, about 3 minutes or until tender. Add garlic, stirring for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add rice, and stir about 3 minutes until lightly toasted.
Add tomatoes, and stir until juices are absorbed. Add broth, thyme, and bay leaves. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low. Cover, and cook for 15 minutes or until rice is tender.
