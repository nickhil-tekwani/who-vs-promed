China confirmed a new outbreak of H5N1 bird flu among migratory birds in
western Qinghai province and Tibet Autonomous Region, the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) said Wednesday.
The outbreak in Tibet's Nagqu Prefecture and Qinghai's Golog Tibetan
Autonomous Prefecture occurred on the same migratory route where another
outbreak in Yushu of Qinghai was reported early this month.
A total of 399 wild birds have been found dead in the 2 areas, the ministry
said, noting that all were in the wild areas where few people live and no
poultry are raised.
Local governments have disinfected the areas where the dead birds were
found, and no domestic poultry have been affected.

[2] China (Qinghai, Tibet): wild birds

China reported 2 new outbreaks of avian flu among migratory birds, bringing
to 4 the number of such cases recorded in the northwest over the past month.
A total of 399 bar-headed geese and ruddy shelducks had died from the virus
in outbreaks in Tibet's Naqu district and the Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture in neighboring Qinghai province, the agriculture ministry said.
The ministry reported on its website that the outbreaks, which it said had
happened 'recently,' were confirmed as the deadly H5N1 virus earlier today.
Although the 2 outbreaks had occurred in separate locations, they were
linked by the same migratory route. The route also linked the outbreaks to
2 other recent incidents in the area, the ministry said. According to
earlier reports, 123 birds had died in the previous outbreaks.
The ministry said the area was thinly populated and had no farms where
poultry was being raised, suggesting the risk to domesticated birds was small.
Qinghai is along one of Asia's main bird migratory routes and a series of
avian flu outbreaks were recorded there in May 2005.
China has reported 18 human cases of bird flu, 12 of which were fatal. More
than 120 people worldwide have died from bird flu since it re-emerged as a
threat in 2003 -- with most of the victims in Asia.

The European Commission yesterday expressed its worry about the situation
of the avian flu in Romania and the spread of the virus in the poultry
farms, according to the statements made yesterday by the Commission's
spokesman Phillip Tod for RFI radio station. "The EC limited the chicken
imports from 5 more counties from Romania, apart from the previous 26. We
are in permanent contact with the Romanian authorities on this issue and we
are ready to give our aid, if asked," said Tod.
Moreover, he added that the Commission holds no information which should
suggest that Hungary and Slovakia were involved in any way in the outbreak
of the new epidemic. "Neither of the 2 countries announced cases of avian
flu in farms. Moreover, even the Romanian PM denied this variant as the
source of the new wave of avian flu in Romania," also mentioned Tod.
The Ministry of Agriculture Spokesperson yesterday [24 May 2006] around
noon announced that there were confirmed 46 avian flu hotbeds at that time
nationally, 2 more cases than the previous day.
No less than 10 counties, plus Bucharest municipality, are affected by the
avian flu. Yesterday at noon, there were also 37 suspicions of avian flu
around the country. A new avian flu suspicion appeared at Codlea, at a
poultry farm. It is the 3rd farm affected by the virus within Codlea, where
it seems everything started.
The preliminary tests from Aviprom Codlea farm came out positive, however
the authorities are waiting for confirmation from the laboratory in
Bucharest. Over 4000 birds will also have to be culled.
Following Districts 2 and 4, it is now the turn of another district to face
the avian flu. In District 5, in a private household, avian flu suspicions
appeared yesterday, when a hen was found dead. The quick tests confirmed
the H5 virus and the authorities disinfected the area while the 6 persons
living there, 3 adults and 3 children were given anti-viral drugs.

[Remarkably, in spite of the described difficulties and the presence of the
H5N1 virus in commercial and backyard farms since October 2005, Romania has
been able -- so far -- to prevent human infections; hopefully this
achievement will be maintained.
Romania's experience deserves to be closely followed by industrialised and
semi-industrialised nations within their own efforts in preparing for HPAI.
