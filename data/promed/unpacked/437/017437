Over the past 4 months some 600 cases of mumps have been reported in
the Jerusalem district and over 850 nationally in Israel, the majority
of whom (70 percent) have been male. Case investigation has shown that
the outbreak emerged in male attended religious high schools and
colleges (yeshivas). Female cases have been mainly secondary,
household contacts.

About 60 percent of patients had received 2 doses of MMR, another 20
percent had received one dose (13 percent age appropriate). As opposed
to previous outbreaks in Jerusalem where active case investigation
showed 95 percent of cases to be unvaccinated, only 20 percent of
cases in the present outbreak were unvaccinated.

The predominance of males, vaccinated individuals, and the low rate of
transmission to the surrounding community should, in our opinion, call
for further investigation.

[The situation in Jerusalem does not appear to be unique. Most
recently in August 2009, an outbreak of mumps originating in a summer
camp in Sullivan County, New York state became the largest mumps
outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced an outbreak of
mumps with 6584 reported cases. The outbreak primarily affected
members of a tradition-observant (Jewish) religious community, in
spite of a high level of vaccination (see MMWR, November 12, 2009 /
58(Dispatch); 1-4 available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d1112a1.htm?s_cid=mm58d1112a1_e>).

Elsewhere similar outbreaks have occurred in colleges and schools
where children and young adults may be living in close contact.

Dr Chen Stein-Zamir and colleagues have documented the current
Jerusalem outbreak at an earlier stage in some detail (see
Eurosurveillance 14(50), 17 Dec 2009 at
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19440>).
They concluded then that: "The reasons for the particular
characteristics of these recent mumps outbreaks are unclear. Possible
explanations include a combination of primary and secondary vaccine
failure, waning immunity, inadequate vaccine effectiveness, and
previous low immunisation coverage. Contributory factors include
living conditions in specific population groups such as college
freshmen, army recruits, and adolescent students in boarding schools."

Readers are invited to suggest other factors which might contribute to
the current situation in Jerusalem. - Mod.CP]
