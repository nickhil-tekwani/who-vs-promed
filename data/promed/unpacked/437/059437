More people in the state were afflicted with dengue fever between last year
[2009] and 2 Jan [2010]. According to a statement from the state health
department here on Sunday [10 Jan 2010], 4579 cases of dengue fever were
reported during the period, compared with 1527 cases in 2008. The Miri
District had the highest at 990, followed by, among others, Kuching
District (838), Sibu (516), Sri Aman (265), and Sarikei (264).

Since December 2009, 2 people have died, and 176 others have been treated
in hospital in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan after being infected with dengue
fever [virus]. Balikpapan mayoralty health agency head Diyah Muryani said
on Tuesday [12 Jan 2010] that the dengue outbreak was already out of
control. She said the agency had encouraged local people and schools to
keep their environments clean in order to prevent dengue fever.

Hospitals were obliged to give free treatment to dengue fever patients, she
added

The local administration in Jember regency, East Java, has recorded a total
of 141 cases of dengue fever in the 1st 11 days of the new year [2010] and
say the number may increase in the coming weeks. "Usually, the number peaks
between January and February at the height of the wet season," Yumarlis,
spokesman of the local health agency, told tempointeraktif.com on Tuesday
[12 Jan 2010].

He said that the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito population rose and reached its
peak during the wet season, when the number of areas covered with stagnant
water increased and became a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Last year [2009], 962 people in the regency contracted the fever, and 5 of
them died.

Dengue fever, which has claimed the lives of 15 persons, including 13
children under 13 [years of age] within the limits of Jaffna Municipal
Council (JMC), is spreading fast and unchecked due to negligence of JMC
authorities, according to Jaffna Teaching Hospital (JTH) sources. A 7 month
old child died from dengue fever Thursday [14 Jan 2010] in Nalloor, the
sources said. 308 persons were admitted to JTC with dengue fever in
December 2009, while 350 more had been admitted in January [2010] alone.

Cases of dengue had been identified in Nalloor, Cha'ndilippaay,
Uduththu'rai, Koa'ndaavil and Changkaanai. No information is available on
cases of dengue fever in Vadamaraadchi and Thenmaraadchi.

Divisional director of health services Dr N Ketheeswaran said that
preventive measures in 3 stages are to be taken to contain the spread of
dengue fever with the assistance of the Ministry of Health.

Surveillance of cases clinically suggestive of dengue
-----------------------------------------------------
After being maintained over the last 2 weeks of Dec 2009 (weeks 2009-52 and
2009-53) at levels close to the maximum expected, there is a rapid rise and
a large number of cases clinically suggestive [of dengue virus infections]
during the 1st week of Jan (week 2010-01). With about 260 cases clinically
suggestive [of dengue] seen in consultation with general physicians during
the last week, the level reached was equivalent to that observed during the
2nd week of Dec [2009] and far surpasses the maximum level expected for the
period. The number of cases clinically suggestive of dengue fever is an
estimate for the entire population of Guadeloupe [based on] the number of
people who consulted a general practitioner for a clinical syndrome
suggestive of dengue. This estimation is performed using data collected
from the network of sentinel physicians.

Monitoring of laboratory confirmed cases
----------------------------------------
The evolution of the number of laboratory confirmed cases follows a dynamic
similar to that of the suggestive cases. After declining in the 3rd and 4th
weeks of Dec 2009 (week 2009-51 and 2009-52), we observed a significant
increase of almost 60 per cent in the number of laboratory confirmed cases
in week 53 [last week of Dec 2009]. Since early Dec [2009], the positivity
rate remained at a high level, each week ranging between 37 and 51 per cent
in the 5 weeks of Dec 2009.

Geographical distribution
-------------------------
The [number of] households identified [with dengue cases] in October [2009]
has increased and gradually generalized. The phenomenon [dengue outbreak]
was widespread on Grande Terre island. On Basse-Terre island, it was
widespread on the north east and north of the Windward Coast, including
Bay-Mahault, Petit Bourg, and Guava.

Surveillance of hospitalized cases
----------------------------------
After remaining stable between August and November 2009, the number of
laboratory confirmed cases hospitalized increased sharply in Dec 2009, with
a total of 20 cases. Since early January [2010], 5 laboratory confirmed
cases have been hospitalized. Since early December [2009] the 25 registered
cases have comprised 12 adults and 13 children. They are divided into 7
[cases] of classical dengue, 3 severe cases, one DHF, 4 incomplete
hemorrhagic types; the other 10 cases recently reported are being currently
classified.

Monitoring of [dengue virus, DENV] serotypes
--------------------------------------------
The DENV-2 serotype that was predominant to the end of the epidemic of 2007
has gradually given way to the DENV-1 serotype, which has circulated almost
exclusively since early 2009.

Situation analysis
------------------
After a period of stability observed during the period at the end of year
[2009], the monitoring indicators show a strong increase of virus
circulation. The phenomenon is widespread at this time save for some
southern windward coastal municipalities and southern and northern
Basse-Terre. The epidemiological situation, which corresponds to Phase 3 of
PSAG (program monitoring, warning and management of epidemics) for
Guadeloupe, is "epidemic risk," which will be reviewed by the Committee of
Experts on Infectious and Emerging Diseases that meets on 14 Jan [2010].

Surveillance of cases clinically suggestive of dengue
-----------------------------------------------------
Over the last week (Jan 2010, week 1), we are witnessing a decrease in the
number of cases suggestive of dengue seen by general practitioners on the
island, with an estimated 100 cases who have consulted [physicians] versus
215 the previous week. However, this number remains very much above the
epidemic threshold, and comparable to numbers observed during the 1st 3
weeks of Dec [2009]. Since early Dec 2009, nearly 800 cases clinically
suggestive of dengue fever have consulted a general practitioner, averaging
over 130 per week. The number of cases clinically suggestive of dengue
fever is an estimate, for the entire population Saint Martin, based on the
number of people who consulted a general practitioner for a clinical
syndrome suggestive of dengue. This estimation is performed using data
collected from the network of sentinel physicians.

Monitoring of biologically confirmed cases
------------------------------------------
Since early Dec [2009], the number of laboratory confirmed [dengue] cases
has varied from week to week but remained well above the epidemic
threshold. During the last week, there were 24 laboratory confirmed dengue
cases on the island (incomplete data). A total of 123 of laboratory
confirmed cases have been identified since early December [2009].

Positivity rate of requests for laboratory confirmation and [dengue virus,
DENV] serotypes circulating
-------------------------------------------------------
The positivity rates of samples taken has been high since the beginning of
Dec [2009], every week ranging from 40-55 per cent. In the 1st week of Jan
[2010], 24 of the 44 samples tested were positive (55 per cent). Since the
beginning of Oct [2009], 3 distinct [dengue virus, DENV] serotypes
circulate on the island: DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-4. DENV-2 is prevalent (22
samples of 31; 70 per cent); DENV-1 was found 6 times and DENV-4 in 3
patients. Only DENV-3 appears not to be circulating.

Hospitalized cases
------------------
During the 1st week of January [2010], 4 children with laboratory confirmed
dengue were treated in hospital. One of them had a severe form requiring a
transfer to the University Hospital of Pointe-a-Pitre, where he is
currently hospitalized. The other 3 children had non-severe disease.

Spatial distribution
--------------------
The study of the geographical distribution of laboratory confirmed cases
shows a distribution of cases across the island. However, the Concordia
neighborhood and the areas between Grand Case to Baie Orientale have been
most affected since late Nov [2009].

Situation analysis
------------------
In Saint-Martin, the dengue epidemic continues. Although the number of
cases does not seem to increase, there were still hospitalizations during
the past week from a severe form [of the disease]. The epidemiological
situation is still in Phase 3 of PSAG of the Northern Islands as an
epidemic phase.

Surveillance of cases clinically suggestive of dengue
-----------------------------------------------------
After reaching very high values between mid-Nov and mid-Dec [2009], the
number of cases clinically suggestive of dengue fever has abruptly
decreased in week 2009-52 without, however, running below the epidemic
threshold. Since then, there has been a gradual increase in new cases, with
an estimated 40 cases in the 1st week of Jan [2010]. The number of
suggestive [dengue] cases has been well above the epidemic threshold for
the past 2 months. It is estimated that during this period, 340 cases
suggestive of dengue were seen by general practitioners on the island,
averaging over 40 per week. The number of cases clinically suggestive of
dengue fever is an estimate for the entire population of the island, based
on the number of people who consulted a general practitioner for a clinical
syndrome suggestive of dengue. This estimation is performed using data
collected from the network of sentinel physicians.

Monitoring of laboratory confirmed cases
----------------------------------------
The number of laboratory confirmed cases of dengue fever follows a dynamic
similar to that of suggestive cases. After a sharp decline in week 2009-52,
there was a further increase in the number of confirmed cases during the
last week of Dec (2009-53), then an equally high number of laboratory
confirmations during the past week (2010-01). Since the 3rd week of Nov
(2009-47), 239 laboratory confirmed cases were recorded, and the number of
weekly cases has far exceeded the epidemic threshold.

Positivity rate of requests for laboratory confirmation and circulating
[dengue virus, DENV] serotypes
-------------------------------------------------------
As in the previous week, the positivity rate has been very high in the week
2010-01, since 26 of the 41 samples analyzed have been positive (66 per
cent). This is the 2nd consecutive week for this rate, so it is increasing
during the upswing of the epidemic. Since mid-Nov 2009 (week 2009-47),
DENV-1 has constituted the vast majority [of isolates], accounting for 95
per cent of viruses isolated (73 of 77 samples analyzed). DENV-2 has also
been identified but only 4 times.

Hospitalized cases
------------------
Since early Dec [2009], no new confirmed cases of dengue have been
hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The number of laboratory confirmed
hospitalized cases has been constant since October 2009, with 2
hospitalizations occurring each month.

Spatial distribution
--------------------
The geographical distribution of laboratory confirmed cases indicates their
presence on all sectors of the island, indicating that there still is
widespread circulation of the virus.

Situation analysis
------------------
At Saint Barthelemy, the epidemic continues. Virus circulation is still
important and widespread on the island. The number of hospitalized cases
remains very low. The epidemiological situation is still in Phase 3 of PSAG
of the Northern Islands as an epidemic phase.

The state Secretariat of Health has announced partial data of dengue cases
for the 1st week of January 2010. Up to today's date (13 Jan [2010]), the
State of Mato Grosso has reported 1346 cases of the disease, 26 of them
reported as serious dengue cases. To date, the total number of reports of
deaths due to dengue are 4 cases, which are under investigation [apparently
not yet confirmed - Mod.TY]. The numbers are from the Coordination [office]
of Epidemiological Monitoring of SES/MT [state Secretariat of Health, Mato
Grosso].

The capital of Mato Grosso, Cuiaba has so far reported 234 cases of dengue.
Of these, 4 were reported as severe cases of the disease with no recorded
deaths from dengue.

In Varzea Grande to date, 122 cases of dengue have been reported. Of that
number, 5 were reported as severe cases of disease, with 2 deaths under
investigation.

Deaths in other municipalities that had reported dengue so far were: Pocone
(one case under investigation) and Rondonopolis (one case under investigation).

The state of Mato Grosso up until now has had an increase of 18.7 per cent
in reported dengue [cases] compared with the same period last year [2009].
The data relating to the partial close of the year 2009 are 58 410 cases of
dengue, of which 1405 cases were reported as severe disease. The
municipalities have until 15 Jan 2010 to pass along the data on dengue as
of the close of the year of 2009. Total dengue deaths in 2009 are 57 cases.
Of these deaths, 52 were confirmed, and 5 cases are under investigation.

This week, the government of Mato Grosso renewed the partnership of the
state with the municipalities of Cuiaba and Varzea Grande to fight dengue
with the hiring of mobile patrols carrying out the task of trash removal
from homes and vacant lots in the 2 cities for more than 30 days. This
period will also see the delivery of new machines for road consortia.

Through the Center for Strategic Information in Health Surveillance
(CLEVS), a reorganization was established with municipalities at risk of
and [having] epidemic disease, which included measures and strategic
actions in fighting and dealing with the disease through conferences about
the dengue situation.
