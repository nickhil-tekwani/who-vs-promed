Uganda: hepatitis E spreads, IDPs [internally displaced persons] most
vulnerable
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 13 Oct 2008 hepatitis E is on the increase in Uganda's
northern district of Pader, where it has claimed scores of lives and
infected thousands in the past year, officials said.

Since May [2008], there have been 55 new infections and 7 deaths in
Pader, according to Angelo Luganya, a health official in Pader. "More
cases are being received in health units in villages and there is
need for urgent attention to check on the disease that is on the
rise," he told IRIN. Since 2007, the viral disease has infected up to
8000 people in neighbouring Kitgum district alone, and killed 129.
The disease has since spread to the districts of Pader, Gulu,
Adjumani, and Amuru.

Hepatitis E is transmitted mainly by drinking contaminated water or
eating contaminated food. Charles Kurua, the Pader deputy
commissioner, said the majority of those infected in the district
were internally displaced persons (IDPs).

"There is need for intervention by local government and health
partners to curb the spread of the disease," said Kurua, who is also
a member of the hepatitis E taskforce in the district, adding that
the number of those being infected was rising daily. Poor sanitation
has contributed to the spread of the disease, with some IDPs lacking
pit latrines and others drinking unsafe water from unprotected
sources, leaving them prone to infection, Kurua said. "Our people are
living under unhygienic conditions in IDP camps and areas of return
in villages that leave them more vulnerable to diseases such as
hepatitis E and cholera," he said. "If they [IDPs] keep on staying in
the camps, more would die from the diseases."

The infected were being treated at Kalongo, the main hospital in the
district, as well as in health centres in Pader, Acholi Bur, Pajule,
and Patongo areas. Kurua said the taskforce was being frustrated by a
lack of adequate resources, making it hard for its members to reach
all the communities living in Pader. He said efforts were underway to
drill boreholes in all resettlement areas to avoid outbreaks of
sanitation-related diseases.

Alfred Akena, a local leader in Pader, said the situation was
worrying because in most of the villages IDPs are returning to do not
have adequate functional health centres. "A number of parishes have
not been able to get health centres within their reach due to a
collaboration gap between the parish development committees and the
district, this is dangerous when we get outbreak of diseases," he
said. Moreover, Akena said, people in the neighbouring district of
Kotido also risk infection of hepatitis E following an influx of
Karimojong people looking for food and water. At least 346 Karimojong
women and children have crossed into Pader district and settled in
the sub-counties of Adilang, Lapono, Paimol, Kalongo, and Parabongo,
adjacent to Abim and Kotido districts.

The hepatitis E outbreak in Uganda is far from contained and is
spreading further south from Kitgum district into Pader district.
Partly as a consequence of movement of IDPs (internally displaced
persons) deeper into the country. And now Kotido district to the east
of Pader is threatened by another movement of IDPs.

The causes of the outbreak, contaminated water sources and inadequate
provision of sanitation, are well understood, but administrative and
resource problems have yet to be overcome.
