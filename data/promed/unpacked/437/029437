Beavers found dead in western Colorado have likely succumbed to a
common waterborne bacteria.

Colorado Division of Wildlife officials say that several beavers have
been found dead in San Miguel and Gilpin counties.

The culprit was an outbreak of a [bacterial infection] called
tularemia, which can infect animals that spend a lot of time in water.

A total of 5 beavers have been found dead near Telluride, and 3 beaver
carcasses were reported in Gilpin County.

Dr Lisa Wolfe, a state wildlife veterinarian, says outbreaks of
tularemia are common and pose little threat to humans.

[The article does not tell us if there were any necropsies done or if
this a usual occurrence and the state veterinarian's office is
presuming this is the case.

Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly
known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a gram negative, non-motile
coccobacillus. 2 subspecies exist: _F. tularensis tularensis_ (also
known as Jellison type A) and _F. tularensis holarctica_ (Jellison
type B). _F. tularensis tularensis_ is found in lagomorphs in North
America and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits; _F.
tularensis holarctica_ is less virulent and occurs in beavers,
muskrats, and voles in North America and in hares and small rodents in
Eurasia.

_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion, inhalation,
arthropod-borne transfer, or direct contact through the skin and
mucous membranes. Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of
infected animals and can survive for long periods on fomites including
food and water. Aquatic animals may develop tularemia after being
immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores sometimes become infected
after ingesting a contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F. tularensis
tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor andersoni_, _D.
variabilis_, and _Amblyomma americanum_) and biting flies
(particularly deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also
transmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the organism is spread by
animal bites.

_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods in arthropod vectors and
in the environment. Individual flies may carry the organism for 2
weeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes. Viable bacteria can also
be found for weeks to months in the carcasses and hides of infected
animals and in fomites including grain dust, straw, water, soil, and
bedbugs. This organism is highly resistant to freezing; live organisms
have been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at -15 deg C (5
deg F).

Rabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected.
Tularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets
including pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish, and birds can also get
tularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the
disease.

Some animals do not show signs of disease. Illness occurs 1-10 days
after exposure to the bacteria. Animals may have fever, look tired, be
depressed, and refuse to eat. Some will have a cough, stagger from
weakness, vomit, or develop diarrhea. Rabbits and rodents behave
strangely, huddle together, and have a rough looking coat. Sudden
death can occur.

Tularemia bacteria can be found in the organs or body fluids of
infected animals, which contaminate the environment. The bacteria can
live for long periods of time (weeks to months) in soil, vegetation,
and water and serve as a source of infection for other animals or
humans. Animals get tularemia by ingesting (oral) contaminated food
(raw meat from infected animals) or drinking contaminated water. They
can also inhale (aerosol) the bacterium, have direct contact with it
in contaminated environments (entry through the mucous membranes or
breaks/cuts in the skin), or be bitten by infected biting flies or
ticks (vector).

Tularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment
or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets
indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat,
especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.

Lastly, this agent is a category A bioterrorism agent.
