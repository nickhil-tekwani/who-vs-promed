Specialized field teams in 3 provinces are trying to tackle the
spread of myiasis, the infestation of human or animal tissue with fly
larvae (maggots) -- a disease, which has not been seen in Yemen until
very recently.

Ghaleb al-Eryani, director-general of the General Department for
Animal Resources (GDAR) at Yemen's Ministry of Agriculture, told IRIN
[UN Integrated Regional Information Networks. - Mod.AS] on 18 Feb
2008 that about 1500 animals and 8 people [that] had contracted the
disease since it first appeared in December 2007 in al-Dhaher
village, Saada Province, near the border with Saudi Arabia.

"The disease was combated immediately... but later it spread to other
districts and the neighbouring province of Hajja," al-Eryani said,
adding that the disease had also hit al-Zahrah district in the
western province of al-Hudeidah.

"The teams have cured all the discovered cases by giving them
anti-parasite medicines and spraying parasiticide. Combating the
disease is very costly and beyond the government's capabilities. On
average, the infected animal or human needs USD 10 for the required
medicines," he said.

Myiasis is the infestation of tissue with fly larvae. It is
widespread in the tropics and subtropics of Africa and the Americas,
but occurs with significantly less frequency in most other areas of
the world. The disease is also known as 'fly-strike', 'fly-blown', or
'New World' [screwworm].

The GDAR said it had notified farmers not to move their animals
without the supervision of a veterinary officer for fear that they
might move to infected places.

Al-Eryani said people need to be aware of the disease; combating it
requires a clean and healthy environment. He said the poor could be
the most vulnerable as 75 percent of Yemen's 21 million inhabitants
live in rural areas and "almost all people in rural areas rear
animals in their houses. The environment encourages the spread of the
new disease."

"The situation is very worrying. The initial loss Yemen might face is
22 billion riyals [about USD 111 million] in terms of livestock.
There are 15 million sheep, 1.4 million cattle, and 250 000 camels in
the country," he added.

Epidemiology
------------
According to al-Eryani, the disease is caused by a fly known as
screwworm or 'New World' (because of its prevalence in the tropics)
-- a species of parasitic fly whose maggots eat the living tissue of
warm-blooded animals, including humans. The screwworm fly is about
twice the size of a regular house fly. It is greenish-blue in color
and has large reddish-orange eyes.

Infestations can occur in any open wound, including cuts, castration
wounds, navels of newborn animals, and wounds caused by tick bites.
The wounds often contain a dark, foul-smelling discharge. Screwworm
larvae feed only on living flesh, never dead tissue. Once a wound is
infested, the screwworm can eventually kill the animal or human,
literally eating it alive.

Screwworm females can lay up to 400 eggs at a time in the exposed
flesh of either animals or humans and they can hatch into larvae in
as little as 12 hours. A single adult female can lay as many as 2800
eggs during its 31-day lifespan. The hosts are usually mammals,
occasionally birds and, less commonly, amphibians or reptiles.

"This fly can fly over 120 km (75 mi) and deposit its eggs in
animal's or human's wounds. It also puts its eggs in the animal's
anus and vagina. Then the egg develops into a larva, which later
grows in the form of a snail," he said, adding that the infected
organ might need to be amputated. "The disease does not directly lead
to death but if not treated it causes death," he said.

Bristol University's Veterinary Parasitology and Ecology department
has described in detail the different forms of the disease.

[Screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that feed on living flesh. These
larvae infest all mammals and, rarely, birds. Two different species
of flies cause screwworm myiasis: New World screwworms (_Cochliomyia
hominivorax_, NWS) occur in the western hemisphere, and Old World
screwworms (_Chrysomya bezziana_, OWS) are found in the eastern
hemisphere. Both species are members of the subfamily _Chrysomyinae_
in the family _Calliphoridae_ (blowflies). "Screwworm myiasis" is an
OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) reportable disease.

The climatic requirements for these 2 species are similar, and they
could become established in either hemisphere. OWS and NWS have
adapted to fill the same niche, and their life cycles are nearly
identical. Female flies lay their eggs at the edges of wounds or on
mucous membranes. When they hatch, the larvae enter the body, grow,
and feed, progressively enlarging the wound. Eventually, they drop to
the ground to pupate and develop into adults. Screwworms can enter
wounds as small as a tick bite. Left untreated, infestations can be
fatal. Screwworms have been eradicated from some parts of the world,
including the southern United States, but infested animals are
occasionally imported into screwworm-free countries. These
infestations must be recognized and treated promptly; if the larvae
are allowed to leave the wound, they can pupate and introduce
themselves into the area.

Screwworms are very susceptible to freezing temperatures or long
periods of near-freezing temperatures. These organisms are seasonal
in some areas, and can spread into colder climates during the summer.

Screwworms can be eradicated from a region by repeatedly releasing
sterile male flies that mate with wild female screwworms to produce
unfertilized eggs. (Because it is usually impractical to separate
irradiated male and female flies, both males and females are usually
released.) This technique leads to a reduction in screwworm numbers
and eventually results in eradication. In addition, infested animals
are treated and their movements are controlled.

NWS are found only in the western hemisphere, primarily in the
tropical and semitropical regions of South America and the Caribbean.
They are rare above 7000 feet [2134 meters]. These parasites were
once widespread, but eradication programs have eliminated them from
the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao,
and all of Central America. Screwworms were last reported in Panama
in 2005. An eradication program is ongoing in Jamaica. NWS were
detected in Libya in 1988, but have since been eradicated. This
eradication project, which involved the wide-scale releasing of
sterile male as described above, was supported by the FAO (UN Food
and Agriculture Organization).

_C. bezziana_ (OWS) can be found in Southeast Asia, the Indian
subcontinent, much of tropical and sub-Saharan Africa, and some
countries in the Middle East. The situation is changeable in the
Middle East; while Kuwait reported its last case in 1998,
infestations have recently occurred in Iraq and Iran. OWS have never
become established in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, or the Western
Hemisphere.

Occasional cases or outbreaks of screwworm are reported in
screwworm-free countries.

Humans can be hosts for screwworm larvae.

The newswire above on suspected cases in Yemen, in animals and
humans, does not provide information on the exact identity of the
screwworm involved. Its confirmation, including identification of the
fly species involved and any available further information, is
requested. If confirmed, immediate notification to the OIE should
follow and application of control/eradication measures is essential.
Neighbouring countries should carry out surveillance at the earliest.
