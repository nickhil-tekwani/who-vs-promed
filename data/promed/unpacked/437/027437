Six horses in Crawford County, Ohio have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported. On 3 May 2019, the EDCC said the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) had confirmed neurologic EHV in 5 horses on a single premises.

"Three affected horses are deceased," the EDCC said. "All showed severe respiratory signs; one older horse collapsed before death. An additional positive horse has shown rear-leg weakness and urine dribbling but is recovering."

30 horses were considered exposed. Then, on 6 May 2019, the EDCC said the ODA confirmed another positive case.

"This horse had a fever and respiratory signs late last week and is now showing neurologic signs," the EDCC said. "This brings the total number of affected horses to 6," 4 of which showed respiratory signs of disease (and of which 3 are deceased) and 2 showing neurologic signs.

The premise has been under quarantine for the past week with no movement of horses on or off the property, the EDCC added.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM.

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[30 horses exposed are quite a lot. The article does not specify whether this was a boarding facility or whether an infected animal was found at a show or exhibition.

While vaccination will not prevent the neurological form, it may give your animal a better chance of surviving. If you have not vaccinated, please do so. At the same time, vaccinate for strangles, rabies, eastern and western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. - Mod.TG
