This should, of course, have read: DO NOT DISABLE YOUR MACRO VIRUS
PROTECTION.
I repeat below the full instructions from our first post:
How to Protect your PC:
----------------------
Verify that the macro virus protection feature in Word is turned on. (The
default is on.) To do this, in Word 97:
1. On the Tools menu, click Options.
2. On the General tab, check Macro Virus Protection.
With the macro virus protection turned on, every time you receive a Word
document that contains macros, a dialog box opens and allows you to choose
whether to enable the macros. Always choose "disable macros" when you are
not certain of a macro s purpose or functionality. By choosing to disable
the macros, you will prevent this and any macro virus from running,
rendering it harmless.
The virus is only activated if you open the attached
Word document and choose to enable the macros, or if your macro virus
protection settings have been turned off. (Most Word documents do not
contain macros.)
***
Sorry about that
