_Iris yellow spot virus_ (IYSV) is continuing to pose a danger to onion crops by evolving and spreading. It had been known to infect onions since the early 1990s, but a sudden resurgence and rapid spread of the virus was observed in the early 2000s in the US causing as much as 80% yield losses.

More than 200 genetic sequences reported globally in GenBank were analysed, suggesting that the virus is evolving through genetic recombination and mutations. While one strain is predominant in US onion crops, a different strain seems to be present in other parts of the world. The 2 distinct strains seem to be due to differences in one single gene. A molecular test can identify which of the strains is involved in a given outbreak. The study also provides an estimate of the evolutionary rate of this virus and its speed of spread as being similar to other related viruses.

[_Iris yellow spot virus_ (IYSV; genus _Orthotospovirus_, previously _Tospovirus_) hosts reported so far include onion, leek, iris, amaryllis, lisianthus, as well as wild relatives of onion (_Allium_ species). IYSV has been detected in a number of locations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, South Africa and Australia. The economic impact is low in some areas, but up to 100% loss has been observed in onion crops, for example, in Brazil.

The virus is transmitted by the onion thrips, _Thrips tabaci_. Spread of IYSV occurs with infected plant material; ornamentals and weeds may serve as pathogen and/or vector reservoirs since thrips may also feed on them.

Vector insects carrying the virus have been shown to have a longer life span (see link below), both giving them an evolutionary advantage and increasing the virus's efficiency to spread. The virus appears not to be seed transmitted. Management of IYSV and its vector may include use of clean propagative material, cultural practices and pesticides. Natural resistance to tospoviruses appears to be rare amongst their plant hosts and their epidemiology is complex.

Tospoviruses ( type member _Tomato spotted wilt virus_; TSWV) are an extremely important group of plant RNA viruses affecting a large range of crops. Due to their agricultural importance, research on tospoviruses has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new species are being found and many more can be expected to exist.
