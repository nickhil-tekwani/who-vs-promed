Another outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] has occurred in Kuban, said
speakers at a Tuesday [23 Nov 2010] meeting of the Krasnodar territorial
emergency situations commission.

"The disease has been recorded in 5 districts of the Krasnodar region:
Krasnoarmeiskaya, Temryuk, Starominskaya, Kurganinsk and Novopokrovskaya,"
they said.

"There is a danger of ASF spread throughout the territory. The entire
population of 1.1 million pigs is at stake," Krasnodar governor Alexander
Tkachyov said.
