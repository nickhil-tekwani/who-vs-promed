Multiple new suspected bird flu cases have been reported over the weekend, renewing concerns that the pathogenic poultry disease may spread again.

On Sunday [23 Feb 2014], 2 suspected cases were reported at 2 duck farms in Youngam and Younggwang, South Jeolla Province and a chicken farm in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, the agriculture ministry said Sunday [23 Feb 2014]. These followed a chicken farm in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, which reported a suspected case on Saturday [22 Feb 2014]. South Jeolla Province has the nation's largest duck farm cluster. All are undergoing laboratory examinations for confirmation.

A virulent H5N8 strain of avian influenza has been confirmed in 23 [outbreaks] across the country since it was 1st detected on 16 Jan 2014 in Gochang, North Jeolla Province. Nationwide, more than 2.4 million chickens and ducks have been culled so far, breaking a record for poultry killed in connection with the bird flu.

The highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has been identified in 13 other [events] that involved wild birds, which made relevant government agencies identify migratory wild birds as possible sources of the pathogen, but no conclusion has been reached.

Health officials said the H5N8 strain, unlike a few other strains of bird flu, poses no immediate threats to humans. The outbreak of bird flu has diminished the national consumption of chicken and ducks.

The authorities have buried all live poultry within a 3-km perimeter of the outbreak of the disease, sparking protests from animal rights activists. However, authorities argue that it is the most practical and quickest remedy to contain the situation.

[The status of migratory/wild birds within the South Korean H5N8 epidemiology is of significance for the prospects of disease eradication. In case the virus continues to circulate within wild birds, stamping out and quarantine measures may not be enough for the disease to be eradicated. - Mod.AS
