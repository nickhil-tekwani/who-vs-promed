Deaths in Maua were due to spotted fever
----------------------------------------
Testing done by the Adolfo Lutz Institute of the State Secretariat of
Health revealed that the cause of 3 deaths in Maua, Grande Sao Paulo, was
fiebre maculosa [spotted fever], as announced by the Jornal SPTV of TV
Globo. Transmission of spotted fever is through infected ticks, which live
on wild birds, chickens, horses, and dogs. It is a notoriously difficult
disease to diagnose (see earlier "Undiagnosed deaths" postings listed below).
The 3 people who died were in the same family and lived in the same house
[multifamily] in Jardim Primavera, in Maua, a poor region that according to
SPTV does not have basic sanitation. Animals are common there. Other
individuals from the same neighborhood have been released from the
hospital. The Secretariat of Health confirmed that there was no risk of spread.

[As mentioned in earlier ProMED-mail postings (listed below), the diagnosis
of hantavirus infection was less likely in the absence of respiratory
symptoms from descriptions of the illness. Fiebre maculosa (spotted fever)
is another name for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), caused by
_Rickettsia rickettsii_. In Central and South America, the Cayenne tick
(_Amblyomma cajennense_) is the most important vector for _R. rickettsii_.
RMSF is endemic in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais in Brazil. The area of
residence of the cases in the report above is Maua, one of the
municipalities in the Metropolitan Region of the state of Sao Paulo. The
municipality is a small, somewhat underdeveloped area (according to
information on the Sao Paulo State tourism website
<http://www.turismopaulista.sp.gov.br/cidades/index_cidades2.asp>).
Cases and the epidemiology of RMSF in Sao Paulo are reviewed in a paper
available online: DeLemos ERS, Alvarenga FBF, Cintra ML, Ramos MC, et al.
Spotted fever in Brazil: a seroepidemiologic study and description of
clinical cases in an endemic areas in the state of Sao Paulo. Am J Trop Med
Hyg 2001; 65(4): 329-34. <http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/reprint/65/4/329.pdf>.
More information on the ongoing epidemiologic investigation of this
cluster, including information on other possible identified cases in the
area from knowledgeable sources, would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
