Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1806 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 643 related deaths.

WHO risk assessment
MERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality and has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

[The global tally reported to WHO as of 11 Sep 2016 is 1806 cases of laboratory-confirmed infection with MERS-CoV including 643 deaths. Since then Saudi Arabia has reported 3 additional cases. As the previously available WHO tally was 1800 cases, this tally of 1806 presumably includes the case in a Saudi camel herder reported by Austria on 8 Sep 2016.
