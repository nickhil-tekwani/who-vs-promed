Diarrhea outbreak strikes Bogor
-------------------------------
Dozens of children under the age of 5 are been treated for diarrheal
diseases in several hospitals in Bogor, which suggests that residents may
lack access to clean water and basic information on good hygiene and health.
Spokesman of the Indonesia Red Cross (PMI) Hospital in Bogor, Andi Mukti,
said the hospital had treated 104 children since early Jun 2004, 94 of whom
were outpatients. According to the Bogor health agency, 26 children with
diarrheal diseases are being treated at the Salak army hospital.
Officials of the city health agency expressed concern that the number of
patients with diarrheal diseases would increase during the dry season,
which will start in Jul-Aug 2004. "Not only children, but adults will be
affected by the proliferation of _E. coli_ bacteria that causes diarrhea,"
said head of the infectious disease eradication unit at the agency, Eddy
Darma, as quoted by Antara earlier this week.
Data from the Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey (SDKI) shows that in
2002 and 2003, about 11 per cent of children aged below 5, most of whom
were from low-income families, suffered from diarrheal diseases. The
percentage has not changed since 1997. Children aged below 5 account for
10.4 per cent, or more than 22 million, of the country's total population
of 220 million.

At least 17 people have died of diarrhea at Sonacherra Tea Estate in
Assam's Haliakandi district during the last 3 days. GP President of
Sonacherra, Dinesh Singh said that an acute form of diarrhea had assumed
epidemic form in the tea estate, resulting in the deaths.
"A medical team has gone to the area to provide treatment and enquire into
the causes of the death. I have received reports of death, but at present I
am not in a position to give the exact number of people who have died",
said Haliakandi deputy commissioner, Jatin Gogoi.
Lack of proper sanitation and drinking water were the primary cause for the
outbreak of the disease. State social welfare minister, Gautam Roy, who is
also the MLA from Hailakandi, has directed the authorities to open medical
camps to provide treatment to the sick.
[Although no denominator is given, fatalities suggest the disease may be
cholera. - Mod.LL]

Wedding guests laid low by mystery bug
--------------------------------------
Health officials are investigating an outbreak of gastroenteritis among
guests at 2 weddings held at the Boat House By The Lake restaurant on Sat,
26 Jun 2004.
Deputy chief health officer Dr Charles Guest said yesterday that 40 out of
80 guests at the lunchtime wedding developed symptoms such as diarrhea and
vomiting. Some guests at the evening wedding also became ill, but health
officials were still attempting to ascertain the illness' strike rate. One
of the weddings was between a Department of Defense worker and a Department
of Foreign Affairs and Trade employee and had a number of high-profile
people on the guest list.
The bride and groom are still recovering from food poisoning themselves
during their honeymoon at Perisher. They could not be contacted yesterday.
Overall, 6 guests were treated at hospital emergency departments within 48
hours of the wedding. Dr Guest said he could not say at this stage whether
food poisoning or viral gastroenteritis had caused the illness, but
gastroenteritis had been "very common" in the region this year. He said
health officials had no reason to close the Boat House By The Lake because
there was no ongoing public health hazard.
Dr Guest said 6 functions were held at the restaurant, but the outbreak of
gastroenteritis was confined to the 2 weddings. The investigation was
focusing on common threads such as the health status of staff who worked
both functions and food served at both weddings such as the grilled quail
salad, radicchio, red onion, and lentils with aged balsamic vinegar.
