Doctors on Friday [17 Feb 2012] reported the first known case of legionnaires’ disease, a rare infection usually linked to faulty air conditioning and hot water systems, that was caused by a visit to the dentist. The case report, published in The Lancet, describes an unnamed 82 year old woman in Rome who was hospitalized with fever and breathing problems in February 2011 [Ricci ML, Fontana S, Pinci F, et al. Pneumonia associated with a dental unit waterline. Lancet 2012; 379 (9816): 684].

Swiftly diagnosed with infection by _Legionella pneumophila_ [a Gram negative bacterium], she died 2 days later of septic shock despite being given heavy doses of antibiotics. During the 2 to 10 days it would have taken for the bacterial [infection] to incubate, the patient had only left her house twice, both times to attend appointments at the dentist.

Samples of water were taken from the dentist's tap, from the waterline -- the tube that supplies water to tooth scalers and handpieces used by the dentist -- and from the high pressure pump supplying the waterline itself. All 3 sources tested positive for _L. pneumophila_, but especially in water taken from the pump. Genetic sequencing found that the germs there matched the bacteria that killed the patient. The bug turned out to be a particularly virulent sub-strain called Benidorm. After cleaning with hydrogen peroxide solution and bleach, the water unit was free of contamination.

The case is unusual, as outbreaks of legionnaires’ disease are generally caused by air conditioning systems, hot water systems, spas, and fountains that are not properly cleaned or maintained. Warm temperatures and periods of water immobility provide a breeding ground for the bacteria. Distributed in fine droplets by a spray, the bacteria are then breathed in. Elderly people or individuals with poor immune systems are those most at risk.

Previous research has shown that dental waterlines can be contaminated by the germ, but this is the first known case where illness has occurred. "As far as we are aware, no case of legionnaires’ disease has been associated with this source of infection," says the report, headed by Maria Luisa Ricci at the Istituta Superiore de Sanita in Rome. "The case here shows that the disease can be acquired from a dental unit waterline during routine dental treatment. Aerosolized water from high speed turbine instruments was most likely the source of the infection."

The case report puts down a series of recommendations, including use of filters, continuous circulation of disinfected water and using sterile water instead of tap water.

[Legionnaires' disease was first recognized when an outbreak of pneumonia occurred among participants at an American Legion convention during the summer of 1976 in Philadelphia and was focused mainly at one convention hotel (Fraser DW, et al. Legionnaires' disease: description of an epidemic of pneumonia. N Engl J Med 1977; 297:1189-97). Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused by _Legionella_ species, a Gram negative bacillus. The _Legionella_ species usually incriminated is _Legionella pneumophila_, and about 80-90 per cent of cases are caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic illness also caused by legionella. Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever are acquired by inhalation by a susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized legionella. Risk factors for legionnaires’ disease include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, immunosuppression, and possibly alcoholism.

Legionella are embedded in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the pipes and containers of plumbing systems. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems. Concentrations of the organism can also be increased by disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can be generated from the contaminated water by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, showerheads, misters, whirlpool spas, and other such devices.

Genotyping patient and environmental isolates will help to confirm the environmental source (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). Because _L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, matching the genotypes of clinical isolates with those of possible environmental sources helps identify the environmental sources that have given rise to the cases. By genotyping environmental and clinical isolates in the patient above reported in Lancet, aerosolized water from high speed turbine dental instruments was identified as the most likely the source of the infection. However, this is difficult in most legionellosis outbreaks because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens, in which case genotyping of clinical isolates is, of course, not possible.

Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water system is difficult, especially if the system is old. As temperatures over 55 C (131 F) kill legionella, superheating of water to 71-77 C (160-171 F), from 43 C (110 F), the temperature usually used by most hospitals, or hyperchlorination (greater than 10 mg/liter of chlorine in water) for a period of time is recommended to eliminate legionella from a hot water system.

Significant contamination of dental unit waterlines with legionella has been widely documented (Williams JF, Molinari JA, Andrews N. Microbial contamination of dental unit waterlines: origins and characteristics. Compendium of Continuing Education in Dentistry. 1996; 17:538–540; Pankhurst CL, Philpott-Howard JN, Hewitt JH, Casewell MW. The efficacy of chlorination and filtration in the control and eradication of Legionella from dental chair water systems. Journal of Hospital Infections 1990: 16(1):9–18). Serological studies have also shown a higher prevalence of antibodies to _L. pneumophila_ in dentists and dental practice staff, suggesting a potential health risk for these workers (Pankhurst CL et al. Prevalence of legionella waterline contamination and Legionella pneumophila antibodies in general dental practitioners in London and rural Northern Ireland. British Dental Journal 2003; 195(10):591–594). Surprisingly, however, no cases of legionnaires’ disease have been previously attributed to dental units, perhaps due to a lack of awareness that a visit for dental treatment or prophylaxis is a significant risk factor for legionellosis.

Rome, with over 2.7 million residents, is the capital of Italy. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, on the Tiber River within the Lazio region of Italy.
