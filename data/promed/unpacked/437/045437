[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD, i.e., sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease), are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 3 Oct 2011
has risen to 173. A total of 3 definite/probable patients remain
alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead
and alive) is 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and now 2 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
----------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 3 Oct 2011], there have been 120 referrals,
59 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS, 6 cases of familial
CJD, 2 cases of vCJD, and 2 cases of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2853 referrals, 1274
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 173 cases of vCJD, 89 cases of familial
CJD, 67 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 44 cases of GSS.

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 19 Aug 2011, and totals overall since 1996
---------------------------------
During the 1st 8 months of 2011, there have been 216 referrals, 134 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 105 cases of
sporadic CJD, 21 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

Overall, 4126 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending (but vCJD excluded in 8
cases or inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in
achieving unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 15-year period, a total of 2441 prion disease cases has
been screened, a figure which includes 18 cases with type
determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall, there were 2068 cases of sporadic CJD, 356 cases of
familial CJD, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases, and in Saudi Arabia in the
other [But see following statement from Saudi Arabia.].

The USA National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Centre reports
included as item [3] in the monthly Prion Disease Updates state that:
"...3 cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to
infection occurring in the United Kingdom and in Saudi Arabia in the
other."

By international agreement, vCJD attribution is based on the country
where the case is diagnosed. Saudi Arabia has one case of vCJD and
disputes disease attribution for 2 additional cases, one Canadian case
reported in March of this year [2011], and an earlier American case
included in this report. To date, no source information has been
provided by Canadian, American or international authorities to the
Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health that links either case to our country.
Until such time as data are provided to us and formally vetted by
neutral international authorities, disease attribution by ProMED-mail,
should follow international convention.

[5] HPA - Appendix survey analysis

Interim data from the current national survey of abnormal prion
prevalence in archived appendix specimens
-----------------------------------------
[The Appendix Study is an unlinked anonymous survey coordinated by the
Health Protection Agency with immunohistochemical testing being
conducted at 2 collaborating laboratories: the Department of
Neurodegenerative Diseases at the UCL Institute of Neurology and the
Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency. Approximately 20 000
samples will be from individuals born between 1961 and 1985 and 10 000
from those born between 1941 and 1960.]

Interim data from the unlinked anonymous survey of the prevalence of
abnormal prion protein using archived appendix tissue show that 4
samples have tested positive for disease-associated prion protein
(PrPCJD) out of 13 878 suitable specimens examined (288 per million -
95 percent Confidence Interval (CI): 79 to 738 per million).

Using the information collected by the National CJD Research and
Surveillance Unit [see part (1) above] on the 176 variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) cases to date, it is possible to
conclude that all 4 appendices found positive in this survey have NOT
come from known vCJD cases. Codon 129 analysis of the 4 positive
specimens is underway at the MRC Prion Unit. [Excluding a small survey
of tonsils reported in 2004 , the available data on the prevalence of
PrPCJD in Britain is tabulated in the original text (available by
accessing the original document via the source URL)].

The ACDP TSE Risk Assessment Sub-Group has considered the interim data
from the current appendix survey and concluded that the results for
the 1961 to 1985 birth cohort "essentially reproduce" the results for
the earlier survey published in 2004. Also, 2 of the 4 positives to
date in the survey that is underway were in the 1941 to 1960 birth
cohort (641 infections per million population - 95 percent CI
78-2314), so it is possible prevalence could be higher in the 1941 to
1960 birth cohort compared to the 1961 to 1985 birth cohort (186
infections per million population - 95 percent CI 23-671).

The Sub-Group concluded that: "The precautionary (and maybe most
likely) scenario is that all those with signs of infection in tissue
would have infective blood. So although the contrary assumption could
help explain the small number of blood-borne cases to date, relying on
this would be problematic. Unless there is evidence to the contrary,
abnormal prion protein in tissues can be regarded as a proxy measure
for infectivity in blood."

The earlier study of appendix and some tonsil tissue, from operations
conducted between 1995 and 1999, found 3 positive samples out of 12
674 tested for PrPCJD using the IHC method [4]. The prevalence
estimate calculated from this study was 237 per million (95 percent
CI: 49-692 per million) or 380 per million (95 percent CI=80-1120 per
million) in 20-30 year olds, since all the PrPCJD positive individuals
were in this age group [The tabulated data can be viewed by accessing
the original text via the source URL].

In April 2008, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC)
considered available data from the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive
(NATA) [6]. At that time, no PrPCJD positive samples had been found in
nearly 55 000 samples, analysed by a high throughput enzyme
immunoassay technique, including about 11 000 samples from the 1961 to
1985 birth cohort. Statistical analysis of the data from the completed
appendix survey and NATA showed that, because of the wide confidence
intervals around both prevalence estimates, the data sets were
statistically consistent with each other. However, should the lack of
PrPCJD positive samples from NATA continue as more samples are
collected and analysed, the 2 data sets will at some stage become
discrepant. Subsequently, through applying the immunohistochemistry
technique to the tonsils from the 1961 to 1985 birth cohort, one
specimen with a single strongly positive follicle was found, leading
to the conclusion that there was "no or one v-CJD positive individual"
in this group.

In the face of continued uncertainty over possible discrepant results
between both prevalence surveys, together with the urgency to resolve
this uncertainty as quickly as possible, SEAC advised that, provided
appendix samples were collected from the appropriate birth cohort
(1941 to 1960 and 1961 to 1985), and these samples were tested using
the same immunohistochemistry technique as used in the previous
appendix tissue study, the data from such a study could be combined
with the previous study [6]. This would allow further refinement of
the current estimates for the prevalence of subclinical infections.

[6] ALS a prion disease
Date: Tue 20 Sep 2011
Source: PrioNet Canada [abridged & edited]
http://www.prionetcanada.ca/detail.aspx?menu=12&dt=293797&app=70&cat1=211&tp=12&lk=no


A team of researchers from the University of British Columbia (BC) and
the Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute have found a key link
between prions and the neurodegenerative disease ALS (Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The discovery
is significant as it opens the door to novel approaches to the
treatment of ALS.

A pivotal paper published by the team this week in the Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), demonstrates that the SOD1
protein (superoxide dismutase 1), which has been shown to be
implicated in the ALS disease process, exhibits prion-like properties.
The researchers found that SOD1 participates in a process called
template-directed misfolding. This term refers to the coercion of one
protein by another protein to change shape and accumulate in large
complexes in a fashion similar to the process underlying prion
diseases.

These findings provide a molecular explanation for the progressive
spread of ALS through the nervous system, and highlight the central
role of the propagation of misfolded proteins in the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.

"Our work has identified a specific molecular target, which when
manipulated halts the conversion of the SOD1 protein to a misfolded,
disease-causing form," says Dr. Neil Cashman, Scientific Director of
PrioNet Canada, Canada Research Chair in Neurodegeneration and Protein
Misfolding at UBC, and academic director of the Vancouver Coastal
Health ALS Centre. "This discovery is a 1st-step toward the
development of targeted treatments that may stop progression of ALS."

ALS is a progressive neuromuscular disease in which nerve cells die,
resulting in paralysis and death. Approximately 500 to 3000 Canadians
currently live with this fatal disease, for which there is no
effective treatment yet.

"For many years, ALS has remained a complex puzzle, and we have found
a key piece to help guide the research community to solutions," says
Dr. Leslie Grad, a co-1st author of the project and current Manager of
Scientific Programs at PrioNet Canada. "PrioNet is further exploring
this discovery through newly-funded research projects."

The work was completed by Dr. Neil Cashman's lab at the Brain Research
Centre based at the University of British Columbia and the Vancouver
Coastal Health Research Institute, in collaboration with researchers
at the University of Alberta. The research was supported by PrioNet
Canada and in part by Amorfix Life Sciences and the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research.

PrioNet Canada, based in Vancouver, has achieved international
attention for scientific discoveries and risk management strategies
directed at controlling prion diseases and is now directing capacity
into therapeutic solutions for prion-like diseases of aging, such as
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and ALS.

[The paper referred to in the preceding press release above is
entitled: Intermolecular transmission of superoxide dismutase 1
misfolding in living cells, by Leslie I. Grada and 9 others, Published
in the Proceedings of the Academy of Sciences online before print in
19 Sept 2011, doi:10.1073/pnas.1102645108
http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/09/13/1102645108.abstract.

The Abstract reads as follows: "Human wild-type superoxide dismutase-1
(wtSOD1) is known to coaggregate with mutant SOD1 in familial
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS), in double transgenic models of
FALS, and in cell culture systems, but the structural determinants of
this process are unclear. Here we molecularly dissect the effects of
intracellular and cell-free obligately misfolded SOD1 mutant proteins
on natively structured wild-type SOD1. Expression of the enzymatically
inactive, natural familial ALS SOD1 mutations G127X and G85R in human
mesenchymal and neural cell lines induces misfolding of wild-type
natively structured SOD1, as indicated by: acquisition of
immunoreactivity with SOD1 misfolding-specific monoclonal antibodies;
markedly enhanced protease sensitivity suggestive of structural
loosening; and nonnative disulfide-linked oligomer and multimer
formation. Expression of G127X and G85R in mouse cell lines did not
induce misfolding of murine wtSOD1, and a species restriction element
for human wtSOD1 conversion was mapped to a region of sequence
divergence in loop II and beta-strand 3 of the SOD1 beta-barrel
(residues 24-36), then further refined surprisingly to a single
tryptophan residue at codon 32 (W32) in human SOD1. Time course
experiments enabled by W32 restriction revealed that G127X and
misfolded wtSOD1 can induce misfolding of cell-endogenous wtSOD1.
Finally, aggregated recombinant G127X is capable of inducing
misfolding and protease sensitivity of recombinant human wtSOD1 in a
cell-free system containing reducing and chelating agents; cell-free
wtSOD1 conversion was also restricted by W32. These observations
demonstrate that misfolded SOD1 can induce misfolding of natively
structured wtSOD1 in a physiological intracellular milieu, consistent
with a direct protein-protein interaction."

[Prions are "misfolded" proteins, the infectious, aggregating agents
in diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, chronic
wasting disease (CWD) in deer and elk and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), also known as "mad cow‚" disease in cattle. In
ALS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, the misfolded proteins are SOD1,
beta-amyloid, and alpha-synuclein, respectively.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig 's
disease in the United States and motor neuron disease (MND) in Europe,
is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by deterioration of motor
neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Individuals living with the
disease experience progressive paralysis, as well as difficulty
breathing or swallowing. At this time, no cure or effective treatment
exists.

Recent research highlights links between the biological mechanisms of
common neurological disorders, such as ALS, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's disease with prion disease. While each of these diseases
manifests itself in a different way, the hallmark of each is a
progressive accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates in the
central nervous system. - Mod.CP]
