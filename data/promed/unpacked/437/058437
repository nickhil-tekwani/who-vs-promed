[To correct the initial posting in this thread, drinking water, however
unsafe, will not transmit yaws.
Yaws transmission is strictly person-to-person and is associated with scant
clothing and lack of soap. It does not usually occur in outbreaks; it is
endemic in some regions, mostly remote areas. A campaign in the 1950Â´s
virtually eradicated yaws through mass treatment with long-acting
penicillin (usually aluminum monoestearate penicillin, an earlier version
of benzathine penicillin).
New Guinea is probably one of the last (and only) places where yaws is
found [periodically.
