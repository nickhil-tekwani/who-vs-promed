West Nile Virus Antibodies Found in Non-migratory Birds in the UK
--------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus, which has killed more than 188 people in the US so far
this year, may be present in UK birds, say scientists. However, so far,
there have been no cases of the disease caught in this country, say
experts. Oxford University researchers have found antibodies in
nonmigratory birds in the UK, which suggest the presence of the virus.
West Nile virus is normally transmitted by mosquitoes, which suck the blood
of infected birds then feed on humans. The risk of human-to-human
transmission is thought to be low. It is uncertain whether the limited
mosquito population even in warmer areas of the UK could support a
widespread West Nile virus outbreak. Doctors have been warned to report
cases in which patients display suspicious symptoms. Previous cases of the
illness have occurred only in people returning from areas in which the
disease is widespread.
The spread of the virus through bird populations in the US has caused
widespread public concern in recent years. At the present time, since its
arrival in New York in 1999, 38 states have experienced cases. So far this
year, hundreds of cases have been identified, and 188 people have died.
Most vulnerable are people who are over the age of 50 or already suffering
a serious illness.
The findings from the Oxford-based Centre for Ecology and Hydrology
[formerly the NERC Institute of Virology] are due to be published in a
scientific journal shortly. A spokesman for the Department of Health said
it would study the report at that point. The Public Health Laboratory
Service, which monitors the rates of infectious disease in the UK, is
already asking doctors to send reports of any patients with encephalitis or
viral meningitis. The symptoms of both of these appear similar to West Nile
virus.
So far, it says, no blood samples from these patients have proved positive
for West Nile virus. A spokesman told the BBC: "We have been warning
doctors about this for some time. It is more a traveller's illness in
people coming back from the US."
