Department of Defense anthrax update: Italy added to list
---------------------------------------------------------
That makes 85 labs around the world in 5 countries, 20 US states and the District of Columbia. The [US] Department of Defense [DoD] has increased the number of government-run and private labs that have received live anthrax to 85, and Italy has been added to the list of countries that have received the virus.

The countries that have received live anthrax samples are Canada, Italy, Britain, South Korea, and Australia. At home [United States], labs in 20 states and the District of Columbia have received live anthrax from the Dugway Army facility in Utah.

The DoD is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its investigation of the shipments, and is conducting an internal investigation into DoD laboratory procedures. That internal investigation has concluded and will be released to the public after it is digested by Pentagon leadership, according to defense spokesman Captain Jeff Davis. "There is a review. The review is done. They're in the process of going through and digesting what that says," Davis told reporters at the Pentagon on Wednesday [8 Jul 2015]. "And we do expect, at some point in the near future, perhaps next week, that you'll see some sort of results of that review."

[In all the fuss and flap about this, I think that many people forget that outreach programmes such as this by Dugway result in productive exchanges of information. Quiet questions can be asked, and answers compared. - Mod.MHJ]
