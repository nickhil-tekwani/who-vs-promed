Angola: Marburg Virus Disease - WHO Update 5
--------------------------------------------
As of Thu 31 Mar 2005, 140 cases of Marburg virus disease have been
reported in Angola. Of these, 132 have been fatal. Cases continue to be
concentrated in Uige.
Mobile surveillance teams in Uige continue to follow up on rumours and
conduct active searches for additional cases. Contact tracing has also been
intensified. These activities are now supported by a mobile laboratory in
Uige, which has greatly expedited diagnostic testing.
WHO is working with the Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of
Congo to train local staff in the border area near Angola in case detection
and management.

Angola: Marburg Disease Outbreak is the Deadliest Ever
------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola has claimed 127 [now
132 -- see above] lives, the highest number of fatalities ever recorded
from the rare deadly disease, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on
Fri 1 Apr 2005.
In a statement, the United Nations agency also said it was sending more
experts to Angola at the weekend, including a medical anthropologist to
teach about preventing the spread of the virus during traditional burial
practices. The WHO has deployed 20 experts to help combat the viral
hemorrhagic fever, characterized by headaches, nausea, vomiting and bloody
diarrhea. It is spread through close contact with bodily fluids including
saliva and perspiration.
Since October there have been 132 cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever,
causing 127 deaths, mainly in Angola's northern Uige province. A
15-year-old boy who died on 20 Mar 2005 is the only known victim in the
capital Luanda, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a briefing. "This is the
largest number of fatalities ever recorded during an outbreak of this rare
but extremely severe disease," the WHO said. The previous record was 123
deaths among 149 cases during an epidemic from late 1998-2000 in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Most victims were gold miners.
The WHO is also sending a further 500 kilos (1100 lbs) of protective
equipment to protect hospital workers and other front-line staff in Angola.
"Marburg can be controlled if people are put in isolation and their
contacts are traced," Chaib said.
Health officials were also tracing travelers rumored to have been exposed
to the disease in Angola, including 9 people now isolated in hospital in
Italy, according to the WHO spokeswoman. Tests on two travelers who went
from Angola to Portugal showed they did not have the disease, she added.

Suspected Marburg Fever Cases in Democratic Republic of Congo and Italy
---------------------------------------------------
Italian hospital staff have put 9 patients in isolation after they had been
suspected of having contact with Marburg virus, the World Health
Organisation (WHO) stated on Fri 1 Apr 2005. A WHO spokesperson, Fadela
Chaib, said 2 other suspected cases had been reported in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), across the border from the north Angola area where
the outbreak began and has claimed 127 lives out of 132 cases.
"9 people who were in contact with an ill person have been isolated in an
Italian hospital," Chaib said, without giving details of in which town or
the nationality the suspected fever patients. Last week, an Italian
paediatrician died of haemorrhagic fever in Angola, according to Medici con
Africa, the relief organisation for which she worked. The WHO was unable to
say whether the 9 patients in Italy had been in touch with this woman.
The death toll of 127 out of the 132 people who contracted Marburg fever in
an outbreak that started 6 months ago in the north of Angola came from data
released by the WHO on Fri 1 Apr 2005. Angolan authorities on Thu 31 Mar
2005 officially put the toll from the virus at 126, the world's highest, as
Canada sent a mobile laboratory to help investigate suspected cases. The
epicentre of the outbreak is Angola's northern Uige province.

Angola: Marburg Virus Reaches a Fourth Province - Kwanza Norte
--------------------------------------------------------------
Marburg virus has reached a 4th province in Angola, bringing the nationwide
toll from the Ebola-like disease to 130, Angola's Health Ministry and the
World Health Organisation said on Fri 1 Apr 2005. "By Thu 31 Mar 2005 a
total of 137 cases, 130 of them fatal, have been recorded," the joint
commission monitoring the epidemic said in a daily briefing document,
adding that the virus had spread to Kwanza Norte province east of the
capital. The official death toll from the disease had stood at 126 on
Thursday, since the worst global outbreak of the virus started 6 months ago.
3 more deaths have been recorded in the province surrounding the capital
Luanda, in Kwanza Norte province and in Uige -- the northern province which
has been worst hit by the virus. No details were available about a 4th
death. The case in Kwanza Norte was recorded in the town of Camabatela,
which lies 85km south of Uige and 300km east of the coastal capital. The
health ministry called on the population to help control the epidemic by
alerting the authorities of any deaths in the home. It also urged people
not to touch the bodies of the deceased and to keep the authorities
informed about individuals who may have been contact with the sick.
A severe form of haemorrhagic fever akin to Ebola, Marburg virus was first
identified in 1967. It spreads on contact with the fluids the body produces
in reaction to it, such as blood, urine, excrement, vomit and saliva. The
Marburg outbreak has claimed a record number of lives, overtaking the
earlier peak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola's neighbour.
The WHO is to send medical reinforcements to Angola over the weekend to
help cope with the crisis. The commission tackling the Angolan epidemic
comprises WHO specialists, as well as experts from Medecins sans
Frontieres, and from the US-based Centers for Disease Control.

Angola: Further Comment on the Unusual Age Distribution of Cases
----------------------------------------------------------------
To extend on Dan Bausch's hypothesis of an iatrogenic explanation for the
unusual age distribution in the current Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak
[see ProMED-mail post: "Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (11): age
distribution 20050331.0935]: In addition to in-hospital transmission, the
teams in the field may wish to investigate 2 other possibilities for
iatrogenic transmission: (1) invasive outreach activities like vaccination
and (2) traditional medical practices like scarification, provided they
target children.

[In summary, the death toll in the current Marburg hemorrhagic fever
outbreak in Angola now exceeds that of the previous highest outbreak total
recorded in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1998-2000. As of Thu 31 Mar
2005, there have been 9 fewer cases but 9 more deaths in Angola. 2
suspected cases have been reported from the adjacent Democratic Republic of
Congo and 9 suspected cases of unknown provenance hospitalised in Italy. -
