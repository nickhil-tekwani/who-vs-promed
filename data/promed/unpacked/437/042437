"Worrying and dangerous" threat of yellow rust strain
-----------------------------------------------------
More than half the winter wheat acreage in the ground during 2010 will be
susceptible to yellow rust. Of those varieties, nearly 60 per cent are
expected to be susceptible to the new Solstice yellow rust race which
became widespread last season. NIAB's [National Institute of Agricultural
Botany] Rosemary Bayles said the industry had an unusual situation with
such high susceptibility to yellow rust in winter wheat. "It is a worrying
and potentially dangerous situation," she said.

The striking feature is the change in varieties' resistance ratings to
yellow rust, with a substantial number having disease ratings cut by 4 or 5
points [out of 10 for complete resistance]. The number of yellow rust
isolates in 2009 had risen significantly, although testing for the year had
not been completed. "The suggestion is that 80 per cent of isolates tested
in 2009 could turn out to be virulent," said Dr Bayles. Varieties with
lower ratings may be susceptible to some rust races.

Despite the enormous number of pathogens in existence, the main yellow rust
races could be grouped into either the Robigus, Original V6, or new
Solstice types. Varieties such as Solstice, Viscount, and Qplus showed
resistance to earlier yellow rust types, but not to the new Solstice type.

"The safest option will be to grow varieties with high resistance ratings
as companions to susceptible varieties. A diversification scheme will be
produced to assist in spreading the risk from one variety to another,
including disease control strategies and planning fungicide programmes
accordingly," Bayles said.

Yellow rust will strike
-----------------------
All winter wheat varieties previously susceptible to one of the 2 main
races of yellow rust are also susceptible to the new "Solstice" strain,
NIAB analysis has found. In addition, 4 varieties that were resistant to
the Robigus and original V6 races, are also susceptible. But other
varieties were resistant to all 3 races, according to Rosemary Bayles of NIAB.

"The Solstice race is virulent on 4 key varietal yellow rust resistances,"
she told advisers. Previous races could only overcome [one] or 2 of those
resistances. Nearly 60 percent of the 2010 wheat crop was susceptible to
the Solstice race, which she was certain would "dominate" in 2010.

Winter weather would determine the severity of any outbreak, Jonathan
Blake, ADAS [Agricultural Development and Advisory Service], said. "It is
not a case of will it strike, but how quickly," he warned. Last year there
had been a significant epidemic despite a colder winter that would usually
reduce inoculum, he noted. "Does that mean the new race has increased
aggressiveness? If it does it has implications on how to manage crops in
the future. But most fungicides are pretty good against yellow rust.
Choosing the right moment to start and the correct interval between
treatments might be [equal to] or more important than product choice."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow leaf stripes
and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. It affects
wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses.
Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season.
Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge" providing
inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer
crops. Monitoring programmes are important to recognise emerging new strains.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and are also
suspected to emerge in China. In the UK, recent outbreaks of stripe rust
are thought to be due to at least one new fungal strain. According to the
reports above, the new race appears to have increased virulence as well as
greater survival fitness, which would markedly increase the risk posed by
stripe rust to cereal producers.
