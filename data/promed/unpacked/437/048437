A batch of olives produced in Italy has been withdrawn from sale in
the UK after 2 people in Helsinki, Finland, were diagnosed with
botulism. Both people reported having eaten Gaudiano Organic Olives
Stuffed with Almonds. Lab tests confirmed that the jar from which they
had eaten the olives contained botulinum toxin. The tainted olives
were in 314 ml glass jars with a 'best before' date of 09/2012.

Olives from the implicated batch were distributed to one company in
the UK, Greencity Wholefoods of Glasgow, which took delivery of 40
jars. They were imported into the UK in September 2010. These were
sold on to a number of smaller retailers and caterers. None of the
affected batch remains on sale.

No cases of botulism have been reported in the UK linked to this
product. Consumers who purchased Gaudiano Organic Olives Stuffed with
Almonds (Product of Italy; Best before 09/2012), should not consume
the product and instead dispose of them.

The Food Standards Agency was notified of this food incident through
the European food alert system (RASFF) and has been working with the
local authority and the business involved to ensure the product is
withdrawn from sale.

[Specifics regarding the Finnish cases of botulism are not included in
this report. As a commercial product, there is more concern regarding
further cases of the neuro-intoxication from the olives. The posting
does not state if the olives were distributed to other countries. -
