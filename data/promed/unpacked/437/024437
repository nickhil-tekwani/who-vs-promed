Measles outbreak in Metro Vancouver tied to global travel
---------------------------------------------------------
A number of Lower Mainland residents have gone to hospitals with
measles virus symptoms in the past month, public health officials
said Tuesday [28 Mar 2010].

"Several have been hospitalized and more assessed in emergency rooms
or by their primary-care physician," said public health official Dr.
Monika Naus, without being specific about the number and location of
hospitals where cases were treated.

Of the 14 cases of measles in the Lower Mainland, 8 are associated
with one household of unvaccinated family members who were exposed by
out-of-country visitors, the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control (BCCDC) reported Tuesday. A 15th case has been identified in
the British Columbia (B.C.) Interior, in an individual who returned
home from India. None of the 10 lab-confirmed and 4 suspect cases
have been among people who had 2 doses of vaccine, which is needed
for full protection. Of the cases so far, some of the individuals
were not immunized, some had partial vaccination history and others
did not know their status.

Although measles is considered highly infectious, public health
officials believe the risk to the general population during the
current outbreak is low because 76 percent of B.C. children have
received 2 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The 1st
dose is given after the 1st birthday and the 2nd dose at about 18
months of age. Naus, medical director of immunization programs at the
BCCDC, said it's difficult to know how the earliest cases began but 2
genetic types have been identified from the cases so far, indicating
separate importations.

"The early ones are the H1 genotype, which currently originate in the
Western Pacific region. The later one is D8, which is active in India
and elsewhere," she said. As to how the B.C. residents became
infected, she said: "We don't know how they became infected but
suspect that they were infected by visitors to Vancouver. Measles
rates in North America and Western Europe are extremely low while
elsewhere they are higher. "We will likely never know who the sources
of the measles infections were; they're likely long gone."

The cases circulating in B.C. show the effect of international travel
patterns on infectious disease outbreaks. These cases show that with
global travel, even a vaccine-preventable disease "is only an
airplane ride away," Naus said.

Measles outbreak in Lower Mainland
----------------------------------
The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) is asking
health-care professionals and the public to be alert for measles
after several people in the Lower Mainland were recently diagnosed
with the disease.

In the past 2 weeks, 10 laboratory-confirmed and 4 suspect cases of
measles have been identified in the Lower Mainland of British
Columbia, including an out-of-province visitor. Of the 14 cases, 8
are associated with a single household with unvaccinated members. It
is suspected that at least 2 out-of-country visitors brought measles
into Vancouver sometime in February or early March [2010], as 2
separate strains of the virus have been identified. Susceptible
people exposed to these imported cases would have developed measles
by now if infected. Several cases have occurred because the 1st B.C.
cases spread the infection to others. A separate case of measles has
also been confirmed in the same time period in a returning traveller
from India coming home to the Interior of B.C.

None of the cases identified to date had 2 doses of measles vaccine,
which is needed for full protection. Many were unimmunized because of
philosophical objections, and some had a history of only receiving a
single dose of measles vaccine or did not know their immunization
status. Overall the risk for the general population remains very low
because most children routinely receive the vaccine between their 1st
and 2nd birthdays. "Most years, we see no cases of measles in B.C.
because our vaccination rates are high," said Dr. Monika Naus,
immunization director for the BCCDC. "Nevertheless, these cases show
that with global travel, even a vaccine-preventable disease -- as
rare as measles is now in Canada -- is still only an airplane ride away."

Measles is a highly contagious viral illness spread through airborne
contact with the virus. The illness begins with a fever, runny nose
and cough. Several days later, a rash appears around the face and
then spreads to the chest and limbs. The eyes may be red and very
sensitive to light. Anyone who suspects they have measles should
immediately contact their doctor by telephone 1st or call the
HealthLink BC. "Measles is particularly contagious," said Naus. "So
contagious that people with measles should avoid exposing others,
especially in medical waiting rooms and emergency rooms." Physicians
are required to immediately report suspected cases of measles to
public health authorities.

Current guidelines for vaccination against measles are that people
born after 1956 should have 2 doses of measles containing vaccine.
The vaccine is available as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine
and usually given to children at the 1st birthday and at 18 months of
age. In 1996, B.C. took part in a nationwide campaign to eliminate
measles by giving a dose of measles-containing vaccine to all
children starting as young as 18 months and adolescents through high
school, including offering the vaccine to college/university
students. Subsequently a routine 2nd dose was added to the
immunization schedule.

The message is simple as how best to avoid the disease: get
immunized. "Whether it's measles, mumps, rubella, or a host of other
vaccine-preventable diseases for which we have vaccines, the best
thing anyone can do is to make sure that their vaccinations are
up-to-date," continued Naus. "Two doses of measles vaccine are 99
percent effective against the disease. Those are pretty good odds.
The vaccine is especially recommended for school children,
post-secondary students, health-care workers and travellers, but also
for anyone born after 1956."

Measles can cause serious and sometimes permanent health problems. It
often causes an ear infection or pneumonia. One person in every 1000
with measles has an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).
Encephalitis can lead to convulsions, deafness or permanent mental
disability. One person in every 3000 with measles may die of complications.
