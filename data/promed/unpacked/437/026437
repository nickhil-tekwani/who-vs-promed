An anthrax outbreak occurred on 2 Apr 2016 in the partido [county] of Gonzales Chavez, Province of Buenos Aires, in a herd grazing a natural Campos pasture and where there had been a previous outbreak in 2014.

The herd involved 300 Aberdeen Angus cattle, and one bull and one heifer died suddenly and without any sanginous extravasation (loss of blood from the natural openings of the body). The owner claimed to have vaccinated the animals (120) previously and provided the necessary certificate.

The carcasses were processed in the standard "Trapado Controlado" manner after being sprayed with 5% formaldehyde [The TC method involves covering the carcasses with lime and a large tarpaulin weighted down along its edges, and the bones and hides are recovered about 9 months later for disposal]. Gonzales Chavez is part of the surveillance area for rural anthrax in the province and is one of 30 such partidos which have demonstrated a measure of anthrax enzooticity over the years since 1977.

The Argentines are working hard to eradicate bovine anthrax, and, as in North Dakota, where the present problem is failure by individual ranchers to vaccinate their stock, this is complicated in Argentina by their vaccine not always providing the cover expected, as in this case. We have checked their vaccine, and it is by all appearances a standard Sterne, which should provide cover for at least 6 months and on up to 9 months. Why it sometimes fails evades explanation at this time, but most of the time, it works. - Mod.MHJ
