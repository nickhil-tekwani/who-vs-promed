Thirty-two single serum samples, collected in September from cases of
dengue-like illness in Western Samoa, were sent to the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research, Queensland Health, Brisbane
for investigation. Evidence of recent dengue infection was detected in 28
of them. Dengue-2 virus was isolated from 20 sera and dengue-2 specific
IgM was detected in 11 sera.
The similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the E/NS1 gene junction of
these isolates and isolates from an outbreak in the Cook Islands in early
1997 suggests that the virus may have been introduced from other Pacific
Island countries. Previous studies in collaboration with Dr. Eliane
Chungue, Institut Louis Malarde, demonstrated a close relationship between
dengue 2 isolates from French Polynesia, New Caledonia and the Cook
Islands, suggesting a common origin for these viruses.
Recent cases of dengue 2 infection have been detected in Fiji and molecular
studies are in progress with an isolate from Fiji.

[Thanks to Debbie and PACNET for keeping us apprised of the situation with
this up-to-date report. Such detailed studies appear to be the only way to
keep track of the movement of dengue viruses; this is the expensive _sine
qua non_ of molecular epidemiology. Maps of virus movements will be
interesting but the seemingly random movement of humans will continue to
confuse the issue. - Mod.CHC
