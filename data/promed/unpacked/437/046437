[1] Cholera, atypical El Tor strain - Guinea

The cholera that struck more than 7000 people in Guinea in 2012 was caused by a new generation of cholera strains, atypical variants of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor, epidemiologists have confirmed.

The new strains secrete a toxin more severe than usual strains, creating a more virulent illness, with harsher symptoms and a higher infection rate, according to cholera experts in the region.

The same types of strain are believed to be in Sierra Leone, where cholera affected 22 345 people in 2012. The bacteria are thought to have come to Guinea from Sierra Leone. For now, genetic sequencing has been done only on samples from Guinea; analysis of Sierra Leone samples is under way.

"This discovery of a atypical El Tor strain is worrying, as it confirms the advance of strains that are more severe and more contagious," said Stanislas Rebaudet, an epidemiologist at the university hospital of Marseilles, France, where the _Vibrio cholerae_ strain found in Guinea has been analysed with the support of the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). "This demands stronger prevention and response efforts."

Africa, West Africa in particular, is the only region of the world where cholera cases are steadily increasing.

Cholera experts say the strain isolated in Guinea was most likely recently imported and not lying dormant in the environment. "This tells us then that cholera is not an inevitability in this region," he told IRIN. He noted that this year's [2012] situation in Sierra Leone and neighboring Guinea demonstrates the importance of cross-border collaboration.

Scientists are continuing their analyses in a bid to identify the source of the strain, epidemiologist Rebaudet says. This type of strain was present in Zimbabwe in 2009, in the Lake Chad Basin in 2009, and is also found in Haiti currently.

[2] Diarrhea, cholera - Zimbabwe

Cases of diarrhea are on the increase in Zimbabwe owing to the deteriorating sanitation conditions in the country, Health and Child Welfare minister Henry Madzorera has said. Giving an update on the outbreaks of typhoid, cholera, and diarrheal diseases in Harare on Tuesday [4 Dec 2012], the minister said the majority of cases and deaths had been recorded among children under the age of 5.

Madzorera said it would be difficult with the high number of diarrhoea cases to meet the United Nations' Millennium Development Goal number 4 and urged communities to take caution during the rainy season. "As we approach the critical period which will coincide with the festive season, I remind all Zimbabweans to take extra caution to avoid falling victim to typhoid, cholera and other enteric diseases," he said.

"The determinants of these preventable, but highly transmissible and fatal diseases remain largely unaddressed in that sustained provision of adequate and safe water is not guaranteed for both urban and rural communities. Sewerage and solid waste is also poorly processed and managed in all the major urban areas."

Statistics presented by Madzorera showed that there were 6000 cases of diarrhea in 2010, increasing to 10 000 in 2011, while in 2012, 12 500 cases had been recorded.

Among the key drivers of the outbreaks are unregulated food vending, poor personal and community hygiene, poor solid waste management, sewerage bursts, and shortages of household water.

[3] Diarrhea, fatal - Somalia (Lower Shabelle Region)

Reports from the Lower Shabelle region in southern Somalia say that an outbreak of diarrhea has produced deaths in different small communities in the region. Outbreaks of diarrhea have been reported in the communities of Dudumo gadud, Madax Marodi, Sahan weyn, Saha Yarey, and other larger communities like Yaqbari weyne and Yaqdomar, all in the Lower Shabelle region.

Residents in those parts of the province who spoke to local media said the outbreak can related to the extreme warm weather, which comes at this part of the season.

According to residents in those areas plagued by the diarrhea, there are no medical centers where the affected patients can seek treatment for the disease, which is easy to cure, but without medical help can otherwise be deadly.

[Fatalities associated with outbreaks of diarrheal illness can suggest cholera as the cause, but in a setting with no medical care, fatalities certainly can occur with other etiologies.

[4] Cholera - Sierra Leone (Southern Province)
Date: Fri 14 Dec 2012

http://www.awoko.org/2012/12/14/cholera-still-in-bo/


The cholera outbreak in Sierra Leone has so far from 16 Jul 2012 to 5 Dec 2012 affected about 633 lives in the district of Bo.

Among this total, 297 are males and 386 are females. Among the 297 males, 45 are under 5 years old, while 252 are above 5 years old. Among the 386 females, 47 are under 5, while 339 are above 5. Of the entire 633 total infected, only 27 died at the Bo Government Hospital, while the rest died either at their homes or while on the way to the hospital. This disclosure was made to Awoko by the Bo District Disease Survey officer John Kannie.

He explained that even the 27 deaths at the hospital were "most times due to the late responding and bringing in of the patients to the hospital." Among the 27 dead, 13 are males (2 deaths under 5 years old) and 14 (5 deaths under 5 years old) are females.

In addition, the Ministry of Health has contained the disease in the 16 chiefdoms of Bo, but with Valunya Chiefdom being the only challenge. "We are just getting new reports of the disease in Valunya chiefdom, but forensic investigation continues," Kannie said. This area, he explained, lacks good sanitation, like good toilet facilities, in almost all of the areas of suspected cases.

[5] Cholera, refugees - Burundi
Date: Mon 10 Dec 2012

Tens of thousands of refugees returning to Burundi are now at risk of a health disaster, as cases of cholera increase in their homeland. Burundi has been tackling a deadly cholera outbreak for 2 months, and as hundreds of refugees from Tanzania's Mtabila camp cross the border each day, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) fears that the large population movement may make things worse.

"So many people on the move significantly increases the risk of cholera and other diseases spreading to, and devastating, new communities," says Dr Ben Adeiza, Africa Zone health and care coordinator for the IFRC. "This has the potential of becoming a very serious issue."

The government of Tanzania announced the closure of the Mtabila refugee camp earlier in 2012. It was home to many Burundians who fled the country decades ago to escape a civil war. The 38 000 refugees due to be repatriated may be at an increased risk of contracting the diarrheal disease, as many do not have homes to return to, and most will have poor access to water and sanitation facilities.

Burundi's government declared a cholera outbreak and a health disaster in October 2012. The disease has infected hundreds of people and has killed at least one person. The number of people affected has been especially high in those areas that are receiving returnees, particularly Nyanza-Lac and Makamba districts.

These atypical El Tor strains referred to in the Guinea post above have been discussed in this forum previously while being referred to as the Matlab variants, which were observed initially in strains isolated between 1991 and 1994 in Matlab, Bangladesh (1). Analysis suggested that these variants were derived from the El Tor biotype, but they harbored certain genes of the classical biotype. Similar strains have been found in Mozambique and, indeed, have also been linked in part to the Hispaniola outbreak of cholera in Haiti. An excellent review of the field can be found in reference 2.

As a review, although there are over 200 O antigen serogroups of _V. cholerae_, only O1 and O139 appear to have the potential to cause epidemics of cholera. The O1 strains can be divided into 2 biotypes based on phenotypic differences, classical and El Tor. The phenotypic differences include sheep red blood cell hemolysis, agglutination of chicken red blood cells, Voges-Proskauer reaction, and the sensitivities or lack of to polymyxin B and specific phages. Classical biotype is generally more severe, with a higher percentage of symptomatic infections but generally less efficient person-to-person spread.
