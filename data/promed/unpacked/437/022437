The UK newspaper the Daily Mail reported yesterday [3 Sep 2018] that at least 60 British tourists have had to undergo intravenous antibiotic treatment during the current year [2018] after suffering from _Salmonella_ infections while in Cuba. All these tourists became infected after staying in hotel facilities on the island and reported that hygiene conditions around food were not the best. "There were always flies flying over the food; the meat and fish were on the buffet tables raw and without any refrigeration to preserve them," reported interviewed travelers.

Almost all the tourists were affected after staying in the same facility, the Hotel Playa Pesquero de Holguin. At this hotel, 2 weeks ago [around 21 Aug 2018], an English couple who was there to celebrate their wedding and spend their honeymoon lived a nightmare, as, after paying USD 5000 for the event and services, the bride was hospitalized for 5 days and 4 guests became ill from the same _Salmonella_ outbreak.

The complaint was reported by the British media after comments on social networks showed a massive outbreak of food poisoning where everyone agreed that they had been staying in the same all-inclusive hotel, which carries a 4-star rating. Customer complaints were posted on the Facebook page of the Playa Pesquero hotel and confirmed by the same travel agency that organized the trips for these clients.

In the article, they explained that the travelers received free medical treatment, but they had to sign a discharge of responsibilities in which they were committed not to make public declarations on the matter or to establish later demands.

It is not the first time that these complaints have been reported because last year [2017] the news broke that a group of approximately 50 Canadian tourists were infected with _Salmonella_ after consuming food maintained in poor conditions at different hotels when staying in Varadero [beach, Cuba].

[It appears that the salmonellosis outbreak has been spread over most of 2018, which suggests continuing exposure of contaminated food. It is not known if the isolates over time are even the same subtype of _Salmonella enterica_. A similar cluster was reported on ProMED-mail in 2014 from the same hotel. - Mod.LL
