FBI Studies Anthrax: Intentional Release Suspected
--------------------------------------------------
Investigators searching for any link between terrorism and 2 cases of
exposures to deadly anthrax in Florida say the incidents were malicious but
not on a scale consistent with a terrorist attack. Federal authorities say
the anthrax spores responsible for the death of a Florida man were not
natural but rather a crude kind made in a laboratory. Identifying the
specific strain of bacteria could provide important leads to the source.
The FBI, now the lead agency in the anthrax probe, has combed through the
headquarters of American Media Inc., where the spores were found. But
traces have been found on only one keyboard, which had been used by a
63-year-old tabloid newspaper editor before he died last week.
The only other place spores have been discovered is in the nasal passages
of a colleague who worked in the building mailroom. That man, 73, is being
treated at a Miami-Dade County hospital. While investigators think a
terrorist attack would more likely have spread anthrax throughout the
entire building, they also say the strain of lab-made bacteria found almost
certainly rules out a lone crackpot. These spores could contain tell-tale
markers that lead investigators to a specific nation or even a laboratory.
U.S. officials - from President Bush on down to Palm Beach County health
officials - say they are taking the anthrax exposure incidents very
seriously. "Thus far it looks like it's a very isolated incident, but any,
any type of incident, any type of information that comes into our
government we take very seriously, because we understand we're dealing with
evil people," the President said today.
Of particular concern is the fact that Mohamed Atta, a suspected ringleader
of the Sept. 11 hijackings, had rented and flown planes out of an airfield
in nearby Lantana, Florida twice during August. Authorities told ABCNEWS
the FBI was running anthrax tests on every one of Atta's possessions they
can find, but preliminary field tests turned up nothing.
Whatever the source of the anthrax spores, the doctors of the deceased
Florida man say he received a huge dose, adding to the belief that he may
have received a package or letter at his desk. "The first look at his
spinal fluid was overwhelming," said Dr. Larry Bush. There was a large
amount of bacteria in the spinal fluid, which is never a good sign. It is a
sign of overwhelming infection."
The coworkers of the deceased Florida man today expressed outrage at what
they said was slow and inadequate federal government response, waiting 4
days to seal off the office building after the anthrax infection was
confirmed.

Link between anthrax, hijackers probed
----------------------------------------------
WEST PALM BEACH, Florida (CNN) -- Federal officials said Tuesday their
investigation into a deadly anthrax infection in Florida included a closer
look at forensic evidence gathered in the weeks since the September 11
terrorist attacks, especially items traced to the suspected hijackers, such
as luggage, documents, and cars.
Employees of American Media in Delray Beach, Florida, worked in temporary
locations Tuesday as law enforcement and health officials scoured their
building for evidence and for further traces of the bacteria. AMI's
building, which also includes offices for the National Enquirer and The
Globe, remained sealed. "The FBI tells us they hope to finish collecting
samples by about mid-day tomorrow," said Lt. Frank Montilli of Boca Raton
Fire-Rescue.
Officials have been working around the clock since Monday. Montilli said
his people have been in charge of decontaminating them as they leave the
building. The procedure includes scrubbing and hosing them down in their
white haz-mat (hazardous material) outfits.
Law enforcement sources said investigators were unable to match The Sun
strain of anthrax with any on record. The closest matches were a strain
from a goat and a strain manufactured in a laboratory. "As we've gathered
more information ... and since no one was sorting wool or tanning hides at
The Sun, it lowers the chance that it was a natural occurrence," said Dr.
Jeffrey Koplan, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta. "The evidence is stacking up that indicates it is not
environmental." Both men were affected by the same strain of the bacteria,
which was also the same strain found in trace elements on the computer
keyboard of the deceased man, Agwunobi said.
The FBI was looking into the possibility that anthrax could have gotten
into the building by mail, but sources in Washington said they had no
letter in their possession with traces of anthrax. Sources said
investigators were also checking into former and current employees who may
have had access to the building.
Law enforcement sources in Washington told CNN that investigators were
looking not only at forensic evidence in the AMI building but also at
evidence gathered in the weeks since the deadly September 11 terrorist
attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania. Investigators were
particularly checking items traced to the suspected hijackers -- luggage,
documents, cars -- for traces of anthrax.

A run on antibiotics as fearful public awaits anthrax test results
-------------------------------------------
Pharmacies were running low on an anthrax antibiotic Wednesday as the
public rushed to fill prescriptions as a precaution. There were no new
signs of the bacteria and officials said the strain that killed a Florida
man last week may be related to one isolated at an Iowa lab a half-century
ago. Joshua Lubitz, a pharmacist at an Eckerd drugstore, said he normally
distributes about 200 tablets of Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) per week. Since
Monday, he had dispensed 2500. "They want Cipro specifically for the threat
of the possibility of anthrax," Lubitz said. Another pharmacist said he ran
out on Tuesday. Bayer AG, Germany's biggest drug maker, said it will boost
production of Cipro to meet surging U.S. demand by reopening a plant. One
of the leading U.S. distributors of the antibiotic, McKesson HBOC, said it
has not encountered any shortages.
FBI investigators in white biohazard "moon suits" spent a third day
collecting evidence at the supermarket tabloid offices of the 2 men whose
exposure to anthrax has heightened terrorism fears across the country.
The Palm Beach County Health Department has ordered the American Media
building closed indefinitely while the investigation continues into where
the anthrax came from and whether it was deliberately released. There has
been no sign of anthrax anywhere in the country since authorities earlier
this week said traces were found on the computer keyboard of [a photo
editor who has died of the disease and in the nose of a mailroom co-worker.
The 63-year-old photo editor with The Sun, died last Friday of inhaled
anthrax, a rare and particularly lethal form of the disease. The
73-year-old mail worker was in good condition and was expected to be moved
out of intensive care soon. Florida health officials have said the bacteria
in [the deceased's blood responded to antibiotics, suggesting it was a
naturally occurring strain, rather than a laboratory-altered one.
A law enforcement official said on condition of anonymity that preliminary
work on the anthrax that killed [the photo editor has found a possible
match to a laboratory strain first isolated in Iowa. However, further tests
are being done. It is possible the bacteria originated from the so-called
Ames strain, which was isolated from an animal in the 1940s at Iowa State
University in Ames, but health officials didn't confirm that. The strain
has been widely used across the country as a standard for comparison by
scientists trying to determine whether a tissue sample contains anthrax.
The concern also spread to newsstands. American Media executives said they
had received phone calls from supermarket chains and tabloid readers who
were afraid they might come into contact with the bacteria while leafing
through the paper. AMI chief executive David Pecker cited the CDC in saying
there is no danger to the public from handling newspaper. The company's
tabloids, including The Sun, are not printed in Florida.
[Byline: Allen G. Breed
[I have been getting calls all day long about the possible identity of
these Florida isolates. A constant theme is a very senior Washington FBI
officer has identified the USDA/ARS facility but there is as yet zero
evidence provided for this statement. And secondly, if the "Ames" strain is
involved, it is a common strain in many research establishments, here and
abroad. At the same time, I have been very reliably informed that a senior
FBI officer gave a press briefing midday in Florida when he stated that the
Florida isolates had not been exactly matched with any known strains but
have been most closely matched to separate isolates from Haiti, Texas and
Iowa. This latter revelation would put the Florida isolates in the Western
North American group, while Ames is in the distant Sterne-Ames group. -

Anthrax in United States (State of Florida)
-------------------------------------------
WHO has received reports from the WHO Collaborating Centres, the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is working
closely with the Florida Department of Health, confirming one case of
pulmonary anthrax in a Florida man who died 5 Oct 2001. A second man, a
co-worker, presented himself to medical authorities who positively
identified anthrax bacteria in his nose. The two men worked at a local
newspaper office in Boca Raton, Florida. One of the many samples taken
from their workplace environment was positive for anthrax bacteria.
Final results from other environmental samples will not be available for
several days. Nonetheless, CDC assessed the risk to other employees and
visitors as extremely low. An epidemiological investigation on this
event is ongoing and WHO will continue to be updated.
Pulmonary or inhalational anthrax is very rare in the United States.
There were 18 reported cases in the 20th Century with the last case some
25 years ago. Anthrax is not contagious. Anthrax bacteria normally enter
the human species from infected animals or animal products, such as from
eating infected meat, or through occupational exposure, such as in
tannery workers. Symptoms of pulmonary anthrax include fever, muscle
aches, and fatigue that rapidly progress to severe systemic disease.
Antibiotic treatment before symptoms occur will prevent the disease.
Anthrax vaccines can prevent infection, but are not normally recommended
for the general public.
WHO Guidelines for the Surveillance and Control of Anthrax in Humans and
Animals are also available online.

This is an official CDC Health Advisory
-------------------------------------
Public Health Guidance for Anthrax Threat Letters or Packages
Recently, a number of individuals and organizations have received
envelopes or packages with letters indicating that "anthrax" was either
on the letter or in the envelope. Some of these envelopes may have
suspicious contents. CDC previously has issued guidance to help address
these events in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report: Bioterrorism
Alleging Use of Anthrax and Interim Guidelines for Management -- United
States, 1998. MMWR 1999:48 (no.4)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4804.pdf>.
Initial steps to assist in management of these incidents include:
1. Contact local law enforcement and the FBI field office and inform
them of the incident. A risk assessment for those persons involved in
the incident should be coordinated by the law enforcement personnel.
2. State and local health department officials and persons with
expertise in these areas also should be involved in the decision-making
process. Contact CDC through the 24-hour emergency notification system
(770 488-7100). This telephone number is staffed 24 hours a day by CDC
personnel; outside of regular working hours, staff from this office will
be paged to return your call. CDC will assist in contacting appropriate
federal and state health and law enforcement officials.
3. Decisions about the need for decontamination and initiation of
antibiotic prophylaxis should be made by health officials responsible
for the jurisdiction in which the incident occurs. In most
circumstances, the decision to initiate prophylaxis can be delayed until
the presence or absence of Bacillus anthracis is determined.
