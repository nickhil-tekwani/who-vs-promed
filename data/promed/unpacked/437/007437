Cassava disease to cause food shortage
--------------------------------------
The destructive cassava mosaic disease, which almost wiped out cassava
plants in Nigeria in the early 1970s, has resurfaced again in a more
vicious form. Experts have warned that the more virulent strain of the
cassava mosaic disease could wipe out entire crop in West Africa.

James Agba, International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), says
the disease threatens to wipe out the crop in Nigeria, Cameroon, Ghana and
Togo. "A diagnostic survey by our experts has detected the new strain of
the disease in West Africa" he said. "The disease combines features of
strains earlier discovered in West Africa and East Africa" he added.

Nigeria is currently the world leading producer of cassava and earns a lot
of foreign exchange from cassava export. This situation has created an
emergency response from agricultural experts in the country. IITA says it
has already started to counter the disease and would engage its expertise
to halt the spread.

"There is need to show some concern because cassava is very important in
the African food chain, so it has to be preserved and protected from the
destructive disease" said Adebisi Adurangba, an expert in agronomy.

[Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and strains
in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different
areas of Africa. Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between
strains have also been reported. Recombinant strains can be particularly
virulent, and the report above suggests that the new strain is due to
recombinations. CMD has triggered food emergencies in the past by
destroying cassava crops throughout the region. Symptoms include leaf
mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants.

The CMD viruses are spread by whitefly vectors. At least one of them
(_African Cassava Mosaic Virus_; ACMV) has been found in an alternative
host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host
reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Disease management
for begomoviruses usually relies on control of their vectors and pathogen
and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have proven
unsatisfactory in developing countries.

Because traditional cultivars are susceptible to the disease, varieties
resistant to different CMD strains are being developed for local use (for
example by IITA). This has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in
others the new varieties are being wiped out by _Cassava brown streak
virus_ (CBSV; more information via recent ProMED-mail post no. 20090416.1440).
