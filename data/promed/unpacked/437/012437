Malaysia: Selangor has the most cases in nation
-----------------------------------------------
The Selangor government is shifting its focus to the public to check the
dengue situation, as the state [of Selangor] has the largest number of
cases in the country. Public apathy towards the environment has been
identified as one of the main causes, said state executive councillor in
charge of health Datuk Tang See Hang. "It is the tidak apa [meaning,
variously, "no problem", "don't worry", or the "whatever" ubiquitous in the
United States] attitude. This must change," he said. He took the people to
task for not doing their part to keep the environment clean. Tang made the
comments after chairing a press conference on the state's dengue situation
at the Ampang Jaya Municipal Council in Pandan Indah yesterday.
A total of 9385 cases with 17 deaths had been reported in Selangor, as of
28 Dec 2002. A total of 29 615 cases had been reported in the country as of
14 Dec 2002. It was reported that there were 54 fatalities nationwide last
year. "This is the worst year when compared to the past 10 years, with the
figure increasing every year since then," said Tang. He said there was no
need to put the state on a "dengue alert" as they had an action plan. Tang
declined to elaborate on the plan, however, except to say that it included
educational programmes, fogging, awareness campaigns, and the participation
of the public and non-governmental organizations. "Our action plan will be
introduced immediately by the local authorities and the State Action
Committee on Dengue 2003 set up to address the problem."
On why Selangor had the largest number of cases in the nation, he said it
was also due to high population density and inconsistent weather. "It rains
on some days while it is dry on others. It is also partly caused by rapid
development and some construction projects," Tang said. "Houses situated
close to one other and movement of the people are the other factors."
It was reported that there were 4 cases in the Selayang Municipal Council
(MPS) jurisdiction and district of Gombak, 3 in the Sepang district, and 3
within the boundary of Subang Jaya Municipal Council.

Fiji: dengue virus type 1 outbreak in Suva and Lautoka
------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has confirmed an outbreak of dengue virus type 1 in
specific areas in Suva and Lautoka. Acting health permanent secretary Dr
Timaima Tuiketei said that, in the past few days, an outbreak in Suva has
seen 16 dengue cases reported from CWM (Colonial War Memorial) hospital and
Suva private hospital. She said the regions affected in Suva are mainly
within the Grantham Road-Laucala Bay road, [and]
Nasinu-Caubati-Narere-Nakasi areas. "The other areas in Fiji are still
under a dengue alert warning, and everyone should take heed of this caution."
Dr Tuiketei said the Ministry of Health has activated its dengue outbreak
task force with an action plan to respond and monitor the situation. These
include:
press releases with continuing public update on dengue outbreak information;
active community mobilization [...to...] strengthen clean-up campaigns with
localized spraying of identified affected areas;
strengthening of health promotion and dengue awareness messages in TV,
newspapers, and public radio broadcasts;
utilization of the Dengue Clinical Management guidelines for health personnel;
ongoing surveillance and monitoring of cases within [local] health services;
localized spraying in Suva areas commencing today, and next week a second
round of spraying in the identified areas in Lautoka and Labasa.
Dr Tuiketei said the government is providing FJD 40 000 [USD 19 860]
initially for these dengue outbreak activities. She said the World Health
Organization is asking everyone to clean up their own household and
compounds, workplaces, schools, and other areas in the community and
destroy all the potential mosquito breeding places and sources. "This is
everyone's responsibility, hence, we need to stop this dengue outbreak.
Collectively we can put a stop the outbreak."
The Ministry of Health has put out a dengue alert warning to all health
personnel and health facilities, all town and city councils, all rural
local authorities, and the public at large to strengthen the dengue
prevention awareness and control activities.
A total of 117 dengue cases were confirmed in 2002.
