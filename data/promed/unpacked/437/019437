It could very well be an accident, but a Colorado trout hatchery may have
spread whirling disease into New Mexico. New Mexico's Department of Fish
and Game is trying to match 800 infected rainbows from ranch ponds in
Colfax County. The whirling disease parasite is an epidemic in Colorado.
Whirling disease is not dangerous to humans, but curves fish spines so they
swim circles.
