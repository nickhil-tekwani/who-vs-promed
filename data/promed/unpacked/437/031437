Richard's Rubs & Seasonings LLC is recalling Richard's Too Good BBQ Sauce, Richard's Too Good Hot Sauce and Richard's Too Good Teriyaki Sauce because they may have been improperly processed and because they may have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, which can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal foodborne illness.

Foodborne botulism is a severe type of food poisoning caused by the ingestion of foods containing the potent neurotoxin formed during growth of the organism. Foodborne botulism can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

The recalled sauces were sold in western Washington [state] grocery stores and butcher shops in Kitsap, Snohomish and King counties. Sauces are packaged in 12 oz tall glass bottles with metal screw caps and black heat resistant tamper seals.

The products being recalled were distributed up to the date of 17 Jun 2014. This recall has been initiated because of a consumer complaint indicating that sauce may have been improperly processed. Richard's Rubs & Seasonings LLC has not been notified of any illness associated with their products.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
