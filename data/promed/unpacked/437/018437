Eight cases of cholera have been confirmed in the northern province of
Gilan, Iran. The deputy director for health affairs of Gilan Medical
University, Esmail Noursalehi, said that four patients have been
transferred to Tehran for treatment; two are under medical care in Rasht,
and two in Langeroud. Pamphlets have been published to increase public
awareness in order to prevent the disease from spreading.
