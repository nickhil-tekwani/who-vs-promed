Summary
-------
There were 24 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 14 Jun [2015] compared with 27 cases the previous week. In Guinea, 10 cases were reported from 4 prefectures (Boke, Conakry, Dubreka, and Forecariah). A total of 14 cases were reported from 2 districts (Kambia and Port Loko) in Sierra Leone.

Of 76 confirmed cases reported from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the 21 days to 14 Jun [2015], 69 (91 percent) have come from 3 prefectures in Guinea (Boke, Dubreka, and Forecariah) and 2 districts in Sierra Leone (Kambia and Port Loko). Most (55) of these 69 cases came from well-characterised chains of transmission, and arose among registered, monitored contacts of previous cases. Each of these cases presents a risk of further transmission, but in most instances that risk is well understood and can be planned for accordingly. However, 14 of those 69 cases, and 5 of the 7 cases that were reported from other prefectures and districts during the same period, arose from unknown sources of infection, and/or are associated with a large number of high-risk contacts, some of whom it was not possible to trace. Effectively managing the risks associated with cases such as these will be crucial to getting to zero. To that end, a package of enhanced surveillance and response measures has been introduced in both Guinea and Sierra Leone.

In Guinea, health checkpoints have been established in the western prefectures of Boke and Coyah. A 6-day door-to-door case-finding and sensitization campaign was carried out in Dubreka from 7 Jun [2015], leading to the detection of one confirmed case. In addition, intensive investigations are underway to trace a number of high-risk contacts associated with 3 cases reported from the Guinean capital, Conakry, over the past 2 weeks. All of the 3 cases acquired infection outside the capital.

In Sierra Leone, a large-scale operation is planned in the districts of Kambia and Port Loko, aimed at ending the secret movement of cases, contacts, and dead bodies that has propagated transmission over the past 2 months. Measures include broadened criteria for identifying and tracing contacts, improved incentives to increase compliance with quarantine measures and encourage the timely reporting and isolation of cases, and expanded use of rapid diagnostic tests.

As at 14 Jun [2015], there were 1927 contacts being monitored across 8 prefectures in Guinea. In Sierra Leone, 443 contacts were under follow-up in 3 districts. A total of 660 laboratory samples were tested in Guinea in the week to 14 Jun [2015]: 4 percent tested positive. Over the same period, 1787 new samples were tested in Sierra Leone, with less than one percent testing positive.

In Guinea there were a total of 15 unsafe burials in the week to 14 Jun [2015], representing 4 percent of 357 community deaths. In the week to 7 Jun [2015], 1 unsafe burial was reported in Sierra Leone.

The last health worker infections in Guinea and Sierra Leone were reported on 6 Apr [2015] and 14 May [2015], respectively. However, a case reported this week from the Targrin area of Port Loko, Sierra Leone, accquired infection after being treated in the same private healthcare facility as another confirmed case. There is an extremely high likelihood that this case will lead to further transmission, with 20 health workers who came into direct or indirect contact with the case defined as medium or high-risk contacts, along with many patients who were treated at the same facility. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-------------------------------------
There have been a total of 27 305 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 11 169 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 10 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and 14 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 14 Jun [2015]. The outbreak in Liberia was declared over on 9 May [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 to 4 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 4 to 5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 869 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 507 reported deaths (table 5)... - more

[3] Liberia: USA offers new entry guidelines
Date: 17 Jun 2015
Source: The New Dawn [edited]
http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/news/7675-us-relaxes-ebola-screening-for-liberians


Liberians entering the United States through the 5 major airports designated for Ebola effected countries will not be subjected to tough screening measures imposed at the height of the outbreak last year [2014], the U.S embassy announced Tues 17 Jun 2015.

The move by the U.S to scale back screening for travelers from Liberia comes a month after the World Health Organization or WHO declared the country free of the tropical disease.

Temperatures of travelers from Liberia will not be measured and reported on arrival, but contact information will still be left to state authorities, the U.S Government said.

However, requirements for active monitoring will end immediately, but local or states jurisdiction may exercise discretion.

Making the pronouncement, the US Government calls on Liberia to take rigorous surveillance measures, particularly along the Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea borders, as a best defense against the reintroduction of Ebola in the country, including maintaining effective entry and exit screening at all points of entry.

It says although Liberia has been removed from the list of Ebola affected countries, the United States has consistently advocated for a regional approach to the outbreak and has publically stated that the epidemic would have to end in the entire region before any of the 3 affected countries would be adequately protected from a recurrence of the outbreak.

The United State believes Liberia's success strengthens the determination of the peoples of Sierra Leone and Guinea to continue their efforts to reach zero cases of Ebola.

The U.S further stressed that the success of the response in Liberia demonstrates that the world can beat the disease if everyone works together and responds quickly with the usage of the right tools including rapid diagnosis, contact tracing, surveillance, isolation of cases, safe and dignified burials, community outreach, and dedication.

Liberia was declared Ebola free by the WHO on 9 May 2015. The U.S played a major role leading to the eradication of the tropical virus that left over 4000 Liberians dead.

[This is welcome news. While the Ebola situation remains in a dynamic state, in response to Liberia being Ebola-free since the last infected individual was buried on 28 Mar 2015, new guidelines have come out. The risk is considered low but not 0 for individuals entering the US who have traveled from Liberia in the last 21 days. The new guidelines will be published shortly but take effect today, Wed 17 Jun 2015. To access the new guidelines, check http://emergency.cdc.gov/coca; however, note they are not yet available on-line. Basically, a new algorithm has been developed where Liberia is separated from Sierra Leone and Guinea in regard to entry procedures and hospital care. But each state will have the final say in determining its own policies. This information was obtained from Ebola experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who held a national conference call today, 17 Jun [2015]. They discussed entry procedures, reviewed techniques on taking thorough histories (covering health, travel, and exposure), provided recommendations on using clinical judgment to evaluate patients based on those histories and their symptoms, and highlighted the importance of considering other illnesses in the differential diagnosis of ill travelers returning from West Africa. The entire transcript of the call will be made accessible to the public. It was noted that, to date, 20 000 people have undergone active monitoring for Ebola virus disease in the US. - Mod.LK]

http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/44739-ebola-vaccine-trial-sensitisation-to-begin-thursday.html
[The Ministry of Health will from Thu 18 Jun 2015 begin a sensitisation exercise in the Greater Accra Region on the impending Ebola vaccine clinical trial. The public education will subsequently be carried out in the Volta, Brong Ahafo and the Upper East Regions. The exercise is aimed at disabusing the minds of Ghanaians against the perception that the vaccine trial will end up spreading the Ebola virus in Ghana.]

16 Jun 2015 Ghana: "It is unsafe to undertake Ebola vaccine trial"
http://graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/44703-it-is-unsafe-to-undertake-ebola-vaccine-trial.html
[The Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences (GAAS) has stated that the country's current state of preparedness makes it unsafe to conduct the proposed Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) vaccine clinical trials.

Warning of the likely side effects on those who may be tested with the Ebola vaccine, the GAAS said the Phase I trial of the GSK vaccine in Europe caused prolonged bleeding in 10 to 15 per cent of the vaccinated population. "This is a serious adverse effect that calls for extreme caution in approving clinical trials, both Phase I and Phase II, in the country," the Academy noted, adding that those vaccinated in both phases may also shed the adenovirus vector into the surrounding community. "In the absence of a map of adenovirus prevalence in the trial sites, there is a high risk of an 'escape virus' merging with the endemic adenoviruses to create more virulent strains. For that reason alone, it is important the exposed communities and, indeed, the general public be adequately informed of such trials and their benefits and risks," the GAAS stated.

The GAAS expressed its shock at the knowledge that a separate Ebola vaccine trial which it was not privy to was planned for Hohoe in the Volta Region. ... At the meeting convened by the Minister of Health Mr Alex Segbefia on 3 Jun 2015, the Technical Committee of the Academy raised 9 key concerns on the Ebola virus, including the vaccine's composition, the inclusion of children in the trials, the protection available for communities where the trials would be conducted, and the evidence of strict compliance of international standards. "In the course of the meeting, it was mentioned that approval had already been given to an application for a separate Phase I trial in Hohoe of a test vaccine with a different construct from the GSK test vaccine.]

[On Tuesday, 16 Jun 2015, the US Congress' House of Representatives released an appropriations draft bill, which would give the CDC USD 7 billion in funding in fiscal 2016.

The bill also includes an additional USD 108 billion for the CDC's Public Health Preparedness and Response office, the purpose of which is planning for, and reacting to, pandemics and bioterror attacks. That would be a 7.2 percent increase, which would give the office nearly USD 1.6 billion to do its work next year [2016]. The draft bill may be viewed at:

[According to MSF's International President, Joanne Liu, major aid donors missed an important opportunity by failing to provide any concrete solutions for a rapid response to events like the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. Liu also criticized the G7 for lacking the will to reform WHO (World Health Organization), despite heavily criticizing the organization. Liu also sees a country's declaration of a disease outbreak as providing negative incentives, and believes there should be political and financial incentives to declaration of an outbreak.]
