In the remote wilderness of Canada's Northwest Territories, high-tech
infrared cameras and computers are being enlisted by wildlife managers
to spot bison carcasses infected with anthrax, a lethal disease caused
by a spore-forming bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_.

"We're up to 44 dead bison," Troy Ellsworth told Discovery News
yesterday [26 Jul 2010]. Ellsworth is the manager for wildlife in the
Territory's South Slave Region, and so far, thanks to low forest fire
activity this year [2010], he's had enough people available to
dispatch the carcasses.

But finding the dead bison in the 1st place is crucial to mitigating
an outbreak. If left unchecked, scavengers including vultures, bears,
wolves, and foxes -- who appear to be immune to anthrax -- can tear
apart the carcass, allowing the anthrax bacterium to reach the soil,
where it produces spores. Spores can remain viable for years or even
decades. And it's thought the bison wallowing in dusty areas where
spores exist may be inhaling the deadly disease. [For this to occur a
bull must have died previously in the wallow, but most die away from
their wallows while fevered and in the shade of trees. - Mod.MHJ] Or
it's possible that they are ingesting the spores during grazing.

The wildlife managers started using infrared technology back in 1993,
but the cameras were big, and had to be specially mounted to
helicopters and flown and operated by trained individuals. Starting in
2006 -- when the last anthrax outbreak killed 28 bison -- the team
switched to handheld devices, which they were using to spot the
remnants of forest fires smoldering unseen under 2 to 3 feet of
peat-like material. The devices aren't cheap, Ellsworth says. A
replacement lens alone can cost USD 10 000. But they're user-friendly
and operators can be trained on the ground before ever getting onboard
a helicopter.

Not every summer brings with it an outbreak of anthrax. And the
anthrax season itself seems to last between the end of the June and
the middle of the August. But once it strikes, death occurs within a
couple of days. Often the ground around a dead animal shows no visible
signs of thrashing. It's as if the bison fell where it stood and died
instantly. [An excellent description of an anthrax death, whether in
bison or humans. - Mod.MHJ] In the heat of fever, they often take
shelter under the cool shade of dense brush, and that makes finding
the carcass a challenge.

As a matter of routine, the park crew uses a plane to perform about 4
visual surveys each summer of known bison habitats. If a dead animal
is found to be infected with anthrax, the wildlife managers switch to
conducting more frequent surveys using the infrared cameras.

"As soon as it dies, the microbial floral in the gut breaks out to
decompose the carcass. That throws off a lot of heat," said Daniel
Dragon, a biosafety officer at the University of Alberta, who has
conducted research on anthrax and bison in the Northwest Territories.
The search typically begins early in the morning, starting between 4
a.m. and 5 a.m., when the ground has had time to cool off. In the
right conditions, "These guys light up like Christmas trees even under
complete tree cover," said Dragon.

Once an animal is found, a specially trained crew wearing protective
clothing is dispatched to dispose of the animal. The best method so
far is burning. About 4000 lbs [1.8 tons] of wood and coal are used
per animal. The approach used in the Northwest Territories is very
well regarded in the anthrax community, said Dragon, because there are
less frequent outbreaks and when one happens, fewer animals die.

Already Ellsworth thinks that the current outbreak is fading. On 4
different occasions in the last 10 days, his crew has been out
scanning the area. "We haven't found any more carcasses. We are
continuing to conduct aerial surveys," he said, "But if we don't pick
up any more through the weekend, we'll be done. Let's hope for the
sake of the herd, that's true."

[I advise all members who just might be interested to view the
original script. There are some excellent illustrations, including a
nice one of a bull bison stirring up dust in a wallow. Because of the
large volume of these bison, they can me imaged for 5-6 days after
they die. This facilitates finding their carcasses; and getting them
burnt. - Mod.MHJ]

[This hugely expensive conservation operation to sterilize the ground
around a couple of hundred dead bison out of the herds of thousands in
the Canadian northwest is in stark contrast to the situation regarding
tiger conservation in India. There, lack of funds to pay enough park
rangers has allowed poachers to practically exterminate tigers from
some "reserves". - Mod.JW]
