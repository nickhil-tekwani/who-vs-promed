News of the response
Electoral operations in areas affected by Ebola
------------------------------------------------
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health has been in regular contact with the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) to keep it informed of developments. The Ministry does not expect that the evolution of the current outbreak will impede the smooth conduct of electoral operations in the affected areas of the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. Indeed, one of the Department's priorities was to ensure that response activities only minimally disrupted the normal functioning of society. As a result, markets, schools and places of worship remained open in accordance with Ministry recommendations.
- A special consultation committee between the Coordination of the Ebola Virus Disease Response and the CENI will be set up to coordinate epidemiological surveillance activities around electoral operations. We plan to install health checkpoints with handwashing and temperature-sensing devices at the entrance of all polling stations in the areas affected by the outbreak.

Free care
---------
- From Thu 1 Nov 2018, free healthcare is effective in all health areas of Butembo health zones, Katwa, Masereka and Kalunguta. Implemented through the Health System Development Project (HSDP), this measure aims to encourage the population in the areas affected by the epidemic to go as quickly as possible to public and private health facilities that meet the standards from the Ministry of Health. Free healthcare was already effective in the health zones of Beni, Mabalako and Oicha since 20 Aug 2018. In Beni, free admission was effective in the priority health areas that have reported confirmed cases of Ebola but will soon be extended to all health areas in the Beni area.

[It is good that health checkpoints will be established at the upcoming election stations. Extending free medical care may also reduce the delays that have occurred when patients, particularly children, have 1st gone to traditional healers, even for malaria-like illnesses. - Mod.LXL]

[This official tally underscores what other commentators have already noted, that almost half of all the new cases of Ebola since the North Kivu outbreak began in August 2018 have occurred just in this immediate past month of October 2018, reversing earlier success in contact tracing and case finding. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Maps and graphs of the North Kivu Ebola outbreak

[CSIS Briefs, abridged, edited]
https://www.csis.org/analysis/north-kivus-ebola-outbreak-day-90-what-be-done

There is a high risk that the international response to the Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo, the 1st in a war zone, is falling far short of what is required. Indeed, we may be at the edge of a swiftly expanding epidemic that spreads regionally and perhaps beyond. Armed attacks, wary communities, and insufficient on-the-ground capacity are major barriers to arresting the outbreak. There is an urgent need for high-level political attention focused on generating an updated game plan to improve security, train and deploy community health workers and Congolese public health experts, and win community trust and cooperation. The United States -- vitally important to the international response in West Africa 2014 to 2016 -- has chosen thus far, out of security concerns, to limit its engagement to the periphery of the outbreak. Quick action is needed to affirm US leadership in eastern Congo, better understand the specific security threats at play, and come up with practical solutions that permit the safe deployment of a small US expert contingent into the center of the outbreak, where seasoned US talent is most needed.

[This white paper is worth reading in its entirely for its high-level political analysis from the standpoint of US government policy. However, even more useful for epidemiologists are several excellent color maps and graphs that combine information that has been difficult to find elsewhere in a single source, including the following figures (not numbered in the article):

- A map of individual Ebola cases and security incidents in North Kivu and Ituri, superimposed on the map of areas known to be under de facto control by non-governmental armed forces. This combined map shows the proximity of outbreak foci to, and in some cases their encirclement by, armed rebel forces.
- A map of migration flows within North Kivu and between the DRC and Uganda. Thousands of people circulate daily through this region and include traders, refugees and displaced people, and armed militants.
- A chronological graph of new Ebola cases by week of onset, annotated to show the impact of the late September 2018 armed attack in Beni and subsequent suspension of outbreak control activities.
- A chronological graph of the percentage of daily new cases from unknown chains of transmission. This graph shows that on many days in August and September 2018, all new cases derived from known contact lists, whereas in October 2018, on some days up to 60% to 80% of new cases had no known epidemiological link to prior cases. - Mod.LXL
