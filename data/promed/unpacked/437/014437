I agree with Karrie Rose that the _Leishmania_ isolated from kangaroos
could be endemic to Australia.

In reading Rose et al.'s recent publication in the International Journal
for Parasitiology, I noticed that the _Leishmania_ isolate from kangaroos
was only compared to isolates of _Leishmania_ (_Leishmania_), and not to
any _Leishmania_ (_Viannia_) species. The _Leishmania_ (_Viannia_)
subgenus is restricted to South and Central America; hosts are South
American edentates (sloths, armadillos) and marsupials, which have cooler
core body temperatures than placentals; and the temperature of optimum
growth of amastigotes (the form found in mammals) is about 32 degrees C,
similar to the optimum infectivity of mouse macrophages at 33 degrees C
rather than 37 degrees C found by Rose et al.

Furthermore, at least one hypothesis suggests that marsupials dispersed
from South America via Antarctica to Australia (Martin 1977, cited in Nowak
1991), which suggests a possible dispersal route for _Leishmania_ from
South America to Australia in marsupials. I look forward to hearing
further results from these studies.

[A most interesting and challenging hypothesis! One can hope that the
Australian group will further test their isolates in the light of this
suggestion. - Mod.MHJ]
