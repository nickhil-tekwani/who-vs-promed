The Ohio Department of Agriculture has issued a public health alert for yellowfin tuna purchased from Kroger stores in Ohio. The department issued this alert after an investigation involving 4 cases of scombroid poisoning [was] reported in Franklin and Montgomery counties.

The product was purchased from 3 stores: 1365 Stoneridge Drive, Gahanna; 10101 Landing Way, Miamisburg; and 5400 Cornerstone N Boulevard, Centerville. It was sold fresh with a label of "Tuna Yellowfin Steak Fresh Wild Caught," with sell-by dates of [3 Sep 2019] and [5 Sep 2019]. The product was both with and without sesame ginger seasoning. The Department of Agriculture said there may be additional customers who bought the product.

Scombroid fish poisoning, or histamine fish poisoning, is a syndrome resembling an allergic reaction that occurs after eating fish contaminated with high levels of histamine. Officials say symptoms begin within 2 minutes to several hours after eating. The most common symptoms are tingling and burning sensations around the mouth, facial flushing, sweating, nausea, vomiting, headache, palpitations, dizziness, and rash. Most people have mild symptoms that resolve within a few hours. In some cases, symptoms may last for several days.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture is asking anyone who may have this item to discard [it]. Anyone exhibiting signs or symptoms of foodborne illness [is] encouraged to contact a physician immediately.

Abstract
--------
"Histamine poisoning results from the consumption of foods, typically certain types of fish and cheeses that contain unusually high levels of histamine. Spoiled fish of the families Scombridae and Scomberesocidae (e.g., tuna, mackerel, bonito) are commonly implicated in incidents of histamine poisoning, which leads to the common usage of the term 'scombroid fish poisoning' to describe this illness. However, certain non-scombroid fish, most notably mahi-mahi, bluefish, and sardines, when spoiled are also commonly implicated in histamine poisoning. Also, on rare occasions, cheeses, especially Swiss cheese, can be implicated in histamine poisoning. The symptoms of histamine poisoning generally resemble the symptoms encountered with IgE-mediated food allergies. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, an oral burning sensation or peppery taste, hives, itching, red rash, and hypotension. The onset of the symptoms usually occurs within a few minutes after ingestion of the implicated food, and the duration of symptoms ranges from a few hours to 24 hours. Antihistamines can be used effectively to treat this intoxication. Histamine is formed in foods by certain bacteria that are able to decarboxylate the amino acid, histidine. However, foods containing unusually high levels of histamine may not appear to be outwardly spoiled. Foods with histamine concentrations exceeding 50 mg per 100 g of food are generally considered to be hazardous. Histamine formation in fish can be prevented by proper handling and refrigerated storage, while the control of histamine formation in cheese seems dependent on ensuring that histamine-producing bacteria are not present in significant numbers in the raw milk."

Abstract
--------
"Scombroid poisoning, also called histamine fish poisoning, is an allergy-like form of food poisoning that continues to be a major problem in seafood safety. The exact role of histamine in scombroid poisoning is not straightforward. Deviations from the expected dose-response have led to the advancement of various possible mechanisms of toxicity, none of them proven. Histamine action levels are used in regulation until more is known about the mechanism of scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning and histamine are correlated but complicated. Victims of scombroid poisoning respond well to antihistamines, and chemical analyses of fish implicated in scombroid poisoning generally reveal elevated levels of histamine. Scombroid poisoning is unique among the seafood toxins since it results from product mishandling rather than contamination from other trophic levels. Inadequate cooling following harvest promotes bacterial histamine production, and can result in outbreaks of scombroid poisoning. Fish with high levels of free histidine, the enzyme substrate converted to histamine by bacterial histidine decarboxylase, are those most often implicated in scombroid poisoning. Laboratory methods and screening methods for detecting histamine are available in abundance, but need to be compared and validated to harmonize testing. Successful field testing, including dockside or on-board testing needed to augment HACCP efforts, will have to integrate rapid and simplified detection methods with simplified and rapid sampling and extraction. Otherwise, time-consuming sample preparation reduces the impact of gains in detection speed on the overall analysis time."
