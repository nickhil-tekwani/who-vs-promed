On 20 Jul 2003, a 59-year-old male was admitted to Rabin Medical
Center-Beilinson Campus with extreme weakness. The patient is known to have
bone metastasis from prostatic carcinoma. He had been on an antiandrogen,
allopurinol, a proton pump inhibitor, and aspirin. On admission, blood
tests disclosed a severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.66 (normal
7.35-7.45), bicarbonate of 1.3 mEq/L (normal 22-26 mEq/L), and a serum
lactate of 323 mg/dL (normal 2-20 mg/dL). The patient developed respiratory
failure requiring mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure, and
hepatotoxicity. The cause of the life-threatening lactic acidosis remained
initially unexplained.
On the second day of hospitalization, his wife revealed that the patient
had consumed during the 10 days before hospitalization one glass/day of a
drink made by milk fermentation by the Kombucha "mushroom". Cultures from a
sample of the fermented milk grew yeasts and bacteria still unidentified.
Kombucha tea is a popular "health" beverage made by incubating the Kombucha
mushroom in sweet black tea. In this case, milk was used instead of tea, as
recommended by a local distributor.
The starter "mushroom" was given to our patient as a gift by a neighbor.
Following intensive supportive therapy, our patient is rapidly recovering
from his severe condition. A warning by the Ministry of Health was issued
yesterday.
Our case is very similar to the 2 cases reported by the CDC in 1995
(MMWR, 8 Dec 1995/ 44(48), 892-3, 899-900.)

[Kombucha mushroom tea, also known as "Manchurian tea" or "Kargasok tea,"
is not actually derived from a mushroom, but from the fermentation of
various yeasts and bacteria. A starter culture is added to a mixture of
black tea and sugar, and the resulting mix is allowed to ferment for a week
or more. The culture grows to form a mushroom-shaped colony, the derivation
of its name.
Through the process of fermentation, the product comes to contain
considerable quantities of acids commonly found in some foods such as
vinegar, and smaller quantities of ethyl alcohol. Because the acid could
leach harmful quantities of lead and other toxic elements from certain
types of containers -- some ceramic and painted containers and lead crystal
-- such containers should not be used for storing Kombucha tea.
The unconventional nature of the process used to make Kombucha tea has led
to questions as to whether the product could become contaminated with
potentially harmful microorganisms, such as the mold Aspergillus. Such
contamination could produce serious adverse effects in immune- compromised
individuals. Commercially produced sterile products have not been shown to
harbor any contamination, but there is no way of knowing if the same is
true about home culturing or brewing.
In some countries Kombucha is used to support the healing of a wide variety
of diseases. It is said that in Manchuria, the home of Kombucha, not one
case of cancer has been detected where the people religiously drink the
tea. Traditionally, the Kombucha culture is considered to be holy, and
whoever receives the "mushroom" promises to treat it reverently; if they
were unable to continue caring for the culture, then they must pass it on
to a caretaker so it may continue to flourish.
Anecdotally it is reported to affect a plethora of conditions, resulting in
anything from a feeling of well-being to curing a variety of diseases. It
is advertised by some stores to cure almost any ailment from A-Z.
Controlled studies, such as would be required to have it recognized as a
drug, seem to be lacking. - Mod.TG]
