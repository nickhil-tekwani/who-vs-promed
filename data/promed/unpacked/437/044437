Infection with _Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis_ in Iceland
-----------------------------------------------
Information received on 11 Jun 2004 from Dr. Halldor Runolfsson, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Reykjavik:
Date of the report: 11 Jun 2004.
Infection with _Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis_ was detected during
a routine health control histological study and was confirmed by PCR.
Location of the outbreaks: Northern and Southern Iceland (2 farms).
Infected population: red abalone (_Haliotis rufescens_). The animals on the
abalone farms are apparently healthy. There is no abnormal mortality, and
growth is normal.
Source of agent/origin of infection: the brood animals were originally
imported from California, United States of America, in 1988, and the source
of agent/origin of infection must be from this import.
Control measures: control measures will be based on movement restrictions.

WITHERING SYNDROME OF ABALONE
(_Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis_)
Withering syndrome here refers only to the disease in abalone caused by
_Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis_ on the west coast of California,
United States of America (USA) and Baja California, Mexico. However, as
infected abalone have been transported to Chile, Japan, Israel, and other
countries, the geographical range of the etiological agent is suspected to
be broad where California red abalone, _Haliotis rufescens_ are cultured.
If detected outside the known range of _Candidatus Xenohaliotis
californiensis_, light microscopy, in combination with molecular probes, if
available, must be used to identify, and distinguish, the detected organism
from other rickettsial bacteria. The presence of these pathogens in any
abalone should be regarded as potentially serious, and the OIE Reference
Laboratory should be consulted.
_Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis_ infects the gastrointestinal
epithelial cells of the posterior esophagus, digestive gland, and, to a
lesser extent, intestine. The dimorphic rod-to-spherical shaped bacterium
measures an average of 332 x 1550 nm in the bacillus form and an average of
1405 nm in the spherical morphotype. The bacteria reproduce within
intracytoplasmic vacuoles 14-56 um in diameter. Severe infections result in
withering syndrome, a disease that is characterized by morphological
changes in the digestive gland, which vary between species, and may include
degeneration (atrophy of tubules, increase in connective tissues, and
inflammation) and/or metaplasia of the digestive tubules. The metaplasia
involves the replacement of terminal secretory/absorptive acini with
absorptive/transport ducts similar in appearance to the post-esophagus.
Some hyperplasia of the absorptive/transport ducts may also be involved.
This morphological change is accompanied by a decrease in feeding, and a
depletion of glycogen reserves, followed by use of the foot muscle as an
energy source and death. The foot of affected abalone contains fewer, and
less organized, muscle bundles, abundant connective tissue, and may contain
more cerous cells than unaffected individuals. Disease (withering syndrome)
occurs at elevated water temperatures (around 18 degrees C and above). The
incubation period of withering syndrome is prolonged and ranges between 3
and 7 months.
Cumulative mortality has been recorded at over 99 percent in black abalone
and at over 30 percent in red abalone. The pathogen and disease (withering
syndrome) may occur year round, but losses due to the disease occur most
often in the summer and autumn, after a 3-to-4-month period when
temperatures are elevated over 15 degrees C. Reducing densities, and the
application of an oxytetracycline-medicated diet, may reduce losses.
For diagnosis, the recommended guidelines for sampling are those stated in
Chapter 1.1.4 and Chapter I.2. of the Aquatic Manual. - Mod.AS]
