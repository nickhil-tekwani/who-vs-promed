Edmonton: Norwalk Virus Outbreaks Affect Schools and Healthcare Centres
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
EDMONTON: Schools, day cares and seniors' residences have been hit by
the worst outbreak of a flu-like virus the city has ever seen, says
medical officer of health Dr. Gerry Predy. Over 450 people have been
affected in the last month in 16 separate outbreaks of the highly
contagious Norwalk virus. [Norwalk virus infection causes
gastroenteritis and flu-like symptoms, but Norwalk virus is not a
flu-like virus. Norwalk virus is an RNA virus with a monopartite
positive-sense RNA genome, whereas Influenza virus is an unrelated
virus with a segmented negative-sense RNA genome. - Mod.CP].
Although [Norwalk] virus causes only minor illness for most people,
it can be very serious for the very young or old and those with
weakened immune systems or underlying health problems. "I don't
recall ever seeing this many outbreaks in such a short period of time
-- it's more than we've ever seen," said Predy. "We've already had
some outbreaks in continuing-care centres and we don't want this
getting into our hospitals."
Norwalk [virus infection] occurs year-round, but is more common in
the winter. There were only 10 outbreaks in all of last winter, said
Predy. Symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and flu-like muscle aches
or fever. The
symptoms usually only last 24 to 48 hours and require no special
treatment. "We've had a number of older people who have had to be
hospitalized and young people have become dehydrated and needed an
intravenous drip," said Predy. "We are asking people to wash their
hands to help break the chain of transmission. And if you are feeling
rotten, nauseous or have diarrhea, stay home."
Predy says the outbreaks have been scattered throughout the city.
Since early October, two day cares, two elementary schools, one
post-secondary dormitory and 11 seniors residences have been
affected. In some cases, the outbreaks have led to full or partial
closure of the facilities, said Predy.
