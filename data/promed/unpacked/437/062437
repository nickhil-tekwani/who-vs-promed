----------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of severe febrile illness 5 days following ingestion of venison, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, is compatible with only a handful of infectious diseases. In 1980, a similar outbreak among American hunters was ascribed to acute toxoplasmosis. [1] The decision support module in Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) also assigns a high ranking to toxoplasmosis.

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for this posting. Indeed, if the illnesses are venison-related, toxoplasmosis is a strong possibility. It was not stated if this was fresh killed venison or previously frozen. Adequate cooking and/or adequate freezing will kill the organism.

In addition to the publication above, a Brazilian report
(Bonametti AM, Passos Jdo N, da Silva EM, Bortoliero AL: Outbreak of acute toxoplasmosis transmitted through the ingestion of ovine raw meat.
Rev Soc Bras Med Trop. 1997; 30: 21-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9026828; in Portuguese) documented a similar cluster from raw mutton, which was serologically proven:

"Abstract
---------
The authors present 17 cases of symptomatic acute toxoplasmosis acquired by the ingestion of raw mutton offered during a party in September 1993. The incubation period carried from 6 to 13 days (10.9 +/- 7.0). 16 (94.5 percent) patients presented fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and adenopathy (cervical or cervical/axillary). Hepatomegaly was found in 6 patients, splenomegaly in 4, and rash in 2. One patient presented clinical picture of chorioretinitis confirmed by ophthalmological exam. All patients showed increased serum levels of specific antibodies (IgG and IgM) on indirect immunofluorescence assay evidencing acute phase of toxoplasmosis. The patients were treated with specific drugs for toxoplasmosis and presented satisfactory clinical and laboratory response."

The incubation period was as short as 6 days but in Herwaldt BL: Laboratory-acquired parasitic infections from accidental exposures. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2001; 14(4): 659-88; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88999/, an incubation period of as short as 3 days was found:

"The median incubation period for the 20 cases with available data, all of which were related to exposure to tissue stages of the parasite, was 8.5 days (range, 3 days to 2 months); with the exception of 2 cases with incubation periods of 2 months, all cases had incubation periods of 13 days or less." - Mod.LL]
