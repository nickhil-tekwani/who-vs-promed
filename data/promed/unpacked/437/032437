The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the FDA Coordinated Outbreak Response and Evaluation Network (FDA CORE), and the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA CVM) to investigate an outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections linked to contact with frozen feeder rodents used to feed pet reptiles. FDA CVM is the regulatory authority for animal feeds (which includes pet food), animal drugs, and veterinary devices.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, obtains DNA "fingerprints" of salmonella bacteria through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE] to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. This PFGE pattern has been seen before in PulseNet and in the past typically caused 4-8 cases per month during January to April.

A total of 37 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 18 states from 11 Jan 2014 to 13 May 2014. The number of ill persons reported from each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (2), California (7), Illinois (1), Kentucky (1), Maryland (1), Michigan (2), Minnesota (1), Missouri (2), Montana (3), New Jersey (3), New Mexico (1), North Carolina (1), Ohio (4), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (3), South Dakota (1), and Texas (1).

Among 32 persons with available information, dates that illnesses began range from 11 Jan 2014 to 21 Apr 2014. Ill persons range in age from younger than 1 year to 69 years, with a median age of 21 years. 59 per cent of ill persons are female. Among 34 persons with available information, 5 (15 per cent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, veterinary, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that contact with frozen feeder rodents used to feed pet reptiles is a likely source of this outbreak of human _S._ Typhimurium infections. Frozen feeder rodents may include mice, rats, or other rodents of different sizes and ages. Frozen feeder rodents are used to feed some pet reptiles and amphibians.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods eaten and animal contact during the week before becoming ill. 21 (66 per cent) of 32 ill persons interviewed reported contact with multiple types of reptiles, including snakes and lizards. 17 of the 21 ill persons reporting reptile exposure were able to provide information about what the reptile was fed. 15 (88 per cent) of these 17 ill persons reported exposure to frozen feeder rodents.

The Oregon State Public Health Laboratory isolated the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium in one sample of unused frozen mice, packaged by Reptile Industries, Inc. and sold under the brand name Arctic Mice at PetSmart, collected by the Oregon Department of Public Health from an ill person's home.

FDA has evaluated sales and shipping records, and traceback activities have identified Reptile Industries, Inc as the common source of frozen feeder rodents purchased by ill persons. Testing conducted by FDA isolated the outbreak strain in 2 samples of frozen feeder rodents collected during an FDA investigation at the Reptile Industries facility.

In the absence of a voluntary recall from Reptile Industries, Inc, FDA issued a warning to pet owners who have purchased frozen rodents packaged by Reptile Industries, Inc since 11 Jan 2014 that they have the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. Reptile Industries, Inc packages frozen rodents for PetSmart stores nationwide and are sold under the brand name Arctic Mice.

CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory conducted antibiotic resistance testing on _S._ Typhimurium isolates collected from 3 ill persons infected with the outbreak strain; all isolates were pansusceptible (susceptible to all antibiotics on the NARMS panel). NARMS is a US public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is an interagency partnership among CDC, FDA, USDA, and state and local health departments. The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antibiotic resistance in Salmonella and several other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens and submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten and animals they had contact with before becoming ill.

[An outbreak of human _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- infections associated with exposure to rodents sold as food for pet reptiles and amphibians (that is, feeder rodents) was reported in MMWR from the USA in 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120419.1107037). This outbreak strain also was implicated in a 2009 outbreak in the UK and a 2010 outbreak in the USA, both linked to frozen feeder rodents from a single USA supplier, resulting in recalls.

_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- is quite similar to _S._ Typhimurium, indeed it has the same somatic (O) antigens of Typhimurium. - Mod.LL
