Belgium: 3rd consecutive year of increased hantavirus infection activity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hantaviruses (family _Bunyaviridae_) are rodent-borne pathogens that
circulate worldwide. In Europe and Asia infection with hantaviruses
may result in hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) varying in
severity depending on the causal serotype.
In Belgium, the predominantly circulating serotype is _Puumala virus_
(PUUV) with the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) as its main reservoir
(1). The disease is characterised by an abrupt onset; symptoms
include fever, headache, abdominal and back pain. Humans may become
infected through inhalation of aerosolised rodent excreta. The
incidence of human hantavirus infections is, at least in temperate
Europe, related to the bank vole population density which on its turn
depends on the mast of oak and beech.
Until 1999 (with epidemics in 1990 with 62 cases, 1993 with 174
cases, 1996 with 224 cases, 1999 with 124 cases) a 3-year cycle in
increased hantavirus infection activity could be observed, from this
year on and up until 2005 a 2-year cycle occurred (epidemics in 2001
with 110 cases, 2003 with 122 cases and 2005 with 372 cases) (2,3,4).
Surprisingly, 2006 resulted in 160 cases and was the 1st epidemic
year with no preceding non-epidemic year. During the first 4 months
of 2007, 61 cases were detected by the National Reference Laboratory
for Hantavirus Infections (located at the Queen Astrid Military
Hospital, Brussels, and hosted and funded by the Belgian Ministry of
Defence). Up until today (22 May) the 2007 grand total stands at 76
cases. The average number of cases for the January-April period from
the past 10 years was 41 cases and around 35 percent of the annual
total was detected during these first 4 months. Belgium could thus
expect a calculated number of 175 cases for the year 2007, which
would make it the 3rd consecutive epidemic year in a row. Being an
extrapolation, care should however be taken in interpreting this
number as a multitude of parameters (biotic as well as abiotic) could
interfere, positively or negatively, in the course of the year.
The main determinant for increased hantavirus activity in Belgium is
the mast of oak and/or beech but, additionally, favourable climatic
conditions are likely to facilitate rodent survival during autumn and
winter and induce an early start of the reproductive period.
Intervals between mast years are currently reduced to two years
(normal 4-7 yrs) and the last 5 years Belgium experienced unusually
mild winters. The 2006 autumn as well as the 2007 winter broke
records with minimum and maximum monthly averages being several
degrees Celsius higher than normal. The year 2006 was, on top of all
this, a moderately abundant oak mast year.
