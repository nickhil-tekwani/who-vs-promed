Eighteen sheep have died due to the outbreak of sheep pox virus (SPPV) in Surendranagar since 21 Aug [2022]. This comes as the state [Gujarat] battles an outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD).

Both LSDV and SPPV are viruses of the _Capripoxvirus_ genus.

However, government officers claimed they have managed to keep the outbreak limited to one herd, of which 38 sheep have contracted the virus, and 18 have died.

Officers of the state animal husbandry department said a team of veterinarians visited Himmatpura village in Dasada taluka on 22 Aug [2022] after media reports emerged of sheep falling ill en masse.

"Some illness was reported in a herd of 145 sheep in Himmatpura on 21 August. So, our team visited the village the following day. The team found that 8 sheep had fallen ill and 2 of them had died. Symptoms suggest the sheep had contracted the sheep pox virus and not goatpoxvirus that causes lumpy skin disease," Falguni Thakar, director of animal husbandry (DoAH) of Gujarat, said [see comment].

The officer said that samples of infected sheep were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) for laboratory tests. The samples returned positive for SPPV.

"Our team started giving treatment to the infected animals while advising the herdsman to segregate other sheep. But later on, 30 fresh infections were reported. However, all of the infections were from the same herd. As a precautionary measure, we have vaccinated 2283 sheep found in the radius of 15 km [9.3 mi]. There has been no fresh infection reported among the herd since September 3," Thakar further said.

The DoAH said healthy sheep have been given doses of SPPV vaccine to give the small ruminants protection against the viral disease.

"The outbreak of sheep pox virus is not new. Isolated outbreaks are reported from the state on and off. But there is a vaccine for this virus, and therefore we have been able to tackle such outbreaks. The situation is under control," Thakar added.

Pravin Kanjariya, deputy director of animal husbandry in Surendranagar, said the herdsman whose flock has been affected lives in an isolated place. "He keeps his herd in isolated places. Maybe, that has helped in containing the spread of the virus," said Kanjariya. He added that by "noticing nodules on the sheep's body parts like mouth, legs, etc., we prima facie concluded that the sheep had contracted SPPV."

[Sheeppox (SPP) and goatpox (GP) are endemic in India. In 2019, another capripoxvirus, lumpy skin disease (LSD), penetrated India and has been spreading since, causing losses in cattle. Capripoxviruses generally show host preference.

For the vaccination of sheep, an indigenous SPPV-Srinagar attenuated strain (SPPV-Srin38/00) vaccine was developed; reportedly, it has been tested in vivo in sheep extensively and found to be safe, potent, and efficacious in house and field trials.

For the vaccination of goats, the attenuated live indigenous goatpox vaccine (GTPV/Uttarkashi/1978 strain) is applied. This vaccine has been found as safe in goats, protecting challenged vaccinated goats up to 52 months post-vaccination [see citation below]. This vaccine has been recently applied in India for the vaccination of cattle against LSD; official safety and efficacy data are pending.

It will be interesting to note if sheep, challenged by the said attenuated goat vaccine, have been tested for their susceptibility. ProMED would appreciate relevant information from knowledgeable sources.

Surendranagar is an administrative district in Saurashtra region of Gujarat state. - Mod.AS
