Outbreak notice: rabies in Bali, Indonesia
------------------------------------------
(This information is current as of today, 31 Oct 2009)
In December 2008, the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture reported a
rabies outbreak in dogs on the island of Bali, Indonesia, to the World
Organization for Animal Health [OIE]. As of October 2009, the
Indonesia Ministry of Health has reported 15 [human] deaths caused by
rabies on Bali. Most human and animal rabies cases have been confirmed
near popular tourist destinations on the southern tip of Bali.
However, because the situation is evolving, CDC advises travelers to
take precautions on the entire island.

The following activities may put travelers to Bali at higher risk for rabies:

- Working closely with animals of unknown rabies exposure or
vaccination history.
- Spending a lot of time in a rural area or doing outdoor activities
such as bicycling, camping, or hiking. These activities increase the
risk for coming in contact with animals.
- Touching or playing with animals.
- Adopting animals with the intention of bringing them home to the
United States [or any other country].

Information about rabies
------------------------
A threat to both human and animal health, rabies is a rapidly
progressing, deadly disease. It is almost always spread by an animal
bite but can also be spread when a rabid animal's saliva gets directly
into the eyes, nose, mouth, or broken skin. The primary sources of
human infection worldwide are dogs and certain wildlife species, such
as foxes, raccoons, mongooses and bats.

Each year throughout the world, rabies kills approximately 50 000
people, mostly children. The risk of rabies from domestic animals is
low for people in the USA. For people who travel to other parts of the
world, the risk of rabies may be higher. Therefore, all travelers
should know how to protect themselves from this disease.

Advice for travelers
--------------------
Follow these recommendations to protect you and your family from rabies:

- Avoid animal bites:
- Avoid touching all animals, including wild animals and pets. Pets in
other countries may not have been vaccinated against rabies.
- Resist the urge to rescue animals with the intent to bring them
home. Dogs and cats may be infected with rabies but not show signs
until several days or weeks after you first encounter them.
- Supervise children closely, especially around dogs, cats, and
wildlife such as monkeys. This is important since children are more
likely to be bitten by animals, may not report the bite, and may have
more severe injuries from animal bites.
- If you are traveling with your pet, supervise your pet closely and
do not allow it to play with local animals, especially strays.

Act quickly if an animal bites or scratches you:
- Wash the wound well with soap and water.
- See a doctor right away, even if you don't feel sick or your wound
is not serious. To prevent rabies, you may need to start a series of
vaccinations immediately.
- To get vaccinated, be prepared to travel back to the United States
or to another area. (Adequate vaccination for exposure to rabies is
not available in all parts of the world.)
- After you return home, tell your doctor or state health department
that you were bitten or scratched during travel.

Before your trip, find out if your health insurance covers health care
overseas and medical evacuation. If it does not, consider buying
supplemental health insurance for your trip.

Information for health-care providers
-------------------------------------
GeoSentinel data indicate that the number of requests for rabies
postexposure prophylaxis has increased among travelers returning from
Bali since May 2008. GeoSentinel is a worldwide communication and data
collection network for the surveillance of travel-related illness. It
is operated in partnership between the International Society of Travel
Medicine and CDC.

During pre-travel consultations, health-care providers should stress
the importance of avoiding animal bites and recommend that travelers
to Indonesia supplement their health insurance to cover emergency
evacuation or health care abroad.
