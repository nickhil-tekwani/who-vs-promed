Ebola Situation Report - 9 Sep 2015
---------------------------------------

Summary
-------
There were 2 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 6 Sep [2015]: 1 in Guinea and 1 in Sierra Leone. Overall case incidence has remained stable at 2 or 3 confirmed cases per week for 6 consecutive weeks. There are a total of 3 active chains of transmission, 2 in and around Conakry, Guinea, and 1 in the western district of Kambia, Sierra Leone, after all remaining contacts associated with transmission chains in Forecariah, Guinea completed follow-up in the week to 6 Sep [2015].

In addition, Liberia was declared free of Ebola virus transmission in the human population for a 2nd time on 3 Sep 2015, 42 days after the country's last laboratory-confirmed case associated with the Margibi cluster of cases completed treatment and was confirmed as EVD-negative. Liberia has now entered a 90-day period of heightened surveillance.

The total number of contacts under observation in Guinea and Sierra Leone has increased from approximately 450 on 30 Aug [2015] to approximately 1300 on 6 Sep [2015]. This increase is largely attributable to the single high-risk community death reported from Kambia, Sierra Leone at the end of the previous week (week to 30 Aug [2015]). Both cases reported in the week to 6 Sep [2015] were registered contacts associated with previous cases in the same areas of Conakry, Guinea, and Kambia, Sierra Leone in the past 2 weeks. The case reported from Guinea is considered to present a high risk of further transmission. There remains a risk of short-term increases in case incidence as a result of these high-risk cases.

The single confirmed case reported from Guinea in the week to 6 Sep [2015] had onset of symptoms in the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. The case is a 13-year-old girl and is a registered contact and relative of 2 cases reported from the same area of the city during the previous 2 weeks. She is considered to present a high risk of further transmission after she was briefly lost to follow-up after developing early symptoms. She then presented to several private health facilities whilst symptomatic before being traced, tested for EVD and admitted to an Ebola treatment centre. The 292 contacts under follow-up on 6 Sep [2015] in Guinea were located in 2 adjacent prefectures, Conakry (266 contacts) and Dubreka (26 contacts). The last remaining contacts in the prefecture of Forecariah completed follow-up in the week to 6 Sep [2015].

One new confirmed case was reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 6 Sep [2015]. The case is the daughter of the high-risk case reported from Kambia in the previous week (week to 30 Aug [2015]): an approximately 60-year-old woman identified as EVD-positive after post-mortem testing in the village of Sella Kafta, Tonko Limba chiefdom. The most recent case was identified as a high-risk contact after caring for her mother during the course of her mother's illness. Over 900 contacts have been identified in association with the chain of transmission, although the majority of these contacts have been defined by geographical proximity rather than by history of possible exposure, and are, therefore, considered to be at very low risk. However, further cases are expected among the approximately 40 high-risk contacts identified so far. The origin of infection of the 60-year-old woman remains under investigation.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 6 Sep [2015]. There have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 513 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------------
There have been a total of 28 141 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 6 Sep [2015], with 11 291 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). One new confirmed case was reported in Guinea and one in Sierra Leone in the week to 6 Sep [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 6 Sep [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[3] Ebolavirus taxonomy
Date: Tue 8 Sep 2015
From: Kuhn Jens <kuhnjens@niaid.nih.gov> [edited]


The genus _Ebolavirus_ includes 5 species, but the species are called _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Reston ebolavirus_, _Sudan ebolavirus_ and _Zaire ebolavirus_ [all italicized]. Each species has currently a single member. These members, the viruses, are called Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV); Sudan virus (SUDV); Tai Forest virus (TAFV), and Ebola virus (not Zaire virus!) (EBOV). Species cannot infect you, they cannot be centrifuged, they cannot be discovered, and they cannot spread. Viruses on the other hand can do all those things.

Virus names should never be binomials (and rarely are), only species names should be. Hence, for a virus called "Reston virus," an abbreviation "REBOV" would not make sense; and species names are not to be abbreviated (Reston virus is a member of the species _Reston ebolavirus_; and people really need to begin to understand the difference).

It's deliberate to lose the connection to EBOV because RESTV, TAFV, etc. are different viruses, albeit classified in the same genus. RESTV, EBOV, and SUDV are ebolaviruses.

If the ProMED report would say "Reston virus found in Philippines" and then the text state that RESTV is distantly related to EBOV and SUDV, then the panic meter would be much less than it will be now after "EBOV" has been found in the Philippines, while we still talk about the big EBOV disease outbreak in Western Africa.

[Thank you, Jens, for sending this clear explanation.
Readers should ask themselves "Are we talking about a virus or a species?"
"Are `dengue virus` or `yellow fever virus` usually italicized?" The answer is NO.
"Are scientific names for species of living beings like the mosquito `Aedes aegypti` usually italicized?" The answer is YES.
The other point is that yellow fever and dengue viruses belong to the same genus, Flavivirus.
Ebola and Reston viruses belong to the same genus, Ebolavirus -- but they are no more closely related to each other than dengue and yellow fever viruses. - Mod.JW]

8 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: Sierra Leone officials confirm 3 new cases of Ebola
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_SIERRA_LEONE_EBOLA?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-09-08-14-12-56
[The head of Sierra Leone's National Ebola Response Center [NERC] says 3 new cases of Ebola have emerged in an area where a 67-year-old woman died in late August [2015], bringing the total new cases in treatment to 4. Alfred Palo Conteh said on Tue [8 Sep 2015] that 3 new cases were confirmed on Mon [7 Sep 2015]. He said now 4 people are in treatment after another case was confirmed on [5 Sep 2015]. [The total, including the 67-year-old index case, is 5 cases. Palo Conteh said the new cases were in contact with the woman who died in the northern Kambia district on 28 Aug 2015. Samples from her body came back positive less than a week after the country's last known patient was discharged from the hospital.]

9 Sep 2015 USA: One year later, U.S. nurses feel unprepared for the next Ebola
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/not-much-has-changed-for-nurses-since-the-2014-ebola-threat_55ef2961e4b03784e276be9b
[After the 2014 outbreak struck, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services created a 2-tier system, granting funds to select hospitals to ensure they can either safely temporarily care for possible Ebola patients or treat them long-term, the latter designation so far given to just 9 of a planned 10 hospitals. The vast majority of the 5600 hospitals in the U.S. are not part of the Health and Human Services-designated system, and they don't receive the funding or training that Clark and her colleagues do. Instead, information about new infectious diseases is piecemeal and unregulated, leaving everyone, but especially healthcare workers, open to the next infectious disease threat. ...more]

9 Sep 2015 Sex and masturbation may hamper Ebola eradication efforts
http://www.trust.org/item/20150909162251-l2il9/
[Isolated flare-ups of Ebola may point to a higher risk of transmission via the semen of male survivors than previously thought, undermining hopes of ending West Africa's deadly outbreak by the end of the year. The World Health Organization's advice is that all male survivors should be tested 3 months after the onset of symptoms and then monthly until they know they have no risk of passing on the virus through their semen, Bruce Aylward, head of the WHO's Ebola response, told a news conference. But a forthcoming study in the New England Journal of Medicine, based on around 200 survivors, found that around half still had traces of the virus in their semen after 6 months, a clinician familiar with the study told Reuters. "The old advice of 3 months is no longer good," the clinician said. "The number of people with persistent virus in their semen is much greater than expected." The clinician, who was not authorized to speak about the study, added that the risk might not only be from sex but also from masturbation. "It's not the sex that is dangerous, it's the semen that is dangerous," said Aylward, who mentioned the study during a news conference but did not give details. "How people actually get exposed, in soiled linens or whatever, is not clear." Transmission through semen may explain why a few cases continue to occur even though the outbreak has been almost completely eradicated by an intense international effort, recently bolstered by the deployment of a trial vaccine in Guinea and Sierra Leone. ...more]

http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/8/ebola-vaccine-officials-weigh-who-to-vaccinate-how/
[With scientists hopeful they are closing in on a vaccine to stop Ebola, policymakers are beginning to grapple with the other big questions: how much will be needed and who should get vaccinated in order to stem the next outbreak. It's unlikely an Ebola vaccine will join chickenpox, measles and tetanus shots as standard for the general population, but officials will have to decide how much of the vaccine to stockpile and whether to require mandatory vaccination for those with high-risk job. ...more]

Funding
-------
7 Sep 2015: The European Commission announced on 7 Sep 2015 that they will provide EUR 1 million [USD 1.17 million] in order to help children affected by Ebola
http://www.neurope.eu/article/eu-e1-million-in-funds-to-assist-children-affected-by-ebola/
[The funding will help the re-opening of schools closed due to the Ebola epidemic. The funding will go through UNICEF [United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund] and Save the Children, with each organization set to receive EURO 500 000 [USD 558 500]. Their goal will be to provide educational projects in Guinea and Sierra Leone. The amount due to be funded will come from the EURO 11 million [USD 12.9 million] currently allocated for educational projects in conflict areas under the EU Children of Peace initiative. This initiative focuses on providing vulnerable children in emergencies with access to a safe learning system and to help them achieve a better life. Through this initiative, the EU [European Union] will help train children and teachers on how to prevent Ebola transmission. It will also take part in increasing hygiene and sanitation in schools, integrating children into their communities, and also strengthening the resilience of the population in case a health crisis happens in the future. ...more]

Research
-------
7 Sep 2015: Film tells the story of largest ever Ebola trial with convalescent plasma
http://www.ebolatx.eu/film/
[A film about the Ebola-Tx clinical trial was presented on Mon 7 Sep 2015 at the European Conference on Tropical Medicine and International Health (ECTMIH) in Basel. The Ebola-Tx trial is the largest ever Ebola trial testing convalescent plasma as treatment. Led by the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), the European Union-funded trial took place between February and July 2015 at the Donka Ebola Treatment Centre in Conakry, Guinea, run by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). With more than 100 enrolled patients, Ebola-Tx is the largest ever convalescent plasma trial for Ebola... The data collected during the trial is currently under analysis and will soon be published. Whatever the outcome, the scientific insights into the use of convalescent plasma as therapeutic treatment will be precious information in case of future outbreaks.]

9 Sep 2015: New Ebola test could help curb disease spread
http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-09/e-net090915.php
[A new Ebola test that uses magnetic nanoparticles could help curb the spread of the disease in western Africa. Research published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics shows that the new test is 100-times more sensitive than the current test and easier to use. Because of this, the new test makes it easier and cheaper to diagnose cases, enabling healthcare workers to isolate patients and prevent the spread of Ebola. ...more]
