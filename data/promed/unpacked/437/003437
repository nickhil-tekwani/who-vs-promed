Scientists are trying to identify disease outbreaks threatening commercially
valuable salmon stocks preparing to spawn in watersheds throughout British
Columbia.
Deaths reported among the first sockeye salmon arriving at the Adams River
already number in the "tens of thousands," said Jay Hartling of the federal
Fisheries Department. "At first, they thought it was a gill infection,"
Hartling said. "Now they think it's some kind of kidney parasite." More than
680 000 fish are expected to arrive at the Adams water system over the next
few weeks.
At Weaver Creek, south of Harrison Lake in British Columbia, federal
fisheries manager Vic Ewart confirmed early arrivals of sockeye are dying in
significant numbers.
Mortalities numbered in "the low thousands," but the bulk of an expected run
of 200 000 sockeye has not yet arrived, he said. The cause of the Weaver
Creek deaths hasn't yet been identified, but it appears similar to the Adams
River outbreak, Ewart said.
Meanwhile, at Scott Cove Creek among the islands between the north end of
Vancouver Island and the mainland, researcher Alexandra Morton has been
catching escaped Atlantic salmon displaying symptoms of a highly contagious
disease that recently ravaged fish farms and wild stocks in Norway.
Earlier this month, an estimated 30 000 Atlantic salmon escaped from a fish
farm in the area. Two specimens she recovered had symptoms of a disease
called furunculosis, Morton said. Large boils on one fish had ruptured,
dispersing the highly contagious bacteria among the spawning coho, she said.
"It's so contagious," she said. "This bacterium can last in water. It can
thrive on wet wood." She said she's particularly concerned because the
stream where she's been finding the escaped Atlantics is adjacent to a main
migration route for many salmon stocks heading for the Fraser River system.
The provincial Environment Ministry was investigating.
No similar problem has been found among sockeye in Washington [state, said
Joan Thomas, health specialist with the state Fish and Wildlife Department.
Sockeye runs began in June up the Skagit-Baker River system in Skagit County
and in Lake Washington, Thomas said.
