Spike in greening cases worries orange producers
------------------------------------------------
A recent spike in the number of citrus trees infected with huanglongbing (HLB, or greening) disease in Sao Paulo state is a "worrying" development for Brazil's citrus sector, according to researchers from national citrus production defence fund, Fundecitrus.

"Yes, we are worried about the increase in the number of plants with symptoms of the disease from 3.78 per cent in 2011 to almost 7 per cent in 2012," said Fundecitrus researcher Jose Belasque Junior, who added that this increase did not come as a surprise to his organisation as disease management measures on the ground have not been satisfactory.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus occurs throughout much of Asia. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector. 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. HLB has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

In Brazil, the Asian citrus psyllid was reported in 1942. _Ca._ L. asiaticus was reported for the 1st time in the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012). At that time, in the state of Sao Paulo the pathogen was present in about 5 per cent of citrus trees and _Ca._ L. americanus (which shares the same vector) in 95 per cent of trees. However, by 2008 more trees were being found infected with _Ca._ L. asiaticus which is thought to be due to this species being more heat tolerant. Millions of HLB affected sweet orange trees have been eradicated in the country under a national HLB control programme, but HLB continues to spread in the region.
