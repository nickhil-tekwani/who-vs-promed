Two Honduran children were reported ill with dengue hemorrhagic fever,
making the number of cases of this disease (DHF) in Honduras increasing to
16 since the beginning of this year, an official source reported this
Wednesday.
The director of the Department of Epidemiologia of the Ministry of Health,
Antonio Pinel, confirmed to the local press that the past Tuesday, a child
of 9 years old in the city of San Pedro Sula (north) and an adolescent of
16 years of age in the department of Coluteca (south) were reported as
infected with dengue fever virus.
Pinel indicated that the Government has made efforts, through publicity
campaigns, in order for the population to eliminate the breeding sites of
mosquitos that transmit dengue, but the disease continues advancing.
Last April a child in San Pedro Sula died as a result of dengue hemorrhagic
fever, who was considered the only fatal victim reported to the health
authorities due to this disease [DHF.
According to official records, in 1998 dengue hemorrhagic fever caused 7
deaths in Honduras.

[The number of cases of DHF mentioned in this newswire release (16) differs
markedly from that reported in the ProMED posting of 5 July 1999 (ref. 03
above) where 47 cases of DHF were reported since the beginning of this
year. Neither the Honduras MOH nor the PAHO/Honduras websites had
information on the dengue situation in Honduras more recent than 1995-1998.
