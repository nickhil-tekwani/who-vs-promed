[This is an updated summary of the dengue situation in New Caledonia, based
on our past records and the latest official report from the Department of
Health of New Caledonia. Thanks to Dr JP Grangeon and Nancy Klingler for
keeping PACNET focal point posted. - TK
Since December 1997, the number of new cases of [dengue-2 virus infection
has constantly increased. The first case of DEN-2 since 1972 was notified
in mid-December 1996. Between this date and 16 February 1998, 594 new cases
of dengue were reported. No deaths were registered.
In 1997, there has been a low level transmission all over the year, with
243 new cases reported; amongst the cases for which the type of dengue has
been determined, 95% (146/154) were DEN-2, 5% (7/154) DEN-3 and 1 case was
DEN-1 (imported from Thailand).
In December 1997, the weekly number of new cases started to increase, and
347 cases were notified from 1 January to 16 February 1998, which
represents more than the total number of cases in 1997; all 260 confirmed
cases were DEN-2. Thirty-six percent of 1998 dengue new cases are from the
island of Ouvea (one of the Loyalty Islands) and 23% are from Noumea.
The weekly number of cases from the week starting on 24/11/97 (week 48 of
1997) to the week starting on 09/02/98 (week 7 of 1998) is shown herunder:

The following background data on dengue in New Caledonia were extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
- Dengue was first reported in New Caledonia in 1910, and outbreaks were
reported in 1908, 1926, and 1943 to 1944. An epidemic during 1971 to 1972
involved at least 40% of the population.
- 66 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) were reported during 1975 to
1979; 160 during 1980 to 1984; 662 during 1985 to 1989; 119 during 1990 to
1993.
- No cases of dengue were reported in 1978. In 1979, an outbreak involved
11% of persons on Thio (Noumea), with 5 cases of DHF (only 118 cases were
officially reported from New Caledonia that year). An estimated 25,000
were infected during an outbreak in 1989.
- 1,820 cases (563 of these in Noumea) including 37 DHF were confirmed
during January to June 1995 - 60% from Southern Province and 40% from
Northern Province. 243 cases were reported in 1997
