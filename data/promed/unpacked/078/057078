Healthcare authorities reported that 2 teenagers from Cochapeti community in Caceres del Peru district, Santa province [of the Ancash Region - Mod.LL], died after acquiring leptospirosis, a disease transmitted by rodents. The 2 siblings were brought to Eleazar Guzman-Barron Regional Hospital in mid-January 2015; however, it was not until yesterday that Dr. Eduardo Guzman, director of the hospital, reported their passing. "The young male, aged 17, died in our hospital; and the young female, aged 14, died in Lima, since she was referred to a Lima hospital," reported Dr. Guzman.

Dr. Guzman declared that both patients were admitted presenting with high fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. He also reported that because of the occurrence of these cases, he submitted a report to the Pacifico Norte health network, so immediate actions may be taken to determine if the affected persons got sick because of rat exposure.

Dr. Guzman also commented that the school where these young persons studied, as well as their homes, should be visited (by healthcare authorities). "Meanwhile, we suggested that fumigation should be performed," he added. This occurrence has alerted Santa inhabitants; since the day before, Ms. Mercedes Lozada, Head of Environmental Health in Pacifico Norte health network, reported that after monitoring activities, rat overpopulation was found in 2 markets in Chimbote, and immediate fumigation was recommended. Local authorities requested Santa provincial municipality 10 000 Soles [Peruvian currency, equivalent to USD 3200] for carrying out this activity.

[Clinical signs observed with leptospirosis vary from inapparent to fatal depending on the host and the serovar. Acute leptospirosis is evident initially by a fever that may persist from a few hours to several days. In humans the disease is characterized by fever, headaches, muscle aches, vomiting, conjunctivitis, weakness, meningitis, and in severe cases, icterus (jaundice) and kidney failure. In domestic species clinical signs consist of fever, weight loss, anorexia (loss of appetite), abnormal milk secretion, anemia, hematuria (blood in the urine), hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in the urine), muscular weakness, pulmonary congestion, icterus, abortion (a few days to several weeks following infection of the fetus), stillbirths or persistent infection in newborns, and death. Naturally occurring leptospiral infection in wildlife is apparently self-limiting and asymptomatic, with the host recovering from the initial stages of the disease while remaining a reservoir host. Experimental infections in white-tailed deer resulted in clinical signs ranging from an inapparent infection to a febrile response, abortion, and death. Clinical signs observed in the experimental deer were a transient fever, anorexia, weakness, anemia, hemoglobinuria and icterus.

Pathological findings vary as much as the clinical signs of disease. In humans, pathological changes occur in the kidney parenchyma. In domestic species, the leptospirae cause hepatitis (cellular necrosis and separation of liver cord cells). Encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and nephritis (inflammation of the kidney) also occur. - Mod.LL
