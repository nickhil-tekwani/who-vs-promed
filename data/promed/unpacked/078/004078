The Tyler Morning Telegraph has learned [a man] died [Fri 8 Nov 2019] around 9:45 p.m. His family told reporter Cory McCoy he was fighting for his life after complications from legionnaires' disease and had been in and out of the hospital. They confirmed late Friday he passed away.

The family said they believe he contracted the disease at East Texas State Fair more than a month and a half ago.

[The man], a well-known volunteer, community leader and the precinct chair for the Smith County Democratic Party, spent the entirety of the fair setting up and running the party's booth in Harvey Convention Center.

His wife told the Tyler Morning Telegraph in an interview that her husband was in the hospital in October [2019] to treat the disease but then contracted a deadly bug that caused kidney failure and recently, surgery to remove his colon.

Twelve people may have developed legionnaires' disease in the East Texas State Fair legionnaires outbreak (https://www.makefoodsafe.com/east-texas-state-fair-legionnaires-outbreak/). The Northeast Texas Public Health District alerts the public in East Texas that:
Anyone who attended the East Texas State Fair in Tyler during September 2019 and is sick due to symptoms of legionnaires' disease is urged to discuss legionnaires' disease with your health care provider immediately.

Public health investigators are working to identify how the outbreak happened. 7 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease and 5 possible cases have been linked to the East Texas State Fair.

The Tyler Morning Telegraph reports that, "state health investigators have determined that all who are sick attended the East Texas State Fair that took place [20-29 Sep 2019] in Tyler. If exposed to the disease, attendees already would have exhibited symptoms."

Legionnaires' disease symptoms usually begin 2 to 10 days after exposure to water vapor carrying _Legionella_ bacteria. Coughs, fevers, and headaches are common symptoms. Additional symptoms may include shortness of breath and muscle aches. Most people who develop Legionnaires' disease will require hospitalization. In about 10% of people, Legionnaires' disease is fatal.

Because legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, the disease can be treated with antibiotics. Early diagnosis and treatment can lead to better patient recovery.

[There have been 7 confirmed cases and 5 possible cases of legionnaires' disease in the Northeast Texas region]. The investigation of these cases is ongoing, as the Northeast Texas Public Health District (NET) Health Disease Surveillance Division is working with organizers of the East Texas State Fair and local health officials to investigate any connections of these cases with attendance at the East Texas State Fair this year [20-29 Sep 2019].

According to NET:
Anyone who attended the East Texas State Fair in Tyler during September 2019 and is sick due to symptoms of legionnaires' disease is urged to discuss legionnaires' disease with your health care provider immediately.

George Roberts, NET Health CEO, told the local news, "We want (doctors) to specifically ask any patient with the symptoms whether they were at the fair."

NET officials believe the common element in these legionnaires' disease cases is the East Texas State Fair. Within a week's time 5 cases were noticed by health officials.

Jason Geslois, epidemiologist with NET Health, said he and other health officials ask patients about where they have traveled recently to find a common denominator of the outbreak's source. The process of narrowing down the location within the fair is ongoing, but the time frame is [20-29 Sep 2019], and 2 to 10 days [the incubation period of legionnaires' disease] afterward.

"Now we narrow down our scope a little further," Roberts said. "That's why we're trying to track this down." Roberts said NET Health has a strong confidence that Harvey Hall Convention Center is safe due to the chlorine that disinfects the water for bacteria [that cause] legionnaires' disease. "NET Health and state officials conducted an investigation of the facility to test the water sources at Harvey Hall as the disease is spread through water particles," NET Health's statement read. "Public health officials confirmed the facility came back negative for any conditions that would allow for Legionnaires' disease to be present."

[The news reports above say that 7 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease and 5 possible cases have been linked to the East Texas State Fair.

East Texas State Fair was held in the city of Tyler, Texas, 20-29 Sep 2019 (https://www.etstatefair.com). It brings an estimated economic impact of USD 9.8 million to the City of Tyler and Smith County, with over 250 000 visitors who come to the fair each year including local families, concertgoers, exhibitors, vendors, contest participants, school groups, entertainers, workers, sponsors, and volunteers (https://www.etstatefair.com/p/about/community-impact). A map of the fairgrounds can be found at https://www.etstatefair.com/p/about/visitor-info/fairgrounds-map.

Tyler, with a population of about 100 000 residents in 2017, is the county seat of Smith County, located in east-central Texas, United States, 100 miles (160 km) east-southeast of Dallas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler,_Texas). A map showing the location of Tyler can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tyler,+TX.

Genotyping clinical and environmental isolates will help identify clusters of cases with a common source and identify the source responsible for infection in these clusters when the genotypes match. At another recent outbreak of legionellosis at the North Carolina Mountain State Fair in Fletcher, North Carolina, there were 132 cases (94%) of legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the infection, and 8 cases (6%) of Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of the infection (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (26): (NC) fatal, agricultural fair, hot tub display susp 20191021.6737887). The source of the North Carolina state fair outbreak is suspected to be a hot tub display in one of the buildings. The source for the East Texas State Fair has apparently has not yet been identified. - Mod.ML
