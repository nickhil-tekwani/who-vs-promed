[The birds involved in this outbreak are free ranging laying hens, so
exposure to wild birds is a definite possibility. The Netherlands have
had severe problems with H7 highly pathogenic strains of the avian
influenza virus. The outbreak in 2003 resulted in the slaughter of 30
million birds, almost 1/3rd of the Dutch poultry stock. Also,
approximately 450 people had symptoms, with the majority of those
having conjunctivitis. - Mod.PC]
