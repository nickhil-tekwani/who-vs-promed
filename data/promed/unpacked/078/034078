Four elk tested positive for chronic wasting disease over the winter at
Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota.

Thirteen elk and 8 deer were tested for the fatal disease with the results
just now becoming available. Animals tested came from road-killed animals
and targeted surveillance for elk demonstrating clinical signs of the disease.

"Our on-going surveillance program to identify and remove suspect animals
from our herds is helping us learn more about this disease in the park,"
said park biologist Dan Roddy. "We are incorporating information gained
from this active surveillance program into the development of our elk
management plan that will address population filtered numbers and movement
patterns both inside and outside park boundaries."

Since 1998, 123 deer and 34 elk in Wind Cave National Park have been tested
for CWD. Of those animals, 8 deer and 8 elk have tested positive for this
disease that is similar to mad cow disease and thought to be caused by a
"prion" or abnormal protein particle. How the disease is transmitted is
unknown, although at this time there is no evidence CWD can be transmitted
to humans.

[It is not new that South Dakota has CWD, but it good news that the park is
targeting road kill to look for the disease. Animals affected with the
disease may be less able to avoid vehicles in the park. - Mod.TG]
