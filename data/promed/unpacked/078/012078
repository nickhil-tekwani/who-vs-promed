[The quoted "IAH (Institute for Animal Health) Pirbright Molecular
Epidemiology Report" at the URL above includes also a dendrogram and
the table "Most Closely Related Viruses", with the 10 FMDV strains
found most closely related to the current Kuwaiti isolate
'O/KUW/1/2011', as follows:

Pos. / virus name / percentage identity / topotype / strain
---------------------------------------------------
1 / O/KUW/2/2011 / 100.00 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
2 / O/ISR/6/2011 / 99.06 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
3 / O/ISR/5/2011 / 98.90 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
4 / O/ISR/7/2011 / 98.90 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
5 / O/ISR/9/2011 / 98.90 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
6 / O/ISR/8/2011 / 98.75 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
7 / O/PAK/1/2010 / 98.59 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
8 / O/PAK/2/2010 / 98.59 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
9 / O/PAK/5/2010 / 98.59 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10
10 / O/PAK/8/2010 / 98.59 / ME-SA / PanAsia-2ANT-10

The close genetic relationship between the Kuwaiti and Israeli 2011
isolates is rather striking, particularly in view of the geographic
distance between the 2 countries (1250 km, 775 miles) and the fact
that there is no direct or indirect trade in animals, their products,
or potential fomites between them. A possible explanation for an
epidemiological link between Kuwait and Israel may be sought in a
potential common source of infection.

With all due caution, one cannot refrain from giving consideration to
Syria as a plausible -- though, in the absence of hard evidence,
hypothetical -- candidate. Syria exports live sheep to Kuwait (see
Syria's export data in FAO statistics, FAOSTAT) and is Israel's north
eastern neighbour, the aerial distance in meters between livestock
holdings and grazing herds on 2 sides of the border counted in 2-digit
and 3-digit figures, allowing airborne transmission. The FMD outbreaks
in Israel during 2011 are presented in the OIE map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529.
Most of them are adjacent to the Syrian border, as well as those of
Lebanon and Jordan. Syria exports sheep also to these 2 countries.

According to OIE's and WRLFMD data, FMD has been last reported from
Syria in 2002 (see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/syr.htm).
According to an April 2011 report, Current Situation and Future Status
of FMD Globally: West Eurasia (JM Hammond,
http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/genses39/App22.pdf),
Syria is counted among the countries where FMD is "intermediate,
sporadic" (see slide 6). Does this reflect the actual situation?

The FMD situation in Syria is in need of elucidation. Enhanced FMD
serosurveillance, addressing large and small ruminants as well as
wildlife (such as wild boars), and, if possible, obtaining samples for
genotyping in a reference laboratory, could improve the understanding
of FMD epidemiology in the Middle East. Reportedly, a serosurvey was
conducted in Syria during 2008 and possibly later as well. Final
results would be appreciated.

During the 2nd Regional Progress Review Meeting of "West Eurasia FMD
Control -- Roadmap 2020", held in Istanbul in December 2010, Syria
submitted a request for technical support in capacity building for
epidemiology, training field vets in differential diagnoses (outbreak
investigation), and for the review of its own risk based control plan.
A serosurvey was said to be planned for 2011 (see table 4 in
http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/Regional_FMD_meetings/2011/Report_Istanbul.pdf).

Hopefully, Syria's requests are met and results of the current survey
will become available soon.- Mod.AS]
