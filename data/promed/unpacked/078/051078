A half-ton pygmy sperm whale found dead late Friday [8 Jul 2011] on
the beach near Bermuda Bay on State Road A1A by a visiting Texas
couple will be studied to determine why these deep ocean marine
mammals are swimming to land and dying.

Scientists want to know whether a heart disease similar to one that
affects humans is the cause, said Steve McCulloch, manager of the
Marine Mammal Research and Conservation Program at Florida Atlantic
University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce.

The whale was the 2nd in 3 days to be found stranded on Indian River
County beaches and the 8th this week to be found beached between North
Carolina and the Florida Keys, McCulloch said.

"The last time we had this number of strandings in this amount of
time was in 1998," he added.

Then, as now, scientists are unsure why the animals left their native
open ocean environment to strand themselves on beaches. McCulloch said
DNA analysis will determine if the whales were related to one another,
possibly members of the same pod.

Blubber from the animals also will be tested to determine the
presence of any natural or manmade toxins.

McCulloch said stranded whales often show signs of a heart muscle
disease called cardiomyopathy, which also afflicts humans. It lessens
the heart's ability to pump blood and is thought to be inherited. [I
wonder what other stresses may cause the heart to show damage. -

McCulloch said Harbor Branch staff veterinarian Juli Goldstein and
Greg Bossart, formerly of Harbor Branch and now chief veterinary
officer at the Georgia Aquarium, are studying cardiomyopathy in whales
under a grant by the National Marine Fisheries Service.

The work done by Harbor Branch's Marine Mammal Research and
Conservation Program is largely funded through the "Save Florida's
Whales" specialty motor vehicle license plate, McCulloch said.

He asked anyone finding whales, sea turtles, birds, or other marine
animals in distress to phone 1-888-404-FWCC.

[While this seems like an interesting theory, I wonder what else is
going on. Is there red tide in the area? What is the navy doing
regarding sonar testing? That has caused some difficulties in the past
with these incredible creatures. So if further investigation is not
done first, then spending funds to investigate a cardiac problem may
be akin to the "wild goose chaseâ€š". If it were a cardiac problem why
would we not see it on a more regular basis? Surely we cannot believe
it happens with regularity and only on special occasions they get
washed ashore.

These seem to occur in roughly 2 year increments. This does not seem
to be cardiomyopathy but rather another cause, and cardiomyopathy is a
result of another problem (sonar?) not the cause of the problem. -
