[Unfortunately, one cannot tell if the etiologic agent in these cases
is Japanese encephalitis virus, as previously reported; undiagnosed
"acute encephalitis syndrome," also previous reported; or something
else entirely. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving further
information as it becomes available.

As many as 55 people, mostly children, have died in Bihar in the last
1.5 months due to encephalitis, the Rajya Sabha [Indian Council of
States] was informed Tuesday [16 Aug 2011]. Health and Family Welfare
Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said clinical and epidemiological data
suggests that it was an outbreak of acute encephalitis syndrome
resulting in 150 cases and 55 deaths, mostly among children.

In a written reply, the minister said these cases were reported early
June to middle July [2011]. He said cases of encephalitis, a rare
brain inflammation caused by a virus, were reported from Muzaffarpur
and its bordering areas in Bihar. Azad said rapid response teams
(RRTs) consisting of experts in epidemiology, entomology,
microbiology, and medicine have been trained and positioned at
district, state, and central levels to mount rapid response to disease
outbreaks. He said RRTs at central level are dispatched to affected
areas as and when the need arises to support local health authorities
in prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of outbreak-prone
diseases.

[The proportion of individuals in this area who are immunized against
JE virus is not stated in this or the previous report. The etiology of
the "acute encephalitis syndrome" mentioned above remains unknown.
Until the etiology of these cases is established, implementation of

[Japanese encephalitis virus infections are being diagnosed widely in
northeastern India. One hopes that people in the areas where the
cases are occurring will take advantage of the free vaccination
program.
