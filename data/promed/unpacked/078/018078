The dog of a Dallas [Texas] nurse diagnosed with Ebola has tested negative for the deadly virus. When Nina Pham was diagnosed with Ebola earlier this month [October 2014], her King Charles Spaniel named Bentley was placed in quarantine with Dallas Animal Services. Bentley was seized from Pham's apartment on 11 Oct 2014 and is being quarantined at the Hensley Field Services Center on West Jefferson Avenue.

In a release Wednesday [22 Oct 2014], the City of Dallas said, "The test results show that Bentley has tested negative for the virus. Specimen collection will be conducted again before the end of the 21-day quarantine period. Bentley will be monitored for a full 21-day period, similar to people exposed to the Ebola virus."

The Centers for Disease Control says there have been no reports of dogs or cats falling ill with Ebola, nor is there any evidence that pets can spread the virus to other people or pets.

After a Spanish nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, authorities decided to euthanize her pet dog, Excalibur. But Dallas officials pledged to do everything they could to avoid that fate for Pham's pet. "We are hopeful that Bentley's journey will contribute to what we know about Ebola and dogs, since they play such an important role in so many peoples lives," said Dallas Animal Services operation manager Dr Cate McManus in a written statement.

Pham is recovering at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. Dallas Animal Services said she is getting regular updates about Bentley's progress.

Texas nurse Nina Pham's dog, Bentley, has tested negative for the Ebola virus, Dallas officials announced on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014]. The 1 year old Cavalier King Charles spaniel was put into quarantine last week after Pham contracted the disease.

Pham, 26, was diagnosed with Ebola this month [October 2014] after taking care of Thomas Eric Duncan, the 1st Ebola patient diagnosed on US soil, at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She stayed in isolation in the hospital for nearly a week and was transferred on Thursday [16 Oct 2014] to a National Institutes of Health clinic in Bethesda, Maryland, for further treatment. On Tuesday [21 Oct 2014], her condition was upgraded to good.

Bentley is to remain in quarantine at Hensley Field, a decommissioned naval air base west of Dallas, for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola. He will be tested again before being released, Dallas spokeswoman Sana Syed said on Twitter. Workers watching over Bentley have been wearing full-body protective suits to make sure they don't catch the deadly virus in case he was infected. But the risk that a person could catch Ebola from a dog is exceedingly low, experts say.

Although there is scientific evidence that pets are vulnerable to infection, there has not been a single case of a dog or cat spreading the virus to people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC says, "there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola," not even in Africa, where the virus was 1st identified in the 1970s.

In Spain this month [October 2014], after a nursing assistant was diagnosed with Ebola, authorities euthanized her dog as a precaution. The move sparked international outrage. On Sunday [19 Oct 2014], an initial test showed that [the nursing assistant's] blood no longer had any traces of the Ebola virus.

[The approach adopted in Texas -- testing the dog for the virus and monitoring for possible infection -- seems sensible. The veterinarians treating and caring for Bentley have said he is the perfect patient -- easy to care for and very responsive to them. It is delightful to know both Ms Pham and Bentley will soon be healthy and reunited. - Mod.TG
