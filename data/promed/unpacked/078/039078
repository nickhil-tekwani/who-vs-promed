Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: In the framework of the academic investigation about porcine viruses performed by the Faculty of Sciences of the University of the Republic, positive animals to the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome were detected through indirect ELISA test and RT-PCR. The 5 affected premises are located in the departments of Salto and Canelones. An epidemiological investigation has started in the affected premises, as well as in pig farms that imported breeding pigs in the last 10 years. Sampling will continue in slaughterhouses. Official services summoned liberal veterinarians to tell them what the situation is and to form a working team. Samples are being analyzed in the DILAVE official laboratory through serology and PCR; in case of positive results, the samples will be sent to an OIE reference laboratory.

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Faculty of Sciences (Private Laboratory)/ Swine / real-time PCR / 12 May 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order _Nidovirales_, family _Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_.

A total of 2 major antigenically different types of the virus exist: Type 1 (previously described as European - EU) and Type 2 (previously North American - NA). Historically, Type 1 was restricted to Europe and Type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally.

"The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faeces, urine, semen and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances has also been confirmed.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.8. 6 "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.06_PRRS.pdf (Adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2015).

There is no evidence of human infection with PRRS virus. - Mod.CRD
