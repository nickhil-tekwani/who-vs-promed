Leishmaniaisis in Calcutta
-------------------------
I believe a correction is warranted. Visceral leishmaniasis in India can be
anthroponotic, i.e. transmission takes place from human host to human
susceptible without the animal reservoir. An important aspect of Indian
Kala-azar is that, contrary to other forms of human visceral leishmaniasis,
Leishmania can be found in the skin.
This can give place to epidemics, as in the past.

[Thank you very much for your additional information. If there is no animal
reservoir, the risk of an outbreak will be much less, and I hope that the
_Leishmania_ from the particular case will be isolated and typed. - Mod.EP
