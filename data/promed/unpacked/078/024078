It was reported in the Australian press this morning that there have been 7
confirmed cases of dengue in North Queensland and possibly up to 50
unconfirmed.

[This cannot be correct. We had already posted a report from Debbie
Phillips (see Dengue - Australia (Queensland) (04) 971222210814)
that there had been 21 confirmed (16 by PCR, 5 by serology; all dengue 3
virus) cases in Cairns. Within the last day we had a report of a dengue
case in Townsville, about 300 miles south of Cairns. The question now is
whether the 7 confirmed and 50 unconfirmed cases are redundant of previous
reports or represent new cases in Cairns, Townsville, both or elsewhere.
We would appreciate it if someone would provide data. - Mod.CHC
