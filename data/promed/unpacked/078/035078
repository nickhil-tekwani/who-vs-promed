Health officials in Puerto Rico have declared an epidemic of dengue
fever. Health secretary Lorenzo Gonzalez says 210 cases have been
confirmed for January [2010], more than triple the number in the same
month of 2007. That year proved the worst for the US Caribbean
territory in nearly a decade, with 11 000 cases.

Gonzalez says no one has died in the latest outbreak. He says only 3
DHF cases have been reported since January [2010].

El Salvador health authorities declared a national health emergency
and on Saturday [27 Feb 2010] announced a yellow alert due to the
increase in dengue cases, saying that they will immediately initiate
massive campaigns to eradicate the mosquito that transmits the disease [virus].

Public health authorities have registered 1530 dengue cases in the
1st 7 weeks of 2010, something never seen in recent years. The
Ministry of Health registered 34 DHF cases, the fatal form of the
disease, but has not reported any fatalities. This number is double
the cases registered in 2006, when DHF caused at least 4 victims
[deaths?], all minors.

The Minister of Public Health, Maria Isabel Rodriguez, told reporters
that the country was facing an epidemic and that it was necessary to
act accordingly.

Meanwhile, the director of the National Commission for Civil
Protection, Jorge Melendez, issued a yellow alert, by means of which
all the aid and [medical] attention for the citizens will be
activated. Melendez said in a press conference that units of
soldiers, personnel from public health units and other governmental
organizations would be sent to fumigate houses in the 262
municipalities of the country. With the activation of the yellow
alert, Civil Protection will have access to the necessary financial
resources to confront the epidemic.

Hospitals and health centers of the country count an average of 200
cases weekly, something unusual for the dry season. Most of the cases
are registered in the central departments [state or province
equivalent] of La Libertad and La Paz, Santa Ana in the western part
of the country, and the El Salvador capital [San Salvador].

Public Health has identified the circulation of 2 [dengue virus]
strains [serotypes], 1 and 2, of the 4 existing dengue [types]. The
presence of several [dengue virus] strains [serotypes] at the same
time trigger more DHF cases.

The authorities have instructed the population to not ignore the
sanitary measures to avoid mosquito breeding [sites] and to be
attentive for [dengue] symptoms to seek early [medical] attention.
They added that a daily monitoring of dengue cases will be maintained
to avoid tragedies such as those registered in the year 2000, when
the disease caused more than 25 deaths, the majority children, among
3000 confirmed cases.

The mosquito-borne dengue fever is spreading once again in Sri Lanka,
especially in northern Jaffna peninsula with a sharp increase in the
number of patients, the data released by the Epidemiology Unit of Sri
Lanka, Health Ministry showed. Over 8000 dengue cases have been
reported so far in the 1st 2 months of the year [2010] and 46 of them
have been fatal according to the figures released by the Epidemiology
Unit on Friday [26 Feb 2010]. The number of cases has risen nearly
260 percent from the corresponding figure during the same period last
year [2009]. So far 8001 cases have been reported for the months of
January and February [2010] opposed to the 2227 cases reported in 2009.

The dengue epidemic was mostly prevalent in Colombo, Gampaha, and
Jaffna districts. Nearly half of the deaths have been reported from
these 3 districts. The Jaffna district reported the highest number of
cases with 1557 patients and 8 deaths while Gampaha district recorded
1004 cases and 6 deaths. There were 954 reported cases and 7 deaths
in the Colombo district.

According to the director of the Epidemiology Unit, Dr Paba
Palihawadana, the public help in destroying the breeding grounds of
dengue mosquito is essential to control the spread of the disease.

The government is to purchase the larvicidal bacteria, _Bacillus
thuringiensis israelensis_ (BTI) from a Cuban company to control the
fast spreading dengue epidemic in the country.
