Horse owners caught flouting bans
--------------------------------------
More than 20 people have been caught flouting the
ban on horse movements around Queensland as the
equine influenza crisis continues into its 7th
day. Inspector Ian Robertson, of Queensland
Police's Stock and Rural Crime Investigation
Squad, said 24 people had been intercepted
transporting horses illegally since the equine standstill began.
They face a maximum penalty of $150,000 or 2
years' jail, however it is uncertain whether any
of those caught will be punished. Under the
standstill, no horses of any type, including
pets, riding club horses, show animals, donkeys,
mules or zebras are allowed to be moved.
Inspector Robertson said despite the breaches and
some confusion in the community about exactly
what the ban meant, most people had obeyed the
rules. "The standstill refers to all forms of
horse movements including walking or riding them
as well as transporting horses by vehicle," Inspector Robertson said.
Meanwhile, the racing industry, crippled by the
EI outbreak, will begin its recovery in Melbourne
today, where the 2007 Spring Racing Carnival
kicks off at Caulfield today. The meet won't be
without its hurdles, however. Authorities have
been forced to establish exclusion zones within
the racecourse to prevent contact between horse
handlers and the public. Trainers won't be
permitted to have any contact with owners and
they, in turn, won't be permitted within 20
metres [21.9 yards] of their horses.
Queensland and New South Wales remain in the grip
of the illness, however experts agree the
infection is of a milder strain. Most of the 700
horses trained at Sydney's Randwick Racecourse
are expected to succumb to EI over the next few
days after the disease was confirmed in 8 horses there.
Experts agree the EI infections in New South
Wales and Queensland are of a milder variety.
Still the virus has been enough to bring the
multi-billion dollar industry to a staggering
halt over the past week. The costs are mounting
day by day and racing officials are looking for
more help after a 4 million emergency package from the federal government.
Information about the disease and the quarantine
restrictions are available on the Department of
Primary Industries and Fisheries website at

[Given the stiff penalty for violation of the
standstill order, it seems quite a risk that
individuals are taking to move their animals or animal waste.
Equine influenza is considered an exotic disease
in Australia and they are eradicating the disease
from the continent. Consequently this outbreak is
a setback for them. The fact the they are
involved in an eradication effort may explain why
they have elected not to vaccinate, in the sense
that the diagnostics cannot distinguish between
the vaccinated animal and the infected animal.
This situation is not uncommon when a country is
eradicating a disease, or when technology has not
yet advanced to be able to develop diagnostics
that distinquish between infected and vaccinated animals.
Regarding the disease, a review is presented below:
Influenza type A virus, 2 sub-types A/equi-1 and
A/equi-2. In the same Orthomyxoviridae family as
human and avian influenza viruses. Occurs in all
horse species. Transmission to humans under
natural conditions of exposure has not been reported.
The disease is endemic in Europe and North
America, but does not occur often due to the high
level of vaccination undertaken. Periodic
epidemics have occurred in other parts of the
world, including South Africa, India, China,
Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and South America.
Equine influenza virus is rapidly spread by the
respiratory route especially when there is close
direct contact between horses. Infected horses
excrete the virus in their expired air for up to
8 days after initial infection and coughing
contributes to the spread. There is no long term carrier state.
Equine influenza virus survives in the
environment for up to 36 hours but is easily
killed by cleaning and disinfection. Infection
can be spread by contaminated horse transport
floats, grooming and veterinary instruments.
Wind-borne virus may spread for up to 8 km [about
5 miles]. Outbreaks are most likely to occur when
horses are congregated together.
Clinical signs
------------
The incubation period is 1-5 days. A fever up to
41 Deg C [68 Deg F] is followed by a cough, which
is dry and hacking during the first few days but
later becomes moist and less frequent. There is a
nasal discharge which is initially serous and
later mucous or mucopurulent. Affected horses can
be lethargic, easily fatigued and lose their
appetite. If the animal is rested, recovery is
complete in 1-3 weeks. The disease is
particularly severe in donkeys. Deaths are rare
unless secondary respiratory infections occur.
Laboratory samples
----------------------
Specimens of nasal discharges should be collected
from early clinical cases to isolate the virus.
The nasal passages can be washed out with sterile
normal saline to which 10 percent brain-heart
infusion broth has been added and antibiotics
(obtain from a veterinary laboratory).
Alternatively a deep nasal swab is inserted and
placed in the same solution as above. Serum and
clotted blood samples should be collected from
horses showing early clinical signs, and repeat
blood samples from the same horses 2-4 weeks later.
Differential diagnosis
-----------------
The main features of equine influenza are the
explosiveness of outbreaks, the high number of
infected horses and the prominence of coughing.
Other diseases with similar signs are: equine
rhinopneumonitis, equine viral arteritis,
Pasteurellosis, strangles, other bacterial infections.
Outbreaks of this disease in Australia will be
controlled according to the nationally agreed
AUSVETPLAN. The initial measure is to control
movements of all horses in order to minimize
spread of the disease. Vaccination of at-risk
animals may be used to contain the spread of the
disease and build up immunity in the horse population.
The most important treatment is complete rest for
2-3 weeks. A dust-free environment is desirable.
Supportive therapy, such as antibiotics,
expectorants and cough suppressants, is
administered if required. During an outbreak, it
may be necessary to destroy a small number of
horses that have severe secondary infections. All
horse industries and subsidiary industries are
affected with considerable economic consequences.
The major effect is on racing and other
equestrian competitions, breeding, shows and
sales because of movement restrictions. Exports
of horses and equine products may be banned to
some countries until the disease is contained.

Regarding the standstill on movement:
-------------------------------------
The movement of animals without an inspector's
approval is against the law and the maximum
penalty for contravention of an Equine Standstill
Zone is currently 150 000 AUD [122 792 USD] or 2 years imprisonment.
It has been agreed that all states and
territories will implement a standstill on the
movement of horses. This standstill is in place
until revoked by the minister. No equine events
and gatherings can take place during the standstill.
Horse owners must not move horses from their
properties. They should keep themselves informed
about updates for further restrictions. Avoid
contact between your horses and other horses.
Race meetings and other horse events have been called off in Australian states.

There are vaccines overseas but none will be
available for use in the short term, especially
since vaccination can complicate the diagnosis of
the disease. Biosecurity Queensland is working to
eradicate the infection, so that permanent
vaccination of horses in Australia will not be required.
This information is taken from the AUSVETPLAN for
Equine Influenza which can be obtained from Animal Health Australia.
The recommendation for treatment of EI is that
horses are rested in a dust-free, well-ventilated
environment and receive supportive therapy. At
least 30 days complete rest is recommended after
infection, with a longer period being required if
the fever extends for more than 4 days. Rest
reduces the opportunity for secondary infection and hastens complete recovery.
Supportive treatment is important to minimise
complications and includes expectorants, cough
suppressants and mucolytics. Antipyretics and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may be
indicated in stallions or pregnant mares with
very high fevers, to avoid testicular
degeneration in the former or abortion in the
latter. Treatment of secondary bacterial
infections with antibiotics may be indicated,
particularly if fever persists for longer than
4-5 days and is accompanied by increasingly
abundant and thick nasal discharge. Hyperimmune
serum collected from recently recovered (more
than14 days since recovery) adult horses may be a
useful therapy for young foals.
Currently there is no specific antiviral
treatment registered for use for treatment of EI.
