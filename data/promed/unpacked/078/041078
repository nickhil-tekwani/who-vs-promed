News of the response
Field visits
------------
- The minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, made a 4 day mission this week to Beni, Goma and Butembo. The purpose of the mission was to assess the challenges and needs to facilitate the implementation of the update of the National Response Plan 2 (Strategic Response Plan 2.1) and prepare the National Response Plan 3, which will cover the period from February through April 2019. The National Response Plan 2 (November 2018 through January 2019) was updated during December [2018] to take into account new technical and financial requirements related to the evolution of the epidemic. This constant adaptation of the national strategy demonstrates the dynamic nature of this response to the most complex Ebola outbreak in the country's history.
- The revised response plan aims to integrate all participants in the local health system in the response and strengthening of the health system. In Goma, the minister held working meetings with the Provincial Health Division of North Kivu to ensure better leadership of the provincial health authorities in overseeing the operations of the response. In Butembo, the minister visited the new local coordinating committees in the health zones of Katwa and Butembo to better anchor the response in the community. The minister then arrived in Beni on Thu 20 Dec 2018, where the new measures put in place in October [2018] have significantly reduced the number of Ebola cases in the city, which reported only one case in the past 5 days.
- He took advantage of his visit to the city to attend the grand finale of the football tournament "Ebola Pas Chez Moi", where the best teams of Beni and Butembo met to win the Cup of Hope. After launching the tournament 2 weeks ago, the minister was able to present the cup to the winners, the Cafe Sport team from Beni. He warmly congratulated all 47 teams of young footballers from Beni and Butembo who, beyond their athletic prowess, were also brand ambassadors for the youth response in these 2 big cities of North Kivu.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda Health Zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako Health Zone).
- Continued immunization of primary care providers in the Goma Health Zone.
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 49 940 people have been vaccinated [see the source URL for complete breakdown of numbers vaccinated and where].

[byline: Julia Manuel]

3 to 4 months more
------------------
Health minister Kalenga looked at the 2nd strategic plan in place, covering November 2018 through January 2019, and held meetings with concerned provincial health officials. In another interview, he said this outbreak will "certainly" last for 3 to 4 months more.

The World Health Organization claimed there was significant progress seen in the affected areas, especially in Beni, where a decrease in Ebola cases was observed. However, it further said that the outbreak "continues to be a complex challenge".

- 21 Dec 2018. The DRC'S Ebola outbreak is an end-of-year nightmare
[Wired, abridged, edited]

Initial hopes that the vaccine would be enough to contain the outbreak have withered as new disease clusters have appeared in new locations. Each of these new areas has experienced "community deaths" in recent weeks, which means they took place outside a treatment center or other healthcare setting, increasing the risk that more people came into contact with a body. Should the outbreak spread more widely in Butembo, the number of people exposed could quickly strain the supply of vaccines.

[byline: Megan Molteni]

Six months after the 1st case of Ebola was confirmed in the DRC's conflict-torn border province of North Kivu, the outbreak is still raging, leaving a trail of fractured families and hundreds of orphans in its wake. In the last month [November to December 2018] alone, 20% of all new cases have been reported. Now an upcoming election and holiday travel are mobilizing the population, making a tough situation even harder to control.

The country's emergency health response is understaffed. Because of the security threats posed by the militia, the US State Department withdrew Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staffers from the outbreak zones earlier this fall [2018]. CDC employs some of the world's leading Ebola experts. On 14 Dec 2018, the US Embassy in Kinshasa announced it had ordered all nonemergency government staff and family members out of the country.

According to a US State Department official, some Ebola responders will remain at the Kinshasa embassy as part of essential staff. "The US remains strongly committed to supporting the Congolese government's efforts to contain the ongoing Ebola outbreak," the official said, while declining to offer any specifics. CDC referred questions about its current Ebola efforts to the State Department.

Initial hopes that the vaccine would be enough to contain the outbreak have withered as new disease clusters have appeared in new locations. Each of these new areas has experienced "community deaths" in recent weeks, which means they took place outside a treatment center or other healthcare setting, increasing the risk that more people came into contact with a body. Should the outbreak spread more widely in Butembo, the number of people exposed could quickly strain the supply of vaccines.

- Thu 20 Dec 2018. Ebola virus disease - DRC -- Disease Outbreak News: update 20 Dec 2018
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, edited]
<https://www.who.int/csr/don/20-december-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to be a complex challenge. Pockets of community reluctance and the conflict setting continue to obstruct activities in some affected areas. Additional challenges may also be anticipated during the ongoing election period, which may lead to heightened political tension, a deterioration of the overall security situation and violent civil unrest -- presenting an indirect threat to the Ebola response operations.

Despite these difficulties, meaningful progress has been made across the outbreak-affected areas, most especially in Beni where there has been a general decrease in case incidence in recent weeks. The control of the outbreak there, and previously in the city of Mangina, demonstrates how the outbreak can be controlled when response activities can be scaled and implemented with the participation of local communities. While the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners work toward similar progress in Katwa, Butembo and other emerging clusters, we must acknowledge the unique challenges arising from each geographical area. The introduction, acceptance and resulting impact of interventions on the epidemiology of the outbreak will take time. Response teams continue to adapt and scale up the application of evidence-based public health measures and innovative tools.

Currently, the outbreak remains active across a geographically dispersed area covering 14 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Over the past 21 days [27 Nov to 18 Dec 2018], 114 new confirmed cases have been reported from Katwa (31), Beni (18), Komanda (17), Butembo (14), Mabalako (14), Kalunguta (5), Oicha (4), Vuhovi (3), Kyondo (3), Biena (1), Mandima (1), Masereka (1), Musienene (1), and Mutawanga (1). Only Tchomia Health Zone has not confirmed any new cases since the cluster was detected in mid-August [2018]. Amplification of the outbreak within these areas has been driven by a combination of social/community transmission and transmission within private and public health centres. In the past week, 2 new infections of health workers have been reported -- 55 (53 confirmed and 2 probable) health workers have been infected to date, of whom 19 have died.

Cumulatively as of 18 Dec 2018, 549 EVD cases (501 confirmed and 48 probable), including 326 deaths (case fatality ratio 59%), have been reported in 12 health zones in North Kivu Province and 3 health zones in Ituri Province (see figure 1 at source URL). Overall trends in case incidence (see figure 2 at source URL) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these areas, with an average of 35 new cases reported each week since mid-October [2018].

Small but meaningful victories continue to be won with the discharge of survivors from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs), aided by more timely admissions to ETCs and use of Ebola therapeutics together with supportive care measures. In the past week, 18 additional patients were discharged from ETCs. Overall, 193 patients have recovered to date [20 Dec 2018].

Although all credible alerts outside of the abovementioned affected areas have tested negative for EVD to date, there remains a very high risk of further geographical spread within North Kivu and Ituri, to other provinces of the DRC, and to neighbouring countries. Preparedness and operational readiness activities across these areas must continue to be scaled up to mitigate this risk, and rapidly detect and respond to any potential cases.

Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to be closely monitored. Since our last report on 7 Dec 2018 (Weekly Bulletin 49), 37 new confirmed EVD cases and 30 new deaths have been reported.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The EVD outbreak in the DRC continues to be of significant concern, with continuing insecurity, population mobility and pockets of community reluctance, as well as the potential social disruption and violence associated with the ongoing election activities. The major challenges lie in investigating new confirmed cases without clear epidemiological links to other cases and comprehensively listing contacts of the new confirmed cases. The national authorities and partners need to strengthen all response pillars while remaining vigilant in the face of the upcoming general elections.

See figure at the source URL showing the geographical distribution of confirmed and probable EVD cases reported from 1 May to 15 Dec 2018, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC.

- Fri 21 Dec 2018. As Ebola threatens mega-cities, vaccine stockpile needs to grow
[Reuters, abridged, edited]
https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-stockpile/as-ebola-threatens-mega-cities-vaccine-stockpile-needs-grow-idUKKCN1OJ21B
[Byline: Kate Kelland]

Doubts are growing about whether the world's emergency stockpile of 300 000 Ebola vaccine doses is enough to control future epidemics as the deadly disease moves out of rural forest areas and into urban mega-cities. Outbreak response experts at WHO and at the vaccines alliance GAVI are already talking to the leading Ebola vaccine manufacturer, Merck, to reassess just how much larger global stocks need to be.

"We're actively engaged with the World Health Organization and with groups like GAVI, the US government and others to try to understand what will be an appropriate sized stockpile in the future," Merck's head of vaccines clinical research, Beth-Ann Coller, said in a telephone interview. Supply of the Merck shot, which is currently being used to fight a large and spreading outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, is not a problem right now, according to the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, Peter Salama.

But the nature of Ebola outbreaks is changing, he told Reuters. As the virus finds its way out of rural villages into populous urban settings, plans for how to contain it in future must change too. "What I'm concerned about is the medium- to long-term stockpile. The figure of 300 000 was very much based on previous Ebola outbreaks where you never really had huge numbers of cases because they were in isolated, rural, populations. But now, we increasingly see Ebola in mega-cities and towns. We need to view it now as an urban disease as well as a rural one -- and therefore one requiring a different order of magnitude of preparations, including vaccines," he said.

[It would be wise to start increasing the vaccine stockpile of the rVSV-EBOV vaccine in preparation for the worst-case scenario that Ebola becomes active in a mega-city. The effectiveness of the vaccine has been demonstrated, and it seems a good time to build the emergency stockpile to greater than 300 000 doses, which would be needed to respond to a major urban outbreak. - Mod.LK
