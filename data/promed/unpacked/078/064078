Public Health Dispatch: Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus --
Pennsylvania, 2002
-------------------------------------------------
_Staphylococcus aureus_ is one of the most common causes of hospital- and
community-acquired infections (1,2). Since the recognition of
vancomycin-resistant enterococci in 1988, the emergence of
vancomycin-resistant _S. aureus_ (VRSA) (minimum inhibitory concentration
[MIC] greater than 32 microg/mL [3]) has been anticipated. The transfer of
the genetic element containing the vanA vancomycin resistance gene from
_Enterococcus faecalis_ to _S. aureus_ was demonstrated in the laboratory in
1992 (4); the first clinical infection with VRSA was reported in July 2002
(5).
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5126a1.htm>
This report describes the second documented clinical isolate of VRSA from a
patient.
On 20 Sep 2002, the patient was admitted to a hospital in Pennsylvania and
evaluated for chronic foot ulcer and possible osteomyelitis. A culture of
the ulcer grew _S. aureus_. This isolate was tested for antimicrobial
susceptibility by disk diffusion; a vancomycin-agar screen plate (brain
heart infusion agar containing 6 microg/mL vancomycin) also was inoculated.
Growth on the vancomycin screen plate and a 12 mm zone of inhibition around
the vancomycin disk suggested that the isolate had decreased susceptibility
to vancomycin. Further testing by Etest(R) confirmed that the isolate was
resistant to vancomycin (MIC=64 microg/mL).
Following notification of the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PDH), the
isolate was forwarded to CDC, where it was confirmed to be VRSA (vancomycin
MIC=32 microg/mL by broth microdilution testing). The isolate contained both
the mecA and vanA genes mediating oxacillin and vancomycin resistance,
respectively. The isolate was susceptible to chloramphenicol, linezolid,
minocycline, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampin, and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
The patient has been discharged from the hospital and is responding to
antimicrobial treatment. The patient is receiving home-health care. PDH and
CDC are assisting health-care providers investigating this case of VRSA. The
goals of this investigation include assessment of infection-control
practices in the hospital and home setting, and the possibility of
transmission of the organism to other patients, health-care providers, and
family or social contacts. Previous investigations of VRSA and
vancomycin-intermediate _S. aureus_ in the home setting demonstrated no
transmission among family or home health-care contacts (5)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5126a1.htm> (6).
The presence of vanA in this VRSA suggests that the resistance determinate
was acquired from a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Development of this
VRSA appears to be unrelated to the previous VRSA identified in Michigan (5)
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5126a1.htm>
However, because both were probably the result of conjugation events,
additional VRSA infections are likely to occur. Therefore, clinical
microbiology laboratories must ensure that they are using susceptibility
testing methods that will detect VRSA and that they are saving potential
VRSA for confirmatory testing. In addition, more systematic surveillance for
VRSA will enhance the ability of the public health system and the
health-care system to address this resistant pathogen rapidly.
The public health response to this VRSA occurrence is ongoing. Using proper
infection-control practices and good antimicrobial agent management will
help limit the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant
microorganisms, including VRSA. CDC recommends contact precautions when
caring for patients with these infections, including placing the patient in
a private room, wearing gloves and a gown during patient contact, washing
hands after contact with the patient and infectious body tissues or fluids,
and not sharing patient-care items with other patients. CDC guidelines for
preventing spread of VRSA are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/10_20.pdf.>
Isolates of _S. aureus_ with confirmed or "presumptive" vancomycin
resistance should be saved and reported through state and local health
departments to CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, National
Center for Infectious Diseases, telephone 800-893-0485.

[This is the second well-documented case of VRSA. It is likely that the
history of this patient is similar to the previous case -- prolonged use of
vancomycin -- although that information is not given in the MMWR report.
Although this isolate was sensitive to linezolid and
quinupristin-dalfopristin, relatively little information is available on the
treatment of deep-seated _S. aureus_ with such antimicrobials. - Mod.LL]
