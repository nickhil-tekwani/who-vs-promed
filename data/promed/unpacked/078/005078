The Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS) have confirmed the deaths of 10 Grevy's
zebras in Samburu Game Reserve in Kenya due to anthrax. Grevy's zebras are
rare, and their deaths have prompted the veterinary officers of KWS to
start vaccinating other zebras in the reserve. The Veterinary Department
has also started immunizing animals in the surrounding areas to stop
domestic animals from being affected.

[Our thanks to Dr. Sharif. I must admit to being somewhat puzzled, as the
American field team found and sampled the 1st dead Grevy's zebras in the
Samburu Game Reserve in mid-December 2005. We posted the 1st Kenya report
on 4 Jan 2006. This report of an official Kenya response is dated 21 Jan
2006. I can remember a similar response reaction time when there was an
epidemic of Rift Valley Fever some years ago. It too was over the Christmas
holidays. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax outbreak could have been averted
-----------------------------------------------
That anthrax has broken out in Maragua and elsewhere with animal and human
victims is a tragedy. The media have done very well to sensitize the public
on the issue, and hopefully, readers and listeners will learn and act to
prevent further prevalence of the disease.
The Kenya Veterinary Association is concerned that the full story has not
yet been told, and as such, great lessons are likely to be lost. A study of
all media reports reveals that the following questions have not yet been
answered:
* Could the outbreak in animals have been prevented, and if so, why was it not?
* Could the outbreaks among people have been averted?
* Who takes responsibility for the tragedy?
* Is the Maragua case all there is, or is it just the tip of the iceberg?
* Is there a law to prevent such a tragedy?
The animal outbreak could have been prevented. Indeed, the Department of
Veterinary Services jointly with the Kenya Veterinary Association (KVA)
carried out a mass vaccination campaign in the district hardly a month
before the outbreak, covering over 17 000 cattle. The vaccine used protects
cattle adequately for a period of 6 months to a year.
The turnout of cattle was low, about 40 percent of the target. Many farmers
failed to present their animals, thereby precipitating this tragedy. This
low turnout was not just in the affected Ichagaki location but also in
other highly contaminated areas of Kandara division and parts of
neighboring Murang'a district. A large percentage of cattle in these areas
are still unprotected and are prone to anthrax.
The spread of anthrax from animals to people is easily preventable when
farmers and the general public take certain farm and personal hygiene measures.
Firstly, farmers should seek the advice of registered veterinary surgeons
in the event of sickness or death of their animals. Reporting of suspected
cases or cadavers of notifiable diseases, including anthrax, to the
veterinary officer is a legal requirement that all farmers should abide
with. Opening up of any cadaver should be left to the veterinary surgeon,
who is the only person qualified to make a diagnosis and give the required
advice. The law specifically prohibits opening up of anthrax cadavers by
anyone, including the veterinary surgeon. This is intended to prevent
environmental contamination with the long-surviving anthrax spores.
Secondly, farmers and other members of the public should only buy and eat
meat from licensed butcheries. Such meat must have been slaughtered in
licensed abattoirs and inspected by government personnel and must bear a
"GK approved" stamp. Eating meat from cadavers or from home-slaughtered
animals leads to such tragedies as the Maragua one.
Some farmers do slaughter animals in their terminal stages of disease with
the wrong belief that so long as the animal bleeds, "the disease will come
out with the blood." The truth is that disease-causing organisms are not
just in the blood but are in all other tissues, and in any case, not all
blood comes out during slaughter.
Other farmers believe that burying cadavers without severing the head or
removing the skin will lead to a bad omen so that surviving animals will
not multiply. It is such beliefs that precipitate human infection with
anthrax, and they should, therefore, be corrected and farmers properly advised.
The farmers of the affected area take most of the blame for this tragedy.
They failed to present their animals for vaccination when called upon to do
so. And when animals started getting sick, they failed to report the
disease or consult the relevant qualified veterinarians. And then, when
animals were terminally ill or had died, they ate them and sold the meat to
their neighbors. Had the animals been vaccinated or a qualified vet called
for advice, this tragedy would not have happened.
The veterinary profession also takes part of the blame. Reports of a quack
meat inspector who had passed the meat as fit for human consumption
indicates that the profession was not in full control. The Kenya Veterinary
Board will need to crack the whip and curb illegal veterinary services,
meat inspection included. And the veterinary professional fraternity will
need to work harder to sensitize farmers on good livestock practices.
The government itself cannot escape blame. Mass vaccinations of animals are
compulsory according to the Animal Diseases Act. The veterinary officer has
authority to enforce compliance to calls for mass vaccinations. However,
over the years, enforcement of this law has become lax such that farmers
have forgotten their legal responsibilities.
Vaccination defaulters retain the disease-causing organisms in the
environment and lead to outbreaks even in areas where mass vaccination
projects have been undertaken, as was the case in Maragua. And when
defaulters' animals come down with notifiable disease, quarantine
restrictions will have to be imposed in the entire neighborhood, thereby
harming the marketing interests of even the compliant farmers.
The government will need to enforce the law on mass vaccinations and this,
coupled with more intense public education by the veterinary professionals,
will finally succeed in averting anthrax and other diseases once and for all.
