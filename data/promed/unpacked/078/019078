1st report of Hop stunt viroid from plum in China

Japan. Accepted for publication 29 Jun 2006.
Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) was 1st described from hops with stunt disease in
Japan (Yamamoto et al., 1970). HSVd belongs to the genus _Hostuviroid_
(family _Pospiviroidae_) and has the broadest host range known for any
viroid. It has since been found in a wide range of herbaceous and woody
hosts, including cucumber, grapevine, citrus, plum, peach, pear, apricot,
almond and pomegranate (Astruc et al., 1996). HSVd has been isolated from
plums with dapple fruit disease in Japan (Sano et al., 1989), where the
viroid occurs frequently. However, while plums originated in China and are
extensively cultivated there, HSVd infection in this host in China has
never been reported.
In September 2005, 6 plum varieties were collected from the Institute of
Fruit Science in Changping district in Beijing, Peoples Republic of China.
Total RNA was extracted (Li et al., 1995) from leaves and used for dot blot
and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results of
dot blot and RT-PCR showed that one of the 6 samples was positive for HSVd.
The positive sample came from one of the most popular and widely grown
varieties in China (Dashizaosheng). There were no clear symptoms on leaves
or bark when the samples were collected. A 297 bp DNA fragment was
amplified from the sample by RT-PCR using primers R1
(5'-GCTGGATTCTGAGAAGAGTT-3') for the RT reaction, followed by R2
(5'-AACCCGGGGCTCCTTTCTCA-3') and F3 (5'-AACCCGGGGCA ACTCTTCTC-3') for PCR,
with both R2 and F3 primers including SmaI sites. The primers were
complementary to residues 87-106 (R1), 67-84 (R2) and 79-96 (F3) of HSVd
sequence Accession no. Y09349, respectively. Amplified products were cloned
into pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, USA), and positive clones were selected by
digestion with SmaI. Five clones were sequenced, and 2 different sequences
were obtained for those parts of the amplicons between the primers. Both
were more than 99 percent identical to Acc. No. AB098501. One sequence
(Acc. No. DQ648600) obtained from 3 clones had a single nucleotide change
(G107->A). The other one sequence (Acc. No. DQ648601) obtained from 2
clones had 2 nucleotide changes (C59->T; G107->A).
Many varieties of plum are grown in China. In further investigation, HSVd
was detected in a further 7 samples, of various varieties, out of 38
samples collected in China. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of
HSVd isolated from plum in China.

[The fruit crop plant plum, _Prunus domestica_, develops dapple or no
symptoms when infected by the hop stunt viroid (family: _Pospiviroidae_,
genus: _Hostuviroid_, HSVd). HSVd consists of a 295-303 nucleotide circular
single-stranded RNA. It has been found in a wide range of herbaceous and
woody hosts, where the infection seems to be latent (such as grapevine,
apricot, pear) or may induce specific disease symptoms such as hop stunt,
citrus cachexia, and dapple fruit of plum and peach. It has also been
reported in cucumber.
The results presented in the report indicate HSVd is not difficult to find
in plum in China, despite this being the 1st report in that host. No
symptoms have been associated with these findings. The detection of HSVd in
plum in China is significant in part because this is the geographical
origin of the species and because of the threat this pathogen could have to
the other crops it infects. Like other viroids, HSVd is transmitted
mechanically, by budding and grafting, and by vegetative propagation. Note
that HSVd has been reported in grape (20051222.366) and apricot
(20060523.1456) in China. The report in apricot is a companion to this report.
At present, isolates of HSVd are divided into at least 5 groups using
sequence data obtained from Spain, France, Italy, USA and Japan: 3 major
groups (plum-type, hop-type and citrus-type), each containing isolates from
only a limited number of isolation hosts, and 2 minor groups that are
presumed to derive from recombination events between members of the main
groups.
