One person died, and some 70 others have become ill in Port Sudan [capital of Red Sea state] as a result of an unknown viral disease. A medical team was supposed to arrive to Port Sudan on Sunday [15 Jun 2014] for investigation. Sources speculate that the virus must be the deadly coronavirus.

The Director of Epidemiology of the Federal Ministry of Health, Hayat Salaheldin, told the press on Sunday [15 Jun 2014] that such a virus does not exist in Port Sudan.

The coronavirus is a viral respiratory illness with a high fatality rate. Since it was 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, it has been named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The initial source of the virus is still unknown. MERS-CoV has been found in camels in Qatar, Sudan, Tunis, and Spain. The virus can be transmitted to other people in close contact with a patient.

Cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, and Yemen. Imported cases have also been reported by Kuwait, Egypt, Lebanon, Tunisia, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, the Philippines, Malaysia, and the USA. Most of these infections were acquired in the Middle East, according to the proceedings of the Regional Technical Consultation Meeting on MERS-CoV in Muscat, Oman on 20-21 May 2014.

[More information on this reported outbreak in Port Sudan would be greatly appreciated. The absence of information providing symptoms and signs of the disease renders it virtually impossible to postulate on what the disease might be. The speculation above that this might be due to MERS-CoV seems somewhat premature, although is suggestive that the outbreak might involve respiratory symptoms. In the past few days, there have been media reports of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in the Red Sea state (where Port Sudan is the capital). The media reports of VHF also do not mention specific symptoms. (Please see the ProMED-mail post Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Sudan: (RS) RFI for more details on the reported possible viral hemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Red Sea state of Sudan). Hence it is unclear if there are 2 separate unrelated outbreaks ongoing in the Red Sea State of Sudan, or if there is one outbreak that is being attributed to 2 separate etiologic agents, or if there is any specific large scale outbreaks ongoing in the Red Sea State at the moment.
