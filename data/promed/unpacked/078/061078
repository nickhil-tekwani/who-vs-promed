4 people died from cholera
--------------------------
At least 4 people at Pwintphyu Township, Magwe Division in central Burma,
died from cholera, which broke out after the inundations caused by heavy
rains during September 2004.
The flood waters brought sewage into homes, and many people suffered from
cholera at Yeboke Gyi Village. As a result, a 44-year-old, a 35-year-old,
and 2 30-year-olds died from the outbreak.
The floods also destroyed the paddy-crops twice, causing farmers acute
difficulties, and they are finding it hard to replant the new batch of
paddies. They could not afford to replant the rice due to the cost and are
waiting the chance to grow cold-season crops.

Ugandan govt. dispatches task force to camp following cholera outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan government has dispatched a multi-disciplinary national rapid
response team to the Pabbo internally displaced persons' camp in northern
district of Gulu following a cholera outbreak there, reported Radio Uganda
on Fri, 15 Oct 2004.
The team, composed of members from the Ministry of Health, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organization(WHO) and
Institute of Public Health, has been sent to support the Gulu district
interventions.
According to a press release by the Ministry of Health, 6 cases have
already been identified in the camp, which has a population of over 60 000.
1 person has died in the camp following the cholera outbreak.
The ministry warned that given the living conditions in the internally
displaced persons' camps, the risk of spread is potentially high, but
assured that Gulu district has already reactivated the district cholera
task force. A cholera treatment unit has also been set up to isolate and
treat those affected people, according to the release.

Cholera epidemic kills dozens in Guinea
----------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic has killed at least 77 people in central and western
Guinea since late June, the public health service said on Fri, 15 Oct 2004.
The deaths were among 875 cases of cholera, which has made a resurgence in
2004 owing to heavy rains across the region that have helped to spread the
water-borne bacterial illness. The capital Conakry was among the regions
hit, with 20 dying here from a total of 361 cases, according to Director of
Public Health Dr Mahy Barry.
Western Guinea was hit by a cholera outbreak in Jun 2003, which claimed 83
lives from 183 reported cases. Cholera epidemics in 1994, 2000, and 2001
left hundreds of dead in Guinea.
