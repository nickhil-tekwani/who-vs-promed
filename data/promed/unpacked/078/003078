The blood of 3 British donors who were subsequently found to have variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human form of mad cow disease, was
sold in 11 countries, a newspaper reported [on Mon 5 Feb 2001. Thousands
of patients worldwide and a number of hemophiliacs in Britain could have
been treated with the blood products between 1996 and 2000, the Guardian
said. The British Health Ministry [Department of Health said any risk of
infection was, for the moment, hypothetical.
Irish authorities had admitted before Christmas that a polio vaccine
administered in 1998 and 1999 contained albumin from a British CJD disease
victim who had given blood in 1996 and 1997. Babies and infants [in the
United Kingdom received most of the 83 500 doses of the vaccine. Brazil
also received 45 000 doses of albumin. There have been 94 known victims of
the disease in Britain, 13 of them donors of blood used to transfuse 23
other people and to make derivative products, the newspaper said.
A branch of the National Health Service, the Bio Products Laboratory, sells
blood products to countries including Dubai, India, Turkey, Brunei, Egypt,
Morocco, Oman, Singapore and Russia, the Guardian reported. "There is no
scientific evidence to suggest (variant) vCJD can be transmitted through
plasma or plasma-related products, nor through blood donations in general,"
a Bio Products spokesman said.
