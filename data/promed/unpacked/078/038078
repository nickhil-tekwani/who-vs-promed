Four types of coffee diseases -- an aggressive strain of rust, ojo de gallo, anthracnose, and thread blight -- are reported to affect coffee plantings in the department of Jinotega in north-central Nicaragua. Yields of small producers are reduced by 25 to 40 percent resulting in virtually no financial gain for them. Medium and large scale producers report similar problems. Due to a negative "domino effect," the entire economy of the department is affected.

The neighbouring department of Matagalpa estimates that the rust has affected between 20 and 30 percent of the plantations. They are about to determine the actual incidence of the disease in the department. Anthracnose outbreaks in the coffee growing areas have also caused alarm among the farmers because the adverse conditions could badly affect yields and bean quality.

[The fungal pathogens referred to above are coffee leaf rust (_Hemileia vastatrix_), ojo de gallo (_Mycena citricolor_), anthracnose (_Colletotrichum_ species) and thread blight (_Corticium koleroga_). For further information on these diseases, see links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.

A new, more virulent strain of coffee rust is emerging in the region (ProMED-mail post 20120511.1129720). It affects coffee grown at higher altitudes, which previously was largely free of rust outbreaks, and is causing major concern for local producers. In Nicaragua, it has been reported that about 50 000 acres of coffee in Jinotega are currently affected by rust (see link below).
