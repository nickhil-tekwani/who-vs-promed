International initiative to face devastating crop disease
-------------------
Septoria tritici blotch (STB), a disease caused by the fungal pathogen _Zymoseptoria tritici_ is, alarmingly, becoming increasingly resistant to fungicides and already accounts for about 70 per cent of annual European fungicide use, worth around EUR 1 billion [USD 1.13 billion]. Professor Sarah Gurr, Biosciences, estimated that the disease could cost the economies of France, Germany and the UK, the 3 main EU wheat-growing countries, between EUR 120 and 700 million [USD 136 and 793 million].

Exeter researchers have now started an international initiative to face this challenge to our food security. Professor Nick Talbot, University of Exeter, said: "This study highlights the constant need for fungicide discovery, particularly in the face of emerging resistance to existing products by the fungal pathogen _Zymoseptoria tritici_, so that together we can develop sustainable control mechanisms of STB."

Professor Gero Steinberg, Biosciences, said: "The fungal pathogen _Zymoseptoria tritici_ poses a real threat to wheat production. In times of changing climate and a growing world population, Exeter research joins the world-wide quest to understand the biology of this fungal pathogen".

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_) , _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). The disease affects mainly wheat, but also barley and oats and occasionally rye and some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar and may occur at any time during the growth of the plant and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties. Septoria is considered the most important foliar disease of winter wheat in the UK and other parts of Europe.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash) and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn-sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy, removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties.

Emerging fungicide resistance of septoria blotch has been reported in recent years from Europe, Australasia and North America (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below and in the archives). After the cereal rusts, the disease is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.
