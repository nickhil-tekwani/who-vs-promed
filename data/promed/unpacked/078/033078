Outbreak of horse virus leads to call for quarantine; virus kills 2
horses at stable
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a rare, deadly virus has killed 2, and possibly 3,
horses at a stable here [Rome, Maine] and sickened a 4th in Wales,
Maine, prompting a quarantine at both facilities.
Humans cannot catch the virus, known as Neurological Equine Herpes
Virus Type-1 (EHV-1).
Not much is known about this virus other than that it is a type of
herpes that affects horses' nervous systems and is often fatal. It is
extremely rare, as fewer than a dozen cases were recorded in the
United States in 2006, according to Maine State Veterinarian Don
Hoenig. "This is the 1st incidence of it in Maine," he said. "It
seems to be on the rise, and, in recent years, we've been very
concerned about it coming into our state."
Hoenig said that there was nothing that the Bridges family, owners of
Rome Farms, could have done to prevent the outbreak. The stables at
the time were boarding 13 horses of different owners.
The 1st horse died at Rome Farms on 18 Mar 2007, and Dexter "Buzz"
Bridges was puzzled. When a 2nd horse died the next day, he notified
a veterinarian, a move that Hoenig said probably reduced the number
of horses exposed to the virus. Bridges initially did not suspect a
virus as the reason for the deaths, since Rome Farms doesn't see a
lot of new horses coming and going. Clients who choose the facility
to board their horses tend to leave them there long term. The stables
hadn't received a new horse in 6 months, Bridges said. "Well, it
shouldn't have been this stables, but it was the best place for it,"
he said. "We were able to contain it."
The likely culprit was a horse that carried the virus without
immediately exhibiting symptoms, Hoenig said. So little is known
about the virus that veterinarians are not sure whether it is a
unique disease or a mutated form of the more common herpes virus that
affects the respiratory system. It is not certain that the vaccine
administered for the more common form of the virus will protect the
animals, Hoenig said, but owners should vaccinate their horses as a
matter of course.
The infected horse in Wales, Maine was still alive Thursday [29 Mar
2007] afternoon, and seemed to be responding well to treatment,
Hoenig said; 9 horses are staying at the facility there.
At Rome Farms, members of the Bridges family are checking their
horses' temperatures twice a day and looking in on them
periodically. The Bridges family last year [2006] had been ecstatic
about the opportunity to purchase and operate the stables. The
outbreak has made its future uncertain, Bridges said.

Rome is in Kennebec County, Wales in adjacent Androscoggin County. - Mod.JW]
[Given the severe consequences of the disease, the fact that we are
carrying a few reports each month since October 2006 -- with very
wide geographic distribution (see ProMED refs. below), which now
includes the farthest reaches of New England -- should make everyone
everywhere vigilant. Although a seasonal predisposition for the
neurological form of the disease is not commonly cited in the
literature, a quick scan of the cases reported below over the past
several months indicates that most of the outbreaks occur in late
fall to early spring. Hopefully, the incidence of these small,
isolated outbreaks will drop off as we head into the summer months. - Mod.PC]
[One wonders whether the observed seasonality is related to stress
brought on by respiratory infections that are more common in the cold
months, just as human herpesvirus1 (herpes simplex) recurrence --
"cold sores" -- is brought on by colds, flu and the stress of cold
weather. - Mod.JW]
