As of Fri 23 Nov 2012, a total of 20 (probable or confirmed) cases, including 9 deaths have been reported from 4 districts in Uganda (Kabale, Ibanda, Mbarara, and Kampala).

Close contacts of the Marburg virus disease cases are being followed-up for a period of 21 days.

WHO and international partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Uganda Red Cross (URCS), African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET), Plan Uganda, and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) are supporting the national authorities in the investigation and response to the outbreak. Experts have been deployed through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to strengthen the field team.

Trainings are being provided to health professionals on infection prevention and control (IPC), and on field information management. Social mobilization activities are being conducted to raise awareness on prevention and control of Marburg haemorrhagic fever.

[Since the most recent report from Uganda dated 10 Nov 2012 the number of probable/confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease has increased by 2 to 20, whereas the number of fatalities remains 9. The outbreak has not spread beyond the same 4 districts in southwestern Uganda (Kampala (the capital city), Ibanda, Mbarara and Kabale). It appears that the outbreak is being successfully contained by the prompt response of the Ugandan Ministry of Health and its partners. Information on investigations into the source of the outbreak is awaited.
