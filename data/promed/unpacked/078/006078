Indonesia will carry out mass culling of poultry in areas with a high
intensity of bird flu cases, agriculture minister Anton Apriyantono said on
Wednesday. "We haven't identified the highly intensive areas, but once it
is done, then there will be one (mass cull)," Apriyantono told Reuters when
asked whether the government would conduct mass culling. He said funds
would not be a problem.

The world animal health body OIE (Office International des Epizooties) said
on Tuesday its $100 million strategy to boost veterinary defences against
bird flu was the best way to limit the threat of a human pandemic of the
deadly disease. With governments spending hundreds of millions of dollars
on stocks of anti-viral drugs for use in case the virus mutates to pass
easily between humans, it said some of the funds should be spent on animal
surveillance and disease control at source.
"If the disease is controlled in animals, the risk of a human pandemic is
reduced by thousands of times, and it costs much less," OIE
director-general Bernard Vallat told Reuters. "If you took 10 per cent of
the money being spent on anti-viral medicines and used it on building
measures to stamp out the disease, now that would be a good investment."
Fears of a human pandemic of bird flu with the potential to kill millions
have increased since the discovery that the H5N1 strain of the virus that
has killed more than 60 people in Asia has spread to birds in Siberia.
Experts fear the Middle East, Africa and Europe may be next.
The OIE, along with the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, launched
the its strategy last month and is seeking pledges of $100 million at a
conference in Geneva on 7-9 Nov 2005. While most European countries have
veterinary systems in place to deal effectively with an outbreak of bird
flu, many in places such as Africa need funds to build their defences.
Vallat said the conference would seek pledges from the World Bank, European
Commission and United States. "There are countries who just don't have the
means to fight the disease, and this is what we need to tackle," he said.
"The key is early detection and rapid response."
Vallat said the OIE had sent a team of 5 scientists to Siberia to conduct a
study of the wild birds there with the virus to determine if they could
spread the disease to Europe. Experts in disease transmission, diagnosis
and bird migration will examine how certain infected wildfowl can live with
the disease and if they are able to fly thousands of miles.
"These are questions we need to shed light on," he said. With wildfowl
leaving Siberia soon for warmer climates in the Middle East and Africa, the
scientists do not have long to complete the study. "I would hope we'd have
some preliminary results at the beginning of October," he said.
They will examine the theory that birds could fly from Siberia to Africa,
where they could pass the disease onto others that fly to Europe in the
northern hemisphere spring. "We need to assess the risk of countries in
Africa that could then pass the disease to Europe," Vallat said.
But he said he was satisfied with the veterinary measures against the
threat of bird flu taken so far by most European governments, but did not
advocate other countries going as far as the Netherlands and some German
states, which have ordered poultry to be kept inside. He said that due to
bird flu transmission through droppings, it was enough to keep them inside
at feeding time.

[Many of the points raised should be considered seriously for merit and
feasibility. Certainly, as D-G Vallet points out, avian influenza has
raised questions concerning veterinary and veterinary public health
infrastructure requirements worldwide. - Mod.PC]
