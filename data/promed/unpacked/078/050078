Bluetongue, Israel
------------------
Information received on (and dated) 6 Oct 2011 from Dr Nadav Galon,
director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development, Bet Dagan, Israel

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 1 Oct 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 1 Oct 2011
Report date: 6 Oct 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Oct 2011
Date event resolved: 8 Nov 2010
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Bluetongue virus
Serotype: 12
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory
(advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (Bustan Hagalil) Bustan Hagalil, Acco, Hazafon
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Oct 2010
Outbreak status: resolved: (8 Oct 2010)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 40 / 24 / 4 / 0 / 0
Affected population: in a herd of 40 lactating cows, 20 aborted from
June to December 2010. In October, 4 cows died and 4 additional cows
aborted. Blood samples from one cow arrived to the laboratory. The cow
died a few days later.

Outbreak 2 (Ashdot Ya'aqov(Me'uhad)) Ashdot Ya'aqov(Me'uhad), Kineret,
Hazafon
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Nov 2010
Outbreak status: resolved (8 Nov 2010)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 500 / 82 / 8 / 0 / 3
Affected population: the herd contains about 300 milking cows. From
June to November 2010, 82 cows showed fever. In June, 2 cows were
found positive to BTV 8 by RT-PCR. One cow sampled in November was
found positive to BTV 12. The cow that was sampled remained empty for
one year although 5 artificial inseminations.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 540 / 106 / 12 / 0 / 3

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors
Epidemiological comments: this is the 1st time that this strain is
found in Israel. These outbreaks have already been notified to the OIE
in the 2010 2nd 6-monthly report as BTV.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright
Laboratory (United Kingdom) (OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / real-time PCR / 1 Oct 2011 / Positive
Cattle / virus isolation / 1 Oct 2011 / Positive

[The report above, which includes an interactive map, is a
confirmation of BTV-12 isolated for the 1st time in Israel. It
includes some information, which may allow answers to ProMED-mail's
queries in post 20111003.2976:

1. What samples were taken (entire blood/serum/other)? Probably entire
blood, since virus isolation was performed.
2. Animals sampled: age (milking cows); breed (Israeli Holsteins),
husbandry (housed, zero-grazing), clinical status (clinical cases, but
see further), origin (indigenous, since Israel does not import
breeding dairy cattle).
3. Dates: (outbreak 1: October 2010, outbreak 2: November 2010).
4. Test applied: (PCR AND virus isolation).

The detection of a new (in fact, 10th) BTV serotype in Israel is a
significant achievement; the time it took deserves to be clarified. In
the past, identification of new BTV serotypes was mainly the
responsibility of Israel's Kimron Veterinary Institute.

The role of the newly introduced serotype BTV-12, as a causative agent
for the described clinical disease (fever, abortions, death) in adult
cattle (milking cows) is in need of further study. Traditionally, BTV
was known as a clinical entity mainly if not exclusively in
(susceptible breeds) of sheep. Israeli bovines were known, since
decades, to undergo

sub-clinical BTV viraemia during the disease season; in some "natural
zones" and in certain years, 80-100 percent of the surveyed cattle
underwent such viraemia without detectable clinical signs or
subsequent fertility problems (this involved predominantly serotypes 4
and 16). The 2 outbreaks, described above, are situated in 2 of the
historically highly infected natural zones in northern Israel.

Israel's last semi-annual report to the OIE, covering the period
July-December 2010, mentioned 72 BT outbreaks in bovines and ovines
(no differentiation between the species provided). These outbreaks
were caused -- reportedly -- by the BTV serotypes "8, not typed, 4,
24". Have serotypes 8 (ProMED-mail 20090530.2008, 20090828.3025)
and/or 24 (ProMED-mail 20090706.2422), shown in recent years to have
the (exceptional) capacity of causing clinical disease in cattle, been
excluded as causative agents in the outbreaks described in the current
report? Comparative pathogenicity studies in cattle and sheep, if/when
undertaken, may provide the answer.

The long time-gap between the occurrence of the cases and the
identification of the new serotype deserves clarification. - Mod.AS]
