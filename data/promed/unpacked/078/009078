Act now to tackle an "epidemic" of hepatitis C, says a leading doctor
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Roy Robertson, chair of the National Forum on Drug-Related Deaths,
said around 1000 new cases are recorded each year in Scotland. An
estimated 39 000 people in Scotland [population about 5 million -
Mod.CP] have hepatitis C.

Treatment services need improving and people need to be encouraged to
be tested, said Dr Robertson, a GP based in Edinburgh. He said:
"Hepatitis C is a hugely important epidemic [disease] and it's almost
entirely due to [illicit drug use]. Most of the epidemic in Scotland
has been amongst injecting drug users.

"We've always expected that this is going to be an increasing number
of cases over many years. Some people who get the virus can clear it
from their system and it's no longer a problem. Others go on having
the disease but don't get ill for many, many years." He said people
who used drugs and shared needles in the 1980s are starting to become
unwell from this virus [disease]. "Eventually the incubation period
elapses and people begin to manifest cirrhosis and advanced liver
failure and the death rate will undoubtedly increase over the next few
years," he added. Estimates indicate that the annual death toll from
hepatitis C-related causes in Scotland could be between 100 to 200 by
2015. "And that will continue, probably indefinitely, for the next
goodness-knows-how-many years," he added.

Dr Robertson, whose group helps to advise the Scottish Government,
called for investment in treatment services. He continued: "We treat
probably about 1000 cases per year in Scotland, which clearly isn't
enough, and we need much more in terms of treatment services provision
to reduce the size of the overall pool. For treatment services, now is
the time."

Dr Robertson said more treatment would cure more people, who could go
on to develop liver damage, and may slow the rate of the epidemic.
"Liver specialists are going to be overwhelmed. Also, I think,
treatment services are not terribly sympathetic and not terribly
supportive in some areas. And I think we could do a lot more to
provide better treatment services for a very difficult group of
patients."

Dr Saket Priyadarshi, lead clinician in addiction services for NHS
[National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde and vice-chair of
the National Forum on Drug-Related Deaths, said treating hepatitis C
now would save millions of pounds in health care in the future.

[Hepatitis C virus infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic
illness. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few
weeks to a serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to
cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. A chronic hepatitis C
infection is when the infection lasts for longer than 6 months. The
course of the chronic infection varies considerably between people and
is unpredictable.

Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through contact with the blood of an
infected person. About 130-170 million people are chronically infected
with hepatitis C virus, and more than 350 000 people die from
hepatitis C-related liver diseases each year. Hepatitis C virus
infection is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic
infection are Egypt (22 per cent), Pakistan (4.8 per cent), and China
(3.2 per cent). The main mode of transmission in these countries is
attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment.

Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not
exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may
exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and
jaundice. When a chronically-infected person develops symptoms, it may
indicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of
those with chronic infection develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per
cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver
cancer. (WHO Fact sheet 164:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).

There are 6 genotypes of hepatitis C virus, which is an enveloped,
positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the family _Flaviviridae_.
Almost all people in the UK who have hepatitis C have genotype 1,
genotype 2, or genotype 3 virus. The different genotypes respond
differently to treatment, and it is possible to be infected with more
than one type of hepatitis C at the same time.

As the damage caused by the hepatitis C is usually very gradual, the
time at which people with hepatitis C start treatment may vary between
cases. The usual treatment involves administration of pegylated
interferon and/or ribavirin. The treatment clears the virus in almost
half of those infected with genotype 1, and about 80 per cent of those
infected with genotype 2 or 3. A course of treatment lasts 6-12
months, depending upon the hepatitis C virus genotype. It takes about
12 weeks to determine if this treatment is working. Side-effects from
these treatments can occur which may include tiredness, nausea,
headaches, and depression. New treatments are becoming available which
may improve outcomes.
