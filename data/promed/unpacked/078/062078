An outbreak of infection due to _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ has been
recorded among children in a kindergarten of the settlement of Poberezje
[in the Novgorod region]. Valery Pjanyh, deputy head of territorial
management of the Russian (Health) Protection Agency (Rospotrebnadzor) for
the region, said that the infection has been detected in 24 children within
the past 2 days.
According to Jury Aleksandrov of the regional infectious disease hospital,
symptoms of illness in the first children who fell ill with _Y.
pseudotuberculosis_ were reminiscent of scarlet fever: acute rise in
temperature, a rash, and stomach and joint pains.
Single cases of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ infection have been reported in the
region, but an outbreak such as this is the first on record.
The source of infection was probably vegetables. Practically every day,
vegetable salads were on the menu of the kindergarten. Employees of
Rospotrebnadzor are now investigating the conditions under which these
salads were prepared.

Infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with reservoirs in
many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and various birds. Most
individuals affected are children or young adults. The commonest
presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis presenting with
fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with
acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has
been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a
reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.
Cutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned
erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can be
found with a variety of infectious stimuli. erythema nodosum presents as
painful, indurated erythematous circular lesions usually on the shins.
Erythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form lesions
including classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes erythema
multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into plaques with a
vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be associated with
conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes with erythroderma and subsequent
desquamation can also occur. This manifestation can also resemble Kawasaki
syndrome (2).
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest
studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was
published in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary (4) with the
paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections
associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection with this
bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or
stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found
between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.
