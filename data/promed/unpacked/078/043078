One dead in typhoid fever epidemic
------------------------------------
An unprecedented outbreak of typhoid fever has been confirmed in the
northern rain forests of Gabon, causing one death so far, national radio
announced on Fri, 7 Jan 2005.
Around 50 cases of the water-borne disease have been reported over the past
month in Oyem, a town of 35 000 people located near the northern border
with Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, following repeated breakdowns of the
local water supply system.
Health officials told the radio that cases had also been noted in various
other towns in the Grand Nord region, which is home to 110 000 people,
notably in Minvoul and Mitzic. The only fatality so far was registered in
Oyem, which lies 411 km northeast of the capital Libreville.
"This is the 1st typhoid fever alert in the region and in Gabon," Julien
Meye, a doctor at the endemic diseases service in Libreville, told IRIN. He
said the epidemic had broken out several months after a deterioration in
the supply of drinking water in Oyem, where the disease first
appeared. Meye said the authorities were launching a massive information
campaign in primary schools in the area to help children learn how to
prevent catching _Salmonella typhi_, the enteric pathogen which causes typhoid.
WHO estimates there are about 16 million cases of typhoid a year worldwide,
of which approximately 600 000 end in death. About 70 percent of all
fatalities occur in Asia.
