with WNV infection by State are: Florida, 32; New Jersey, 8; Georgia, 5;

and 1 in each of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts,

[These figures for equine cases of West Nile virus infection represent an
increase of 69 over the previous total released by the United States
Department of Agriculture on 31 Oct 2001, and 240 more than the figure
quoted in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report update published on 16
Nov 2001 <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5045a4.htm>. An
accurate assessment of the number of equine cases must await the end of the
outbreak, but it is clear that horses are the species at greatest risk from
the spread of West Nile virus through the United States. The state of
Florida has suffered to the greatest extent in 2001. Assessment of the
protective value of the equine vaccine is an urgent priority. - Mod.CP
