Since early this month [August 2009], the National Institute of
Infectious and Tropical Diseases has received between 30-40 patients
of dengue fever a day, 90 percent of whom came from inner-city areas.

The Head of the National Institute of Infectious and Tropical
Diseases, Nguyen Hong Ha, said on [18 Aug 2009] that the dengue fever
has reached its peak along with A(H1N1) flu.

Most patients admitted to hospital are in a serious condition, and 62
percent of them are pupils and students between the ages of 16-30.
The spread of the disease among them is attributed to their dark and
stuffy lodgings swarming with mosquitoes.

A woman in the Binh Dinh Province town of Quy Nhon died of dengue
fever on the way to hospital Wednesday [12 Aug 2009] after undergoing
days of treatment at home.

The woman, an 18-year-old resident of Nhon Phu Ward, vomited blood
before being sent to the hospital in the central province.

She had been given a fluid transfusion and injection at home on
Tuesday [11 Aug 2009].

Last Saturday [8 Aug 2009], [the 18-year-old] had fatigue and fever,
but her family did not bring her to see a doctor despite the fact
that local government officials urged her to do so.

[She] was the 2nd dengue-related death in the town in just over 2 weeks.

Quy Nhon has reported nearly 400 dengue cases recently.

[The 2 above newswires illustrate that outbreaks of dengue infection
are going on in Viet Nam. The number of cases and deaths seem to be
continually increasing because Viet Nam is still in the monsoon
season. The dengue outbreak in Viet Nam seems to have begun early
this year (2009) due to unseasonable rains. As of 10 Feb 2009, there
had been more than 3000 cases of dengue fever reported nationwide in
Viet Nam during 2009 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam
20090211.0614).

Although outbreaks of dengue fever have been reported from many
provinces in Viet Nam -- such as Ho Chi Minh City, Tien Giang
province, and Soc Trang province since the beginning of the year 2009
-- the 1st newswire above is the 1st reported outbreak of dengue
fever in Hanoi in 2009. There was an outbreak of dengue fever
reported in Hanoi in November 2008. More than 500 dengue fever cases
were reported after the flooding (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue -
Viet Nam (19): Hanoi 20081120.3666).

Between 1 Jan and 19 Jul 2009, 36 046 cases and 26 deaths of dengue
infection were reported in Viet Nam. The number of dengue cases is
11.7 percent over the cases reported during the same period of 2008,
and mostly in the southern region (see prior ProMED-mail posting
Dengue/DHF update 2009 (31) 20090803.2723).

According to WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO
-- available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>),
there were 96 451 cases and 97 deaths of dengue fever in Viet Nam in
2008, and 16 655 cases and 14 deaths from January to May 2009.

As reports of drug-resistant malaria in western Cambodia gather
increasing attention, experts from the National Center for Malaria
(NCM) on Monday [17 Aug 2009] reported an increase in dengue fever
cases throughout the kingdom in 2009. In the 1st 31 weeks of 2009,
according to the NCM, 7227 people in Cambodia were infected with
dengue fever, compared with just 4261 people infected during the same
period in 2008. The good news was that only 19 people died from the
mosquito-borne malady during the 1st 31 weeks of this year [2009], as
opposed to 40 the previous year.

"Dengue fever in Cambodia has not reached a state of emergency at the
moment, though it is drawing a lot of attention," said Ngan Chantham,
deputy director of the National Center for Malaria and director of
the National Anti-Dengue Programme (NADP).

Large-scale outbreaks of dengue fever typically occur once every 2 or
3 years, and specialists from the NADP said that the next big dengue
outbreak may happen in 2010. They are cautiously optimistic, however,
that they are prepared to deal with it.

Though they will continue to monitor this year's [2009] increase in
dengue cases, Ngan Chantham said the NADP was pleased to see the
death rate drop, attributing this decline to prevention efforts
taking place throughout Cambodia. The NADP is in the process of
distributing around 90 tonnes of pesticides used to kill mosquitoes
throughout the kingdom's 24 provinces, he said.

Education is another significant aspect of prevention efforts, the
group says. The NADP has been conducting dengue-education sessions
throughout Cambodia since 2002, aiming to inform residents about the
precautions necessary to contain the spread of the illness, according
to Chea Muntha, head of the dengue education programme at the NADP.

He said that as residents learn more about the importance of
precautionary measures such as mosquito nets and household
sanitation, mortality rates will continue to decline.

The number of dengue cases has risen to 23 791, while 240 people died
of the disease in Sri Lanka so far, the Epidemiological Unit of the
Health Ministry said on Thursday [20 Aug 2009]. The Epidemiological
Unit said in its latest statistics that of the 23 791 cases, the
highest number of patients were reported from June [2009], totaling
7050. This is followed by July 2009 with 6841 cases being reported.
This represents a sharp increase, as only 4156 dengue cases and 85
deaths were reported for the whole year of 2008. Health officials
said the majority of these cases have been reported from the areas of
Kandy, Kegalle, Colombo, Gampaha and Kurunegala.

The rapid rise in the level of the epidemic has forced the health
authorities to carry out an extensive public awareness campaign to
eradicate the mosquito-based epidemic. Households have been warned to
keep their environments free of mosquitoes. Those who allow
mosquitoes to breed by allowing stagnant water to accumulate face
prosecution, with a special hotline being made available for public
information.

The Ministry of Health today [19 Aug 2009] declared a red alert due
to an outbreak of classical dengue and DHF, which has caused the
deaths of at least 5 children. This measure [red alert] was adopted
due to the proliferation of patients suspected of having dengue
[virus infection], which has saturated the hospitals and clinics in
the Izabal department [state or province equivalent]. La Prenza has
reported that some 700 children have been seen daily in the Eliza
Martinez National Hospital in Izabal, half of whom have symptoms of
dengue, and at least 30 were hospitalized.

Last week [week of 9 Aug 2009], the outbreak was recognized as
affecting the Caribbean coastal populations, which [caused] the
Ministry of Health to send a mission [there] to evaluate the
situation and declare a red alert to deal with the emergency.
