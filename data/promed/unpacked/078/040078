A Hungarian laboratory worker has been isolated at a Budapest hospital after accidental exposure to the deadly Ebola virus but has shown no symptoms so far, health officials said on [Fri 20 Apr 2018].

The accident happened a week ago [Fri 13 Apr 2018] and the employee was under observation in a special unit in the hospital, the national health institute OKI said.

The World Health Organization said it had sent an experimental vaccine and other treatments [2 unlicensed drugs] which had been given to the scientist.

"WHO assesses the risk of Ebola spreading from this event negligible," it said in a statement emailed to Reuters.

"The exposed scientist was immediately put under isolation according to standard operating procedures ... The person is showing no symptoms."

Neither organization gave any more information about the lab worker or the accident.

OKI said there was no threat to co-workers or the public.

More than 11 300 people died in total during the worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease, which mainly affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2013 to 2016.

[The worker was exposed in a "normally secure" laboratory but shows no evidence of disease after one week. As a precaution, the individual has been held in isolation, as per standard operating protocol. It is assumed the vaccine was a live-attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (recVSV) expressing the glycoprotein of ZEBOV (Zaire Ebolavirus). A single dose of 5 x 10^7 plaque-forming units (Gunther S et al. 2011 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21987751 or 10^8 PFU (Wong KK et al. 2016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946014/ have been used following other accidental exposures.

There is no information on what procedure was being conducted that led to the accidental exposure, and whether the laboratory was biocontainment level 4 (BSL-4). This may not have protected the lab worker depending on the route of exposure, but could protect others from exposure.

Rapporteur Mary Marshall asks whether WHO keeps track of which countries and labs are working with or storing live Ebola virus? Mod.LK wonders whether individuals in those labs should be vaccinated before they start working with live virus?
