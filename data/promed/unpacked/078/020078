Subject: ESB in France

France has declared its 27th case of ESB (since 1990) on the 8th of April.
The diary cow, a Normande bred, was born on the 11 of January 1991. All the
cattle on the farm (86 cows) has been slaughtered and destroyed on the 7th
of April.
The case is located in the department of Manche (western France, in
Normandy), where it is the third case of ESB registered (one in 1991 and one
in 1996).

The data I have correspond to the date of daclaration and the department
where the farm was located. These data are also available at the Office
international des epizooties, which has a web site (http://www.oie.org)
where special pages are dedicated to the ESB.
All the cases are concentrated in the more dense zone of dairy cattle, in
the west of France (Brittany+Normandy+Pays de Loire). Only three are far
away from that region (noted *). One of these is next to the Swiss border.
