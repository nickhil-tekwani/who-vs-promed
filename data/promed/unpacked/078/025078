Sri Lanka and Maldives have become the 1st 2 countries in the World Health Organization's South-East Asia region to eliminate both measles and rubella ahead of a 2023 target, the U.N. health agency announced Wed 8 Jul 2020.

"This success is encouraging and demonstrates the importance of joint efforts" in combating diseases as the world grapples with the coronavirus, WHO South-East Asia regional director Poonam Khetrapal Singh said in a statement.

[The announcement was made after the 5th meeting of the South-East Asia Regional Verification Commission for Measles and Rubella Elimination, held virtually.

A country is verified as having eliminated measles and rubella when there is no evidence of endemic transmission of the measles and rubella viruses for over 3 years in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system.

Sri Lanka reported its last endemic case of measles in May 2016, and the last rubella case was in March 2017.

Member countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region had in September last year [2019] set 2023 as the target for eliminating measles and rubella, revising the goal of the flagship programme that since 2014 had focused on measles elimination and rubella control.

Bhutan, DPR Korea, and Timor-Leste are other countries in the Region who have eliminated measles (https://roar.media/english/news/health/srilanka-eliminates-measles-and-rubella).

The Maldives recorded its last endemic case of measles in 2009 and rubella in October 2015, the global health body said.

Sri Lanka's last endemic cases of measles and rubella were reported in May 2016 and March 2017, respectively, it added.

There has been no evidence of endemic transmission of the 2 viruses for over 3 years "in the presence of a well performing surveillance system," the WHO said (https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/09/who-declares-sri-lanka-maldives-measles-free.html). - Mod.LK]

Global health officials are reporting a significant increase in measles cases in Cambodia during the 1st quarter of the year [2020]. This is up from 44 cases during the same period in 2019. At least one death has been reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) confirmed the total on Mon 6 Jul 2020 and reported that 65 per cent of those infected had not been vaccinated.

Measles is a very contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. In fact, the measles virus can stay in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person was there. People may be infected by simply being in a room where an infected person once was. It is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90% of the people around him or her will also become infected if they are not protected.

Measles can be prevented with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The vaccine is safe and effective. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends children receive their 1st dose of MMR vaccine between 12-15 months of age and a 2nd dose between 4-6 years old. More than 95% of the people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to all 3 viruses. A 2nd dose boosts immunity, typically enhancing protection to 98%.

Despite COVID-19 related restrictions, 94 000 children in South Sudan's Northern Bahr el Ghazal province have been vaccinated against measles, Dr. Olushayo Olu, World Health Organization (WHO) representative said on Fri 10 Jul 2020.

"Following the reported cases of measles in some of the counties in January 2020, the 12-day campaign from 22 Jun - 3 Jul 2020 was organized with the support from WHO and UNICEF, the global health body said in a statement.

"Strengthening routine immunization would interrupt the spread of the disease and enhance the survival of vulnerable children," said Dr. Olu.

The WHO said South Sudan is among the countries experiencing an upsurge of measles cases affecting a total of 694 children and claiming at least 7 lives since the beginning of 2020.

[4] Kenya (West Pokot county)
Date: Wed 8 Jul 2020

https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001378073/alarm-raised-over-measles-outbreak-in-west-pokot-county


A 7-year-old boy has died of measles and is among the 40 cases noted in West Pokot County since the disease started ravaging the area last week. The disease has affected both children under the age of 5 years and adults.

According to West Pokot Health Executive Jackson Yaralima, the outbreak has been reported at Katangun, Kotulpogh, Kababanyet and Akulo villages in Pokot Central Sub County after a patient who had been admitted at Kacheliba Sub-County Hospital arrived there.

He blamed the trend on low immunisation coverage in West Pokot County and the nomadic nature of the communities.

"Locals in Pokot Central are always on the move searching for pasture for their livestock. When we commence immunisation exercises we rarely get them at their doorsteps for immunisation. They value their livestock," he said.

He added that insecurity challenges along the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties are also responsible for poor immunisation coverage since cattle rustling left homes deserted.

He said the disease was 1st detected 3 weeks ago in areas bordering Uganda before a patient who had been admitted at Kacheliba hospital, which borders Uganda, travelled to Katulpogh Sub-Location.

He said the county has commenced immunisation to contain the outbreak completely within the next 2 months, and patients have been admitted at Sigor, Kacheliba and Kapenguria sub-county hospitals.

"I dispatched our medical teams on the ground to carry out emergency immunisation and intervention measures. The child had a complication of so many diseases, including measles, that it was too late to save the life of the child, and she succumbed," said Yaralima.

He added, "Most of the children have not been taken to the clinic for immunisation. Most of the parents are ignorant, and they see no need of going to the hospital. I urge the public to be very vigilant and observe all the government regulations for the prevention of communicable diseases."

He noted that all the hospital services have resumed, and health workers will camp at Masol Ward to help reach the people at the grass-root level. "We are pitching medical camps at Amoler, Nyangaita and Akulo areas. Measles during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, early delivery, or low birth weight," he added.

Katulpogh Sub-Location sub-chief Stephen Cholong said 3 people from his area have been infected and are at health centres receiving treatment. He added that locals have now resorted to herbal medicine to treat the disease as they fear going to the hospital because measles signs and symptoms are similar to Covid-19.

"We are worried, and the ministry of health should intervene. The locals slaughter a sheep and apply fats from the sheep to the whole body. They isolate patients until when they recover," He said.

He noted that the health centres are far and locals are now surviving on home remedies to reduce the scourge.

"How can someone travel for 4 hours to reach Sigor Sub-County Hospital for treatment? If we are not careful, the whole community will be infected.

After infection the family members desert the homestead because they don't want to be infected," he added. Symptoms of measles can include watery eyes, sneezing, a dry hacking cough, runny nose, swollen eyelids and inflamed eyes.

There is often fever that can range from mild to severe. Some reddish-brown rashes appear around 3-4 days after initial symptoms, which can last for over a week.
