Start of training of trainers in Goma on good clinical practices related to the 2nd Ebola vaccine
- The Ebola Virus Disease Response Information Management Coordinator, representing the Technical Secretariat, Mathias Mossoko, launched Mon 23 Sep 2019 in Goma training of trainers that runs from 23-28 Sep 2019 on good clinical practices (GCP) related to the 2nd vaccine against the Ebola virus.
- This training benefits from the expertise of CVD's Malians on the transmission of notions about good clinical practice. It aims to provide participants with the standards applicable to the design, conduct, monitoring, and stopping of studies, to teach them the activities of audit, analysis, reporting, and documentation with the guarantee that these studies rely on sound scientific and ethical principles. It is also intended to introduce participants to the correct documentation of the clinical properties of the vaccine tested or evaluated.
- The Response Information Management Coordinator called the attendance participants to demonstrate better actors for the implementation of good practice in this 2nd vaccine.
- For its part, the chairman of the Immunization Committee, Stéphane Hans, said that this 5-day training announces the forthcoming launch of the 2nd vaccine that will come at any time in the targeted health zones. "We welcome this supplementary vaccine very positively compared to the 1st vaccine. This 2nd vaccine has the advantage of preventing all strains of the Ebola virus. It is therefore positive for the population that will receive it," he said while inviting all communities targeted by this vaccination to take ownership of this activity, once launched.
- The training on good clinical practice will revolve around several presentations on different topics, among others, the Ebola virus disease, the responsibilities of the INRB for the QA system, study vaccines (storage, management, chain cold and accounting), inclusion and follow-up of pregnant women, community involvement and informed consent, etc.
- This training was organized for the different actors involved in this project, including doctors, epidemiologists, clinicians, and pharmacists. A total of 25 people from Kinshasa, including the INRB, UNIKIN, CUK, and specialized programs and North Kivu, including the Provincial Health Inspectorate (IPS), the Provincial Division of health (DPS), and the health zones coordination Offices (BCZS) participate in these foundations.

Vaccination
-----------
Opening of an enlarged ring of vaccination around 2 confirmed cases on 19 and 21 Sep 2019 in the health area of Madidi in Mambasa in Ituri.
Another satellite ring was opened at the Kitatumba General Referral Hospital in Butembo health zone in North Kivu around the case notified on 22 Sep 2019. This case started the illness in the Kasindi health area in Mutwanga, North Kivu.
- The Expanded Program of Vaccines has received 4320 doses of vaccine at the national level;
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 226 722 people have been vaccinated;
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at Entry Points
--------------------------
- High-risk contact was intercepted at Kangote PoC in Butembo, North Kivu. This is a 28-year-old unvaccinated woman on the 14th day (D14) follow-up who was listed around a confirmed case in the Katwa Health Zone. During her interception, this woman presented some signs related to the #Ebola Virus Disease. She was sent to the Butembo ETC for treatment.
- Kituku PoC providers in Goma, North Kivu, were assaulted by about 20 onlookers called "Maibobo" who were avenging one of their drowned during the night of 20 -- 21 Sep 2019. These providers feel insecure and ask to be supported by officers of the National Police (PNC) or FARDC.
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement) at the sanitary control points up to 22 Sep 2019 is 96 998 860;
- To date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Tue 24 Sep 2019. WHO: Multiple DRC Ebola hot spots 'grave concern'
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/who-multiple-drc-ebola-hot-spots-grave-concern
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

In the past week, officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 48 new cases and 25 new deaths in an ongoing Ebola outbreak in 3 of the DRC's eastern provinces.

According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office's weekly update on the 13-month-long outbreak, the principle virus hot spots in September [2019] have been Mambasa (25% of new cases), Mandima (19%), Kalunguta (18%), and Beni (11%).

"8 health zones, namely Mambasa, Komanda, Mandima, Beni, Katwa, Kayna, Kalunguta, and Biena have reported new confirmed cases in the past 7 days and remain points of attention," the WHO said. "The persistence of hot spots and the shift in transmission intensity between the main hotspots remains of grave concern, as does continued sporadic transmission in other health areas."

Today [24 Sep 2019] the WHO recorded 2 more cases and 3 fatalities on its online Ebola dashboard, raising outbreak totals to 3171 cases and 2118 deaths. There are 342 suspected cases under investigation.

In an update issued late yesterday [23 Sep 2019], the DRC's multisector Ebola committee (CMRE) said that the 4 cases confirmed yesterday were in Butembo, Mandima (2 cases), and Mambasa.

- Mon 23 Sep 2019. 2nd vaccine
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/who-pushes-tanzania-suspected-ebola-cases-drc-oks-use-2nd-vaccine
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In DRC developments, government officials announced plans to use a 2nd experimental vaccine, a 2-dose regimen made by Johnson & Johnson, the WHO said today [23 Sep 2019] in a statement. The vaccine, known as Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN, is a prime-boost product given 56 days apart and is designed to provide longer lasting protection against the virus.

In April [2019], a WHO vaccine advisory group recommended adding Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN as a way to increase supply and test the effectiveness of a 2nd vaccine, but the country's former health minister pushed back against mounting international pressure to use it, because it could complicate vaccine messaging and post logistical challenges in delivering the 2nd dose.

In its statement, the WHO said health officials will introduce the vaccine in the middle of October [2019], targeting at-risk population in areas that don't have active Ebola transmission.

Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, who directs the WHO's regional office for Africa, said, "The evaluation of the 2nd Ebola vaccine will help ensure that we have potentially an additional tool to prevent the expansion of the outbreak and also a potential tool to protect populations before outbreaks hit areas at risk."

The WHO said at the current number of cases being reported, supplies of the current VSV-EBOV vaccine are sufficient. Merck, the vaccine's maker, has provided the WHO with 245 000 doses and built a stockpile of 190 000 doses that are ready to send to the DRC. Also, the WHO said Merck's goal is to release 650 000 doses over the next 6-18 months.

Excerpt of statement from WHO:
"The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will complement the current vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV-GP, manufactured by Merck), which has proven highly effective and safe, and which has helped protect thousands of lives. The Merck vaccine will continue to be provided to all people at high risk of Ebola infection including those who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have Ebola, all contacts of contacts, and others determined to be at high risk of contracting Ebola. To date over 223 000 people have received this vaccination during the current outbreak.

"In May 2019, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) reviewed use of vaccines in the ongoing Ebola outbreak and issued recommendations. These included adjusting the dose of the Merck vaccine, evaluating a second vaccine under appropriate protocols, changing strategies when insecurity makes it difficult to reach people - such as providing pop-up vaccination stations -- and increasing the number of people vaccinated within communities with ongoing transmission, sometimes vaccinating whole villages.

"In everything we do, we are driven by science," Dr Tedros said. "The advice we were given by SAGE in May has been applied, always taking into account community needs and preferences, as we know this will make the approach more effective. The changes made have saved thousands of lives in this outbreak."

"New therapeutics and better use of treatment protocols have also saved many lives. "To date, 973 people have been successfully treated and released from Ebola treatment centres, and we expect that the 1000th survivor will return to his or her community in the coming weeks," Dr Moeti said.

"Innovative vaccine strategies
------------------------------
"The introduction of the 2nd experimental vaccine is in line with the SAGE recommendations as are a number of other innovations.

"The main vaccination strategy used with the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine is a 'ring strategy' where all people who have come into contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola are given the vaccine. Where people are stigmatized or feel under threat protected, temporary 'pop-up', vaccination sites are set up, often at health posts, rather than near the homes of individuals infected with Ebola. This allows people to come for vaccination at a safe, more anonymous site, but also increases protection for vaccinators in areas where there is ongoing conflict and insecurity.

"Another approach being used to offer vaccination for people at high risk of contracting Ebola is 'targeted geographic vaccination'. This strategy involves vaccinating everyone in the neighbourhood, or village, rather than vaccinating only the known contacts and contacts of contacts. Targeted geographic vaccination was used successfully when the outbreak spread to Chowe in South Kivu.

"Over 90 percent of people who are offered vaccination accept it. Since the start of the outbreak WHO and partners have worked to recruit and train Congolese nationals from within Ebola-affected communities as vaccinators to increase community acceptance and also transfer skills to the region. Now, the majority of ring vaccination team members are trained healthcare workers, doctors and medical students from affected communities who speak local languages and understand community concerns."

DRC: More than 60% of patients cured within ALIMA's Ebola Treatment Center
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After more than a year of caring for Ebola patients at the Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo, ALIMA (The Alliance for International Medical Action) is transferring the management of the center to Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). Thanks to the quality of care provided at the ETC, more than 60% of patients with Ebola virus disease have recovered.

Nearly 4000 people, including 600 confirmed Ebola patients, were treated by ALIMA teams. Thanks to the innovative CUBE (a Biosecure Emergency Care Unit for Outbreaks), the quality of care compared to previous outbreaks has greatly improved. Today, it is possible to provide intensive care, resuscitate patients, perform wireless and sonic ultrasounds, transfusions, and perform certain surgical procedures such as cesarean sections. In addition, ALIMA participated very extensively in a clinical trial that identified 2 treatments (REGN-EB3 and mAB114), which are the 1st drugs to clearly show a significant decrease in mortality in people with the Ebola Virus. Today, our teams continue to operate at the Ebola Treatment Center in Katwa, with the same quality of care.

As the management of the Beni ETC is handed over to MSF, 3 members of the ALIMA team reflect on their experience and work at the centre. - [read their accounts at the source URL above]
