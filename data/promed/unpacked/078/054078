Mumps outbreak in Jerusalem affecting mainly male adolescents
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Rapid communication: C Stein-Zamir, H Shoob, N Abramson, et al.
Jerusalem District Health Office, Ministry of Health, Israel]

Mumps is a notifiable disease in Israel by law. From mid-September
2009 to 7 Dec 2009, 173 cases of mumps have been reported to the
Jerusalem District Health Office [up from 105 on 16 Nov 2009. -
Mod.CP]. The patients were mainly (147/173; 85 percent) students in
yeshivas (religious academies operated as boarding schools) in
several Jerusalem neighbourhoods and 2 neighbouring cities, and 142
of 173 (82 percent) were males. The epidemic curve is presented shows
a pattern compatible with person-to-person transmission. The median
age of the patients was 14.5 years and the mean was 14.8 plus/minus
7.3 years. Altogether, 60 schools have been affected [listed in a
table in the original text]. The outbreak spread to other regions of
the country, and up to 7 Dec 2009 over 250 cases have been reported
with similar demographic and epidemiologic characteristics.

The clinical picture included unilateral and bilateral parotitis. One
patient (a 19 year-old) was hospitalised in a urology department with
orchitis and another 3 were admitted to ear, nose, and throat
departments. A further 6 patients were observed for varying periods
in hospital emergency departments and discharged.

Case ascertainment included: positive mumps IgM antibody (in 20
patients) and positive real-time RT-PCR in urine (in 4 patients). The
virus was classified by the central virology laboratory of the Israel
ministry of health as genotype G5. The remaining 149 cases were
diagnosed on the basis of clinical features together with an
epidemiologic association.

Of the 173 patients, 116 (67 percent) had received 2 doses of
measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine (Priorix GlaxoSmithKline
Biologicals-Jeryl Lynn strain), 29 (16.8 percent) had received one
dose (age-appropriate in 12 of them), 20 (11.6 percent) were not
immunised, and in another eight patients (4.6 percent) the
immunisation status was unknown

A number of patients reported contact with yeshiva students from the
United States (New York) who visited Israel during the High Holidays
in mid-September 2009 and some of whom were reported to have recently
had mumps.

Outbreak control measures included investigations in the relevant
schools to determine the students' vaccination status and referral
for completion of MMR vaccination where necessary. Information on the
outbreak was circulated to all health maintenance organisations in
the District and to the public via the mass media.

Discussion
----------
Mumps is an acute viral infection; a third of infections are
subclinical, another 30-40 percent are expressed clinically as
unilateral or bilateral parotitis. Complications occur more
frequently in adults than in children; 10-15 percent of mumps
patients develop meningo-encephalitis. Orchitis occurs in 20-50
percent of post-pubertal men, but sterility is rare. Other
complications include pancreatitis, oophoritis, deafness, arthritis,
thyroiditis, and myocarditis. Transmission is through droplet
infection. Confirmation of mumps infection includes serological
testing (for IgM antibodies by various methods), identification of
mumps RNA by RT-PCR and viral isolation in cell culture (1).

Mumps vaccination was included in the routine childhood immunisation
schedule in Israel in 1984, and since 1994 has been administered in a
two-dose schedule at ages 12 months and 6 years (1st grade in school)
in the form of the MMR vaccine, and since 2008 as
measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) vaccine. The average overall
immunisation coverage for the 1st dose of mumps vaccine (MMR/MMRV) in
the Jerusalem District has been maintained between 93 and 96.7
percent over the past decade [Jerusalem District Health Office,
unpublished data]. It is to be noted that in 1992, the coverage for
the 1st dose of MMR among the Jewish population of Jerusalem was a
mere 82.3 percent.

Mumps control in Israel improved significantly during the 1990's (2),
although periodic outbreaks still occurred due to under-vaccination,
primary vaccine failure, and waning immunity. In 1998 and 2005, 2
outbreaks (each of the order of 100 cases) occurred in Israel. In
2006, 12 cases were reported; 6 were reported in 2007 and 13 in 2008.
Serological studies performed in the late 1990s revealed relatively
low mumps antibody levels among adolescents and army recruits in
Israel, ranging from 59 to 83.3 percent positivity; such levels do
not guarantee adequate herd immunity (3, 4).

Mumps outbreaks, mainly involving adolescents and young adults, have
emerged recently in several countries. A nationwide mumps outbreak
occurred in the United Kingdom in 2004-2005, with 56 390 reported
cases. The majority (79 percent) were aged 15-24 years; two thirds
were unvaccinated. Non-availability of MMR vaccine probably
contributed to susceptibility of the birth cohorts 1983-1986 [5]. In
the United States, the largest outbreak in 20 years occurred in
2006-2007, encompassing more than 6 000 cases centred in college
campuses. Of the students aged 18-24 years, 84 percent had been
vaccinated with 2 doses of mumps vaccine (6). The epidemic occurred
despite high vaccination rates and low mumps activity in the community (7).

England and Wales are currently in the throes of an outbreak of mumps
centred in college campuses, with 998 cases reported in
January-February 2009, and further cases still being reported, mainly
among college students. The circulating genotype is G5 (8).

Other European outbreaks have been reported in recent years. In an
Austrian outbreak involving over 200 cases (9), 49 percent of the
patients were unvaccinated -- a very different situation from the
outbreak we report. In the Republic of Moldova, an extremely large
outbreak of nearly 20 000 cases was reported in 2007-2008 (10). Most
of the patients (96 percent) had received only one dose of MMR. A
2-dose schedule was introduced in that country in 2002, for birth
cohorts from 1995 onwards.

In an ongoing mumps outbreak in the United States (New York, New
Jersey), and Canada (Quebec), 179 and 15 cases, respectively, were
reported in August-October 2009. The affected individuals are mainly
members of a Jewish religious community (83 percent males; median age
14 years). Of those for whom vaccination status is known 72 percent
were vaccinated with 2 doses. The virus was of genotype G [?] (11).

Conclusions
-----------
The 2 main characteristics of the current outbreak in Jerusalem are
the predominance of male adolescents in religious boarding schools
and the fact that most cases (74 percent) are appropriately
vaccinated for their age. The male predominance is striking, and
requires further study.

It had been observed that the mumps component of the MMR vaccine
provides inferior protection compared to the measles and rubella
components. Unlike the levels of 95 percent and 98 percent provided
by the latter 2, the mumps protection levels are approximately 62 85
percent and 85 88 percent for the 1st and 2nd doses, respectively.

Recently, the effectiveness in the United Kingdom was determined as
88 percent and 95 percent, respectively. However, the effectiveness
of one dose waned from 96 percent in two year-olds to 66 percent in
11-12 year-olds, and the effectiveness of two doses from 99 percent
in 5-6 year-olds to 86 percent in 11-12 year-olds [12].

The reasons for the particular characteristics of these mumps
outbreaks are unclear. Possible explanations include a combination of
primary and secondary vaccine failure, waning immunity, inadequate
vaccine effectiveness, and previous low immunisation coverage.
Contributory factors include living conditions in specific population
groups such as college freshmen, army recruits, and adolescent
students in boarding schools.

[The continued prevalence of mumps in several different countries in
the face of high levels of vaccination may be due to poor initial
response to vaccination in a proportion of individuals and/or early
waning of the immune response in others. One predisposing factor has
been the congregation of young adults in colleges and similar
educational establishments. The yeshiva system of boarding schools in
Israel and in orthodox Jewish communities elsewhere seems to provide
similar conditions allowing the transmission of mumps in younger
age-groups despite higher levels of vaccination. Further information
regarding the containment of the Jerusalem outbreak would be welcomed.
