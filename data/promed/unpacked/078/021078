Here we go again. This statement has been obsolete for more than a decade, but continues to be repeated and repeated: "How many others in Chennai got bitten by the same dog and how many other dogs were rabid in Chennai will never be known, for want of a case-based surveillance system in India" [ProMED-mail post 20140826.2724516].

In truth, the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence has been conducting such surveillance at government hospitals throughout India since 2003. The Central Bureau of Health Intelligence data collection system does not include private and nonprofit hospitals and clinics, but since only government hospitals are part of the free post-exposure rabies vaccination program and have the facilities to knowingly house persons displaying rabies symptoms, it is unlikely that many rabies cases elude the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence dragnet.

You can find their data here: http://cbhidghs.nic.in/index1.asp?linkid=267.

Their 2013 rabies data shows 138 total human deaths (100 male, 38 female), with 57 deaths in West Bengal [state], 21 in Andhra Pradesh [state], 10 in Delhi [state], and only 60 in the entire rest of the nation through 13 Dec 2013: http://cbhidghs.nic.in/writereaddata/mainlinkFile/Health%20Status%20Indicators-2013.pdf.

"20 000 deaths are unacceptable." That was what David Semple and William F. Harvey believed when they did the 1st national survey of rabies cases in India in 1911. The figure of 20 000 is projected from their research, has become the foundation for an entire rabies response industry, and has also been repeated ad infinitum for decades, even though it is demonstrably grossly exaggerated. The Central Bureau of Health Intelligence has found between 221 and 361 human rabies deaths per year, nationwide.

Details: "Official" Indian human rabies death toll of 20 000 ignored government's own data and appears to have been based on 101-year-old research, http://wp.me/p4pKmM-ro. Once the exaggerated numbers are thrown out, and the associated notion that rabies is endemic at all times and in all places throughout India, then targeted vaccination of street dogs should be able to eradicate rabies as effectively there as has already been accomplished here in the US.

Mission Rabies is doing just that: Mission Rabies vaccinates 60 000 dogs in 10 Indian cities in 30 days: http://wp.me/p4pKmM-rs.

Update about Mission Rabies, which has now vaccinated more than 101 000 dogs in just under a year: http://www.missionrabies.com/.

Moderator MHJ wrote [in ProMED-mail post 20140826.2724516]: "On the other hand I have long held that any human rabies cases are the responsibility of the veterinary services because canine control of rabies through vaccination is cheap, well-proven, and not complicated. Frankly, in my book, urban rabies control is so straightforward that it is the equivalent of bovine mastitis control in dairy herds; any large animal veterinarian can do the latter, so any public health veterinarian should be able to do the former." [This was based on my experience in Brazil. MHJ]

Reluctantly I must disagree with this statement. The control of rabies in owned controlled dogs in urban situations is indeed easy and in situations where this is the predominant form of dog ownership, there is no excuse for urban rabies. However, in many countries, including India, dog populations are much more complicated than this with a mixture of dog types from fully controlled and owned dogs through dogs cared for by the community but not owned to dogs which are truly unowned and uncontrolled. In these situations, it can be very difficult to ensure the required level of population immunity to eliminate rabies. This is made particularly difficult by the very high rate of turnover of the population with very few dogs reaching 4 years old and most dying within the 1st year of life. Control of street dogs is complicated by the fact that many are seen as owned but cannot easily be caught. In some situations, "tie up" campaigns have been used where any dog not tied up on a given day is regarded as unowned and shot. This can work quite well in rural situations, but shooting dogs in urban areas is fraught with difficulties ranging from actually finding the dogs to human casualties. Poisoning (often done with strychnine) has similar safety issues as well as not reaching all dogs. Dogs breed quickly and urban populations recover quickly. Control or urban dog rabies is not simple in many countries.

This does not mean that I advocate widespread human pre-exposure vaccination. I think that simple public health messages of how to deal with a dog bite (e.g., washing with soap and water 1st, and the seeking medical attention) and how to avoid dog bites need to be better promoted as well as making sure that doctors know what they should do.

[I should point out that Merritt has extensive experience globally, and Nick in Albania, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. I am very grateful to both of them for their comments and for jumping in when I dragged my moderator coat. It is clear that our successes with eradicating canine rabies in Europe and the Americas were simple in comparison to the problems in Asia. Whether and how oral vaccines might be used, following their successes with wildlife, in domesticated and semi-domesticated dogs has yet to be explored, much less its feasibility epidemiologically and economically. But I stand by my belief that cost effective rabies control is a responsibility of the veterinary profession, and any human case represents a failure. This has been an interesting and instructive discussion, but the primary purpose of ProMED is the informing of events associated with emerging infectious diseases and similar toxic events, not discussion. So this thread is now cut. - Mod.MHJ
