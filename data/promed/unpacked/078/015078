Cooking oil deaths rise to 30
Seven people died from dropsy caused by adulterated mustard oil in New
Delhi on Sunday, taking the number
dead in the capital to 30 as fear of an epidemic spread to more Indian states.
Seven companies producing mustard oil - much used for cooking and in Indian
pickles - were charged with
allegedly lacing it with petrol and other toxins. Dropsy causes swelling of
the limbs, breathlessness and nausea and can lead to glaucoma or a heart
attack.
