So far this year, the provincial health district of Granada has detected 27
cases of brucellosis, a disease also known as Malta fever [as well as
Mediterranean fever, remittent fever, and undulant fever - Mod.LL] that
affects mainly those in direct contact with animals or animal tissue.
As in previous years, the majority of cases have been detected in the
northeastern and southern sanitary districts of the province, with an
average of 80 cases per year. Nonetheless, these numbers are clearly
tending to decrease.
However, during May and June 2003, there was an epidemic outbreak in Motril
(Granada), with at least 27 cases linked to the consumption of fresh cheese
acquired directly from the farmers who produced it and sold it in the
municipality.
The cases of brucellosis as a result of drinking [unpasteurized - Mod.LL]
milk (most frequently goat milk), or its fresh byproducts (generally cheese
and sometimes cottage cheese) are ever more rare in Granada.
During the last decade, 55 percent of the cases registered in Granada were
attributed to direct contact with livestock, 21 percent to the intake of
infected dairy products, 18 percent to mixed causes, and in 6 percent
air-borne transmission was suspected.
The data indicates that brucellosis continues to be a public health concern.
There are preventive measures, but their success depends on the cooperation
of various agencies and institutions, as well as on the modification of
personal and hygiene habits.
Although there is no brucellosis vaccine for humans, there is one for the
animals, which constitute its natural reservoir. In Spain, the disease
currently affects goats and sheep -- bovines are usually free of the disease.
