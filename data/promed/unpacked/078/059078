The associate director of scientific programs at the Yerkes Regional Primate
Center at Emory University in Georgia announced today at a news conference
that a member of a researach tem died Wed, 10 Dec after contracting the
herpes B virus from a rhesus monkey about 6 weeks ago.
Body fluid from the monkey struck the woman in the eye while she was moving
the cage and trying to look into the cage to make sure the animal was all
right. Symptoms of disease developed about 10 days after the event. It is
not known what the fluid was, or even if came from the animal as urine or
saliva.
While common among macaque monkeys, used in the Yerkes AIDS research
programs, herpes B does no real harm to the animals but is fatal in 70
percent of infected humans. Only 40 cases of monkey-to-human transmission
have been recorded in the past half century, and most of them resulted from
bites or scratches., against which the victim and all Yerkes researchers are
protected by masks, gloves and fine mesh screening the cages.
The woman, whose name is being witheld at the request of her family was
hospitalized and responded well to anti-viral drugs. The day after her
release from the hospital for further recuperation at home, she reported
weakness in her legs and was readmitted to the hospital where she died two
days later.

[Herpes virus B (cercopithecine herpesvirus 1, herpes simiae virus) is
classified as a member of the family _Herpesviridae_, subfamily
_Alphaherpesvirinae_, genus
_Simplexvirus_. The natural history of this virus is similar to that of
human herpes simplex 1 virus of humans. The few fatal cases of herpes B
virus infection in animal handlers have been characterized by ascending
paralysis and encephalitis; transmission has been attributed to animal
bites. The disease in monkeys is called "B virus disease". It remains to
be determined how this unfortunate animal handler acquired her infection. -
