Madagascar is used to fighting mosquitoes, but not the kind responsible for
the fever outbreak that is crippling the eastern port town of Toamasina, where
experts warn that conventional vector control will not be enough.
Since the beginning of 2006 nearly all Toamasina's 200 000 residents have
reportedly come down with a fever as a result of either dengue or chikungunya
fever. Both diseases are spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
"We are sending a joint World Health Organisation (WHO) and Ministry of Health
team there [Toamasina] on Sunday to better understand the behaviour of the
mosquito. It is a different mosquito from the one transmitting malaria, which
they are used to," the WHO country representative, Dr Leonard Tapsoba, told
IRIN. Known locally as 'malaria season', the rainy season with its pools of
stagnant water means breeding conditions for mosquitoes are optimal.
The symptoms and treatment of chikungunya and dengue fever are very similar,
making it difficult for health practitioners to distinguish between them,
Tapsoba said. [That doesn't matter, since the treatment is the same. -
Mod.JW]. "There is only symptomatic treatment, so the only response is vector
control. They [officials] have started fumigation and cleaning, but we also
need to better understand the mosquito."
According to Tabsoba, ..."the dengue mosquito is active during the day and
outdoors, so traditional measures like impregnated [insecticide-treated] bed
nets and normal measures are not enough."
An awareness campaign has been launched, urging the population to participate
in a mass clean-up drive. "This is a fight by the community -- they have to
remove any potential water reservoir that the mosquito can use as a breeding
ground -- but because people have jobs, and it breeds during the day, this is
very difficult," he said. [I don't see why people can't clean up before they
go to work or after they get home -- it's an emergency. - Mod.JW].
Agence France-Presse quoted Dr Clarette Dinh-Van, a general physician
operating a private clinic in Toamasina, as saying, "In the last 3 months,
between 80 and 90 percent of Toamasina residents have had a fever."
Health officials are still uncertain as to whether the outbreak can be
attributed to a mosquito-borne disease called chikungunya, Swahili for 'that
which bends up', which has been spreading across the Indian Ocean islands, or
dengue, "because surveillance is picking up all types of fever and Madagascar
does not have the specific viral lab capacity to identify the cause," Tapsoba
noted. Tapsobo said blood samples have been sent to France for testing and
dengue has been confirmed. One case of chikungunya was also registered.

Mauritius, where [Indian] President Abdul Kalam is currently on a visit, is
reeling under a serious attack of chikungunya fever, a painful mosquito-borne
disease for which there is no cure or vaccine.
The disease has already infected more than 180 000 people, mostly in the
Reunion. In Mauritius alone, 1500 cases of this fever have already been
confirmed while 6000 suspected cases are awaiting test results.
The fever already killed at least 78 people as of February 2006 [in Reunion,
the death toll had reached 93 by 4 Mar 2006, see ProMED post 20060304.0699. -
Mod.RY]. The tropical virus, first recognised in Tanzania in 1952, is marked
by high fever and severe rashes and can be extremely painful, giving its
victims a stooped posture.
Director of India Malaria Research Centre A P Dash said: "All precautions must
be taken by visitors going to the affected countries to remain safe. The
precautions are similar to those taken against dengue."
Chikungunya fever is characterised by sudden fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting, arthralgia and rash. In contrast to dengue, chikungunya is
characterised by a briefer febrile episode and by persistent arthralgia in
some cases.
An official of India National Vector Disease Control Programme said: "The
mosquito-borne chikungunya virus is jumping from one island to another in the
Indian Ocean region. Tourists are also refraining from going to these islands.
Now it [is] official that chikungunya was not only found in persons coming to
Mauritius from abroad -- as Mauritian authorities held for a long time -- but
is also being spread by mosquito bites in Mauritius."
Mauritius meanwhile has taken all the essential steps to restrict the outbreak
of the fever. A national committee on the chikungunya epidemic has been set up.
Spraying and fogging machines were ordered from abroad and some 100 000 litres
of insecticides were bought to cover the whole country.
The mosquito that spreads the disease, _Aedes albopictus_ or Asian tiger
mosquito, is prevalent in parts of the Mediterranean, and scientists say there
is a possibility of a European outbreak during summer.
