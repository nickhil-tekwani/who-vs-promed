At least 100 goats have perished displaying symptoms of cold and fever at Ragapur village in Sirpur (U) mandal [administrative division] in the last 4 days spreading panic among the Gonds [aboriginal peoples (now officially designated as Scheduled Tribes) of central and south-central India].

"We are unable to understand what ails the goats," wondered one [farmer] whose goats fell ill 2 days back. Kanaka Sonabai, the local Asha workers, and some other villagers informed the animal husbandry department of the disease which seems to be endemic as of now. The veterinarian did respond but failed in saving the goats the loss being valued at over Rs 4 lakh [Rs 400 000, about USD 6050] in terms of money.

According to villagers, the goats seemed to have contracted the disease while grazing in the nearby open lands. "The animals developed the symptoms only in the night after returning from grazing," [the farmer] disclosed.

["Symptoms of cold and fever" is a rather uncommon clinical terminology in reference to goat disease. In case "cold" is derived from popular human health language, the description may refer to upper respiratory signs (nasal discharge?), combined with elevated temperature. On the other hand, the apparent acuteness of the condition, and its attribution to grazing, may be indicative of toxic or metabolic etiology. More details, and in particular results of veterinary investigation, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
