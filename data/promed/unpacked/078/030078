After being one of the worst-hit countries in the battle against coronavirus, [in Spain] fears of an outbreak of dengue, chikungunya and West Nile viruses have been raised. It comes after a new mosquito species was reported in the country.

_Aedes japonicus_ originally comes from Japan, Korea, China and Russia. It is believed the insect arrived in Spain through the trading of used tyres that come from these countries.

But the Association of Pest Control Companies of Catalonia (ADEPAP) has warned the new species has already been spotted in northern Spain. So far, there have been reports of the bug in Asturias and Cantabria, but ADEPAP warns it is not ruled out to be in Galicia and areas of Catalonia.

Unlike the tiger mosquito, this species can carry infectious viruses such as dengue, chikungunya and the West Nile virus. These bugs reportedly can survive in cold climates and can easily establish themselves in livestock spaces.

Eggs are even known to resist frost but cannot withstand temperatures of more than 30 deg C. The mosquito lays its eggs in small pools or places where water can accumulate.

But the ADEPAP has warned any accumulation of water should be avoided in a bid to stop the spread of reproduction. Despite the early warnings, it is reported the mosquitos are very difficult to eradicate.

Back in May [2020], fears of a spread of dengue fever were raised after health authorities warned they must be "prepared for the prevention and control of new outbreaks." Rosa Cano Portero, member of the Public Health Surveillance Group of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, and Beatriz Fernandez Martinez, epidemiologist, said: "It is believed that climate change may favour its expansion to new areas further north."

[_Aedes japonicus_ is extending its geographic range in Spain. It has been found previously in Asturias and Cantabria. This species can go into diapause and survive winter conditions. There appear to be no barriers to its dissemination in Spain. Eradication with currently available technology is not possible. Its presence and virus vector capacity does represent a potential public health threat. However, in contrast with the tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) that is also found in Spain, it is neither as urban nor as aggressive (in biting) people and is often found in wooded areas. - Mod.TY
