Tanzania to Discard Chloroquine in Treating Malaria
-----------------------------------------------
The Tanzanian Health Ministry Saturday announced the decision to replace
chloroquine, a common drug used in the country to cure malaria, with a new
drug by August this year. Sulfadoxine pyrimethamine (SP), the new drug,
includes brand-name drugs Falcidin, Fansidar, Laridox, Malostat, Orodar,
and Metakelfinl, a senior expert said here on Saturday.
Alex Mwita, Program Manager of the National Program on Malaria Control in
the ministry, said that the new treatment follows the government's plan to
withdraw chloroquine from malaria treatment. He said that research done in
a number of regions on chloroquine's efficacy on malaria show that the
percentage of malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine has increased from
5 percent in l960 to 52 percent in l990. The World Health Organization
(WHO) recommends that if a drug reaches 25 percent resistant to diseases
it has to be changed.
"The problem we have here is that the situation is more dangerous to
children and pregnant women," Mwita said. "By [allowing resistance to
chloroquine to reach 52 percent, the country is very late in adopting
alternative treatment to malaria."
He outlined an acceptable timetable for the SP treatment of malaria from
2-month-old infants to adults.

[Tanzania is now the second country in Africa to drop formally the use of
chloroquine as part of its malaria treatment strategy. Kenya announced
this change in 1999 (see ProMED-mail postings). Resistance rates to
sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) also have been increasing in the
region, raising concerns about the next line of defense. In particular, the
rate of resistance to Fansidar in Malawi is already close to 25%. One of
the major concerns with the increasing drug resistance in Africa is the
easy and uncontrolled access to drugs at local markets, where the drugs are
often sold tablet by tablet. People buy the number of tablets they can
afford, not the number needed for effective treatment. - Mods.MPP,EP
