According to the Ministry of Health, infections and deaths caused by rickettsiosis have [more than doubled] in Baja California between the years 2020 and 2021.

Dr Nestor Saul Hernandez Milan, head of the Evaluation and Monitoring Unit of the Institute of Public Health Services of Baja California (ISESALUD), pointed out that 58 cases were reported in 2021, of which 15 died, while in 2020 there were 25 cases and 8 deaths. "Of these 58 positive cases, we have 23 in Mexicali, 17 in Tijuana, 16 in Ensenada, and 2 cases in Vicente Guerrero and San Quintin. Deaths so far have been 15, out of which 7 are in Mexicali, 7 in Tijuana, and 1 in Ensenada," he said.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tickborne disease caused by the organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_. Typically, the progress of the disease is a sudden onset of high fever, deep muscle pain, severe headache, and chills. A rash usually appears on the extremities within 5 days, then soon spreads to palms and soles and then rapidly to the trunk. Fatalities can be seen in over 20% of untreated cases. Death is uncommon with prompt recognition and treatment. Still, approximately 3-5% of cases seen in the USA are fatal. The absence or delayed appearance of the typical rash or the failure to recognize it, especially in dark-skinned people, causes a delay in diagnosis and increased fatalities. Early stages of RMSF can be confused with ehrlichiosis, meningococcal meningitis, and enteroviral infection.

The organism is maintained in nature in ticks. It can be transmitted to dogs and other mammals, but most times these cases cause little illness. People usually get infected from an infected tick bite. The tick requires from several hours to 24 hours of attachment and feeding to become infectious to people. So prompt removal of the tick can prevent infection. It is not transmitted person to person. RMSF can be diagnosed in the laboratory using serological techniques, PCR, or culture; however, because of the necessity of prompt treatment, diagnosis is based on symptoms. There is no vaccine available for RMSF. It can be treated with tetracyclines either orally or intravenously.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _R. rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA including the Rocky Mountains and also parts of southern Canada, Central America, and South America.

Early recognition of this disease is vital in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (an area that is red and has small, confluent bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial (red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage) and purpuric (purple spots) involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the first 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
