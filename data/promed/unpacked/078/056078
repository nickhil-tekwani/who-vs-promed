New case of E. coli confirmed
------------------------------------------
The numbers continue to climb as one more confirmed case of E. coli in the
London [Ontario area was diagnosed yesterday and 125 are suspected of being
infected
with the dangerous illness.
The medical officer of health, Graham Pollett, said the sixth confirmed case
is a 35-year-old London man, & the latest one involving 4 people in the same
family to be diagnosed with or suspected of having _E. coli_ O157:H7.
Pollett said the father in the family is a "tertiary case," meaning he
probably picked it up from one of his children.
"This is associated with the fair because one of the man's sons, who was not
laboratory confirmed, appears to have transmitted it to him," Pollett said.
"There was a family trip to the fair."
Livestock from a petting zoo at Western Fair have been tested and other farm
animals housed in the same building will be tested as well. Officials still
don't know if the infection comes from the petting zoo area, which was in
the southwest corner of the building, or the barn area at the building's
east side.
