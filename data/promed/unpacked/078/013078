According to this story, thick tuna steaks are being served at area
restaurants with barely seared exteriors and they slice open to reveal a
purple
interior of completely raw fish. And along with seasoned but uncooked
salmon tartare, rare duck breast, wafer-thin slices of beef carpaccio or a
plate of freshly shucked oysters resting on ice, raw is all the rage.
It seems that fine restaurants increasingly serve raw and barely cooked
dishes, in part to make a statement about the freshness and superiority of
their ingredients.
[The ingredients might be fresh but oh so fresh parasites, bacteria, and
viruses can still be within. I prefer a well done mouseburger, myself.
Many of the toxins like paralytic shellfish poisoning are heat stabile so I
won't include them.
Here's a few unexpected tidbits for the raw food fans
Parasites: Anisakids, _Diphyllobothrium latum_, not to mention _Clonorchis
sinensis_, _Paragonimus westermani_ and Opisthorchis species.
Bacteria: All the more important types including salmonella, staphylococcus,
clostridial infections (type e), _Bacillus cereus_, _Streptococcus
faecalis_ and _Proteus_ species. Other problems might include
_Erysipelothrix_ and leptospira. Not to mention _Vibrio cholerae_ and _V.
parahemolyticus_.
Viral: Hepatitis A and C. --- Mod. pc]
