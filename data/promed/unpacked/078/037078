[1] Liberia: court suspends ban on mass gatherings in Monrovia

Liberia's top court issued a stay on a government order banning public gatherings in the capital ahead of Senate elections next week that was imposed because electioneering risks spreading Ebola, Information Minister Lewis Brown said on Sun [7 Dec 2014]. Liberia is the country hardest hit by the epidemic and has recorded more than 3000 deaths out of more than 6000 victims from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to World Health Organization figures. The country's epidemic is gradually being brought under control, but the toll has damaged healthcare and has already caused a delay in Senate elections initially set for October 2014 in a country that emerged from a long civil war in 2003.

Presiding Associate Justice Philip Banks issued the stay pending 2 Supreme Court hearings this week, Brown said. On Mon [8 Dec 2014], the court will hear a petition by civil society groups, prominent citizens and some political parties who seek a delay to the Senate elections, now set for 16 Dec 2014, until Ebola is eradicated. On Wed [10 Dec 2016], the court will hear a separate petition by independent Senate candidate Robert Sirleaf, the son of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. He argues that a government order last week banning public gatherings in the capital where he is standing is punitive and discriminatory... - more

The fight against Ebola received a boost today [8 Dec 2014] with the arrival of 20 000 sets of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) from the Japan Disaster Relief Team. It is the 1st batch of 700 000 sets of such equipment committed by the Government of Japan to the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER). The equipment committed by the Government of Japan to UNMEER should help provide critical protection to healthcare workers in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Mali...

According to the UN World Health Organization (WHO), it is most important to have protective equipment that protects the mouth, nose and eyes from contaminated droplets and fluids. Given that hands are known to transmit pathogens to other parts of the body, as well as to other individuals, gloves are essential, both to protect the health worker and to prevent transmission to others. Face cover, protective foot wear, gowns or coveralls, and head cover are also considered essential to prevent transmission to healthcare workers... - more

[3] Region: Safe schools in the fight against Ebola
Date: Mon 8 Dec 2014
Source: Huffington post [edited]
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gordon-brown/safe-schools-ebola-gordon-brown_b_6286170.html


A new initiative for schools that will combat Ebola has been launched in the wake of a visit to the worst affected areas in West Africa by World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and International Finance Corporation CEO Jin-Yong Cai. The initiative comes as the global educational organization "World at School" reports that 5 million children are no longer attending school simply because of the Ebola outbreak. While in some extreme cases schools have to be closed when they are at the center of an outbreak, investing in safe schools -- and the return of pupils to receive regular temperature checks and health education -- may be the best way to combat Ebola's further spread.

The day-to-day lives of today's victims of widespread school closures in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are very different from a year ago. The students now have no place to learn, but that does not stop them mixing with each other, going outside and congregating in the streets. This is, of course, at odds with the public health rationale for closing schools. And while they could be receiving vital health information in their schools and undergoing temperature checks every day, they wander the streets instead, far outside the capacity of the already overburdened health systems to keep an eye on them.

The vast bulk of schools should be seen as the 1st line of defense in preventing Ebola's spread and keeping children healthy. A safe school is one where there are teachers trained in basic public health. Schoolchildren are alerted to vital information about cleanliness, and about proper nutrition to keep their powers of resistance strong. With twice daily temperature checks, schools can be a monitoring and early warning system against the spread of disease.

Only a few months ago, Nigeria stopped the spread of Ebola. One key reason was that all state ministries of education ordered a minimum of 2 staff in each school to be properly trained by health workers about the Ebola virus. The U.N. agencies that are ready to move -- and that work hand in hand with governments -- are willing to establish clear guidelines for the reopening of safe schools and help prepare the necessary plans and safeguards. But until the world understands what we are losing by keeping schools closed, the shortage of funds frustrates the scale of response needed.

[4] Nigeria: number of doctors - correction
Date: 8 Dec 2014
From: Ebere Okereke <Ebere.Okereke@phe.gov.uk> [edited]


In the ProMED bulletin (Ebola virus disease - West Africa (221): Liberia, S. Leone, Nigerians, orphans), you mention that Nigeria only has only 4000 registered medics. I think you will find that this is incorrect. The Nigerian Medical Council claims 35 000 members, and the CIA world fact book estimated that Nigeria had 0.4 doctors/1000 population in 2008 (ref. http://www.indexmundi.com/g/r.aspx?c=ni&v=2226; which, assuming a population of 170 million, puts the number of doctors at 68 000.

[I got that statistic from: List of Registered Medical Practitioners - statistics http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/register/search_stats.asp. Top 20 countries of qualification.

On reflection, this must be the number of Nigerian doctors registered in the UK. I regret the error.

On the other hand, another online site reports:

Africa's Brain Drain: Nigerian Medical Doctors, by John Campbell, 29 Oct 2013:
"Dr. Enabulele said that of 71 740 medical doctors registered with the Medical and Dental Council, only 27 000 are practicing in Nigeria." http://blogs.cfr.org/campbell/2013/10/29/africas-brain-drain-nigerian-medical-doctors

But in any case, even if all 600 Nigerians arriving in West Africa are doctors, they would not severely deplete the number in the country as I had feared. - Mod.JW]
