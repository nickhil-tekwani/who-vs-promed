Rabies, Liberia
---------------
Information received on [and dated] 19 Nov 2020 from Dr Joseph RN Anderson, Director of Livestock/Veterinary Services, Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Monrovia, Liberia

Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 17 Nov 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Nov 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Buchanan City, Buchanan, No3, Grand Bassa
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Dogs / - / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

Affected population: a stray dog
Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: a stray dog suddenly became aggressive and started attacking residents within a municipal area. The area has a high dog population where no rabies vaccination was performed in the past 5 years. Fishing activities are predominant within the area giving rise to a large street or stray dog population.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Rabies is still a pervasive global threat. Half of the world's population lives in an endemic area, and more than 80% of deaths occur in rural areas, where access to health education campaigns and post-bite prophylaxis is limited or inexistent. Africa and Asia are the continents with the highest risk of human mortality, with more than 95% of the world's fatal cases. These regions are also where canine rabies is controlled the least.

"Around 99 [percent] of human cases of rabies are due to bites from infected dogs. Controlling and eradicating rabies therefore means combatting it at its animal source.

"Mass vaccination of dogs is the method of choice, as this is the only real way to interrupt the disease's infectious cycle between animals and humans. It is estimated that by vaccinating 70% of the dogs where infection is still rife, rabies could be eradicated in dogs and the number of human cases would rapidly drop to almost zero. Excellent anti-rabies vaccines for dogs, developed according to OIE standards, are nowadays available." (Source: OIE Rabies Portal https://tinyurl.com/y52eoetx)

"Despite a long history of dog-transmitted human rabies outbreaks in Liberia, West Africa, no reports exist of molecular characterization of the causative lyssaviruses. This study investigated rabies lyssavirus (RABV) strains isolated at the dog-human interface in Monrovia, Liberia 2016 and 2017, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, using primers specific for the nucleoprotein (N) gene. Out of 20 specimens (19 dog brain samples and one human saliva) tested as suspected rabies cases, three (15%) were positive. Purified amplicons from all 3 positive specimens were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA7 and PhyML3 to determine their relationship with RABV sequences accessioned in NCBI GenBank. The 1st of 3 RABV strains detected clustered with China lineage 2 RABVs of dogs (99% homology to KU963489 and DQ666322). The 2nd strain segregated with Africa lineage 2 RABVs also of dog origin, and the 3rd strain segregated with Africa lineage 3 RABVs of Southern Africa viverrids. Our results show a transcontinental strain of rabies virus co-circulating with Africa lineages in post-conflict Liberia. This finding should stimulate more effective sub-regional planning and execution of one-health actions, towards stepwise surveillance and elimination of rabies in West Africa by 2030." (1)
