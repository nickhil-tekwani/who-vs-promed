The number of the cases of yellow fever in Angola has sharply declined as result of vaccination campaign started in Viana municipality, the epicenter of outbreak of disease.

This was announced [Fri 1 Jul 2016] by head of National Public Health Promotion Department, Filomena Wilson.

The health official also attributed the decline to intervention measures like active epidemiological surveillance, vector control, awareness campaign among population.

She also mentioned the mass vaccination of 11.3 million people in 9 provinces and 38 municipalities of Angola, as being among the factors that led to reduction of yellow fever. The head of the Health Department also said that the vaccination campaigns covered between 81 percent and about 100 percent of the planned target population.

In Angola, she added, 291 suspected cases of yellow fever including 13 confirmed by the laboratory of the National Institute of Health were reported in the last 4 weeks.

This figure represents a considerable reduction compared to the previous 4 weeks, in which, the country recorded 541 suspected cases and 116 confirmed.

The official also said vaccination campaigns against yellow fever are underway in the municipalities of Soyo, Cuango, and Chitatato as well as in the provinces of Zaire, Cunene, and Uige.

On the other hand, vaccination campaigns are being prepared to cover 11 municipalities considered of risk in the provinces of Lunda Norte, Benguela, Cuanza Norte, and Uige.

[It is good to learn that the numbers of yellow fever cases in Angola has recently declined. However, it is far to soon to relax, with campaigns getting underway in several municipalities. As long as there is ongoing transmission, there is reason for serious concern and continued action, not only for Angola, but also for neighboring DR Congo and beyond.
