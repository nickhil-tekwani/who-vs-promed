The recall of raw pork products due to possible _E. coli_ [O157] contamination has been expanded to more stores in Calgary and Edmonton.

Raw pork products bought at Trimming Fresh Meat (6219 Centre St NW) between 15 and 22 Jul 2014 and products from Hiep Hoa Asian Food (4710 17 Ave SE) between 15 and 29 Jul 2014 should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased.

According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency website, the products may not look or smell spoiled, however they still have the potential to make consumers sick. The expanded recall also includes frozen pork spring rolls, pork buns, and pork wontons from Vihn Fat Food Products (10630 97 St) in Edmonton sold between 10 Jul 2014 and 5 Sep 2014, which should be thrown out or returned to the point of purchase.

Alberta Health Services [AHS] said 153 people were diagnosed with _E. coli_ [O157] between 10 Jul 2014 and 3 Sep 2014, with 19 having to be hospitalized and 5 of those suffering the most serious form of the disease, which affects the kidneys [hemolytic uremic syndrome]. AHS officials said 45 people were hospitalized in Calgary and 46 in Edmonton and the remainder at smaller centres around the province.

Steps can be taken to avoid foodborne illnesses, including washing your hands thoroughly using hot, soapy water -- especially after using the washroom or changing a diaper -- cooking pork and beef products to at least 71 deg C (160 deg F) and thoroughly washing any cooking utensils that touch raw meat.

Nearly 2 months after scores of Albertans started falling ill from a potentially-fatal bacterium, health officials say they finally know what has been making them sick. Food safety investigators with the provincial health authority suspect the mysterious spike in _E. coli_ cases was caused by tainted pork from a pair of meat shops that supply numerous Asian restaurants in Alberta's 2 largest cities.

While testing has not yet found a definitive link between the outbreak that has so far sickened 100 people, put 19 in hospital and left 5 with kidney disease, all raw product sold at Calgary's V & T Meat and Food and Edmonton's Hiep Thanh Trading Ltd. since mid-July 2014 is now being recalled by federal food inspectors. "We have _E. coli_ O157:H7 from those 2 establishments and we're waiting for the genetic fingerprinting (that may link them to the human cases)," Dr James Talbot, the province's chief medical officer, said in an interview. "But the fact they had (that strain of bacteria) in product on site was enough to shut them down."

Alberta Health Services first issued public warnings about an unexpected rise in _E. coli_ illnesses in early August 2014 when they discovered a cluster of people had become ill from the same genetic strain of the toxin after eating at several ethnic restaurants in Edmonton. But another month passed and dozens more Albertans became sick before testing finally pinpointed tainted pork as the culprit.

When another group of identical cases cropped up in early August 2014 among Calgarians who had also frequented Asian eateries, investigators were almost certain the illnesses were being caused by a locally produced ingredient that all the restaurants were using. "We started off with the foods that have a track history with being associated with _E. coli_, so in the period after that we started to go after things like beef, bean sprouts, and green onions," he said. "None of that testing came up positive. It was a very frustrating time."

After a 22 Aug 2014 review of what people on the growing list of cases, including 44 from Calgary, had eaten, Talbot said pork was finally moved to the top of the list of suspect ingredients, and testing of raw and cooked product from the various restaurants began in earnest.

In early September 2014, investigators got their 1st positive test result from a pork sample and zeroed in on the 2 facilities that supplied the meat.

"This has been a very challenging investigation with a food that is not a common cause of _E. coli_ disease," said Talbot, "and because the exposures tended to be in Asian restaurants there were also difficulties with translation that complicated things."

While results from genetic testing will likely confirm the 2 meat shops were the source of the tainted pork, Talbot said the investigation is still far from over. "We're looking at people who may have supplied meat to those facilities," he said. "We need to move upstream to make sure there isn't other contaminated pork product still out there."

[The DNA "fingerprinting" is awaited to confirm the association between the pork and the human cases. As with ground beef, adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene will have diminished the risk. Whether the pork was contaminated with beef or was the primary cause of contamination is not at this point clear.
