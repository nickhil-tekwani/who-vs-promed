A case of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been confirmed in Khabarovsk.

According to the Khabarovsk Health Administration, the only way to prevent a massive outbreak of this disease is to undertake a thorough eradication of the rodent vector throughout the entire city. Disinfestation has already been completed in areas which had been flooded. Disinfestion will be carried out elsewhere as flooding recedes and is expected to be completed by 1 Oct 2013.

As a consequence of the flooding, the number of mice in Khabarovsk that are carriers of the disease is many times greater than normal.

People underestimate the danger associated with the invasion of rodents, according to Irina Shapiro, the head of the Health Department of the city administration. She also warns the population that after periods of flooding, great care should be taken regarding the consumption of vegetables, which should be thoroughly heat treated before consumption.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) embraces a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses of the family _Bunyaviridae_. HFRS occurs throughout the world. Puumala virus is the specific virus likely to be the cause of HFRS in the Kabarovsk Oblast. Contamination of dust, food, and hands with the dried urine and excreta of infected rodents, stirred up during cleaning of rodent-infested premises, is the main route of infection.

Khabarovsk is the largest city and the administrative center of Khabarovsk Krai, Russia, located 30 km (19 miles) from the Chinese border at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, about 800 km (500 miles) north of Vladivostok. The city also became the administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District of Russia in 2002. It is the 2nd largest city in the Russian Far East, after Vladivostok.

It can be located in the map of the Khabarovsk Krai at http://russiatrek.org/khabarovsk-krai. - Mod.CP
