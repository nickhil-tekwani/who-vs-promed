Outbreak at a glance
--------------------
As of [22 Jun 2022], 33 countries in 5 WHO Regions have reported 920 probable cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children which fulfill the WHO case definition. Since the previous Disease Outbreak News published on [27 May 2022], 270 new probable cases have been reported to WHO, including from 4 new countries. This Disease Outbreak News includes updates on the epidemiology of the outbreak, the publication of the new interim guidance on laboratory testing, and the launch of the clinical case report form on the WHO Global Clinical Platform. The detection of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children across 5 WHO Regions is unusual, and the severe clinical sequelae of some cases warrant detailed investigation.

Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
This outbreak was initially detected on [5 Apr 2022] when the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the United Kingdom) notified WHO of 10 cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in previously healthy young children aged under 10 years in the central belt of Scotland.

As of [22 Jun 2022], 33 countries in 5 WHO Regions have reported 920 probable cases (Figure 1). These include new and retrospectively identified cases since [1 Oct 2021] that fit the WHO case definition as stated below. There are 4 additional countries that have reported cases that are pending classification and are not included in the cumulative probable case count. Of the probable cases, 45 (5%) children have required transplants, and 18 (2%) deaths have been reported to WHO.

Half of the probable reported cases have been reported from the WHO European Region (20 countries reporting 460 cases), including 267 cases (29% of global cases) from the United Kingdom (Table 1, Figure 2). The 2nd highest number of probable cases have been reported from the Region of the Americas (n=383, including 305 cases from the United States of America), followed by the Western Pacific Region (n=61), the South-East Asia Region (n=14), and Eastern Mediterranean Region (n=2). A total of 17 countries are reporting more than 5 probable cases. The actual number of cases may be underestimated, in part due to the limited enhanced surveillance schemes in place. The case count is expected to change as more information and verified data become available.

W Pacific / 61 / 0 / 6 / 5 / 0 / 0
Cumulative / 920 / 45 / 64 / 327 / 44 / 18

Laboratory testing of cases
---------------------------
Based on the working case definition for probable cases, laboratory testing has excluded hepatitis A-E viruses in these children. Other pathogens were detected in a number of the cases, although the data reported to WHO are incomplete.

Adenovirus continues to be the most frequently detected pathogen among cases with available data. In the European region, adenovirus was detected by PCR in 55% of cases (203/371) with available results. Preliminary reports from the USA indicate that adenovirus was detected in 45% of cases (113/252) with available results.

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in a number of cases; however, data on serology results are limited. In the European region, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR in 15% of cases (47/307) with available results. Preliminary reports from the USA indicate that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10% of cases (8/83) with available results.

Most reported cases did not appear to be epidemiologically linked; however, epidemiologically linked cases have been reported in Scotland and the Netherlands.

Epidemiological characteristics of cases
----------------------------------------
Figure 2. Epidemiological curve of probable cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology with available data, by week, by WHO region, as of [22 Jun 2022] (n=476)

Note: The figure includes only cases for which dates of symptom onset, hospitalization, or notification were reported to WHO (n= 476). The date of symptom onset was used when available (n=289). If unavailable, the week of hospitalization (n=163), or the week of notification (n=24), was used.

[See original URL, but number per week appears to be dropping. - Mod.LL]

As of [22 Jun 2022], of 422 cases with information on gender and age, 48% of cases are male (n=202), and the majority of cases (78%, n=327) are under 6 years of age (Figure 3).

Out of 100 probable cases with available clinical data, the most commonly reported symptoms were nausea or vomiting (54% of cases), jaundice (49% of cases), general weakness (45% of cases), and abdominal pain (45% of cases).

Of all global cases, with available data, a total of 141 cases had both date of symptom onset and date of hospitalization available. Among these, the median number of days between date of symptom onset and date of hospitalization was 4 days [interquartile range (IQR) 7].

Public health response
----------------------
Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, histopathological, and toxicological investigations of the possible etiology (or etiologies) of the cases are underway by several national authorities, by research networks, across different working groups in WHO, and with partners. This includes detailed epidemiological investigations to identify common exposures, risk factors, or links between cases. Additional investigations are also planned to ascertain where the number of detected cases are above expected baseline levels.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The risk at the global level is currently assessed as moderate considering the following factors:

- The etiology of this severe acute hepatitis remains unknown and is being investigated;
- Limited epidemiological, laboratory, histopathological, and clinical information are currently available to WHO;
- The actual number of cases and the geographical distribution may be underestimated, in part due to the limited enhanced surveillance schemes in place;
- The possible mode of transmission of the etiologic agent(s) has not been determined.

Although there are no available reports of healthcare-associated infections, human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out as there have been a few reports of epidemiologically linked cases.

WHO advice
-----------
Laboratory testing
- WHO has developed interim guidance for Member States on testing considerations and strategies for suspect cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown aetiology in children. The guidance includes advice to support Member States with diagnostic prioritization and can be modified for regional considerations of endemic diseases. The guidance also considers assessments for other aetiological factors that are known to cause severe acute hepatitis in children, including other infectious agents, environmental exposures (toxins, medications), metabolic hereditary conditions, or autoimmune disorders, which should be considered in consultation with a paediatric hepatologist.

- Prioritization should be given to routine collection of various specimens from as early after symptom onset as possible, to allow for later testing as required and to identify aetiology(ies). If laboratory capacity is limited, storage and referral to regional or global laboratories should be considered for the suggested investigative diagnostics. Any positive specimens should also be stored for further testing and/or investigation.

To further support Member States with laboratory testing, WHO is establishing a network of regional and global referral laboratories.

Case reporting
--------------
WHO strongly encourages Member States to report cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children matching WHO's case definition, through established IHR mechanisms. For more information, please see the suggested minimum variables for reporting cases of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children.

Reporting clinical data through the WHO Global Clinical Platform
----------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has developed a clinical case report form (CRF) to facilitate reporting of anonymized case-based data. The analysis of standardized global clinical data will contribute to understanding the aetiology as well as the clinical characterization of disease and its natural history and severity, aiming to guide the public health response and the development of clinical management guidance including approaches to investigations and infection prevention and control interventions. WHO strongly encourages Member States' participation in the WHO Global Clinical Platform for all cases meeting the WHO case definition, even if the CRF cannot be fully completed. Patient clinical data may be collected prospectively or retrospectively through examination and review of medical records.

The clinical CRF can be accessed through the WHO Global Clinical Platform for severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology.

Survey to estimate baseline incidence
-------------------------------------
Baseline data on the incidence of severe acute hepatitis of unknown etiology from countries outside of the European Region remain scarce. Although voluntary, WHO encourages Member States to participate in the global survey by making aggregated data from different hospitals/centers across all regions, covering the last 5 years. This survey will help estimate baseline incidence, and importantly where cases are occurring at higher-than-expected rates.

Infection prevention and control
----------------------------
Until more is known about the etiology of these cases, WHO advises implementation of general infection prevention and control practices including:

- Performing frequent hand hygiene, using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand-gel
- Avoiding crowded spaces and maintaining a distance from others
- Ensuring good ventilation when indoors
- Wearing a well-fitted mask covering the mouth and nose when appropriate
- Covering coughs and sneezes
- Using safe water for drinking
- Following the Five Keys to Safer Food: (1) keep clean; (2) separate raw and cooked; (3) cook thoroughly; (4) keep food at safe temperatures; and (5) use safe water and raw materials
- Regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces
- Staying home when unwell and seeking medical attention

Health facilities should adhere to standard precautions and implement contact and droplet precautions for suspected or probable cases.

In the months since UK physicians sounded the alarm about mysterious cases of hepatitis that seemed to be striking young children, researchers have been scrambling to determine the cause, and a possible connection to the coronavirus pandemic has been among the leading hypotheses.

But on 17 Jun [2022], researchers at the US CDC published data suggesting that -- in the USA, at least -- rates of hepatitis, or liver inflammation, with an unknown cause had not changed since 2017 among children aged 11 or younger (1) [for references, see original URL - Mod.LL]. If true, the finding could confound the pandemic-link theory.

Not everyone is convinced by the data, however, and it is unclear whether the same finding will emerge from other countries. "I can tell you, having worked in this country for 30 years as a liver doctor, we've had a huge number of cases in 2022," says Deirdre Kelly, a pediatric hepatologist at the University of Birmingham, UK. "And I think the UK's case ascertainment is extremely good."

Despite the US results, the CDC continues to explore possible connections to the pandemic. An analysis published on 24 Jun [2022] showed that 26% of 123 children with unexplained hepatitis in the USA had a history of a positive COVID-19 test prior to their liver illness (2). The CDC is now working to collect the samples it needs to test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 to find out if other children with hepatitis had previous infections that went undetected, says David Sugerman, a medical officer in the Division of Viral Diseases at the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "We're very much looking at SARS-CoV-2 still," he says.

Known and unknown causes
--------------------
Hepatitis in children has a number of known causes, including infection by viruses such as hepatitis A, and exposure to certain medications, such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). But every year, a few cases of unexplained pediatric hepatitis occur.

In early April [2022], the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) notified the public of an apparent uptick in the number of young children with serious liver inflammation. At the time, the agency reported 60 possible cases in children under the age of 10 in 2022. Physicians typically see about 20 such cases a year in the UK, says Kelly.

Since the start of this year [2022], more than 250 UK children have had hepatitis, and, by 26 May [2022], a total of about 650 cases in 33 countries had been reported to the WHO [for newer numbers, see above - Mod.LL]. Twelve of the British children required a liver transplant; none have died. In the USA, 11 of 296 children believed to have the condition have died.

Adenovirus infections
--------------------
In the UK and the USA, many of the children with mysterious liver inflammation were also infected with a member of a family of common viruses known as adenoviruses. This has led to speculation that the hepatitis is caused by an adenovirus. But although this is the UKHSA's leading hypothesis, it is not a broadly popular one. Researchers have pointed out the lack of statistical controls: adenovirus infections often peak in the winter and spring, and it's unknown what the infection rate was among children who did not develop hepatitis.

There is also a lack of precedents: adenoviruses are not known to cause hepatitis in children with healthy immune systems. And the levels of virus found in most of the children with liver inflammation are low. "I don't think it's adenovirus," says pediatric hepatologist Orit Waisbourd-Zinman at Schneider Children's Medical Center in Petah Tikva, Israel.

On 10 Jun [2022], Waisbourd-Zinman published a case series of 5 children with unexplained hepatitis (3). Only one of them, she says, tested positive for adenovirus. Microbiologist Sumit Rawat at Bundelkhand Medical College in Sagar, India, tested samples from 17 children with unexplained hepatitis and found adenovirus in only 3 of them. But Waisbourd-Zinman and Rawat both say that all the children they saw either had tested positive previously for SARS-CoV-2 or had family members who had. The UKHSA has also consistently listed CoVID-19 as a possible explanation. However, only 15% of the UK children with hepatitis were actively infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the time of their diagnosis, and the agency has not released data on how many had antibodies against the virus, which would have suggested previous infection.

COVID connection
----------------
Although none of the hypotheses is a clear winner yet, the timing of the apparent outbreak of hepatitis strongly suggests some connection with the pandemic, says virologist William Irving at the University of Nottingham, UK. The increase in cases could be a consequence of direct damage from past SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduced exposure to viruses during the lockdown, or aberrant immune responses triggered by the coronavirus. "This is all handwaving," he says. "But I feel like the COVID pandemic has to be critical."

One thing that is clear is that the condition is not linked to COVID-19 vaccination: only a handful of the children in the UK who developed hepatitis had been vaccinated.

The CDC study, covering 2017-22, questions any explanations that involve the pandemic. The team picked through data from health-care records, organ-transplant records, and laboratory testing of stool samples for adenovirus. In the end, the researchers found no recent increase in the number of pediatric hepatitis cases, transplants, or adenovirus-positive stool samples (1).

Hidden diagnoses
----------------
But Waisbourd-Zinman says that a simple analysis of electronic health records might not reveal the true rates of unexplained hepatitis in children. She attempted a similar study in Israel, she says, but quickly found she had to manually dig through health records to find buried diagnoses. For example, one case of hepatitis turned out to be the result of medication used during a kidney transplant; another was an infection with a known hepatitis-causing virus. These causes were not coded as such in the health records, and a cursory examination would have lumped them together with unexplained cases of liver inflammation.

That noise makes it hard to pick out the truly unexplained cases, she says. "It's just impossible to see an increase," she says. "It's so heterogeneous."

In April [2022], researchers also determined that rates of unexplained hepatitis in children in mainland Europe were not above the baseline for that region (4). But Kelly, who consulted on that analysis, notes that it was also limited: as in the USA, Europe's health-care data are fragmented, she says, and the European survey included only specialist hospitals.

Some countries, including Israel and the UK, have now asked physicians to report cases of pediatric hepatitis that are not explained by known causes to public-health authorities, to aid in tracking the condition. This, plus the variety of research studies that have been launched to track down the cause of the condition, could shed light on the handful of mysterious pediatric liver inflammation cases that appeared each year -- whether or not they are linked to COVID-19 -- says Kelly.

"I think there might be something special about those children that makes them susceptible," she says. "Maybe one of the positive aspects of this is that we might find out what that is."

[The etiology or etiologies of this severe liver inflammation remain unclear, although adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2 remain in the equation, separately or together. While aminotransferases of > 500 is part of the case definition, the height of these assays does not necessarily correlate with severity, as such patients can be without jaundice and may be totally asymptomatic. There remains little information about asymptomatic hepatitis in sibling or adult contacts and evidence for past SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. The lack of clusters of cases is not easily explainable, but genetic differences in individuals may be playing a role.

An example of this related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is illustrated by the following report:

Zhang Q, Bastard P, Liu Z, et al. Inborn errors of type I IFN immunity in patients with life-threatening COVID-19. Science. 2020; 370(6515): eabd4570; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd4570.

Abstract
--------
"Clinical outcome upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) ranges from silent infection to lethal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We have found enrichment in rare variants predicted to be loss-of-function (LOF) at the 13 human loci known to govern Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)- and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity to influenza virus in 659 patients with life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia relative to 534 subjects with asymptomatic or benign infection. By testing these and other rare variants at these 13 loci, we experimentally defined LOF variants underlying autosomal-recessive or autosomal-dominant deficiencies in 23 patients (3.5%) 17 to 77 years of age. We show that human fibroblasts with mutations affecting this circuit are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Inborn errors of TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I IFN immunity can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with no prior severe infection."

Dr. Casanova, the senior author on this paper, has published many articles showing that subtle genetic changes can be associated with more severe disease due to a variety of pathogens. - Mod.LL]
