[In regard to] the several ProMED-mail postings about group A
streptococci, scarlet fever, and the "striking similarity between the
reported incidence of varicella and scarlet fever," is anyone checking
to see how common it would be for the locals to be treating their
fevers with NSAIDs [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]?

[Varicella zoster virus is a herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 3) that
lies dormant in the dorsal root ganglion after primary infection in
childhood, with sporadic reactivation leading to localized herpes
zoster (shingles) in adults. Chickenpox can be treated with aciclovir
or related anti-herpes virus drugs, but it would not be usual to treat
children, or even adults, in this way. Oral aciclovir has been shown
to reduce fever by 1 day and symptoms by 15-30 percent. - Mod.CP]

[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, abbreviated as NSAIDs, are
drugs that are used to relieve pain and reduce fever. The term
"nonsteroidal" is used to distinguish these drugs from
anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, such as prednisone. NSAIDS include
aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, many of which are available over the
counter without a physician's prescription in many countries. However,
use of NSAIDs may exacerbate skin and soft tissue infections caused by
group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, and lead to necrotizing fasciitis
and toxic shock syndrome (1). For example, a case-control study in
children with varicella found that NSAID use before hospitalization
was significantly more common among children with group A
streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis and varicella than among control
children with varicella who had serious soft tissue infection, other
than necrotizing fasciitis (2). This adverse reaction may be due to
masking of the signs and symptoms of the group A streptococcal
infection, leading to a delay in diagnosis, or perhaps due to an
impairment of host defense mechanisms in NSAID-treated patients.

Reye's syndrome is a severe neurologic disorder that usually develops
in children and teenagers after certain viral infections, such as
chickenpox and influenza. Studies have documented an association
between Reye's syndrome and the use of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid)
in children and teenagers with chickenpox or virus-like illnesses (3).
The incidence of Reye's syndrome has declined in recent years,
concomitant with a decline in salicylate use among children.

For these reasons, it is best that NSAIDs should not be used in
patients with chickenpox or group A streptococcal skin and soft tissue
infection. Preferably, acetaminophen should be used in place of NSAIDs
for control of fever or pain in these patients. The news releases have
so far not mentioned the frequency of NSAID use in patients involved
in the Hong Kong outbreak.
