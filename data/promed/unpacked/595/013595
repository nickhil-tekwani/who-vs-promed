Asian soybean rust [ASR] continues to show up in Alabama fields at
low severity. Since 9 Sep 2005, there have been 2 new rust findings
in the state.
"One was in a Clarke County sentinel plot near Jackson, about an hour
north of Mobile," said Ed Sikora, Alabama Extension plant pathologist
on 14 Sep 2005. "The plot was drying down and I found a few infected
leaves low in the plant. It wasn't anything major."
The 2nd discovery was in a small commercial field in Geneva County by
Slocumb. It too had ASR at low incidence/low severity.
It takes about 2 weeks after spore deposits for rust symptoms to show
up. Knowing that timeline, Sikora has been keen to check north
Alabama for any rust transported by Hurricane Katrina. On 13 Sep he
drove into the north and northeast part of the state and checked 3
sentinel plots and a handful of commercial fields but found no signs
of ASR. That doesn't mean Katrina didn't push rust spores north,
cautioned Sikora. "It's sketchy trying to find rust in a commercial
field in early stages. I've been pretty lucky in finding it early in
some fields. I thought I might find it up there, but no." Most of the
fields in north Alabama are "yellowing up" into R-7.
Many fields are being harvested. "It's also been hot and dry since
Katrina passed through, so conditions haven't been favorable for
rapid disease development." Is Sikora seeing any defoliation due to
soybean rust?
According to Sikora, the most interesting case was one of the 1st
commercial fields in Baldwin County. The grower has 50 or 60 acres he
treated with Stratego about 21 days apart. He put the first fungicide
on before knowing the disease was in his crop."
Sikora visited that field earlier this month. There was very little
defoliation. Across the road from the main field, the producer has a
one-acre soybean patch -- a different variety in the same maturity
group. Unable to spray the patch, he left it as a check and the patch
was hit hard by ASR. But right across the street, where he sprayed
twice, the crop was protected from ASR. Sikora said that "illustrates
the power of a fungicide."

The anecdotal accounts in this piece illustrate the ASR situation in
the States on the Gulf of Mexico. Depending upon local weather
conditions, ASR spores may land on unprotected soybeans or on those
recently sprayed with fungicides. Those growers who sprayed with
fungicide will likely have an advantage over those who have not yet
sprayed. I suggest that at this late time in the soybean production
cycle, the potential for disease is dwindling. ASR may be confined to
the southern US, but that doesn't mean soybean growers elsewhere in
the country should forget about the disease and how to manage it.
Some of the top experts in North America have assembled a 60-page
color booklet entitled "Using Foliar Fungicides to Manage Soybean
Rust." It contains contributions from plant pathologists from the
nation's leading land-grant universities, as well as experts from
Canada. The manual is available through state extension offices or it
can be downloaded chapter-by-chapter online at:
