New data provide the strongest evidence yet that an epidemic of rare
birth defects along the Texas-Mexico border was caused by
contaminated corn. And the findings may have implications for
populations where tortillas remain a dietary staple.
For more than a decade, scientists have been unable to explain why,
starting in 1990, an alarming number of border infants were born with
neural tube defects -- serious and even fatal abnormalities of the
brain and spinal cord that arise in the first weeks of pregnancy.
In Cameron County alone, 6 babies with missing or rudimentary brains
were born in 6 weeks. An investigation found a high rate of neural
tube defects among almost all border counties.
By early 1992, the epidemic had subsided as mysteriously as it
appeared. Many residents blamed polluted water or air, and even won a
sizeable legal settlement against many of the Mexican factories that
dot the border. Yet investigators were unable to link the disease to
any man-made chemical.
As other potential explanations for the outbreak fizzled, Texas
health officials began to suspect a naturally occurring danger:
fumonisin, a toxin from mold that can appear on corn crops. Just
before the appearance of neural tube defects along the border,
agricultural experts had noted high concentrations of fumonisin on
that year's corn harvest, and Texas horses were experiencing an
outbreak of a fatal brain disease caused by the toxin.
In the February issue of the journal Environmental Health
Perspectives, researchers describe results of the 1st study to
examine the relationship between tortilla consumption, fumonisin
exposure, and the risk of neural tube defects in people. While data
in laboratory experiments have pointed to a link, researchers up to
now have lacked human studies.
The study's major finding: Women who ate 300 to 400 tortillas per
month during their 1st trimester had more than twice the risk of
giving birth to a baby with a neural tube defect than women who ate
fewer than 100 tortillas (studies have suggested that young
Mexican-American women along the border eat an average of 110 a
month).
Blood samples taken from women also indicated that the higher the
level of fumonisin, the greater the risk of neural tube defects.
"I don't know that we can ever go back and definitely say that it was
fumonisin," said Lucina Suarez, director of epidemiology and disease
surveillance for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But
given this and other research, she said, "It certainly looks that
way."
Dr. Suarez and her colleagues studied Mexican-American women who gave
birth from 1995 to 2000. Diets and blood samples from women who had
babies with defects were compared with women who had normal births.
The researchers found that the correlation with tortilla consumption
disappeared when women ate more than 400 corn tortillas per month,
suggesting that above a certain level, a fumonisin-exposed fetus
might not survive. Laboratory studies have found that fumonisin
interferes with the absorption of folic acid, which protects against
neural tube defects.
But even with the new research, experts still cannot say with
certainty that the epidemic in South Texas was the work of fumonisin.
They may never be able to: The corn from that time is long gone.
"It absolutely is plausible," said David Miller of Carleton
University in Canada, who is one of the world's foremost authorities
on the toxin. "However," he added, "Let me tell you what we don't
have. We do not have direct human evidence." In other words, the
study can't rule out other explanations.
Nonetheless, more scientific inquiry is needed, Dr. Miller said,
because fumonisin can still creep into the corn supply when the crops
are stressed and because many people's diets heavily depend on
tortillas. "We need to know the answer to this question," he said.
Both the World Health Organization and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration set limits on the amount of fumonisin allowed in corn
products. Those limits were set before much of the recent research.
Dr. Miller said he believes that, even if fumonisin should prove to
increase the risk or birth defects, the allowable levels are still
safe.
Through a spokesman, officials from the FDA said they would not
discuss the Environmental Health Perspectives report.
"There seems to be some connection between tortilla consumption and
neural tube defects," said Ron Riley, a fumonisin expert from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. But he is still waiting for further
study before making up his mind about whether the tortillas
themselves were to blame. "It's supportive, but it's not convincing,"
he said. "With regard to fumonisin, the jury is out."

[This particular theory has been around for over a decade. The theory
has been examined by the US Federal Food and Drug Administration, and
even by the National Institutes of Health. Even with all the
controlled studies and dollars spent on experimental models, a
conclusive link to the birth defects has never been shown. Detailed
studies have demonstrated that these women have inadequate folic acid
intake and inadequate protein intake during gestation, which have
been demonstrated to cause neural tube deficit or spina bifida.
Horses seem to be sensitive to the effects of fumonisin, resulting in
the fatal neurological disease leukoencephalomalacia. However, this
same sensitivity to neurological problems cannot necessarily be
abstracted across species. - Mod.TG]
[The fungus Fusarium moniliforme (Fusarium verticillioides) is a
common pathogen of corn, so common in fact that it is found wherever
corn is grown. Fumonisin toxin is made by Fusarium moniliforme
fungi. Dry weather early in the season, followed by wet weather
during silking of the corn plant, and insect infestation increase the
amount of fungal infection of corn kernels. In several countries,
high levels of fumonisin in moldy corn have been suspected of causing
esophageal cancer in humans.
