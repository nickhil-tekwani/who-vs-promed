The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed dengue fever in a 26 year
old Sha Tin man, bringing the year's total cases to 19, all imported. The
man came down with fever on 14 Jul 2006 after a trip to Thailand. He was
admitted to Union Hospital on 17 Jul 2006 and was transferred to Prince of
Wales Hospital on July 19. He was discharged on 24 Jul 2006.
People should stay alert to the threat of dengue fever and take measures
against mosquito breeding. Travelers should wear long-sleeved tops and
trousers, and use insect repellent. If feeling unwell after returning from
abroad, consult a doctor.

[The 3 cases referred to above, along with the 19 imported cases not
reported, provide a vivid illustration of how dengue viruses move around in
areas where the _Aedes_ vectors are present. One cannot help but wonder how
many imported cases go undiagnosed and unreported in the world's tropics.
It would be interesting to know which dengue virus serotypes were involved
in these 3 cases. - Mod.TY]

<http://news.monstersandcritics.com/health/article_1193058.php/Five_Cambodians_die_hundreds_hospitalized_in_dengue_epidemic>

A hospital official said on Tuesday that 5 Cambodian children had died and
nearly a thousand more had been hospitalized as underequipped provincial
health centres and impoverished parents face a rare strain of the virus.
Chrang Narith, deputy chief of the Dengue Fever Unit at Kampong Cham
provincial hospital in the country's east, said outbreaks of the
mosquitoborne disease had reached epidemic proportions since January,
especially in 2 districts of the province, and health authorities feared
more deaths were to come.
"Poor parents wait until the last minute to bring children to the hospital
for treatment, and we just don't have the facilities to successfully treat
children when they have reached that point," Narith said, adding that
treatment costs a minimum of 12 [US] dollars.
He said 5 children had died since April [2006] and 800 had been
hospitalized at the province's major public hospital since January.
Children from Kampong Siem and Kong Meas districts have made up the bulk of
the patients, he said, blaming the outbreak on heavy monsoon rains that
have left plenty of the clean, still water that the mosquito that carries
the disease favours for breeding. Dengue experts have said an unusually
high infection rate with a normally less prevalent strain of the disease
had also contributed to the high number of hospitalizations because
Cambodian children who had not been exposed to the strain lack immunity to it.
Severe cases can become dengue hemorrhagic fever, which is especially
serious in young children and is characterized by spontaneous bleeding from
orifices as blood platelet levels plummet. The usual treatment includes
blood transfusions, but Narith said blood supplies were at a premium.
"The Health Ministry has distributed Abate to the affected areas, and
health experts have gone to the villages to inform people about how the
disease is spread and why children need expert treatment," he said. Abate
is a non-toxic chemical that prevents mosquitos from breeding in still
water, such as water pots and rice paddies.

[Abate is an insecticide that has low toxicity for vertebrate animals. Rice
paddies are not a significant breeding habitat for _Aedes aegypti_, which
breeds in containers containing water in and immediately around human
habitations. ProMED-mail requests information about the "rare strain" of
virus cited above, and how it compares to the dengue virus serotypes and
isolates from previous years and other areas in Cambodia.

Phuentsholing in Bhutan could be on the brink of another dengue fever
outbreak, warn health officials of the Phuentsholing hospital's malaria
unit. It was therefore extremely important that residents cooperated to
clean up and maintain hygienic surroundings. In a span of 17 days, starting
July 11 [2006], 8 dengue cases were reported to the hospital, increasing
the number of cases to 31.
A random sample collection done by the malaria unit officials 4 days ago
found out that the larvae of the dengue-[transmitting] _Aedes_ mosquitoes
were everywhere.
According to health officials the patients were mostly those who went for
morning and evening jogging and walks and spent time outdoors in the
evenings. The backyards of houses in lower market area were littered and
neglected. "There are empty tins, plastic, blocked drains where rain water
collects which make it conducive for mosquito breeding," said an official
during city cleanliness and hygienic living conditions awareness workshop
organised by the women's association, yesterday.
These were man-made breeding sites and since building owners were mostly in
Thimphu the surroundings were neglected, officials said. They pointed out,
during the meeting, that despite their instructions nothing was done by
some business entities.
Residents were made aware of the risk and notified through the local cable
network and selected pockets of the city sprayed with insecticide (thermal
fogging) 3 times during the period 22-24 Jul [2006].
Health officials say that residents should also take preventive measures
such as applying repellent oil or cream and by wearing full-sleeved shirts
and full pants to prevent mosquito bites and anyone suffering from fever,
backache and bleeding gums should immediately report to the hospital.

El Salvador was in a state of emergency on Wednesday due to an increase in
dengue infections reported in several departments, in contrast to the
optimism recently expressed by the government.
According to sources in the Health Ministry that issued the red alert, 471
cases and serotypes (a group of closely related microorganisms with similar
antigens) not reported in the country since 2002 have been confirmed.
Minister Guillermo Maza revealed that 3 out of every 4 infected patients
live in the departments of San Salvador, La Libertad and Sonsonate, and
announced that the [red alert is intended to reduce further spread].
Meanwhile, governmental reports show that the last time this disease forced
the Executive to decree a state of emergency was 4 years ago, and at that
time it only affected 4 departments. Despite authorities' efforts, the
official number of [adult deaths?] was 11, while so far 4 minors have died.

The Nicaraguan Health Ministry on Tuesday announced measures to prevent
type-3 dengue fever from entering the country as more than 5000 people are
suffering the disease in nearby El Salvador.
El Salvador borders Honduras, which shares a border with Nicaragua. Juan
Jose Amador, director of the ministry's hygiene and epidemiology
department, said that at present, Nicaragua has only 538 confirmed cases of
classic dengue fever and 22 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever: [dengue
viruses] type 1 and 2.
"We have reinforced preventative actions in the whole of north of the
country, such as fumigating vehicles and homes as well as sending samples
to specific laboratories," Amador said. The ministry said the [dengue virus
]type-3 disease had not appeared in Nicaragua in the last 7 years, and that
the health authorities feared there will be serious problems if type 3
dengue fever enters the country.
Because the type-3 disease has not been found throughout much of the
Americas for about 20 years, most people have a low immunity to the virus,
the authorities said. In 1994, Nicaragua found 19 000 cases of type-3
dengue fever,with several deaths reported.
Dengue fever is a serious health problem in many Central American and
Caribbean countries. Its symptoms include high fever, nausea, rash,
backache, and headache.

The Dominican Republic's secretary of state for public health, Bautista
Rojas Gomez, said on Wednesday [23 Aug 2006] that at least 17 people have
died of hemorrhagic dengue fever so far in 2006, according to reports from
Santo Domingo.
Rojas told Dominican Television that he is worried about the rising number
of hemorrhagic dengue fever cases, and many of the deaths could have been
avoided, but added that at least the mortality rate is reduced from 2005.
Rojas said that every 5 years, a massive outbreak of the mosquito-spread
fever claims many lives. This year, the epidemic has affected the National
District, Santo Domingo province, San Cristobal, San Francisco de Macoris
and Moca.
In 2005, the Dominican Republic reported 248 cases of dengue fever, 82 of
which were hemorrhagic dengue. This year, 130 cases of normal dengue fever,
and 69 cases of the hemorrhagic one have been recorded.

A dengue epidemic is affecting various neighborhoods in Havana, according
to what BBC Mundo was able to gather from different sources which confirmed
these facts, despite the Cuban press not having provided any information
regarding it.
"In the center where I work they said that more than 3000 cases have been
reported for the whole city, and they have said that the municipalities
that have been most affected by the foci [of dengue cases] are Cerro and
Playa," a young worker informed us.
A physician from the Ministry of Health, who wished to remain anonymous,
corroborated to the BBC that there exists an explosion of dengue cases and
that "these [cases] are occurring in the whole city of Havana."
"We have taken all the [necessary] measures; we have various hospitals --
the IPK, the "Salvador Allende" and "La Dependiente", among others, with
dengue units having a total of 800 beds ready to receive patients," the
specialist told us.
[Dengue virus] type 3
---------------------
The serotype involved is dengue [virus type] 3, and according to these
reports there have been few cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], the
version [of the dengue virus infection] most lethal. The virus is
transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, which is very common in the tropics.
The authorities have quickly mobilized an enormous contingent of people in
order to contain foci of _Aedes aegypti_. This contingent visits houses
one-by-one, orienting the population about preventive measures. Moreover,
thousands of workers from the Capital and from other provinces circulate
thoughout the city, having the residents leave their houses and fumigating
these residences house-by house. "We have been working full-time for weeks
in order to eradicate these foci, and in El Cerro we detected 146 [foci?]
already," one of the workers informed us.
Control measures
----------------
Normally, Cuba maintains a permanent control group dedicated to carrying
out preventive measures and fumigation to avoid a resurgence of dengue
foci. Nevertheless, due to various factors, every once in a while the
number of dengue cases shoots up and it is necessary to take additional
measures to avoid epidemics which can lead to the death of patients. In
fact, the first large epidemic of DHF was in 1981, when thousands of people
were infected and hundreds of Cubans lost their lives.

[This is an unofficial report, and the information is not from the Cuban
Ministry of Health. ProMED-mail requests information from the Cuban
Ministry of Health about specific numbers of cases over time and the dengue
virus serotypes that are involved. A progress report on the _Aedes aegypti_
control campaign would also be appreciated. A map of Cuba may be accessed
at <http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/cuba.pdf>.
WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death.
The clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop shock
syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older
children and adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the
classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe
headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C [104-105.8 F], possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena.
In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever
subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate
after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state
of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy.
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives
of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating
fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
