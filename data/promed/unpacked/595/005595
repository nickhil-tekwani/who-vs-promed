About 400 new leprosy cases have been recorded in Moba, northern
Katanga province, in DR Congo during a screening campaign begun last
May [2007] in the province.
According to health district supervisors and other community-based
agents, leprosy has been spreading in the area located near Lake
Tanganyika, south of Kalemie.
Specialists from Fondation Damien have been striving to study new
care strategies for lepers in the area.

Moba is a port that lies on the western shore of Lake Tanganyika in
the province of Katanga. Katanga, a region of extreme poverty, saw
violent conflict between militias and government forces until
mid-2006 (see <http://www.interaction.org/congo/index.html>).
Thousands of refugees have returned to Katanga since the 2nd half of 2006.
Leprosy is a chronic infection due to _Mycobacterium leprae_. It is
not highly contagious and has a long incubation period. In 2004,
Damien Foundation, an NGO (non-governmental organization) operating
in eastern and western DR Congo, reported 9798 new cases of leprosy
(see <http://www.watchlist.org/reports/pdf/dr_congo.report.20060426.pdf>).
The "new" cases of leprosy in the current and prior reports are
likely the result of enhanced case finding. Leprosy "outbreaks" are
very unusual. Leprosy among children would be an indication of
ongoing transmission in the community, but the ages of the "new"
cases in Moba are not reported.
The mechanism of transmission of leprosy is unknown. The only known
reservoir of leprosy is the human species; only those with the
lepromatous form of leprosy are thought to be contagious. The
proportion of the "new" cases in Moba with lepromatous leprosy is
also not reported, Household contact with a case of lepromatous
leprosy poses an increased risk for infection. Casual and short-term
contact do not seem to spread the disease.
Because lepromatous patients excrete enormous numbers of leprosy
bacilli in their nasal secretions as collected through nose blows,
the mode of spread is likely respiratory or nasal discharge. As the
organism is also present in skin, skin contact is thought to be
another mode of spread. Because the organisms persist on surfaces in
the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection.
Other sources such as soil, insect vectors, and armadillos are
speculative. In the absence of a significant insect vector or
non-human reservoir, antimicrobial therapy of the infectious human
reservoir is an effective strategy to control transmission. - Mod.ML]
