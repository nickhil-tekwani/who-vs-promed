The Ministry of Health reported on Monday [12 Mar 2007] that China
detected 9501 cases of measles and 2341 cases of German measles in
February [2007]. [There were] sharp rises of 68 and 134 percent
respectively [in the number of cases, compared to] the same period
last year [2006].
Measles infection cases have been rising fast since the beginning of
this year [2007] and some regions have witnessed an outbreak of the
disease, the Ministry said, without giving any reasons.

[The official report of the Chinese Ministry of Health referred to in
the above newswire can be found at: <http://www.moh.gov.cn/newshtml/18126.htm>
An edited version of the "Google" machine translation of the Ministry
of Health report follows.
"There were 9501 cases of measles reported nationally last month
(February 2007) representing an increase of 12.48 percent (8447
cases) from that reported during the prior month (January 2007) and
an increase of 68.43 percent (5641 cases) from that seen during the
same period last year (February 2006). Since the beginning of this
year (2007) there has been a nationwide rapid growth of a measles
epidemic gaining momentum from January to February, with the growth
higher than the number of reported cases in the same period 2 years
ago (2005). Measles outbreaks have been reported in some areas.
"There were 2341 cases of rubella reported throughout the country
during the month of February (2007) compared with 2101 cases reported
in January 2007, representing an increase of 11.42 percent. During
the same period last year (2006), 1001 cases of rubella were
reported, representing an increase of 133.87 percent in the number of
cases from the same period in 2005. There was a national rubella
epidemic during weeks 2-7 (7 Jan-17 Feb 2007), representing a
significant increase in reported cases from 2 years ago (2005)."
In an 11 Jan 2007 ProMED-mail posting on measles in Guangzhou (see
reference below) the following statement appeared in the newswire:
"However, since 1995, the incidence of measles has been rising across
the country. The year 2005 saw the highest incidence rate of 10 per
100 000 in a decade. Some provinces were still seeing a high
prevalence in 2006. The Chinese government has set a 5-year action
plan to eradicate measles."
Measles is a vaccine preventable disease. The measles initiative was
launched in 2001 with a goal of reducing measles deaths by 90 percent
(of the 2000 reported deaths) by the year 2010
(<http://www.measlesinitiative.org/index3.asp>). The Western Pacific
Regional Office (WPRO) of the World Health Organization (WHO) has
taken measles elimination as a goal for the region. In the most
recent measles bulletin (December 2006), programmatic goals are
presented
<http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/9C284BEA-0524-487F-9294-2858236904D3/0/MeasBulletinIssue11.pdf>.
As can be seen from the references below, adoption of Chinese
children has been associated with measles outbreaks in the United
States as well as in several European countries.
More information on the status of measles in China would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
