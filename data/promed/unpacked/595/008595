A teenager from Quetta has contracted the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and is being treated in the isolation ward of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC).

"Nineteen-year-old M.I. was brought to the JPMC with a bleeding nose and mouth on [Wed 23 May 2018]," the hospital's executive director, Dr. Seemin Jamali, told The News on [Thu 24 May 2018]. "His tests from a private laboratory have confirmed that he is infected with the CCHF virus. We are treating him in the isolation ward."

The CCHF is caused when a person comes into contact with the deadly virus that is found in ticks present on the bodies of cattle and some other animals. People dealing with such animals, including shepherds, butchers and dairy farmers, are at a higher risk of contracting the disease, which has a mortality rate of up to 40 per cent.

As many as 2 people, a resident of Lyari Town and a middle-aged woman from Mianwali, died in Karachi in April and May [2018] due to complications of the CCHF. JPMC doctors said the teenaged patient from Quetta is in a serious condition, as his platelets have dropped to an alarmingly low level, and despite undergoing treatment, he is in a critical state.

"The patient is a bus conductor by profession and has no history of dealing with cattle or other animals," said Dr Seemin. "We are trying our level best to save his life by providing him the best available treatment."

According to experts, patients of the CCHF need to be kept in isolation wards, and doctors and paramedical staff should adopt extreme precautionary measures to avoid contracting the disease themselves, as in several past cases the caregivers have fallen victim to the lethal virus. JPMC officials said they have provided the necessary protective gear and equipment to the staff that are treating the Quetta teenager, and made the assurance that the virus will be contained.

According to epidemiologists, Quetta is a hub of the Congo virus, as several people contract the viral disease due to movement of cattle from Afghanistan. They said that last year at least 5 patients, all of whom were from Quetta's Satellite Town, had died at the JPMC due to the CCHF.

Due to the lack of treatment and diagnostic facilities, the majority of the patients are brought to Karachi and are mostly referred to the JPMC, the Aga Khan University Hospital and the Liaquat National Hospital, where they are kept in isolation wards and provided with the necessary treatment.

[Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been reported from more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Middle East. The disease is considered endemic in Pakistan and neighboring countries like Iran and Afghanistan. At present, no surveillance system for CCHF exists in the country; mainly case based data is available regarding prevalence and fatality.

There is an essential requirement for policy development at national and regional levels, to control the cross border movement of people and animals, to initiate some level of vector and human surveillance and to improve the health and laboratory facilities for early detection and response. Furthermore, critical strategies should be developed to educate the population at risk in endemic areas as well as healthcare workers. - Mod.UBA
