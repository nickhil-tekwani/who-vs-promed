New CWD case discovered at captive deer release site
----------------------------------------------------
A 3.5-year-old captive raised white-tailed buck harvested in early January [2016] by a hunter from a release site on a ranch in Medina and Uvalde counties has been confirmed positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). The deer's origin has been identified as an onsite breeding facility and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are conducting an epidemiological investigation.

Tissue samples revealed the presence of CWD prions during testing at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) in College Station. The samples were submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which validated the suspect findings.

The disease was first recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado. CWD has also been documented in captive and/or free-ranging deer in 23 states and 2 Canadian provinces. In Texas, the disease was first discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer along a remote area of the Hueco Mountains near the Texas-New Mexico border, and last summer [2015] was detected in 2 captive white-tailed deer breeding facilities in Medina and Lavaca counties.

CWD among cervids is a progressive, fatal disease that commonly results in altered behavior as a result of microscopic changes made to the brain of affected animals. An animal may carry the disease for years without outward indication, but in the latter stages, signs may include listlessness, lowering of the head, weight loss, repetitive walking in set patterns, and a lack of responsiveness. To date there is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or non-cervids. However, as a precaution, the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend not to consume meat from infected animals.

More information on CWD can be found on TPWD's website at http://www.tpwd.texas.gov/CWD or at the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website at http://www.cwd-info.org.

[One has to wonder the source of this disease. Is it is spontaneous? Or is the corn being fed to these deer used to clean out the feed mills and therefore being contaminated? It apparently happened in 2001 in other parts of the country. In Texas, the only wild deer affected with CWD were those reported in 2012; all other CWD affected deer have been farmed or captive deer. - Mod.TG
