Bath [Maine] police say they had another rabid fox attack Sunday [3 Nov 2019]. Police say around 11:45 am, they received a report in the area of 305 Washington Street that a fox had bit a 52-year-old man.

The man had been in his yard doing yardwork when he was attacked. He suffered bites and scratches on his legs.

Officers say they located the fox and killed it. The fox was confirmed to be rabid at the DHHS Health and Environmental Testing Lab in Augusta [Maine]. According to the lab, Bath has had 13 positive test results for rabies this year [2019].

[In the USA, there exist several wildlife variants of _Lyssavirus_ that circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bats with rabies are found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Foxes are common carriers of rabies in New Mexico, Nevada and Alaska but not in Maine (see map here: https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html). The main host for rabies in Maine is raccoons.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores (i.e., dogs, cats, ferrets) in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior. - Mod.PMB
