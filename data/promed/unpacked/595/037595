[1] Response to commentary WHO reform

Date: 18 Feb 2016

In his defence of WHO and its response to Ebola [Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, update, vaccine 20160218.4030271], Dr Woodall has clearly identified limitations imposed on WHO by its member states for effective global response to a major health event. As he points out, member states set the program agenda while denying any growth in the budget. In WHO's PROPOSED PROGRAMME BUDGET 2014--2015, the director-general (Dr Chan) states, "The currently proposed budget is USD 3977 million, which aligns with (member states') requests for a realistic budget based on income and expenditure over the past 3 bienniums. In the proposed budget, assessed contributions remain at their 2012--2013 level, representing zero nominal growth, and accounting for 23 per cent of the programme budget. The remaining 77 per cent will need to be financed through voluntary contributions." (1) Since "voluntary contributions" are usually earmarked for specific programs, less than a quarter of WHO funds are discretionary.

While there is GOARN and its successes, and a state-of-the-art Emergency Operations Centre at HQ, 1 missing ingredient for effective response from the member states right on up through the WHO country, regional and HQ offices is an integrated management system [IMS] for major health events such as Ebola and now possibly Zika. I am aware of 2 WHO Regional Offices (PAHO and WPRO) that have begun to utilize the IMS.

The emergency response to major health events often involves multiple players, often operating under their own authority, even outside the control of the affected state's institutions. In the absence of IMS, the response becomes disjointed and uncoordinated. An effective IMS provides a way to coordinate the disparate components of the response.

I just noted that the EU has launched a "European Medical Corps" to respond to ID outbreaks. (2) If the "Corps" is parachuted into an event without some overlying management structure -- for example, IMS, its effectiveness will be compromised in many ways.

The installation of IMS capacity in the organization and its member states is a huge undertaking because the IMS requires trained personnel, endorsement and acceptance. And significant funding, which Dr Woodall points out is in short supply. I hope WHO and its member states take the challenge seriously.

19 Feb 2016: UN links climate change to Zika, Ebola
http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/270069-un-links-climate-change-to-zika-ebola
[According to UNEP (United Nations Environmental Programme) executive director Achim Steiner, on Thursday [18 Feb 2016], "The spread of Zika, just as with Ebola, has sent a strong signal to the international community that there is a need for increased attention to the linkages between environment and health."]

19 Feb 2016 USA: Obama Administration ends enhanced Ebola screenings
http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/19/obama-administration-ends-enhanced-ebola-screenings/
[Because the World Health Organization (WHO) has determined the region is now Ebola virus disease (EVD) free, the Obama administration is no longer doing enhanced Ebola screenings for travelers from West Africa. The last day of the enhanced measures was Thursday (18 Feb 2016). In the 16 months the enhanced measures were in place, the DHS (Department of Homeland Security) screened over 42 000 travelers from Ebola-affected countries, largely in 5 major airports (New York's JFK, Newark, Dulles, Atlanta, and Chicago). Over the 16 months the enhancements were in place there were 0 travelers who entered the USA, exhibiting EVD symptoms, who entered the USA undetected.
CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) said people departing Guinea will still be subject to inspection for the disease.]

Funding

19 Feb 2016 UK: NHS volunteers being denied GBP 4000 payment

[About 200 NHS workers and academics, who risked their lives in combating the deadly Ebola virus disease in West Africa, are being denied a more than 4GBP 4000 (USD 5744) bonus paid to colleagues working for Public Health England (PHE). The workers denied payment were from National Health Service and academia.]

Vaccines
----
16 Feb 2016 Merck's Ebola vaccine candidate being readied for Phase III trials in Sierra Leone
http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/russia-test-ebola-candidate-guinea-afp/2016-02-16

Russia to test Ebola candidate in Guinea: AFP

Ebola vaccine frontrunner Merck is planning to submit its candidate for regulatory approval in 2017, but that doesn't mean everyone else has thrown in the towel and gone home. Russian health minister Veronika Skvortsova announced that an Ebola vaccine developed in that country did well in Phase I and II trials, and will enter further testing in Guinea, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.

According to AFP, the vaccine, dubbed GamEvac-Combi, was developed at a government vaccine research institute and showed "encouraging" results in early trials. Further details about the vaccine were not disclosed [See ProMED Ebola update (15): WHO response comment, update, vaccine 20160218.4030271].

The WHO secretariat is "actively hoping" to study the data, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told AFP in an email. [That is a good sign. Still, it would be beneficial for the data to be publically available for review. - Mod.LK]

Meanwhile, competitors GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Gaithersburg, MD-based Novavax (NVAX) and Baltimore-based Profectus all have candidates in the clinic. J&J and GSK are testing their candidates -- both adenovirus-based -- with booster doses from Bavarian Nordic and Rockville, MD-based Emergent BioSolutions (EBS), respectively. Novavax is working on a recombinant nanoparticle jab, while Profectus' candidate is based on a vesicular stomatitis virus.

Adding another virus vector to the mix is a team of researchers from the NIH, University of California, Riverside, and Plymouth University, who are using a common herpesvirus -- cytomegalovirus -- to present Ebola proteins in a vaccine. The vaccine provided protection in a nonhuman primate study.

In theory, the team said in a statement, the herpesvirus-based vaccine can be made to produce Ebola proteins at different points in time following vaccination. This particular vaccine presented Ebola antigens at a later time, resulting in high antibody levels, but no detectable T-cell response toward Ebola, the statement said. The researchers hope to be able to bias the immune response in a vaccine toward antibodies or T cells, which can be exploited for Ebola well as for other infectious and noninfectious diseases.

And at the annual American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting, a pair of scientists discussed the groundbreaking "ring" trial, in which Merck's Ebola candidate posted 100 percent efficacy in interim results. The strategy involved identifying Ebola cases and the "ring" of susceptible people around those cases to stop the spread of the virus. Ira Longini of the University of Florida and Dr Ana Maria Henao Restrepo, a WHO medical officer, highlighted the "ring" structure as a way not only to respond to epidemics -- including Zika -- but also to carry out clinical trials for diseases where it would be unethical to give trial participants a placebo -- that is, when the risk of becoming infected and dying is high.

[According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 3 Phase-III trials of experimental vaccines against Ebola, which had been delayed, are now set to start in a few weeks. WHO also stated, at a 9 Jan 2016 press conference, efficacy trials of candidate Ebola vaccines will begin within a month. GlaxoSmithKline's ChAd3-ZEBOV, which uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector, and Merck's rVSV-Ebov, which uses an attenuated vesicular stomatitis virus, will be tested against a non-Ebola control in a 3-arm, randomized controlled trial in Liberia.]

[Conclusions: Among the patients with EVD who were cared for in the United States or Europe, close monitoring and aggressive supportive care that included intravenous fluid hydration, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, nutritional support, and critical care management for respiratory and renal failure were needed; 81.5 per cent of these patients who received this care survived.]

19 Feb 2016 Ebola antibodies from blood of recent survivor found effective in killing virus in mice
http://mainenewsonline.com/content/16027057-antibodies-found-ebola-survivor-could-fight-ebola-virus
[The Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa made headlines in 2014 for infecting and causing death in over 28 600 and 11 300 people respectively. Health officials struggled greatly to control the epidemic.

Recently, a number of antibodies from the blood of a survivor of recent Ebola outbreak were found effective in killing the deadly Ebola virus in mice by a team of researchers. The detailed findings of research were published in the journal Science. What now is seen as a ray of hope by researchers is that the antibodies could help device vaccine for curing patients with Ebola diseases.

"Our Science paper describes the 1st in-depth view into the human antibody response to Ebola virus," said team leader Laura Walker, senior scientist at Adimab LLC, and an alumna of the Scripps Research Institute's PhD program.

The scientists were able to do research with the help of biotech company Adimab. The Ebola survivor from whom blood samples were taken was referred as subject 45.

Before the recent discovery of antibiotics, the researchers thought that the virus was deadly and affects immune system. More than 300 antibiotics were found to target the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, a structure that the virus uses to latch on to host cells. According to researchers, 77 per cent of the antibodies had potential to neutralize the Ebola virus, while many of those showed protection against virus in mice.

The researchers will not only help in finding the cure against Ebola, but also for curing any other potential disease from Ebola virus mutates [sic; mutants?]. Similar techniques could be used to find treatments for diseases caused by Zika virus, which has been affecting many people in Brazil.]
