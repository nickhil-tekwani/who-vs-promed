A holiday sweet bread that caused dozens in Orange County [California] to become ill might have been deliberately laced with a synthetic drug that mimics the active ingredient in marijuana, the president of a Santa Ana-based lab said Tuesday, 13 Jan 2015. Neil Spingarn, a pharmacologist who heads up S&N Laboratories, tested a sample of the Three Kings Day bread and found it contaminated with "a substantial" amount of a synthetic cannabinoid, an artificial THC with intensified effects. THC is the main chemical ingredient in marijuana. "The levels in the cake are not small." Spingarn said. "What is most striking is that this was not inadvertent."

The Register obtained a sample of the bread from a Santa Ana woman who said it made her ill last week and hired S&N Labs, which is licensed by the US Drug Enforcement Administration [DEA], to test it. The Orange County Health Care Agency has said its own preliminary lab results found an unidentified synthetic drug in the bread, prompting the Santa Ana Police Department to launch a criminal investigation. Health investigators have not confirmed a specific drug and further lab results are expected within 2 weeks, authorities said.

Neither agency would comment on the findings by the outside lab.

The owners of the bakery that made the bread, Cholula's Bakery in Santa Ana, could not be reached for comment. They have been cooperating with investigators, police said. The bakery made the bread for the Three Kings Day celebration on 6 Jan 2015 and distributed it to 9 stores in Orange County and 1 in Long Beach.

More than 40 people who ate the bread became ill last week with symptoms that included heart palpitations, dizziness, numbness and hallucinations. One of the customers who purchased the bread and received treatment at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, shared a sample of the tainted bread with the Register. S&N Laboratories tested that sample and found the presence of a chemical that's commonly used to make synthetic pot, often called "spice," "incense" and "K2."

It's a chemical alternative to marijuana that often is diluted with water, sprayed onto herbs and smoked like marijuana. It is sold in head shops in small shiny packages for about USD 50 for about 2 grams, according to Vijay Rathi, a special agent with the DEA. Spice looks like marijuana, but its side effects are more severe and can include hallucinations, aggressive behavior and hypertension, police and health officials say. The potpourri of chemicals are not listed on the packaging. "It's a bigger high, and they market it as a legal high; that's why people are willing to pay more for it," Rathi said.

Spingarn identified the specific strain contaminating the bread as JWH-122, named after John W. Huffman, a chemist who designed synthetic cannabis to use for in vitro research on the interaction between drugs and brain receptors. This strain is illegal, but that's not true of all synthetic drugs. Underground chemists in China and India are making new strains quicker than the DEA and US FDA [Food and Drug Administration] can ban them.

"The people who are making this stuff, they're chemists and they're very familiar with the Controlled Substances Act. All they do is check the federal register to see what's illegal," Rathi said. "It's completely frustrating."

Spice sent 11 000 people to emergency rooms in the USA in 2010. That number soared to 28 500 in 2012. Most cases were teenagers, according to the DEA.

[The following is from Forbes written by Alice Walton regarding the synthetic cannabinoids (http://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/08/28/6-reasons-synthetic-marijuana-spice-k2-is-so-toxic-to-the-brain/):

One of the original chemists who designed synthetic cannabis for research purposes, John W. Huffman, PhD once said that he couldn't imagine why anyone would try it recreationally. Because of its deadly toxicity, he likened it to playing Russian roulette, and said that those who tried it must be "idiots." Whether that's the case or not, the numbers of users is certainly rising, and so are overdoses. New Hampshire has declared a state of emergency, and the number of emergency room visits for overdose from the synthetic drug has jumped. One teen died earlier this month after slipping into a coma, reportedly from using the drug.

Synthetic pot also goes by hundreds of names: Spice, K-2, fake weed, Yucatan Fire, Bliss, Blaze, Skunk, Moon Rocks, and JWH-018, -073 (and other numerical suffixes), after Huffman's initials. Synthetic cannabis, unlike pot, however, can cause a huge variety of symptoms, which can be severe: Agitation, vomiting, hallucination, paranoia, tremor, seizure, tachycardia, hypokalemia, chest pain, cardiac problems, stroke, kidney damage, acute psychosis, brain damage, and death.

Why are the effects of synthetic cannabis so varied and so toxic? Researchers are starting to understand more about the drugs, and finding that synthetic cannabis is not even close to being the same drug as pot. Its name, which is utterly misleading, is where the similarity ends. Here's what we know about what synthetic cannabis is doing to the brain, and why it can be deadly.

1. It's much more efficient at binding and acting in the brain

One reason that synthetic cannabis can trigger everything from seizures to psychosis is how it acts in the brain. Like the active ingredient in pot, THC, synthetic cannabis binds the CB1 receptor. But when it binds, it acts as a full agonist, rather than a partial agonist, meaning that it can activate a CB1 receptor on a brain cell with maximum efficacy, rather than only partially, as with THC. "The 1st rule of toxicology is, the dose makes the poison," says Jeff Lapoint, MD, an emergency room doctor and medical toxicologist. "I drink a cup of water, and I'm fine. I drink gallons of it in some college contest, and I could have a seizure and die. Synthetic cannabinoids are tailor-made to hit cannabinoid receptors -- and hit it hard. This is NOT marijuana. Its action in the brain may be similar but the physical effect is so different."

Another issue with synthetic is its potency, which huge. "Its potency can be up to one hundred or more times greater than THC -- that's how much drug it takes to produce an effect," says Paul Prather, PhD, professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. "So it takes much less of them to produce maximal effects in the brain. So these things have higher efficacy and potency.... These things are clearly very different from THC and thus not surprising that their use may result in development of life-threatening adverse effects."

2. CB1 receptors are EVERYWHERE in the brain

A central reason that synthetic cannabis can produce such an enormous variety of side effects is likely because CB1 receptors are present in just about every brain region there is. When you have a strong-binding and long-lasting compound going to lots of different areas of the brain, you're going to get some very bad effects.

Yasmin Hurd, PhD, Professor of Psychiatry, Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics, and Neuroscience at Mount Sinai Medical Center, says that the wide distribution of CB1 receptors in the brain is exactly why they're so toxic. "Where they're located is important -- their presence in the hippocampus would be behind their memory effects; their presence in seizure initiation areas in the temporal cortex is why they lead to seizures. And in the prefrontal cortex, this is probably why you see stronger psychosis with synthetic cannabinoids." The cardiac, respiratory, and gastrointestinal effects probably come from the CB1 receptors in the brain stem. It might be any one of these that produces the greatest risk of death.

3. A synthetic cannabis overdose looks totally different from a pot "overdose"

The clearest proof that synthetic cannabis is a different thing all together is that overdose with the drug looks totally different from an "overdose" with natural marijuana. "Clinically, they just don't look like people who smoke marijuana," says Lewis Nelson, MD, at NYU's Department of Emergency Medicine, Division of Medical Toxicology. "Pot users are usually interactive, mellow, funny. Everyone once in a while we see a bad trip with natural marijuana. But it goes away quickly. With people using synthetic, they look like people who are using amphetamines: they're angry, sweaty, agitated."

Whatever's happening, he says, it may be more than just the replacement of THC with JWH. "It's almost hard to imagine that it could be related to the partial vs. full agonist aspect of the drug."

4. The body doesn't know how to deactivate synthetic

One possibility is that the metabolites of synthetic cannabis are also doing damage to the brain. Usually our bodies deactivate a drug as it metabolizes it, but this may not be the case with synthetic. "What we're finding from our research," says Prather, "is that some of the metabolites of synthetic cannabis bind to the receptor just as well as the drug itself -- this isn't the case with THC. The synthetic metabolites seem to retain full activity relative to the parent compound. So the ability of our bodies to deactivate them may be decreased."

He also points out that what's lacking in synthetic cannabis is cannabidiol, which is present in natural marijuana and appears to blunt some of the adverse actions of the THC. But if it's not there in synthetic cannabis, then this is one more way the drug's toxicity may act unchecked.

5. Quality control is nonexistent

Synthetic cannabis is made in underground labs, often in China, and probably elsewhere. The only consistent thing is that there's no quality control in the formulation process. "Is Crazy Monkey today the same as Crazy Monkey tomorrow?" Prather asks. "No way. The makers take some random herb, and spray it with cannabinoid. They're probably using some cheap sprayer to spray it by hand. How MUCH synthetic cannabis is in there? You have no idea how much you're getting." He adds that there are almost always "hot spots" present in the drug -- places where the drug is way more concentrated than others. "Plus, there's almost always more than one synthetic cannabinoid present in these things -- usually 4 or 5 different ones." The bottom line: There's no telling what you're getting in a bag of Spice or K-2.

6. The drugs are always evolving

"Someone's just kind of riffing off JWH," says Lapoint. There are hundreds of different forms of JWH, and of other synthetic cannabinoids designed by different labs, and the next one is always waiting to go. "It only takes a grad school chemist level to pull it off," he says. "The 1st JWH in incense blends was found in Germany around 2008 -- it was the JWH-018 in Spice. It took months for the local authorities to figure out what was in it and regulate it. The next week incense blends with another compound, JWH-073, came out. They already had it ready to go -- and they're making something that's not even illegal yet. Since we started the conversation 10 minutes ago, we're already behind."
