FAO to provide vaccines to fight FMD
------------------------------------
Zimbabwe will receive a consignment of 340 000 [doses of] vaccine
from the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as part of efforts
to control the spread of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which has
dealt a severe blow to the country's livestock industry.
Recently the government's veterinary department pleaded for help to
buy vaccines, as the country did not have enough foreign currency to
do so.
However, while the Netherlands-sponsored delivery will provide some
relief from the crisis, the FAO has warned that it will only cover 10
percent of the up to 3.4 million doses needed to vaccinate all the
animals at risk of contracting the disease.
"The priority now is for vaccines and for logistical support like
vehicles to move the vaccines around the country, and people need to
be sensitised to the need to control the disease," Mario Samaja, FAO
emergency operations director for Zimbabwe told IRIN. Besides
vaccine, support was also needed in other areas, he said.
"There is contact between domestic livestock and wild animals, which
acts as a reservoir for the disease, and there are logistical
difficulties in controlling the spread of the disease tied into the
general problems the country is facing, like a lack of petrol,"
Samaja noted.
Stuart Hargreaves, director of Zimbabwe's veterinary services, said
his department would prioritise by administering the vaccines to
dairy herds in Chipinge in the east of the country and protecting
communal areas where there have been infections.
"It's just a stopgap but it's better than nothing," he said.
Commenting on an allegation by Botswana MP James Maruatona that
Zimbabwe "had done nothing" to control the spread of the highly
contagious disease and its spillover into Botswana, Hargreaves said:
"People must be very cautious before accusations are made."
He said laboratory analysis had shown that a previous outbreak that
had been blamed on Zimbabwe had been a different strain than that
detected in Botswana.
Zimbabwe suspended beef exports to the European Union and the United
States in 2001 but still exports to some southern African countries
and Libya.
Drought, smuggling, and the sale of cattle by commercial farmers who
lost their land under the government's land redistribution programme
has resulted in a marked reduction in the national herd.
