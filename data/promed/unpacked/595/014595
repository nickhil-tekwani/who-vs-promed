Equidae / 43 / 3 / 0 / 3 / 0
Affected population: Domestic horses in equine farm in Wafra

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Glanders has been eradicated in [Kuwait], with active and targeted surveillance in equines, and it regained free status by self-declaration on March 2012. Since then, in order to maintain free status, active serological surveillance is being continued, and to date, all horses are being serologically tested at regular intervals in the National Veterinary Laboratory. After resuming exports, horses selected for export were routinely tested in blood samples for glanders in the National Veterinary Laboratory and in the OIE Reference Laboratory, Dubai, UAE for glanders and other equine diseases. As pre-export sanitary requirements, 5 horses were quarantined, and blood samples were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory Dubai, UAE for equine diseases with negative results. Among 5 horses, 2 were found to be positive for glanders by complement fixation test (CFT). The affected equine farm was immediately brought under veterinary authority control, with quarantine and movement restrictions enforced within and outside farm. Horse exportation to the trading partner countries was suspended. Blood samples were collected for all 43 horses kept in the equine farm, and 2 blood samples have been sent for reconfirmation (as requested by the said reference laboratory) to the OIE Reference Laboratory, Dubai, UAE, and the remaining 41 blood samples were tested in the national veterinary laboratory. One horse was found to be positive for glanders in the national veterinary laboratory and 2 horses positive in the said OIE Reference Laboratory.

These 3 horses were apparently normal and did not exhibit clinical signs of glanders. The affected 3 horses were killed for post mortem examination after relevant specimens were collected for bacteriological examination for _Burkholderia mallei_. The carcasses were deeply buried with disinfection procedures, and the affected holding was cleaned and disinfected with an appropriate disinfectant.

Among the affected horses, one was imported from abroad in 2015 and other 2 were born and reared on the farm. Follow up investigation was carried out on all contacts (40 horses) in the affected holding and were not exhibiting clinical signs of glanders. Blood samples were retested with negative results by CFT in the National Veterinary Laboratory. Further testing will be done at 2 week intervals 3 times.

In order to control and eradicate glanders in [Kuwait] and regain free status for glanders, animal health surveillance is being carried out according to the OIE terrestrial code chapter 1.4 and Chapter 12.10, article 12.10.8-12.10.9. Any new cases or new outbreaks will be submitted in the follow up reports.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, selective killing and disposal, zoning, disinfection, ante and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary and Research Laboratory (National laboratory) / Domestic horses / complement fixation test / 14 Jul 2019 / Positive
Central Veterinary and Research Laboratory, Dubai UAE (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Domestic horses / complement fixation test / 28 Jul 2019 / Positive

Future Reporting: the event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy.'

Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected or contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95 [percent] within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. A chronic form with abscess formation can occur.

Glanders has been eradicated from many countries by statutory testing, culling of infected animals, and import restrictions. It persists in numerous Asian, African and South American countries and can be considered a reemerging disease. Glanders can be introduced into glanders-free areas by movement of equids."
