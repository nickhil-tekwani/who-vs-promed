The Veterinary Epidemiological Observatory update of 27 Aug 2021, reports 177 active bluetongue [BT] outbreaks in Sardinia, with 48 542 animals involved, 202 already dead, and another 21 suspected outbreaks.

Following the reappearance of the infectious disease affecting ruminants and given its rapid spread in the areas still affected, the CIA (Italian Farmers Confederation) requests the urgent convocation of a meeting between the regional departments of Health and Agriculture and professional trade organizations to obtain a precise picture of the situation and of the actions undertaken to block the spread of the epidemic.

"We would not wish to go back to the years 2012 and 2013," warns the regional president of the CIA, Ignazio Cirronis, "when over 100 000 dead animals and a sharp reduction in milk production were reported."

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

The spreading rate of the epizootic in Sardinia, caused by BT virus serotype 4, is reflected in the increased number of officially reported outbreaks: 16 Aug -- 26 outbreaks; 25 Aug -- 104, 27 Aug -- 177 (see 20210826.8623860).

In case vaccination is not completed urgently, the BTV-4 strain is expected to continue its spread in Sardinia throughout the remaining summer and early fall months, during which the vectors are (seasonally) active. The Sarda local breed of dairy sheep, which counted 2 317 000 lactating ewes as of 31 Dec 2019 (more than 30% of the sheep in the whole of Italy), is known to be highly susceptible to bluetongue.

The Sardinian Pecorino cheese (Pecorino Sardo), a sheep cheese with a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law and a significant source of Sardinia's income, is produced mainly on the east side of the island.

Bluetongue, a vector-borne _Orbivirus_ disease, is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
