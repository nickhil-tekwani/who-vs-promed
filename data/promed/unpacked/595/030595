19 fall sick in Pabna: anthrax suspected
----------------------------------------
At least 19 people might have been infected with anthrax in Pathail
Hat village of the district's Santhia upazila, health officials suspect.

District and upazila [sub district] health officials and an ICDDR,B
[International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh]
medical team visited the spot in the last 2 days. They collected
samples for testing.

The villagers experienced symptoms of the disease after eating meat
of a cow last week [week of 16 Aug 2010], Monsurur Rahman, Santhia
upazila health and family planning officer, told the Daily Star.

During the visit, the experts sprayed anti-germ over the spot where
the cow was processed.

"We collected the names of the people who came in contact with the
cow and kept an eye on them," added Monsurur Rahman.
