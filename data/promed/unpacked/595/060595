A yet to be identified type of fever is spreading across the
peninsula resulting in more than 700 patients being admitted at
Jaffna teaching hospital sources close to the office of Director of
Public Health services, Jaffna, said Sunday [18 Nov 2007]. Hospital
staff are working round the clock to find hospital beds under limited
space and resources to accommodate the growing number of admitted
patients, hospital administration officials said. With the onset of
monsoon rains, the viral fever is spreading at an alarming rate
affecting a large number of civilians, heath officials said.

The Director of Public Health services, Jaffna, confirming the
non-availability of the vaccine required to curb the spread of the
disease, stated that the head office of the Ministry of Health has
been informed of the situation and an appeal made to rush the basic
preventive medicines without delay.

The patients initially admitted to rural hospitals in places such as
Manthigai, Valveddiththu'rai, Kayts and Chaavakachcheari have been
directed to Jaffna Hospital because of the absence of facilities for
testing of blood in these rural hospitals, sources added.

Chikungunya in Sri Lanka. It looks like another outbreak this year
again. - Anonymous contributor.]

[ProMED requests additional information about the etiological agent
responsible for this outbreak of febrile disease. Chikungunya virus
infection is one possibility, as are dengue viruses and other pathogens.
