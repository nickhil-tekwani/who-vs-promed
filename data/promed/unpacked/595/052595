Anthrax found in 2 Serbian villages
-----------------------------------
Serbian authorities have declared 2 northern villages an
anthrax-infected zone after the bacteria [sic] was found in animals
there. The Agriculture ministry says it has launched vaccination of
cattle in the villages of Bocar and Novo Milosevo. The ministry says
it has banned the use of milk and meat from the animals in those
villages.

The statement on Thursday [16 Jun 2011] says that "the situation in
the field is stable with minimum possibility for the spread of the
disease." Anthrax bacteria spores lie dormant in the soil and can
become active under conditions such as heavy rainfall, flooding or
drought. Animals that aren't vaccinated often die quickly after being
exposed to the bacteria.

Anthrax in Serbia -- situation in infected zones under control
--------------------------------------------------------------
The situation in 2 villages in Vojvodina that have been declared
anthrax-infected zones is under control and there is minimum
possibility for the spread of the disease, Maja Andrijasevic of the
Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Directorate said Friday [17 Jun
2011].

"Citizens can feel absolutely positive that everything they eat and
drink is safe," Andrijasevic said in connection with the current
situation in the villages of Bocar and Novo Milosevo that have been
declared anthrax-infected zones. Andrijasevic said that from the
moment the disease had been diagnosed, the relevant veterinary
service, veterinary institute and the competent veterinary inspection
were out there in the field and implementing prescribed measures. The
implementation of control measures is still under way, she added.

The disease is usually related to veterinarians, as they are more
likely to get into contact with an infected animal, while the rest of
the population is safe and there is minimum possibility for the spread
of the disease, Andrijasevic said for the Radio and Television of
Serbia (RTS). [I wish this statement were true but unfortunately we
have stupid livestock owners. - Mod.MHJ]

As regards the current ban on eating milk and meat from the animals
in the 2 villages, she said that vaccination of the animals was
underway, during which time cattle must not be slaughtered for meat or
their milk used for human consumption. Andrijasevic said that the
vaccination would be carried out in the 2 villages over the following
20 years, enough to protect the population and animals there from
infection.

Commenting on the data that anthrax appeared in the region already in
mid-1970's, she said anthrax bacteria spores stayed dormant in the
soil for 30 to 60 years and could become active under conditions such
as heavy rainfall, flooding or drought. She recalled that cases of
anthrax infections had been registered in Tutin, southern Serbia, in
2007, and that the necessary actions were being taken there as well.

[Anthrax historically has been erratically reported in Serbia, and
the country only became independent recently. It has probably been
occurring in the background for some time. If it is as infrequent as
they claim it would be wiser to annually vaccinate herds in target
areas; i.e., for these outbreaks and Tutin, for 5 years and then watch
carefully to see if it recurs.

Surveillance of unexpected deaths is a key part of anthrax control.
When outbreaks occur in areas which have truly not seen the disease in
decades it is usually the result of earth moving activities -- ditch
and spring clearing, putting in water lines to new cattle
water-troughs in old pastures, bulldozing scrub and roads, dredging
rivers and streams downstream of mills and tanneries.
