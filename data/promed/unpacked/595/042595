Case of flesh-eating bacteria _Vibrio_ reported near Gulf Shores
----------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Mobile County Health Department, a person reported contracting _Vibrio_ bacteria while in water near Gulf Shores. This is the first confirmed case in Mobile County in 2021.

_Vibrio [vulnificus_] sometimes called a flesh-eating bacterium, naturally lives in certain coastal waters but can appear in higher concentrations when water temperatures are warmer between May and October. It can enter the body through a break in the skin and from consuming contaminated seafood, according to MCHD.

Because of privacy rights under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), details about the case or the person have not been made available.

More than 70 species of _Vibrio_ exist, about a dozen that can cause human illness, the CDC reports. As of 7 Aug [2021], the Alabama Department of Public Health says 16 cases have been verified statewide this year. In 2020, there were 3 cases of vibriosis reported to MCHD.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," 1st ed, Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at https://bit.ly/3Cohttr:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish.... Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved organics."

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease [the organism can also enter through damaged skin - Mod.LL]. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions" [shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/].

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
