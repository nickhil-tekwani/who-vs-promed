All horses racing in Saskatchewan's Northwest Pony Chuckwagon and Chariot Association must be tested for the deadly equine infectious anemia [EIA] before they will be allowed to race.

Darren Dyck, the association's new president, said Coggins tests have been made mandatory for racehorses in an effort to halt spread of the disease.

"This is a deadly disease that needs controlling. We're trying to be a leader in it," said Dyck, who hopes other chuck wagon groups will make Coggins testing mandatory to help get rid of the disease.

Last year [2013], 89 horses tested positive for the disease in Saskatchewan and 27 in Alberta. 18 horses have already tested positive in Saskatchewan this year [2014] and 3 in Alberta. All horses testing positive must be euthanized or kept in permanent quarantine. "It's a real problem," Dyck said.

The Eastern Pony Chuckwagon and Chariot Association made Coggins testing mandatory in 2012, which helped reduce the number of cases.

Betty Althouse, Saskatchewan's chief veterinary officer, said mandatory testing helps catch the early cases before it spreads. The disease can infect up to 70 percent of the herd if left untreated. Althouse said it's not the 1st time horse groups have made Coggins testing mandatory, but the challenge is keeping the momentum and continuing with the testing.

"It happens for a year or 2 and it dies. It does require more of a sustained effort," she said. The number of cases last year [2013] was up from 82 in 2012 but down from 102 in 2011. There is no cure for EIA, and no vaccine is available.

Transmission occurs mainly through contaminated blood spread by horse flies, stable flies and deer flies. It can also be transferred through contaminated needles and the semen of an infected stallion.

Dyck said he lost 2 of his horses in the past 3 years to the disease and knows other racehorse owners who have lost up to 30 horses. Northwestern Saskatchewan and northeastern Alberta are hot spots for the disease as well as parts of northern of British Columbia and the Yukon. "People have got some really expensive horses that have gotten this disease," Dyck said.

The horses are called pony chuck wagon and chariot horses but can be up to 15 hands high and usually have thoroughbred bloodlines. "We all love our horses. No one wants to lose a good horse."

One of the biggest barriers to eradicating the disease seems to be the cost of Coggins tests, which can range from CND 24-150 [USD 22-136] per head depending on the vet clinic, he said. Dyck said it cost CND 800 [USD 725] to test his 25 horses for the disease last year [2013], which he believes is manageable.

EIA is a reportable disease, and positive horses must be reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

[According to CFIA, a Coggins test is an agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test, and this is run by the Canadian national retrovirology centre of expertise on samples that have previously screened positive on an EIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. An exception to this would be if a horse required proof of a negative AGID test result to meet a particular country's import requirements. Historically, the terms Coggins test and Coggins papers have been used to refer to all EIA testing, but this is not accurate.

From the EIA fact sheet:
http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/eia/fact-sheet/eng/1329554028418/1329554166646:

What is equine infectious anemia?
Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a potentially fatal viral disease affecting horses and other members of the equine family, such as donkeys and mules.

EIA-infected animals remain carriers of the virus for life and can be a source of infection for other animals.

Is EIA a risk to human health?
No. There is no human health risk associated with EIA.

What are the clinical signs of EIA?
The incubation period is generally 2-4 weeks but may range from one week to 3 months. Infected horses may show the following signs:

- anorexia;
- depression;
- general weakness;
- intermittent fever up to 41 C [105 F];
- jaundice;
- small hemorrhages under the tongue and eye;
- swelling of the extremities; and
- weight loss.

In some cases, a loss of coordination may be the only clinical sign. Foals infected prior to birth are often aborted or die within 2 months of birth. Many animals show temporary recovery from the severe stage of EIA and may even appear normal for 2-3 weeks before relapsing with similar, but less severe signs. Episodes of clinical illness are often associated with the use of steroid drugs or with periods of stress such as hard work, hot weather, racing or pregnancy.

Where is EIA found?
EIA has a worldwide distribution. The disease has existed in Canada since the 1800s and is considered to be a sporadic disease in the equine population. The occurrence of EIA in tested horses in Canada is extremely low.

How is EIA transmitted and spread?
Transmission of EIA occurs mainly through the transfer of contaminated blood from one animal to another. Insects such as horse flies, stable flies, and deer flies aid in the disease spread. Transmission may also occur when blood-contaminated objects (e.g., needles, syringes, or surgical instruments) are used on more than one animal. EIA can also be transmitted through the semen of an infected stallion. Foals can be infected before birth.

How is EIA diagnosed?
A tentative diagnosis can be made based on clinical signs, but blood tests are necessary for a definitive diagnosis.

How is EIA treated?
At this time, there is no cure for EIA, nor is there a vaccine that will prevent an animal from becoming infected. Supportive therapy may alleviate clinical signs in individual cases, but it is critical to remember that infected equines serve as a reservoir of infection for other equines.

The control of the disease is based on voluntary testing by owners, identification and destruction or life-long quarantine of infected animals, mandatory testing of imported equines, and efforts to prevent the spread of the virus by controlling insect and mechanical vectors.

What is done to protect Canadian livestock from EIA?
Equine owners can take the following precautions to reduce the risk of infection:

- use strict hygiene practices when vaccinating or collecting blood samples from equines;
- use disposable needles and syringes, and do not use the same needle on more than one equine;
- implement insect control measures;
- test equines as per equine industry standards (i.e., race tracks, shows, events, breeding stables, etc.) and whenever equines from different sources will intermingle;
- isolate all new equines until they have been tested for EIA;
- do not breed EIA-positive equines;
- abide by the national EIA control program; and
- consult your veterinarian if you suspect your equine may be infected with EIA.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) imposes strict regulations on the import of animals and animal products from countries where EIA is known to occur. These regulations are enforced through port-of-entry inspections done either by the Canada Border Services Agency or the CFIA. EIA is a "reportable disease" under the Health of Animals Act. This means that all suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA.

How would the CFIA respond to an outbreak of EIA in Canada?
The CFIA places movement restrictions on all premises on which EIA infected equines are found. The EIA-infected animals and EIA susceptible animals are quarantined, and all equines on the premises are tested for the disease. Equines confirmed to be infected with EIA are either ordered destroyed or placed under permanent quarantine where possible. Owners whose animals are ordered destroyed may be eligible for compensation.
