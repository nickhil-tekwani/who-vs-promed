After [Fri 23 Jun 2017] confirmation of a 3rd case of EIA [equine infectious anemia] there is now suspicion of an additional case.

A holding in Hamburg-Osdorf is affected, according to the Health and Consumer Protection Authority information upon request of 'Pferderevue' on [Mon 25 Jun 2017]. A horse stabled at the premise was tested by a private laboratory for equine infectious anemia. The official test result by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut is still pending.

As a precautionary measure, protective measures have already been taken, and blood samples have been obtained from the other horses of the holding. The results are expected at the end of the week.

Yet, it has not been established whether the cases from Hagen-Grinden, Düsseldorf-Kalkum, Bad Bentheim and now Hamburg-Osdorf are connected. The epidemiological investigations of the positive samples showed that the horse from the district of Verden had previously participated in an official polo tournament in Bad Bentheim. Further connections are under investigation.

[We are informed by the communicator that the new case in Hamburg, described above, has now been officially confirmed by the laboratory. Additional EIA cases have been detected in the meantime, in Bavaria; see further. - Mod.AS]

More cases of new infections with the deadly equine infectious anemia are reported. On [Tue 27 Jun 2017] 5 new cases of the disease became known. In addition to North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg and Lower Saxony; Bavaria is now also affected.

Since the occurrence of a disease in a stable in Hagen-Grinden in the district of Verden at the beginning of June [2017], the number of infected horses has increased every week. There are currently 9 horses infected.

As it became known on [Tue 27 Jun 2017], infection was revealed during the serological examination of horses at the equestrian and polo clubs in Dusseldorf. The 1st case of infection had been reported there on [18 Jun 2017]. Now 2 more horses are infected. They have to be killed, because EIA is regarded as incurable. Any attempt of treatment is prohibited.

For the remaining 50 horses of the Poloclub there might be hope. As club president Dirk Baumgärtner told RP online, the first results of their blood tests were all negative.

Further infections are in Bavaria. Recently, an outbreak of equine infectious anemia was officially confirmed in a horse stable in Tagmersheim in the district of Donau-Ries. The 3 animals concerned have to be euthanized. The affected stable is closed for 3 months in accordance with the legal requirements on the Protection against the EIA and a restricted area is established within a radius of 1km [approx 0.6 mi]. In the restricted area, all horse owners must house their animals and contact the veterinary authorities. The horses must be examined clinically and serologically (Coggins test). Healthy animals must be re-tested after 3 months. Only when all horses in the restriction zone are negative in the 2nd test, the restrictions may be lifted.

Outside the restricted area, all private and commercial horse owners in the Donau-Ries region are requested to register their horses with the Veterinary Office Donau-Ries and to report any suspicion indicative of infection with the EIA virus in their horses.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily _Orthoretrovirinae_. Other members of the genus Lentivirus include: bovine immunodeficiency virus; caprine arthritis encephalitis virus; feline immunodeficiency virus; human immunodeficiency virus 1; human immunodeficiency virus 2; and maedi/visna virus. EIA can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs, pathological lesions, serology and molecular methods. Infected horses remain viraemic carriers for life and, with very rare exceptions, yield a positive serological test result. Antibody response usually persists and antibody-positive animals, older than 6-8 months, are identified as virus carriers (below 6-8 months of age, serological reactions can be due to maternal antibodies; status can be confirmed by molecular techniques). Infected equids are potential virus reservoirs. Biting flies are mechanical vectors for the virus in nature.

The above and additional information on EIA are available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.06_EIA.pdf.

Summarised information on the 3 previous EIA outbreaks in Germany since the start of the current thread/event on 2 Jan 2017, with links to the separate OIE reports, is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22410.

Since 2012, when a total of 12 EIA cases were reported in Germany, its incidence declined. During the subsequent years 2013-2016, the figures were, respectively, 0, 2, 4, and 0. The current increase, observed in several separate locations, deserves a common epidemiological investigation. - Mod.AS
