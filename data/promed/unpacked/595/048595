Subject: Emergency Management Warning 15: Newcastle Disease Confirmed in
California

Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on 1
Oct 2002, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 3 commercial
operations. Clinical signs in infected birds include respiratory, nervous,
and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed
birds. Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final
validation. Veterinary Services (VS) is working to rapidly expand staff on
the Task Force. Over the next 3 months, VS expects to deploy 100 people
per week to the Task Force for 3-week rotations, and is canceling meetings
and training to meet the personnel demands.

Situation Update:
Investigations are on-going and all figures are pending final validation.

Number of premises positive (clinical and contacts): 1146
(up 10 percent from 1/6)
Number of premises depopulated: 637
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 509
Birds depopulated to date: 146 296 (approximate)

Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, San
Diego

Operational Update:
3 commercial flocks have been confirmed with Newcastle disease in
Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA. The 3 operations
housed approximately 1.2 million birds. Depopulation of these birds has
already begun.

The California State Veterinarian has imposed a quarantine (Food and
Agriculture Code Section 9562) on the following counties: All of Los
Angeles County; All of Orange County; Portions of Riverside County;
Portions of San Bernardino County; and All of San Diego County.

Effective 21 Nov 2002, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of poultry and poultry products from Los Angeles,
portions of Riverside, and portions of San Bernardino Counties, CA.

Poultry species affected by California's quarantine are: Chickens, Turkeys,
Ducks, Geese, Partridges, Pheasants, Quails, Guinea Fowl, Pea Fowl
(Peacocks), Doves, Pigeons, Swans Ratites, Ratite Eggs

Veterinary Services has worked with the U.S. Postal Service to affirm that
poultry will not be able to move out of the quarantined areas through the mail.

State and animal health officials are conducting door-to-door surveys to
identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are following up on
epidemiological associations.

To date, depopulation, cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are
being conducted by CDFA and APHIS.

CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions within the
State of California.

Affected and exposed poultry are being euthanized and double-bagged. Task
Force members are disinfecting the bags and transporting the carcasses to
restricted landfills for burial.

All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other poultry in other States.

Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movement restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
