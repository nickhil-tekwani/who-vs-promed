The recommended post exposure prophylaxis for a previously vaccinated
person is an injection of 1 ml (milliliter) of vaccine into the deltoid
(shoulder) muscle immediately (Day 0) and again 3 days later (Day 3). The
injection is no more painful than any other shot in the arm.
For an unvaccinated person, the same injection is given on Day 0 but it is
repeated on days 3, 7, 14, and 28. In addition, as much as possible of a 20
IU/Kg (International Units/Kilogram of body weight) dose of human rabies
immune globulin is infiltrated in and around the exposure site. If the
entire dose (9.3 ml for a 70 Kg person) cannot be infiltrated, the
remainder is injected into a muscle elsewhere.
The pain caused by an injection immune globulin (IG) depends on the volume
and the site. If properly administered, with a slap preceding needle
insertion, 5ml of IG can be delivered through a 20 gauge, 1.5 inch needle
into the buttock of most adults with very little pain. This is because a
1.5 inch needle will not penetrate to the gluteal muscle of most adults.
For small or lean persons, 5 ml injections of IG into the buttocks are much
more painful because the IG is actually injected into muscle.
In the case of post exposure prophylaxis, the pain caused by the injection
of IG will depend on the site of exposure. A fat person bitten on the hand
quarters should have little to fear. On the other hand, the pain that
person bitten in a more sensitive area will experience will be limited
only by the mercy of the treating physician.
In any case, there is no "painful series" of injections.

[Each person's pain is their on perception. We appreciate all the
contributions regarding the rabies vaccine issue. But unless there is more
information regarding the people or animals that were exposed in this
particular case/outbreak, this thread is cut. - Mod.TG
