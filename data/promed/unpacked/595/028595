A St. Louis County resident has tested positive for a possible case of the Bourbon virus [infection] and it's now an emerging illness in different locations in Missouri.

Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS), Director Dr. Randall Williams, confirmed to The Missourian the most recent case was reported in May [2018] in an adult resident and the individual has recovered.

Due to patient privacy laws, Williams could not release the specific location of the potential infection, the person's age, gender or if anyone they may have been in contact with has been tested.

While initial testing was negative for Heartland and Bourbon virus, due to clinical symptoms and in an abundance of caution, additional different testing was conducted and indicated it may have been Bourbon virus. Confirmation of the possible positive test results, which require blood samples collected over time, will not be available for 2 to 3 weeks. Currently, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta is the only entity that conducts Heartland and Bourbon virus testing.

The patient with possible Bourbon virus reports being bitten by a tick after spending time outdoors in the southwest St. Louis area. The patient did not report spending time in specific locations associated with prior positive Bourbon virus test results in people or ticks.

Williams stresses if patients are exhibiting any flu-like symptoms in these summer months they should contact a physician. Likewise, health care providers should not rule out and should focus exams on potential tick-borne illnesses.

"About half of the people infected by tick-borne illnesses have no recollection of being bitten," Williams said. "If you think you have the flu in May, June or July, you should check with your doctor."

Emerging
--------
Bourbon virus was initially identified in an individual in Bourbon County, Kansas. It also has been reported in Oklahoma and detected in ticks in Northwest Missouri, in a resident of Southwest Missouri, a resident of East Central Missouri, and now possibly a 2nd resident of East Central Missouri.

Williams said ticks have no borders and residents living in St. Louis, Jefferson and Franklin counties should be hyper vigilant in checking themselves and loved ones for ticks and use products to prevent from being bitten.

"Although there is a low risk, it doesn't mean there is no risk," Williams said. "It is vital for people to know wherever they are in the state, check for ticks. With reports of Bourbon virus in several parts of the state, no location is safe."

1st Case
--------
Last summer [2017], Meramec State Park assistant superintendent Tamela Wilson died from complications related to Bourbon virus. She was bitten by a seed tick while at her home in the park outside Sullivan last Memorial Day weekend and at the time was only the 5th known case of the virus in North America.

[This report indicates that Bourbon virus is still circulating in Missouri. Although rare, Bourbon virus is capable of causing serious, even fatal, disease, but the above case has recovered. An earlier report made a strong case for _A. americanum_ as the vector of Bourbon virus. It will be interesting to learn which wildlife species are the reservoirs of the virus, and the extent of its geographic distribution. As of 27 Jun 2017, a limited number of Bourbon virus disease cases have been identified in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Some people who have been infected later died. At this time, it is not known whether the virus might be found in other areas of the United States.

Mod.LK previously provided an informative comment, "Bourbon virus is a member of the _Thogotovirus_ genus of enveloped RNA viruses, one of 7 genera in the virus family _Orthomyxoviridae_. Their single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome has 6 or 7 segments. Several related viruses have been identified in hard tick species; while it is unknown how Bourbon virus is transmitted, it is also assumed to be tick-borne because of the seasonality of the disease and association with tick bites" (see Bourbon virus - USA: (MO) tick-borne case 20170703.5147985).

ProMED thanks Greg Folkers (NIAID/NIH) for sending in the above report.
