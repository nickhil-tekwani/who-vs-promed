Canada Finds Avian Flu in Wild Birds; Risk Low
-----------------------------------------------
Canada found 33 cases of avian influenza, a lethal strain of which
has spread through Asia and Europe, in a survey of wild ducks
conducted this summer [2005], a government health agency said.
The infected ducks were healthy, suggesting they don't carry the
virulent H5N1 strain, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said
in a statement today [31 Oct 2005]. Tests to identify the strain will
be completed next week. Canada has had no cases of H5N1, Agriculture
Minister Andy Mitchell told reporters in Ottawa today.
Concern about bird flu's spread to humans has increased since 5 Oct
2005, when U.S. scientists reported finding similarities between the
H5N1 strain in Asia and the Spanish flu that killed as many as 50
million people in 1918 and 1919. There have been 121 confirmed cases
of bird flu in humans, and 62 people have died, according to the
World Health Organization.
Strains of H5 influenza that don't kill ducks can still be dangerous
to other species such as chickens, said Terrence Tumpey, a senior
microbiologist in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention's influenza branch. Testing will be needed to rule out the
H5N1 strain in the infected ducks, he said.
"You can get H5N1 out of healthy ducks,'' he said in a telephone
interview today [31 Oct 2005]. "You can get all kinds of subtypes out
of migratory ducks.''
28 infected ducks were found in Quebec and 5 in Manitoba, according
to the CFIA. The agency said the risk to humans is low and that it
made the results public to be transparent.
The study is the 1st national survey of influenza in migratory birds
in Canada and will serve as a benchmark in future years, the agency said.
Canadian pharmacists today [31 Oct 2005] halted cross-border sales of
the Tamiflu flu drug to relieve public concern that there may be a
shortage in the country if there's an outbreak, the Canadian
International Pharmacy Association said in a statement today. There's
no evidence of a shortage of the drug, made by Roche Holding AG, the
group said.
Tamiflu, approved for the treatment and prevention of flu, has been
shown to fight the H5N1 avian and human virus strains in test-tube
and animal tests. The World Health Organization recommends that
governments stockpile antiviral drugs should an outbreak occur.
