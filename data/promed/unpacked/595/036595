Cholera cases have persisted in Sinazongwe district in Southern
province since the disease broke out in September 2009.

Sinazongwe District Public Health officer Elias Chilwana disclosed
that the number of cumulative cases has reached 30 and 1 person has
since died. Mr. Chilwana said the cases were being treated at
Sinazeze clinic as most people that were being affected were coming
within the same area.

Mr Chilwana stated that most cholera cases were from Nkandabbwe
Collum Coal Mine's (CCM) shaft 2 because of the poor environmental
hygiene within their mining area. The District Public Health officer
noted that the scenario was disturbing as the company has contributed
to the spread of cholera cases resulting from the supply untreated
water and their sanitary facilities were of poor design.

In January 2009, more than 139 people were affected by the cholera
cases in Sinazongwe district resulting in the closure of several
schools as some were turned into cholera centers.

A total of 4 people have died at a dispensary following a cholera
outbreak in Marsabit North District. The patients had been brought to
Ilaret Dispensary on Sunday [8 Nov 2009], but by Wednesday morning
[11 Nov 2009] 2 adults and 2 young children had succumbed to the
disease. Kenya Red Cross Society Regional Health Officer Abdi Mohamed
said more than 40 cholera patients had been admitted since 8 Nov
2009. He attributes the outbreak to recent floods and poor hygiene.

The disease has so far killed more than 26 people in a month in the
expansive Upper Eastern region.

According to Garbatulla District medical officer Nelson Muriu,
cholera cases have doubled compared to other diseases. "We are trying
to contain spread of the disease but the hospital has been
overwhelmed for lack of enough drugs," said Dr Muriu.

The cholera outbreak in Terengganu is reported to have become more
serious with 11 patients, who showed symptoms of the disease, being
tested positive on [Fri 13 Nov 2009].

State health director Dr Nordiyanah Hassan said the patients were
being treated at the Sultanah Nur Zahirah Hospital (HSNZ). So far,
she said a total of 98 people were suspected of having infected after
showing symptoms like vomiting and acute diarrhea.

She also anticipated the number of confirmed cholera patients in the
state to increase over the next 2 weeks following the heavy
downpours, which were expected in most of the East Coast states.

involving a 36-year-old man from Kuala Terengganu.
