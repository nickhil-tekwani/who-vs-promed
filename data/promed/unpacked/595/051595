A meeting was held at the end of last week [week of 18 Aug 2014] in Oujda [East Morocco, adjacent to the Algerian border; see map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/MO/54/Oujda.html] to discuss ways and measures to prevent the introduction of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) into Morocco. The governor of the prefecture of Oujda-Angad, Mohamed Mhidia, stressed that regional offices of the National Office of Food Safety Products in collaboration with the departments of the province and all stakeholders, set up an urgent action plan with a series of measures in state to vaccinate livestock in the region and prevent the spread of this pandemic.

The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Abdelwahab Nouri, went yesterday morning [24 Aug 2014] to the province of Mostaganem to inquire about the status of implementing the prescribed measures against FMD. To this end, he visited 2 premises of infected farms, one at Ouled Ziane within the boundaries of the town Ouled Boughalem, the other one in Sidi Lakhdar. In the afternoon, he held a conference in the provincial conference hall where he thanked the executives of agricultural services who have made many efforts to curb the spread of the disease to the rest of the municipalities in the province. After his brief speech, he told the press that the disease would soon be overcome thanks to the large vaccination campaigns conducted across the country and which resulted in the vaccination of more than 1.6 million heads of cattle, which should be fully protected against this global scourge affecting Africa and 60 other countries worldwide.

[If the information above on vaccination of 1.6 million cattle is accurate, this may represent about 80 percent of Algeria's cattle population (about 2 million). Such coverage would have been protective, if a matching vaccine strain was applied. However, to the best of our knowledge, a vaccine strain matching the circulating virus strain "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d" has been applied only recently, while most cattle had been vaccinated earlier with a WA vaccine strain which may, at best, have provided partial protection. - Mod.AS

[3] Tunisia: update, request for information

On 27 Aug 2014, FAO/EMPRES has received 4 alerts notifying new FMD outbreaks in Tunisia:
- the 1st outbreak was detected on 10 Aug 2014 in the Manouba province, district Mehrine El Battan and concerned one head of cattle;
- 2 additional outbreaks detected on 15 Aug 2014 in Mahdia province, district Zaouia El Jem and in the same province, district Oued Arjoun concerned respectively 10 cattle and 3 sheep and 8 cattle;
- the last notified outbreak was observed on 17 Aug 2014 in the province of Beja, district Sidi Shili, with 2 bovine cases.

[The aforesaid 4 outbreaks were notified by Tunisia to the OIE on 27 Aug 2014 in follow-up report no 10, available, with an interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15926.

Since the start of the outbreak in Tunisia, reportedly on 25 Apr 2014, 124 outbreaks have been reported from this country. The following additional commentary on the Tunisian situation, by Mod.AB, has been included in the ProMED-MENA posting (20140828.2729573), from where the item above was copied. - Mod.AS

While spreading swiftly in Algeria, the FMD epizootic seems to continue its propagation in Tunisia as well. Considering that most susceptible animals have benefited from vaccination, one can easily understand the limited number of clinical cases observed in each disease focus. It is also worth noting that a few cases are reported in sheep in Tunisia, despite the inclusion of small ruminants in the vaccination scheme and this in contrast with the situation in neighboring Algeria, where officials argue the absence of the disease in the country and outline the bovine tropism of the strain responsible for the current FMD outbreak.

ProMED-MENA would appreciate receiving insight on the current situation of the vaccination campaign in Tunisia, particularly after the 1.1 million doses of the vaccine matching the field strain have been received. - Mod.AB

[4] Algeria: sanitary measures

While professionals in agriculture including veterinary inspection of Oran is sounding the alarm bell about the spread of animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease [FMD] and bluetongue, some unscrupulous individuals continue to slaughter livestock illegally spiraling out of control. Indeed this phenomenon, which was limited until a few years ago to the eastern part of the [Oran] province, like Hassi Bounif and Hassi Ameur, seems to [have reached] alarming proportions throughout Oran. If illegal slaughter gets firmly rooted in the habits of city dwellers, what about the rural areas? Hundreds of animals escape the communal slaughter. The veterinary services of DSA [Directorate of Agricultural Services] intensified in recent weeks their efforts to control the butchers, especially since investigations in the field have revealed collusion between the perpetrators of illegal slaughter and some unscrupulous butchers. These expose the public to serious health hazards, hence the need to organize awareness campaigns for the benefit of the consumers, especially those attracted by the low prices.

[5] Algeria: international trade impact

The FMD virus, which emerged in Algeria in June 2014, has now entered its phase of "stabilization", in the words of the Algerian Ministry of Agriculture. Nevertheless, the impact of the disease on the livestock sector and the market for red meat is significant.

The head of the sector, Abdelwahab Nouri ,stated last Saturday [23 Aug 2014] that "the epidemic is under control" and that the time has arrived for damage assessment implementation of the compensation scheme for affected farmers. Since the emergence of this viral disease, veterinary services of the Ministry of Agriculture applied stamping out policy; 4000 cattle cases were culled [in fact, compulsorily slaughtered for human consumption. - Mod.AS] and hundreds died in their respective farms.

The vaccination included 1.6 million cattle, out of a total of 2 million present in the country, according to the same ministry [see item 2 above and the relevant commentary there. - Mod.AS

To meet the needs above the available vaccine stock, the country had to import about 1.2 million additional doses of vaccine within a few weeks.

In addition to the mass vaccination of livestock and economic assistance to affected farmers, the country's authorities have taken several other measures in order to curb the spread of the disease. This included the closure of borders to entry or exit of cattle on foot since last July. Livestock markets throughout the country were shut-down and remain closed to this day.

For their part, farmers do not seem satisfied with the support measures implemented in their favor and oppose the decisions of animal culling. They claim that compensations offered do not reflect the real price of culled (slaughtered) animals. In some cases, the veterinary authorities in the country have had to resort to the police to enforce the decisions of slaughter.

In spite of the government reassurances that measures were applied, industry professionals claimed drawbacks in the management of the crisis since its emergence. The National Veterinary Union denounces "delays" in control of the situation while "the virus is spreading at an accelerated rate." The president of the union believes that "there were failures in the prevention and risk management even before the confirmation of the 1st case."

The prospects of improvement during the coming weeks are less than optimal. The decision to close the borders to the movement of cattle will inevitably affect the recovery of the red meat industry. This, at a time when consumption is expected to rise in September with the reopening of canteens in schools and in various other socio-educational centers, which consume in average 1/3 of the total meat consumption in Algeria.

The consumption of red meat in Algeria averaged 400 000 tonnes annually, of which over 30 percent are imported. France is the main supplier of the Algerian market with 80 percent of imports. Algeria imports from France fattening cattle, dairy cows, and heifers. Renewal of exports from France is anticipated as soon as the epizootic is controlled.

[FMD has already advanced in Algeria westwards as far as the provinces of Mostaganem, Tiaret, Mascara and Oran. Efforts to vaccinate cattle throughout the country are continued.

The authorities are trying to accomplish the vaccination the earliest and apply other measures to control the epizootic to safeguard the availability of large quantities of slaughter animals during the next Moslem feast of sacrifice (Eid al Adha) which is due to begin on Fri 3 Oct 2014 (final date may move one day).

Since sheep are not vaccinated, their continued freedom of disease is not assured. FMD in sheep may cause serious losses in offspring under the age of 2 months; in adult animals, the disease may have a milder course, provided the virus strain is not particularly pathogenic. Most sheep parturitions in Algeria took place during late winter and spring; there are only few lambs in the flocks at present and current disease symptoms in sheep flocks in the Maghreb may thus be of a mild nature and may be missed. However, infected sheep may become carriers/virus disseminators, a serious threat to neighbouring Morocco.

Morocco has already started vaccination of cattle along its eastern provinces bordering Algeria. The vaccine being used is the same as the one donated by the EU to Tunisia, namely a Merial vaccine including a serotype O vaccine strain selected as matching the circulating Indian strain. Hopefully it will prove efficacious should the outbreak flare up in the country, not necessarily on the border with Algeria.

Cattle population in Morocco is mainly concentrated in the western parts; it is sparse in eastern Morocco, mostly composed of herds of less than 5 heads. This poses a double problem:

1. vets complain they are underpaid (Euro 0.4/USD 0.53 per head, all inclusive) and become reluctant to implement the vaccination plan. An agreement to hand over to them the implementation of the planned cattle identification scheme may hopefully lower this reluctance;
2. the vaccine is delivered in 250 ml vials. If a cattle dose contains 5 ml, a vial is to be used for 50 heads. Considering the above, vets will obviously open a vial in a premise, not use it up, then transport it long distances and re-use it. Hopefully this will not have much effect on the potency of an inactivated vaccine. However, what about the effect on the adjuvant? Information on the shelf life of this vaccine will be helpful.

Like Algeria, reportedly Morocco will vaccinate cattle only. This can be explained by the size of the small ruminant population (2013 statistics -- about 20 million sheep, 6.3 million goats) and the constraint of acquiring vaccine in sufficient quantities for the entire ruminant population. Planning the vaccination and adapting its performance to changing epidemiology in Algeria and -- hopefully not -- in case of virus penetration, will be a complex and delicate project. The authorities may consider vaccinating small ruminants at least in the eastern regions, to prevent spread. - Mods.AS/AB
