130 deer killed in TB outbreak
------------------------------
Wild deer in the Forest of Dean "must be infected" with bovine tuberculosis (TB) according to one keeper who had to cull his whole herd. The keeper had to go through the heartbreak of wiping out all 130 of the animals which roam his Priors Mesne estate, near Aylburton, Lydney.

"We found bovine tuberculosis in too many of the deer and it means they have to go," he said, who is also the chairman of Gloucestershire County Council.

"It's a complete disaster. We cull them every year by about 25 to 30 and it is 20 years of improving the herd down the drain. I'm not really equipped to comment properly about the rest of the deer in the forest but my feeling is that they must be infected."

He said he is reasonably sure badgers are to blame for the infection. An experimental badger cull has been announced in parts of Gloucestershire.

A recent motion tabled at a full county council meeting to stop the cull was voted down by members. The pilot will not take place as far south in the Forest as the keeper's estate. He won't receive any compensation for his loss of herd.

The keeper and his wife have sold their estate and will move to Herefordshire in August. He said the new owners are hoping to introduce deer there again. "What I feel about the situation is there must be money spent by the Government on proper research, they have got to get to grips with this because if they don't, we are in real trouble," he said.

A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said TB levels in wild deer were traditionally very low.

[Deer are included among "other species" affected by bovine tuberculosis in the UK.

According to the annual report of the chief veterinary officer, UK, for 2009, _Mycobacterium bovis_ was confirmed in 19 of 52 notified deer carcasses, 18 of which were from wild deer populations, and one case from a farmed deer. This was significantly lower than in alpacas (_M.bovis_ confirmed in 68 of 123 submissions).

In cats, 27 were positive out of 104 submissions. Out of 116 domestic pigs submitted for TB examination, 23 were found infected. There were 9 sheep submissions, with 5 positives.

Deer TB is a serious problem in other countries -- for example, New Zealand. - Mod.AS
