A dog is suspected to be the origin of an outbreak of pneumonic
plague in northwest China that has killed 3 people and left 10 000
under strict quarantine, state media reported. Ziketan, a remote town
in a Tibetan area of Qinghai province, has been locked down since
Saturday [1 Aug 2009] in an effort to contain the spread of the
highly virulent disease.

One patient was in critical condition and 8 others were infected,
most of them relatives of the 1st fatality, a 32-year-old herdsman,
or local doctors, Xinhua news agency said.

Initial tests had shown that the herdsman's dead dog was the likely
origin of the outbreak, Xinhua reported late Wednesday [5 Aug 2009],
quoting professor Wang Hu, director of the Qinghai disease control
bureau. Wang said it was likely that the dog died after eating a
plague-infected marmot and that the man became infected when he was
bitten by fleas while burying the dead dog. He died 3 days later.

"The 1st victim buried the dead dog without any protection. After he
became infected, his relatives and neighbours were in close contact
with him without taking any protective measures, leading to their
infection," Wang was quoted as saying.

[Regarding dogs and plague, an American Veterinary Medical
Association reference
(<http://www.avma.org/reference/zoonosis/znbuboni.asp>), with the
citation numbers changed to begin at 1, states:

"Generally, the canine family is believed to be more resistant to
plague than the feline family and if they develop the disease at all,
the disease usually is subclinical, that is, not easily recognizable.
Wild carnivores in the dog family, such as coyotes and foxes, can
develop blood titers against _Yersinia pestis_ (1,2) Experimentally,
dogs inoculated with _Y. pestis_ develop bacteremia and have had _Y.
pestis_ isolated for 10 days from the oropharynx (1). Subclinically
and clinically affected dogs can develop antibodies against _Y.
pestis_ (1), and people have contracted plague after skinning
infected coyotes and foxes (1,3).
