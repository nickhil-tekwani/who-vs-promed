The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association has decided to cancel the 2016 Equestfest event scheduled for [30 Dec 2016] at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center (LAEC), after recent cases of equine herpes virus in the county.

"As the virus could potentially affect the safety and wellbeing of the equine participants at the 2016 Equestfest event, that event scheduled to be held at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center has been canceled," the Association said in an announcement on the Tournament of Roses website.

California's Department of Food and Agriculture said it has confirmed 13 cases of the virus in horses at the LAEC since [3 Nov 2016] when it issued a quarantine for the Center. Of these horses, only 1 remains in isolation, according to a [7 Dec 2016] update. The rest have been returned to their normal stalls, although the center continues to implement enhanced biosecurity measures in all barns under quarantine.

The Association said it is working with appropriate government officials and its own veterinary consultant "to insure the well-being of the animals participating in the 2017 Rose Parade. Additional safeguards and protocols will be adopted to ensure a safe environment," the announcement said. "It is anticipated that all equestrian entries scheduled to participate in the 2017 Rose Parade will do so."

Tickets for this year's Equestfest purchased through Sharp Seating (www.sharpseating.com) will be automatically refunded to the purchaser, the Association said. Ticket holders do not need to return them to the point of sale.

[With 13 recent cases in the area, this is likely a wise decision. This is sad for the organizers, the human participants and the viewers but it is the safest move for the equine participants.
