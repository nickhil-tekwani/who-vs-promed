The Council of Agriculture is planning measures to assist muskmelon farmers amid an outbreak of plant disease. More than 20% of the crop has been damaged. Financial assistance programmes will be initiated. After inspecting affected farms in the south, they say that the problem may be caused by the way fields are managed. The council will provide help from experts for the farmers to alleviate the damage due to plant diseases and unusual weather patterns.

[A large number of pathogens can affect cucurbit crops, which include melons and cucumbers (_Cucumis_ spp.); watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_); and squashes, gourds, and pumpkins (_Cucurbita_ spp.). Muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_) includes several subspecies and many cultivars, both with smooth (such as honeydew) and netted (such as subsp. _reticulatus_, rockmelon, or cantaloupe) skins.

It is unclear from the story above whether a diagnosis of a pathogen affecting the crops is already available. If not, reliable diagnosis of any pathogens affecting the melons will be essential for designing suitable management strategies for the farmers. The problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors.
