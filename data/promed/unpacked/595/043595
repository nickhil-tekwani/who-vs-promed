The 1st reported case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Saskatchewan in 2020 was confirmed earlier this week.

Ministry of Health officials said that the infected working-aged individual was from a rural area in central Saskatchewan.

There have now been 35 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections] in the province since first reported in 1994, 11 of which have resulted in death, officials said.

Dr Saqib Shahab, the province's chief medical health officer, reminded people to be cautious of hantaviruses while giving an update about the novel coronavirus response in Saskatchewan.

"[For] a while we've been focusing a lot on COVID. Everything else is still there and we just need to take the usual precautions and in this case when you're opening cabins up after the winter season," Shahab said at a press conference on Thursday [14 May 2020].

"A reminder for everyone just before the long weekend [Canadian holiday on the Monday preceding 25 May, Victoria Day, which serves as the unofficial beginning of the summer season] when you are opening cabins or sheds or garages after a period of time... just be cautious."

Exposure to hantaviruses can cause a rare but often fatal disease called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), which can progress rapidly into serious complications.

In Saskatchewan, officials said humans are most often exposed by breathing in air particles contaminated by deer mouse saliva, urine, or feces containing infectious hantaviruses. This can occur, for example, after sweeping or vacuuming infected areas.

[Human hantavirus infections in Saskatchewan are not new. Saskatchewan had 30 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] -- the disease caused by inhaling the virus -- between 1994 and 2015, with 10 of those people dying (see Hantavirus update - Americas (25): Canada (SK) 20150613.3435499).

The report above does not indicate the circumstances under which the infection was acquired, nor the specific hantavirus involved in the cases. Sin Nombre virus is most likely the hantavirus responsible for these cases. This report is another reminder that closed buildings that have been little used or unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant. Seoul virus is another possible hantavirus involved inhuman infections in Saskatchewan. However, the province has an ongoing effort to eliminate the brown rat (_Rattus norveigicus_), the natural host of Seoul virus, and 2/3 of its regional municipalities are now rat-free and the province could be entirely rat-free within a decade, suggesting that Sin Nombre is a more likely hantavirus responsible for this and other recent cases.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America and occurs in Saskatchewan.
