Headlines

- After the safe and successful rollout of nationwide polio campaigns since November 2021, we have received tragic news that 8 health workers at the forefront have been killed this morning in a series of shootings in Takhar and Kunduz in northeast Afghanistan. The vaccination campaign has been suspended in both provinces. A statement has been issued by the Regional Director of WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Region, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, as well as by the United Nations in the country, condemning these attacks, expressing condolences to the families and underscoring that the provision of health and the safety of health workers at the forefront are paramount, and must be kept neutral to any geo-political situation anywhere.

Our thoughts and prayers are both with the families and our teams on the ground at this time. [See section 2 below]

- Last week, Malawi reported a WPV1 case in a 3-year-old girl in the capital, Lilongwe. Analysis shows that the virus is genetically linked to WPV1 that was detected in Pakistan's Sindh province in October 2019. This is the first WPV1 case from the continent of Africa in over 5 years.

[This week's report has several noteworthy events. The first is the official confirmation of the WPV1 case in Malawi (see Poliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529 for an earlier report on this). The second is the reports of the 1st cases of cVDPV associated AFP cases with dates of onset in 2022, with cVDPV1 associated AFP reported from Madagascar and cVDPV2 reported from Nigeria. Looking at the total reported case counts for 2020 vs 2021, there were 140 cases of WPV1 in 2020 and 5 in 2021, a 96% reduction in WPV1 associated cases, while for cVDPV associated cases there were 1113 cases of cVDPV in 2020 and 635 in 2021, a 43% reduction in cases.

Information on the epidemiologic investigation findings of the WPV1 case in Malawi would be greatly appreciated. Did the child or child's family have known contact with travellers from Pakistan? As the virus was last seen in 2019 in Sindh province, did it continue to circulate under the radarscope in Pakistan or was it introduced to Malawi and circulate under the radarscope in Malawi...

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Afghanistan violence
Date: Thu 24 Feb 2022

The United Nations has condemned the killing of 8 polio vaccination workers in 4 locations in northern Afghanistan on Thursday [24 Feb 2022], the first such attacks since nationwide immunization campaigns resumed last November [2021].

One member of the vaccination transit team was killed in Taloqan district in Takhar province, while 4 members of house-to-house teams were murdered in 2 separate incidents in Kunduz city, according to a statement from the UN Country Team.

Two vaccinators and a social mobilizer were killed in Emamsaheb district of Kunduz province.

In the wake of the carnage, the UN immediately suspended the national polio vaccination campaign in Kunduz and Takhar provinces.

Ramiz Alakbarov, the Secretary-General's Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan, took to Twitter to express condemnation in the strongest terms. He said the attacks and assassinations were a violation of international humanitarian law.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyeus, has also expressed his profound shock. Four of the health workers were women, he said in a post on Twitter. "We extend our deepest condolences to their families and colleagues," he wrote, adding that health workers should not be targeted.

The UN Country Team was appalled by the brutality of the killings, noting that this was not the first time health workers have come under attack.

Last year, 9 polio workers were killed during national polio vaccination campaigns.

These immunization exercises are a vital and effective way to reach millions of children to protect them against polio, the UN statement said, and depriving them of an assurance of a healthy life is inhumane.

"This senseless violence must stop immediately, and those responsible must be investigated and brought to justice. These attacks are a violation of international humanitarian law." The UN strongly condemns all attacks on health workers anywhere, stressing that delivery of health care is impartial.

The polio vaccination campaign in Afghanistan is supported by WHO, together with the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other partners.

They planned to target nearly 10 million under-5s across the country this month [February 2022], with 4 more rounds scheduled for the rest of the year [2022].

Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, said the suspension of the programme in Kunduz and Takhar provinces leaves thousands of children unprotected and exposed to a life-threatening disease that can result in permanent paralysis. In calling for an end to "senseless attacks" on health workers, Dr. Al-Mandhari pointed out that they are strictly forbidden in all faiths. "These cowardly acts ultimately only harm innocent children who must be given every opportunity to live safe and healthy lives," he said. "WHO condemns all attacks on health workers in the strongest terms and appeal to the Taliban Authorities to immediately identify and bring the perpetrators to justice."

[What can one say above and beyond what we've said previously. It's hard to fathom why healthcare workers are being targeted. As long as this type of violence continues, the probability of polio eradication remains seriously challenged.
