Re:
[We have not previously had BSE confirmed in Scotland.- Mod.TG
There have been many cases in Scotland, particularly concentrated in
the Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway regions i.e. the south-west of the
country. I saw several cases myself when I worked for the then MAFF as
a vet officer in 1996.
Indeed I was specifically employed on a short term contract based in
Dumfries to work on the selective cohort cull in that area. There were
proportionately fewer cases than in many other parts of the UK, and as
elsewhere the vast majority were in dairy cattle.
This case does raise again the question I have wondered about several
times. Is BSE not a new disease, but one which was amplified up to
detectable levels by a change in feeding practices? Possibly
retrospective histopathology studies have ruled this out, but even
they must have a limited sensitivity.

It is important to find out how the herd was accepted into BAS scheme
despite stringent measures. Are there any more infected cattle in
the herd and what is the status of other herds in the scheme? If the
scheme has flaws, the decision to allow meat from cattle up to 42
months for human consumption could be a serious step backwards.

[Both authors make valid points. However, unless there is substantial
new information regarding the entrance of the animal(s) into the BAS
scheme, or other decisions regarding the 30 months for slaughter, this
string is cut. - Mod.TG
