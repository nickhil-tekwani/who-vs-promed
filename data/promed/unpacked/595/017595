Cattle producers in Victoria's North East and Gippsland areas should
be on the lookout for a parasite which causes theileria. Department of
Primary Industries district veterinary officer Lee Manning said while
theileria was common in northern New South Wales and Queensland it was
rarely seen in Victoria. "Theileria is a blood parasite, which
typically infects cattle through a tick bite," Dr Manning said.
"Victorian beef and dairy herds have been infected when cattle from
the northern states, carrying ticks infested with theileria, are
introduced into a herd or on to adjoining properties.

"The parasite can cause illness and even death to cattle that have not
previously been exposed to it. Theileria is transmitted by
blood-sucking ticks, including the common bush tick, which is
widespread in Victoria. It can be carried by all mammals, including
wildlife, dogs and cats, as well as birds." Dr Manning said farmers
should contact their vet should their cattle have multiple abortions
or show signs of anemia. She said there was no specific treatment for
theileriosis.

"The disease causes mild to severe anaemia due to destruction of red
blood cells and this can be seen as lethargy, weakness, pale mucous
membranes, a drop in milk production, going off feed, difficulty
breathing, abortions, jaundice and sudden death," she said.

"Cattle are more likely to show signs when stressed, especially at the
point of calving but most infected cattle will have benign
theileriosis and show no signs of illness.

"Bush ticks are almost impossible to eradicate from a property because
they are on and off the host in a week and live in pasture for many
months, as well as surviving on wildlife."

Theileriosis results from infection with obligate intracellular
protozoa in the genus _Theileria_. The 2 most important species are
_T. parva_, which causes East Coast fever, Corridor disease, and
Zimbabwean theileriosis, and _T. annulata_, which causes tropical
theileriosis (Mediterranean theileriosis). A number of other
_Theileria_ species can infect ruminants; many of them cause mild or
asymptomatic infections.

Both _T. parva_ and_ T. annulata_ are spread by ticks.

_Theileria_ sporozoites are transmitted to susceptible animals in the
saliva of the feeding tick. Ordinarily, _T. parva_ and _T. annulata_
only mature and enter the saliva after the tick attaches to a host;
usually, a tick must be attached for 48 to 72 hours before it becomes
infective. However, if environmental temperatures are high, infective
sporozoites can develop in ticks on the ground and may enter the host
within hours of attachment. Transovarial transmission does not occur
with either _T. parva_ or _T. annulata_. Inside the host, _Theileria_
sporozoites undergo a complex life cycle involving the replication of
schizonts in leukocytes and piroplasms in erythrocytes. Cattle that
recover from _Theileria_ infections usually become carriers.

The incubation period for theileriosis is 10 to 25 days.

The typical clinical signs of East Coast fever are swelling of the
draining lymph node followed by generalized lymphadenopathy, fever,
anorexia, and a rapid loss of condition. Other symptoms can include
lacrimation, nasal discharge, corneal opacity, an increased
respiratory rate, and diarrhea. Death is common in fully susceptible
cattle, but more rare in cattle in endemic areas. Terminally, animals
often develop pulmonary edema, severe dyspnea, and a frothy nasal
discharge. Cattle with East Coast fever may also develop a fatal
condition called "turning sickness." In this form of the disease,
infected cells block capillaries in the central nervous system and
cause neurologic signs. Some animals recover from East Coast fever and
become asymptomatic carriers; others may have poor productivity and
stunted growth.

Tropical theileriosis resembles East Coast fever, but jaundice and
anemia may also occur. Common clinical signs in tropical theileriosis
include fever, enlarged lymph nodes, pale mucous membranes, a rapid
loss of condition, and sometimes hemoglobinuria.

Morbidity and mortality vary with the host's susceptibility and the
strain of the parasite. The mortality rate from East Coast fever can
be up to 100 per cent in cattle from non endemic areas. However, in
indigenous zebu cattle in endemic areas, mortality is usually low even
with a morbidity of approximately 100 per cent. The mortality rate for
tropical theileriosis can also vary from 3 per cent to nearly 90 per
cent, depending on the strain of parasite and the susceptibility of
the animals. Theileriosis can be treated with drugs, and vaccines are
available for both East Coast fever and tropical theileriosis.
Recovery from one strain of _T. annulata_ confers cross protection
against other strains. Cross protection does not occur with _T.
parva_.

The differential diagnosis includes heartwater, trypanosomiasis,
babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and malignant catarrhal fever. The parasites
must also be differentiated from other species of _Theileria_.
