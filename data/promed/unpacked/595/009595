New variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine pituitary growth hormone.
Ghazot and colleagues describe a case of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (nvCJD) in a French patient. His illness began in February, 1994
(he died in January, 1996, after his disease had lasted 23 months). In the
UK, there has been only one patient in whom clinical onset occurred
earlier, in January, 1994 (2). The fact that onset in the French case of
nvCJD occurred earlier than in all but one of the cases reported in the UK
is surprising, even if one considers that France was one of the biggest
markets for UK beef. A report for the French National Assembly on the "mad
cow" crisis (3), which revealed that the French patient, a mechanic by
profession, was also a devoted body-builder, may provide a clue.
Cadaveric human growth hormone has been used to increase muscle strength
and reduce fat mass in weight lifters and body-builders. This practice is
still going on in some eastern European countries (4) although, apparently,
not in France. However, since 1951, a drug well-known in France,
"somatotrophin", the bovine equivalent of human growth hormone, has been
prescribed for "tissue repairs". In common with human growth hormone, it
has a lipolytic and a protein anabolic effect (but has no effect on
growth). This drug, reimbursed by the French Securite Sociale and
administered by subcutaneous or intramuscular injections (100 units daily,
for 8 days) was, like most of the other drugs of bovine origin, banned, as
a precautionary measure, in July, 1992.
It is possible that the one case of nvCJD reported in France might be an
iatrogenic case resulting from the injections of bovine somatotrophin
contaminated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Onset in February,
1994, is compatible with an inoculation having occurred during the late
1980s (the shortest incubation period with contaminated human growth
hormone is 4 years).
