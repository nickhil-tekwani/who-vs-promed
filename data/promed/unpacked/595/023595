Postal Service says DC facility anthrax-free
--------------------------------------------
The US Postal Service said on Wednesday that it had found no anthrax at its
Washington processing center, and test results that detected the deadly
bacteria on a sample from the Federal Reserve Bank were false.
Anthrax tests conducted at a Federal Reserve mail-screening center this
month produced a positive result that the central bank reported to the
Postal Service on Tuesday. The suspected sample was sent to a North
Carolina facility on Wednesday for more tests, and the Fed said in a
statement these had shown the initial test result was a "false positive."
The central bank said further tests would be conducted.
Postal officials said 86 air and surface tests conducted at a separate
facility operated by the post office to sort mail going to the federal
government, including the Fed, tested negative for the bacteria.
"In total, 86 samples, every sample has come back negative" for anthrax,
said Tom Day, vice president of engineering for the Postal Service. "From
the results we have achieved over the course of the past year (from other
anthrax cases), we believe these are very reliable results."
Following the deadly 11 Sep 2001 attacks on Washington and New York, 5
people died and 23 were injured after contracting anthrax, mostly from
letters laced with the bacteria. The tainted letters were found at several
media outlets and postal facilities around the country. Anthrax-laced mail
also was sent to the offices of Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, both Democrats.
Day said the sample taken at the Fed's screening facility had not been
linked to a specific piece of mail. The Fed tests all mail at 2 trailers
set up near its headquarters before it is sent into the building. As part
of routine testing, the Fed found that one of 36 samples taken between 3
and 6 Jan 2003 produced a positive result in preliminary tests. A batch of
about 700 pieces of mail were tested as the possible source of the initial
positive test.
Day told reporters the additional tests conducted at the Fed's mail
facility were "essential, but the timeliness with which they did it is
probably something to be explored." The post office has spent $115 million
dollars since September 2001 to test and purchase mail-sanitizing equipment
and educate employees to look for suspicious packages.
