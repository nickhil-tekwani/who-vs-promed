Abstract
--------
Bayou orthohantavirus (BAYV) is one of several hantaviruses in the United States that cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in humans. Its host reservoir, the marsh rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_), inhabits coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana, a region extensively impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The oil spill presents an opportunity to investigate how a large-scale ecological disturbance can influence the hantavirus host-pathogen dynamic by examining BAYV presence in its reservoir host species in areas with different oiling histories. Here, we: (1) quantify BAYV prevalence in the rice rat in coastal saltmarshes of Louisiana; (2) assess whether prevalence is driven by rice rat demographics, seasonality, or association with habitat characteristics; and (3) determine whether these factors differ by marsh oiling history. We collected mark-recapture data and blood and tissue samples over 5 years (2013-2017) at oiled, unoiled, and reference sites. Testing of the samples for BAYV revealed an antibody and RNA prevalence of 13.7%. Logistic regression analysis found that prevalence varied seasonally and interannually, and in July 2016 reached 30.8%. Sex (male) and increasing cover of _Sporobolus alterniflorus_ and open water compared to _Juncus roemerianus_ and bare ground were the strongest predictors of hantavirus prevalence. Abundance estimates derived from Huggins closed-capture models were greatest at oiled sites, but oiling treatment had no residual influence on BAYV prevalence, and abundance and prevalence were not correlated. This study supports the hypothesis that habitat is a main driver of hantavirus prevalence in the host and implies that continued and future disturbances in the region will likely impact the rice rat-BAYV dynamic by altering plant communities and landscape structure.

Although cases of Bayou hantavirus causing human hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred infrequently, they have been diagnosed in eastern Texas and Louisiana. The above report underscores the importance of the relationship of habitat of the rodent reservoir host, the marsh rice rat (_Oryzomys palustris_), and prevalence of Bayou hantavirus. Human or naturally caused habitat changes can, in turn, affect BAY virus prevalence. People entering into these wetland areas of high BAY virus prevalence are at risk of infection.
