[In December 2016, Russia reported HPAI subtype H5. To date (16 Jan 2017), 5 outbreaks have been reported; they are in Rostovskaya [Rostov] Oblast (2), Krasnodarskiy [Krasnodar] Krai (2), and Astrakhanskaya [Astrakhan] Oblast (1). These outbreaks have involved 876 278 birds (9740 dead and 861 661 destroyed). See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21840.

Although the neuraminidase for the current event and for the one reported in December 2016 have not yet been typed, given that the subtypes reported from Russia in June and November 2016 were both H5N8, and the fact that the outbreak is continuing in this area, it is likely that these recent reports are also associated with the H5N8 subtype. - Mod.CRD
