Bubonic Plague Breaks Out in Lilongwe
------------------------------
Malawi health officials are battling to contain a bubonic plague outbreak in
the southern border district of Nsanje.
The first cases were reported in April [2002] and officials suspect it
spread from the neighbouring Mozambican district of Mutarara where an
outbreak was reported in March [2002].
The bacterium responsible for the disease is carried by fleas and was most
likely brought into Malawi by rats, said Nsanje environmental officer
George Chitimbe.
A total of 10 people are already being treated for the disease, he said.
"We are working hard to contain the disease and have contacted Mozambique
health officials to formulate a joint strategy to contain it," he said.
Symptoms include shivering, vomiting, headaches, giddiness, intolerance to
light, pain in the back and limbs and a white coating on the tongue.
Although it causes extreme discomfort the disease is easily treated with
modern medicine [antibiotics] and once a person has recovered, they will
have acquired an immunity to the disease, Chitimbe said. If untreated, the
mortality rate can be as high as 75 percent.
