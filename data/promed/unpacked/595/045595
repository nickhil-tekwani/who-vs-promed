The Minister of Health, Franklin Vergara, delivered an ELISA reader
to the Tonosi Rural Hospital that can be used for hantavirus tests.
The statistics reflect that this district in the Los Santos province
has the 2nd most hantavirus [infection] cases. All indications are
that this is due to grain production, such as rice and corn [maize],
which leads to the presence of rodent [hosts].

Tonosi is seen as a fertile area for research on human and geographic
characteristics and health infrastructure. The equipment that has been
delivered will permit an increase in knowledge about hantavirus[es]
and bring in new data in order to control the disease.

[Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Panama due to infections with
Choclo virus has been a persistent, although sporadic, problem in Los
Santos province. It is encouraging to see decentralization of
technology, which will be useful for initial diagnostic workups but
will require confirmatory tests in a more sophisticated central
laboratory and constant checks at the local level to assure good
quality control and test reliability.

As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389,
hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio
Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys
fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda
(cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human
pathogen, causing HPS, which can have a high case fatality rate,
especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their
disease.

[2] Bolivia (Beni)

The 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] that affected a 9-year-old
child in the San Andres municipality, Buen Jesus community, Marban
province in the department [state or equivalent] of Beni, is out of
danger [in Bolivia, a province is a subdivision of a department rather
than the other way round. - Mod.JW]. Today [2 Jun 2011], a rodent
control team went to this region, 72 km [45 miles] distant from
Trinidad, to capture rodents and carry out studies to determine
whether they are virus carriers or not.

According to the physician epidemiologist Wilfredo Camargo, there is
a theory that, with the arrival of the disease in Beni, [the origin
can be traced] to mice that were introduced from Santa Cruz to Beni by
Mennonite [farmers] and their agricultural equipment. [The speculation
is]: "The Menonnites live in Santa Cruz and buy land in Beni; they are
rice producers and brought these animals [rodents] in their
agricultural equipment. When they settled in Beni to produce rice, the
rodents jumped out and infected their cousins in these lands," he
stated.

He explained that the hantavirus belongs to the Bunyaviridae family
and lives in long-tailed wild rats, and one can acquire the virus
through contact with their urine, excretions or saliva, and when it
infects humans, it produces a disease that can be fatal.

He stated that the 1st case of hantavirus [infection] dates back to
25 May [2011] when the infected child came into the local hospital,
and through laboratory tests carried out by the National Control of
Tropical Infectious Diseases Service, the disease was confirmed. The
child's family, school classmates, neighbors and school teachers were
similarly [sampled] and tested in both Bolivia and the USA, and
[results] indicated that there is no infection with hantavirus[es] in
these persons.

[The speculation that Mennonite farmers brought rodents infected with
a hantavirus into the Beni mentioned above has no supporting evidence
and is unfair to these farmers. It is likely, however, that increased
rice production in the Beni may have led to more food availability for
the long-tailed rats with an increase in their populations. This
report does not specify the species of hantavirus involved in this
case.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantaviruses and
their rodent hosts and their images that might be involved in this HPS
case are (from a list kindly provided by Dr Jim Mills):

- Laguna Negra (_Calomys laucha_
