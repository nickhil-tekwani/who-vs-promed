A Nueces County [Texas] man thought to have West Nile virus
[infection] actually had a much more rare mosquito-borne illness
[virus], St. Louis encephalitis [virus infection]. The man, who has
since recovered, is the 2nd person in the state this year [2010] to
contract the illness, which can cause brain inflammation, said Chris
Van Deusen, spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health
Services.

Since 1990, 74 people in Texas have tested positive for St. Louis
encephalitis [virus infection], according to state health department
records. In comparison, 758 people in the state have contracted West
Nile virus [infection] since 2003, the year after it was first
detected in Texas.

Unlike West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis comes in spurts, and
most years, there are no cases of the mosquito-borne [virus] disease
found in humans, according to state records. The last Texas death
from the virus was in 1995, Van Deusen said.

The Nueces County man, in his 60s, was hospitalized in late September
[2009] and the state confirmed he had West Nile virus [infection].
That test was a false positive, and state officials later confirmed
with a 2nd test that the man had St. Louis encephalitis. The Corpus
Christi-Nueces County Public Health District won't release further
details about the man because of privacy concerns.

Health officials said there is a 2nd case of St. Louis encephalitis
in a Nueces County resident, but that case is pending confirmation
from the state laboratory. Dr William Burgin, local health authority,
did not have more information about the patient's condition, and the
state declined to release information until the case is confirmed.

Since testing began on 3 May [2010], 6 pools of mosquitoes have
tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis [virus], but West Nile
virus has not been found in Nueces County mosquitoes this year
[2010]. "With cooler temperatures, mosquito activity will begin to
taper off," Burgin said "Residents should continue to use preventive
measures to help lower their risk."

More people die each year from West Nile virus than St. Louis
encephalitis because West Nile is more common, Van Deusen said. This
year, 5 people in Texas have died from West Nile [virus infection].
However, West Nile virus rarely causes symptoms in infected people,
and 80 percent of those who contract the illness don't feel sick,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many
people infected with St. Louis encephalitis [virus] also don't
experience symptoms, but the mortality rate from that disease can
range from 5-30 percent, with higher rates among elderly people.

There are no treatments for these illness, but doctors often provide
relief for symptoms, which can include headache, fever, and nausea,
Van Deusen said. Most people recover with rest, he said.

Precautions
-----------
Drain standing water around homes to reduce mosquito hatching
grounds; dress in pants and long sleeves when outside in
mosquito-infested areas; apply insect repellent that contains DEET
when outdoors. For infants younger than a year old, consult a
physician first; Stay indoors from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are
most active.

Symptoms
--------
Headache; irritability; lethargy; fever; joint pain; confusion and
hallucinations; personality changes; double vision; seizures; muscle
weakness; loss of sensation or paralysis in certain areas; tremors;
rash; loss of consciousness

When to see a doctor: altered levels of consciousness or
hallucinations; muscle weakness or loss of feeling; seizures; mental
disturbances. In infants, the key signs and symptoms include: body

[St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a flavivirus endemic in the
USA closely related to West Nile virus (WNV). This case underscores
the difficulty in distinguishing serologically between infections
with 2 closely related flaviviruses -- West Nile and St. Louis
encephalitis viruses. This report does not indicate which serological
tests were used for the initial and later confirmatory diagnosis in
this case. When West Nile virus first appeared in the USA, there was
speculation that in areas where SLE virus was endemic, it's presence
would prevent establishment of WNV, or alternatively, WMV would
displace SLEV because of their close antigenic and ecological
relationships. Obviously, that did not happen. SLEV is transmitted
from wild birds to humans by _Culex_ mosquitoes, and causes sporadic
outbreaks and scattered individual cases in areas where it is endemic.
