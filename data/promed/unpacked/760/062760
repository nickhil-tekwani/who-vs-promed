The health authorities of Cordoba and Sucre have reported 58 cases of dengue.
In the area of Shagun (Cordoba), the hospital of San Juan de Dios has
reported 44 suspicious cases 9 of which were positive and the remainder
are under study.
In the middle of April, a 6 year old girl from the neighborhood of El Bosque
died of hemorrhagic dengue. Recently in Cerete, another girl of 11 years of
age also died of the same disease.
In Sucre, 14 cases have been reported, 9 of which were in Sincelejo and the
rest in San Benito Abad, Toluviejo, Tolu, and Ovejas. Manolo Olivares,
Chief of Epidemiology of the Department of Social Security in Sucre,
expressed concern over the problem since they lack the resources (malathion,
etc.) needed to start a fumigation campaign. Nevertheless, the Department of
Social Security began work with the materials they have on hand to spray
those areas that are reporting cases of the disease.
Dengue has caused alarm in other parts of the country as well. In Huila, a
health alert was declared after reporting 100 cases in the Department during
the first six months of the year. Meanwhile in Cali, 48 cases have been
reported in the first six months as opposed to 18 cases in all of last year.
Authorities have recommended keeping water tanks covered, and getting rid of
any unused containers that could collect rainwater.
