No evident disease in deer die-off along Clinton River
------------------------------------------------------
About 20 dead deer found by kayakers and canoeists along a 6 mile stretch
of the Clinton River centered on Bloomer Park in Rochester, MI, were not
infected with chronic wasting disease or any other wildlife disease they
have been able to identify, Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials
said on Thursday [28 Aug 2008].

Tim Payne, a biologist for the DNR wildlife division in Southfield, said
the deer apparently started dying about 3 weeks ago but that no freshly
dead deer had been found in the past week. "We sent 3 of the (carcasses) to
our lab in Lansing, but only 1 of them was really fresh enough for a
definitive necropsy," Payne said. "2 people saw deer die in front of them.
Something obviously has affected them, but we don't know what it is yet."

The deaths preceded by a few days an announcement that chronic wasting
disease -- a fatal deer ailment previously unknown in Michigan -- had been
found in a deer on a private breeding ranch in Kent County. Injured deer
commonly develop fevers and stay near water after they have been hit by a
car or a bullet. But Tom Cooley, the DNR's epidemiological veterinarian,
said there was no evidence of those kinds of trauma in the deer he
necropsied. He said tests completed so far also have ruled out ailments
like CWD, eastern equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, several hemorrhagic
diseases and poisoning.

Cooley said the cause of death for 1 buck was clear -- a fractured skull.
"Some people saw it when it was still alive, and they saw it flip over
backwards into the river. It hit its head on a rock and fractured its skull
at the base of the antlers," he said. [In this case, the cause of death is
not of importance, but rather what neurological illness that made the buck
flip over in the first place? - Mod.TG]

Cooley said the necropsy showed that deer suffered from adhesions between
the lungs and chest cavity and also around the pericardial sack that
surrounds the heart, indicating that "he inhaled something and started a
bacterial infection that eventually killed him." [Inhalation may be a
premature assumption. Adhesions can result from a piece of wire passing
from one portion of the digestive system and through the heart. ­ Mod.TG]

DNR officials said they had sent tissue samples from the dead deer for
further tests in an effort to solve the mystery.

[We will be interested to learn of the diagnostic evaluation on a carcass
that sheds light on what is causing this situation. Epizootic hemorrhagic
disease would be on my differential list, except the article says it was
ruled out. ­ Mod.TG]
