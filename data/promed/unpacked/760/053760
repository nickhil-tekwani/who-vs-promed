HK to implement live chicken importation pilot scheme
-------------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government
announced Thursday the implementation of a pilot scheme on the
resumption of live chicken importation.
HKSAR Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food Yeoh Eng-kiong met with
Minister of the State General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) Li Changjiang on Thursday and
agreed that a pilot scheme on the resumption of importation of live
chickens from the mainland will start on 20 Apr 2004.
"Given that the outbreak situation in the mainland is now under
control and that surveillance has been stepped up, we proposed to
pilot the importation of live poultry in suitable quantity on a trial
basis in order to evaluate the new system before 12 May 2004," Yeoh
said.
The 1st phase of the pilot arrangement will last 3 days from 20 to 22
Apr 2004. Not more than 6000 live chickens will be imported per day.
23 to 25 Apr will be the rest days of the wholesale and retail
markets, and no live chickens would be imported. The government will
evaluate the 1st phase of importation within that period so as to
arrange importation in the 2nd phase.
Yeoh said if the results of the 1st phase are satisfactory, the
government would consider gradually increasing the daily quantities
of imported live poultry on a step-by-step basis.
Yeoh said that officials of the Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department had visited a number of mainland registered farms
supplying live poultry to Hong Kong.
"The recent visits to the mainland registered farms indicated that
the farms have adopted the necessary precautionary measures to
prevent the occurrence of avian influenza and instituted appropriate
surveillance programs to detect the presence of H5N1 virus.
Moreover, all birds to be exported to Hong Kong will have to be
segregated from other birds for 5 days before export. The
consignments arriving in Hong Kong at the initial stage of the
resumption of importation will be subject to the hold-and-test
arrangement. These consignments will be released to the market only
if they test H5 avian influenza-free in the screening test," Yeoh
said.
Li Changjiang said that the central government has been paying much
attention to the avian flu issue, and took corresponding measures to
control the disease during the outbreak in certain areas.
Li reaffirmed that all the mainland registered farms supplying live
poultry to Hong Kong had remained avian influenza-free.
[This is an interesting, detailed pilot plan combining -- at least,
on the recipient's, HK side -- sensible sanitary measures backed by
laboratory-based follow-up. Details on those tests could be of
interest. It could also be useful to note whether sampling and
laboratory tests are required also from the exporting farms in
mainland China. - Mod.AS]

Kyoto farms get clean bird-flu bill of health
---------------------------------------------
The Kyoto Prefectural Government at midnight Monday [12 Apr 2004]
lifted a ban on shipments of chickens and eggs by poultry farms
located within 5 km of a farm hit by bird flu in February 2004.
The end of the ban came 21 days after completion of all necessary
measures stipulated in the farm ministry's manual on epidemic
prevention.
On Tuesday, Kyoto Governor Keiji Yamada visited the town of Tanba, where
the outbreak occurred, and conveyed his thanks to town officials for
their cooperation in containing the disease.
He expressed appreciation to Tanba Mayor Yoshio Yokoyama during a
meeting at the town office, and he met with some 100 residents who
volunteered to help in the cleanup process.
"(The prefecture) will make every effort so that the town can return
to its original prosperity," he said.
The bird flu virus was discovered at Asada Nosan Co.'s Funai farm in
Tanba after the prefectural government conducted inspections 27 Feb
2004 following an anonymous tip on mass chicken deaths. 2 days later, the
prefectural government imposed a ban on the transportation of chickens and
eggs from farms within a 30km radius of the farm. Around 225 000 chickens at
the Funai farm and about 15 000 chickens at another infected farm in Tanba
were slaughtered and buried.
Yamada also visited the other farm, run by Kenshiro Takada, and
expressed his gratitude for the farmer's swift notification to
authorities of the deaths of his birds. Takada, for his part, requested
financial assistance to help rebuild his farm. The governor said the matter
would be looked into.
On 1 Apr 2004, the ban was eased from 30km to 5km from the Funai
farm after local officials found no further infections.
Hideaki Asada, 41, president of Asada Nosan Co., and 2 farm officials
have been arrested on suspicion of failing to report the chicken
deaths in violation of a law to prevent infectious diseases among
livestock and poultry.
