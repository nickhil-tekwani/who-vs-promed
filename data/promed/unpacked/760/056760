After malaria, dengue and swine flu, now the residents of the tricity also need to watch out for scrub typhus, warn doctors. [Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula are collectively referred to as the Tricity.] A fever known to only spread in the hill regions has now started spreading to the plains as well owing to various climatic reasons. The scrub typhus patients earlier only found in hilly regions of the Himalayas including Shimla, Assam, West Bengal are now reporting at PGI [Postgraduate Institute, Chandigarh] from Chandigarh, Panchkula, and the surrounding areas.

"This year [2012] in August and September, 62 blood samples were received from adults as well as children in PGI. Out of these, 50 were found positive for scrub typhus by Weil Felix assay," says Dr Sunil Sethi, Department of Medical Microbiology, PGIMER [Postgraduate Institute of medical Education and Research]. Most of the patients had fever, cough, and myalgia, he adds.

Says Dr Rajesh Kumarm, head of the Department of Community Medicine, PGIMER, "There can be various reasons for the disease to spread here in [the] plains. First, there are climatic changes. Secondly, the agricultural practices in Punjab and Haryana have also changed and the habitat may have been conducive for the mite to breed here and thus find a favourable habitat. Also, residents keep migrating from one place to another and someone infected with the disease came in contact of the mite here and then the infection spread from one mite to another. Indeed it is an unusual finding in the past few years."

The disease recently took lives of 14 patients from different regions in Himachal Pradesh, says Dr Ramesh, deputy medical superintendent, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla. "At present, we have 30 patients admitted to the hospital, and on average, we had been receiving over 100 cases a day from various districts of Himachal Pradesh in our hospital in the past couple of days," he adds.

Explaining its health complications, Dr Sethi says severe scrub typhus usually presents as multiple-organ damage including carditis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hepatitis, renal failure. encephalitis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and septic shock.

The disease is caused by bacteria known as _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that live primarily in mites (the primary reservoir) belonging to the species _Leptotrombidium akamushi_ (chigger mite).

The infection is called scrub typhus because it generally occurs after exposure to areas with secondary (scrub) vegetation. It has recently been found, however, that the disease can also be prevalent in such areas as sandy beaches, mountain deserts, and equatorial rain forests, according to Dr Sethi.

Human beings are infected accidentally, usually during the rainy season. [An eschar is formed on the site of the mite bite.] It resembles a skin burn caused by a cigarette butt. The lesions are painless and without any itching sensation in most cases, causing the infection to be undetected by most patients.

_Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is the cause of scrub typhus, is transmitted by the bite of a chigger. Chiggers are the 6-legged juvenile form (larvae) of the 8-legged mite. More mature stages of the mite are not parasitic and feed on plant materials. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf).

Chandigarh, a city with a population of almost 1 million, is located near the foothills of the Shivalik range of the Himalayas in northwest India; the city serves as the capital of 2 states, Haryana to the south and Punjab to the north (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh). The surrounding districts are of Panchkula and Ambala in Haryana and Mohali, Patiala, and Roopnagar in Punjab. Chandigarh has a humid subtropical climate characterized by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall, and great variation in temperature (-1 to 41.2 deg C, or 30.2 to 106.2 deg F).
