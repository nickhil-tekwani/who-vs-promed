Health officials are frantically searching for the source of a fresh wave of Legionnaires' disease today, as 15 people are hospitalised - with two in a critical condition. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said all of those affected in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, are aged between their late 40s and mid-70s. The number of confirmed cases has been steadily rising since news of the outbreak on Tuesday. Two of the patients are in a critical condition and are being treated in separate hospitals.

A spokesman for University Hospital of North Staffordshire said: "The Trust is currently treating 14 patients confirmed with Legionnaires' Disease; 13 patients are in a stable or improving condition, one person is in a critical condition."

A spokesman for Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, said: "We are treating a patient transferred from the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, confirmed with Legionnaires' Disease, who is in a critical but stable condition."

Public and environmental health experts from the HPA, the Health and Safety Executive, the NHS [National Health Service] in Stoke and Stoke-on-Trent City Council continue to work together to identify and investigate possible sources.

Professor Harsh Duggal, director of the Health Protection Agency's Health Protection Unit in Stafford, said: "Our investigation into possible sources continues. We have sampled and disinfected potential sources of exposure but people can develop symptoms up to two weeks after being exposed to _Legionella_ so we are not surprised by these new cases. We continue to map the outbreak and work with our partners to pinpoint possible sources, using the information we have gathered."

The HPA said the outbreak is not hospital-related and the hospital is a safe environment for visitors. Anyone feeling unwell with any of the possible signs is advised to go and see their doctor, ring NHS Direct on 0845 4647, or click here.
The HPA stressed that there is no need for anyone who is well or only mildly unwell to see their doctor or to have any tests.

One person has died after an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Staffordshire, officials have said. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) also confirmed another case of the disease in Stoke-on-Trent, bringing the total number to 16.

A spokesman for the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS), where most of the patients are being treated, said most were stable or improving. A patient in a Leicester hospital is in a critical but stable condition. The HPA said it would not be giving out any further details of the patient, who died earlier, and also said it would await a cause of death from the coroner. A spokeswoman said all those who had been affected were aged between their late 40s and mid-70s. A hospital spokeswoman said the trust is currently treating 11 patients, all of whom are in a stable or improving condition. Three patients have been discharged. The patient in the Leicester hospital had been transferred from the UHNS earlier.

The HPA has previously said it was continuing to work with the Health and Safety Executive, the NHS in Stoke-on-Trent and the city council to try and find the source of the outbreak. It said the disease was not hospital-related and it was safe for patients to attend the UHNS.

There are more cases and one death, but we still have not been given any information on the epidemiology of this outbreak of Legionnaires' disease or its possible source.

Staffordshire is a landlocked county in the West Midlands region of England, with a population of 1 047 380 (2001) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staffordshire). Stoke-on-Trent, the largest city in Staffordshire, was known for its pottery industry but is now a center for service industries and distribution centers (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke-on-Trent).
