Test results show 4 more positive for CCHF
------------------------------------------
A total of 4 more people have been diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) at Ayub Medical Complex, Abbottabad. Reports received from
National Institute of Health (NIH) on Tue 12 Oct 2010 confirmed that the
patients were suffering from CCHF. Ironically, all 4 patients were
discharged a few days ago and the hospital is unaware of their whereabouts.

Talking to the Express Tribune, deputy medical superintendent (DMS) Dr
Junaid said the hospital had sent 8 blood samples to National Institute of
Health, 4 of which tested positive for CCHF [virus infection]. He said the
4 patients had been admitted in medical ward A of Ayub Medical Complex
Hospital but were discharged a few days ago because "their condition did
not seem serious".

The hospital administration does not have addresses of the patients,
however, he said that 2 of them belonged to Mansehra, one was from Rajoya
village in Havalian, while the whereabouts of the [3rd and] 4th patients
are unknown. Sources inside the hospital said the pathology department was
responsible for maintaining records of these patients. They said a young
resident medical officer (RMO) of ATH [Ayub Teaching Hospital] died of the
disease a few days back. Since [the doctor's death] the hospital received
16 patients suspected [to have contracted] CCHF and their blood samples
were sent to NIH for tests. All these patients were admitted in the
hospital's medical ward A and later discharged, sources said.

The ATH administration has constituted a team including DMS Dr Junaid,
Professor Dr Shamim Anwar and Professor Dr Javed, who, after holding a
meeting with a World Health Organization representative, have established
quarantine measures for CCHF patients in the ATH and arranged 500
protective kits. "Beside lab procedures, early identification of the
disease is very important," said Dr Athar Lodhi, director of IPP [sorry, we
do not know what this stands for. - Mod.SH] and Planning at ATH.

[A] quarantine area to treat such patients has been established next to the
IPP ward, which is putting other patients at risk. "I have requested the
chief executive of the hospital to shift the quarantine to a safer
location," he added.

[In contrast to the situation at the Holy Family Hospital in Rawalpindi the
5 cases (an RMO and 4 patients) at the Ayub Teaching hospital in Abbottabad
appear to have been confirmed by diagnostic testing at the National
Institute of Health. Other suspected CCHF cases still await confirmation.
Apart from the deceased RMO, none of the confirmed and suspected cases
seems to be seriously ill.

However this press report reveals serious lapses in record keeping and
infection control procedures at the Ayub Teaching Hospital and the extent
and source of the CCHF outbreak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North West)
province remains uncertain.
