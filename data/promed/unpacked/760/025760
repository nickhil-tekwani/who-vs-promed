OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION
State veterinarians confirmed Wednesday that at least one cow found dead
near Billings recently died from anthrax.
The first cow suspected to have anthrax died sometime in the last two
weeks, state veterinarian Tom Linfield said. It was during calving season,
and the rancher was spending a lot of time with the animals. The cow was
found dead. More animals started dying unexpectedly, and the rancher called
his veterinarian, Dr. Mark Robinson, who conducted a necropsy on one of the
cows. Robinson later called Linfield, who called in another veterinarian
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia,
USA. Linfield said he was at the ranch this weekend to investigate the
deaths. Seven other cows also died, but Linfield couldn't confirm whether
the seven died of anthrax.
Linfield refused to say who owned the cows or exactly where the outbreak
occurred. He did confirm, however, the cows died on a ranch along lower
Pryor Creek east of Billings. "We're alerting local veterinarians in Big
Horn, Carbon and Yellowstone counties," said Tom Linfield, of the state
veterinarian's office in Helena.
The ground where the cows died has been burned and fenced off, Linfield
said. The carcasses have been buried, and workers sprayed a chemical
disinfectant over the area. The rest of the herd has been vaccinated and is
under state quarantine for 42 days, Linfield said.
In addition, all people who came into contact with the dead animals are
taking antibiotics, said Dr. Todd Damrow, the state's epidemiologist with
the state's Department of Public Health and Human services. Officials
wouldn't say how many people were taking the antibiotics. "They may not
have developed the disease, anyway," Damrow said. "We're treating them
preventatively." Officials believe the outbreak has been contained and that
human beings are not at risk. The last recorded human case of anthrax in
Montana was in 1961.
The last recorded case of an animal with anthrax in the state was in 1985.
Knowledge of whose cows died from anthrax could hurt the rancher when he
tries to sell his cows, Linfield said. That's one reason the state would
not identify the quarantined area. They also wanted to keep would-be
terrorists from trying to dig up the animals to use the spores in
weapon-making.
Jim Peterson, executive vice-president with the Montana Stockgrowers
Association, said he was content with the state's efforts to contain the
disease. He didn't expect any economic hardships from the news. "I don't
see any significant impact," Petersen said. Other ranchers were not so
confident.
[I spoke with Tom Linfield who told me that they had only one carcass to
examine as the animals were promptly buried by the rancher. The disease has
not been reported in this part of the state ever, so the source is unknown;
the disease is not usually seen this far west. His only comment was that
the herd had been seen drinking recently from surface puddles of water.
Also no bleeding was noted from the bodies, though one animal had some
blood around its eyes. In spite of what one reads in the textbooks,
bleeding from orifaces is not pathognomic for this disease. We are getting
reports of anthrax being diagnosed from non-hemorrhaging carcasses. This
could well be why the diagnosis is missed when blood is expected. It will
be interesting to discover on further interviews whether the rancher
recalls similar sporadic deaths in previous years.
When possible, it is better to burn carcasses than bury them.
For those interested, livestock anthrax has been reported in the following
Montana counties:
Phillips: 1917-18, 1930, 1961
Richland: 1917, 1920, 1957
Sheriden & Roosevelt: 1920
Carter: 1943
Fallon: 1944
McCone: 1961, 1985: - Martin Hugh-Jones
