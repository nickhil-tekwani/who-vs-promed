A clade B strain of _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB) was tied to a healthcare-associated outbreak that led to 6 patient deaths. Clade B is characterized by extensive drug resistance. It is also hypervirulent, and experts warn it warrants continued investigation and increased surveillance.

Crystal L. Jones, MD, from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland, and colleagues published their outbreak report online 29 Mar [2015] in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1]. The outbreak investigation included clinical and microbiological data as well as comparative genomics and animal models of virulence.

Instead of using the more common multilocus sequence typing (MLST) assay, the investigators used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for clade B strains. "The [MLST] assay is useful for epidemiologic surveillance, especially if all that they have available is MLST for genetic fingerprinting ... but it can't distinguish this strain/clade from other closely related strains," explained senior author Emil P. Lesho, MD, also from Walter Reed Army Institute, in an email to Medscape Medical News.

AB is a known cause of healthcare-associated infections. There have been previous reports of higher-virulence healthcare-associated AB isolates. The clade B strain is noteworthy because it is not only highly virulent but also very resistant to antibiotics.

"[_Acinetobacter_] is usually not a high-virulence pathogen, in that it mainly affects patients who are substantially immune compromised and very sick. It is unusual to see a strain that is very resistant and very virulent," explained Dr Lesho.

"A key finding of our work was that AB strains that are genetically closely related may show significant differences in virulence, suggesting that small genomic changes can profoundly affect virulence. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report leveraging comparative genomics, animal models, and a surveillance network with isolate repository to characterize an emerging clade of [extensively drug-resistant]-AB associated with a fatal outbreak in patients not severely immunocompromised," the authors write.

In an accompanying editorial, David L. Paterson, MD, PhD, and Patrick N.A. Harris, MD, from the University of Queensland Centre for Clinical Research in Brisbane, Australia, agree that the significance of the outbreak report lies in the fact that AB infection killed patients who had relatively minor underlying disease [2]. The study also suggests that assumptions about AB pathogenicity may be misplaced.

"Our current understanding of _A. baumannii_ pathogenicity is primarily based on mutagenesis studies using reference strains ATCC 19606 and ATCC 17978, which were isolated over 50 years ago. Considering the ease with which _A. baumannii_ can alter its genetic structure and acquire resistance or virulence determinants, these models of AB pathogenesis may have limited clinical relevance," write Dr Jones and colleagues.

The investigators propose that the potential virulence gene structures may provide insights into path-adaptation and evolutionary relationship of the clade B strain. They also report that the host response to the pathogen is a driver of virulence and outcomes.

[Infections due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter_ strains, especially _Acinetobacter baumannii_, have been well described in critically ill, hospitalized patients and in soldiers severely injured in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Medscape report refers to an article published recently online (1). The article concerns an outbreak that occurred at a tertiary care facility in the Northwest US and involved 6 patients with fatal hospital-acquired extensively drug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB) infection. All 6 patients had at least one previous hospital admission in the prior 90 days; but were said to be "relatively immunocompetent patients (low co-morbidity and illness severity scores)", and none had recently traveled outside the US prior to their terminal hospitalization.

"Abstract
---------
Background. Severe _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB) infections in immunocompetent patients are uncommon, and the virulence mechanisms of this organism are not fully understood.

Methods. Following an outbreak of fatal AB infections in a cohort of relatively immunocompetent patients (low co-morbidity and illness severity scores), isolates were investigated with comparative genomics and in animal models.

Results. Two unrelated AB clades were associated with the outbreak. The clone associated with the majority of patient deaths, Clade B, is evolutionarily distinct from the 3 international clonal complexes, belongs to multi-locus sequence type (MLST)-10, and is most closely related to strains isolated from the Czech Republic, California, and Germany in 1994, 1997, and 2003, respectively. In 2 different murine models, Clade B isolates were more virulent than comparator strains, including the highly virulent reference strain AB5075. The most virulent Clade B derivative, MRSN 16897 was isolated from the patient with the lowest combined comorbidity/illness-severity score. Clade B isolates possess a unique combination of putative virulence genes involved in iron metabolism, protein secretion, and glycosylation, which was leveraged to develop a rapid and specific clinical assay to detect this clade that cannot be distinguished by MLST.

Conclusion. Clade B warrants continued surveillance and investigation."
