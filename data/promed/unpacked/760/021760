The Vermont Health Department says the state [is] on track for the highest number of cases of a tick-borne disease called anaplasmosis. According to health officials, anaplasmosis is transmitted by the black-legged tick, the very same one that spreads Lyme disease. "Anaplasmosis is a serious illness, and we're seeing more of it in Vermont," said Bradley Tompkins, infectious disease epidemiologist.

Officials say 133 cases of anaplasmosis have been reported in Vermont so far this year [2016]; last year less than 6 were reported.

According to health officials anaplasmosis symptoms can include fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches. Officials say anaplasmosis can be treated with antibiotics; antibiotics work best if it's caught early. The health department says over 1/3 of people with anaplasmosis need to be hospitalized.

The department says the best form of defense is to avoid tick bites and offers the following tips. REPEL 足 Before you go outside, apply an EPA-registered insect repellent on your skin and treat your clothes with permethrin. When possible, wear light-colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and tuck your pants into your socks to keep ticks from your skin. INSPECT 足 Do daily tick checks on yourself, your children, and pets. REMOVE 足 Remove ticks right away. Showering within 2 hours of coming indoors has also been proven effective in washing ticks off the skin before they attach. Put clothing in the dryer on hot heat for 10 minutes to kill remaining ticks. WATCH 足 If you were bitten by a tick, watch for signs of disease during the weeks following the bite. Early signs of anaplasmosis include fever, headache, chills, and muscle aches, and usually occur within one to 2 weeks of a tick bite. Call your health care provider if you experience these symptoms.

[An increased incidence of anaplasmosis can be due to either a true increase in the number of cases as the primary vector and the reservoir hosts spread geographically into previously uninvolved regions, or to better recognition and reporting of anaplasmosis.

_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), is transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) that transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease and _Babesia microti_, the causative agent of babesiosis. Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of the nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/. Patients may be concurrently co-infected by these pathogens.

Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness onset occurs 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick. Initial presentation typically includes sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, and the disease can be fatal. Severe infections can include prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, hemorrhages, and death.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ are found in the blood stream, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8. October 2008 [date cited] Available from http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for 10 days for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease, but is not effective therapy for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_. - Mod.ML
