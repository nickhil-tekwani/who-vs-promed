A comment
--------------
In a comment on tick-borne encephalitis (Tick-borne encephalitis -
Austria, archive no. 20090201.0450), the moderator notes that the CDC
(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Special Pathogens
website separates Russian spring-summer encephalitis virus from
tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Although a new subdivision of
the virus species into 4 subtypes has been suggested (1), the
currently accepted classification (ICTVdB - The Universal Virus
Database, version 3. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/>)
does not separate TBEV into 2 species, but lists 3 subtypes:
European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. The 3 subtypes have mortality
rates of 1-2 percent, 6-8 percent, and 20-60 percent, respectively
indicating that there are important differences among them (2).
Occasionally infection may persist, particularly with the Siberian
subtype. Despite their names, all 3 subtypes co-circulate throughout
most of the TBEV endemic areas. However, currently the Siberian
subtype dominates in many endemic regions from Eastern Europe to
Eastern Siberia.

The moderator also notes "Vertical transmission from an infected
mother to fetus has occurred." Vertical transmission in laboratory
animals has recently been demonstrated to be widespread (3). TBEV was
detected for 5 generations in small rodents without involvement of
arthropod vectors. Such transmission way may favor the selection of
mammal-adapted variants of the virus more virulent for humans.
