Idaho health officials confirmed on Thu, 5 Oct 2006, a toddler who died in
Sep 2006 from kidney failure had been infected by the _E. coli_ strain
responsible for a nationwide wave of food poisoning linked to tainted spinach.
The 2-year-old boy, from Chubbuck, Idaho, who died on 20 Sep 2006, was the
2nd confirmed fatality of the _E. coli_ bacteria outbreak that has sickened
192 people in the USA and one person in Canada, said Ross Mason, a
spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
An elderly woman in Wisconsin who died on 7 Sep 2006 was the 1st confirmed
death from the outbreak.
"His parents had given him a smoothie of yogurt and spinach," Mason said,
noting the boy then became severely ill and died about a week later.

The death of an elderly Nebraska woman has been linked to an outbreak of
_E. coli_ from tainted spinach, state health officials said Fri, 6 Oct 2006.
Laboratory tests and DNA fingerprinting confirmed the death was from the
O157:H7 strain of _E. coli_, the state Health and Human Services System
said. The woman died in late Aug 2006, said spokeswoman Marla Augustine. 2
other deaths -- a Wisconsin adult and a 2-year-old Idaho boy -- have also
been determined to be from the _E. coli_ outbreak.
The state of Maryland has been investigating what federal officials have
called a "suspect case," an elderly woman who died 13 Sep 2006 after
consuming fresh spinach. Although _E. coli_ was found in her body, DNA
fingerprinting to confirm it was linked to the spinach has not been
possible, the CDC said.
