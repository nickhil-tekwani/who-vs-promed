[West Nile virus surveillance reports are up-dated to Fri 3 Nov 2000. Among
the WNV-positive mosquitoes reported from Pennsylvania was a pool of _Aedes
albopictus_. This is the first time _A. albopictus_, known as the Asian
tiger mosquito, has been found WNV-positive in the United States. The
number of human cases remains at 18 with one death. One of the 18 cases,
the human case in Connecticut, experienced headache only and does not meet
the full clinical case definition established by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention - Mod.CP

On 31 Oct 2000, the State of Connecticut announced 8 additional birds from
6 new towns positive for West Nile Virus (WNV). The birds were collected
from 25 Sep - 17 Oct 2000 from the towns of: Avon (1 crow), Derby (2
crows), East Granby (1 crow), Essex (1 crow), Haddam (2 crows), and
Portland (1 crow). No spraying is planned. Residents are asked to reduce
their exposure to mosquito bites until a hard frost occurs in the area.

On 1 Nov 2000 State Health Officials announced the isolation of West Nile
virus in a robin from Candia, collected on 16 Sep 2000. The robin was
tested at the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services' Public
Health Laboratories in September. Due to inconclusive laboratory results,
the specimen was sent to the CDC in Atlanta, and the CDC laboratory results
confirming the isolation were received on 31 Oct 2000. To date 438 New
Hampshire birds have been received for testing for the virus. This robin,
the 7th New Hampshire bird with the virus, is the first non-crow species to
test positive in the state.

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 54 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 35 were negative, 14 are pending and
1 individual declined testing. These individuals either had symptoms or
signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of
the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with
the virus have been discovered. New Jersey's positive human cases include
an 82-year old Little Falls man who became ill September 3, was admitted to
a hospital 3 days later, and died September 14. New Jersey's other human
cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man, a 54-year old man with dual
residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park, Bergen County, and a
72-year old Bayonne woman. All 3 individuals have either recovered or are
recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, the Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton has
accepted 2 046 birds for testing. A total of 1 122 birds (1 119 crows, a
blue jay, a great horned owl and a cockatiel) found in 18 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Atlantic (3), Bergen (196, including a great horned owl), Burlington (15),
Camden (10), Cape May (5, including a blue jay), Essex (105), Gloucester
(5), Hudson (64), Hunterdon (6), Mercer (11), Middlesex (228), Monmouth
(158, including a cockatiel), Morris (57), Ocean (24), Passaic (85), Salem
(1), Somerset (38) and Union (111) Counties. In addition, avian testing
conducted by the New Jersey Division of Fish & Wildlife has detected WNV in
wild bird specimens in 8 counties. Positive birds have been found in Bergen
(1 merlin & 1 red-tailed hawk), Cape May (1 American kestrel), Gloucester
(1 red-tailed hawk), Hudson (1 crow), Middlesex (1 blue jay), Monmouth (1
red-tailed hawk), Passaic (1 crow), and Union (1 crow, 1 Cooper's hawk, and
1 blue jay) Counties.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing
A total of 53 mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon
(1), Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Ocean (1), Passaic (11), Sussex (6),
Union (1), and Warren (3) Counties have tested positive for the presence of
WNV. In total, 14 329 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been
collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by
the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples are taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all
21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture for the
presence of WNV. To date, 4 chickens, stationed in Essex, Middlesex, Morris
and Sussex Counties, have tested positive for WNV. The National Veterinary
Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed the test results.
Horse Testing
A total of 26 horses from Atlantic (3), Bergen (1), Burlington (2), Cape
May (1), Gloucester (1), Hunterdon (2), Middlesex (1), Monmouth (8), Ocean
(2), Salem (2) and Sussex (3) Counties have tested positive for WNV. Equine
testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal
health laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to NVSL for confirmation.
A total of 7 horse deaths have been attributed to the virus.
Late Season Surveillance & Testing Plans
As mosquito season draws to a close and the potential for WNV infection
ends, statewide surveillance and testing activities for the year will be
discontinued. Active human surveillance (a weekly hospital reporting system
of suspect human cases) stopped 31 Oct 2000, and state lab testing for WNV
in humans will end Nov. 30. Crow submissions from northern and central
counties (including Mercer and Monmouth) ended 31 Oct 2000, while
submissions from southern counties will continue through the end of
November. Routine WNV mosquito surveillance for the season has been
discontinued. County government agencies, however, will continue
appropriate surveillance for general mosquito control.

There were 24 more equine clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection
confirmed during the period. Included are the first three equine cases of
clinical WNV infection ever detected in Delaware (Kent County). Of the
other 21 horses, 1 was from Connecticut (Hartford County), 12 from New
Jersey (Atlantic, Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth,
Salem, and Sussex counties), and 8 from New York (Nassau, Orange, and
Suffolk counties). This brings to 53 the total number of equine cases of
WNV infection in 2000, of which 31 survived and 22 (42%) died or were
euthanatized.
The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) found 23 of the horses
to be WNV-positive on a 1:100 dilution (or greater) of serum on IgM-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All 23 of those also had
WNV-positive results on a 1:10 dilution (greater) of serum on a
plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). One of the 23 horses also had
WNV-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on IgM-capture ELISA and brain
tissue positive for WNV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 24th horse
had PRNT results that showed more than a 4-fold change in titer in 2
different serum samples, positive at 1:10 and at 1:100 or greater.

The European Union previously issued import restrictions for horses
originating from 5 States with equine cases of WNV (Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island). These restrictions have
now been amended to include the State of Pennsylvania and to reduce, from
50 km to 30 km, the distance around a clinical equine case in which a
resident horse may be affected by the restrictions. No other countries have
notified USDA-APHIS of any WNV-related restrictions on the importation of
horses.
No new human cases of WNV infection were reported. The total number of
human cases for the year 2000 is now 18, including one death. (Note: the
clinical illness associated with the human case in Connecticut [headache
only does not meet the full clinical case definition established by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, that "case" is still
included in the total count given here.)
There were no other mammals reported as WNV-positive during the period.
There were 410 more birds reported as positive for WNV. The first
confirmation of WNV activity in North Carolina (Chatham County) was
reported when a dead crow collected on 27 Sep 2000 tested positive for WNV.
Over 4 000 birds have now been documented as infected with WNV in 11 States
plus the District of Columbia in the year 2000.
There were no new sentinel birds confirmed as WNV-positive. The total
number of sentinel chickens found WNV-positive in 2000 stands at 6.
A total of 7 new counties in 2 States reported at least one WNV-positive
mosquito pool: New Jersey (Ocean, Warren) and Pennsylvania (Cumberland,
Montgomery, Pike, Susquehanna, York). Among the WNV-positive mosquitoes
reported from Pennsylvania was a pool of _Aedes albopictus_. This is the
first time _A. albopictus_, known as the Asian tiger mosquito, has been
found WNV-positive in the United States. Experimental studies have shown
this species to be a potentially efficient transmitter of WNV. A total of
56 new positive mosquito pools were reported overall, bringing the total
for this year to 445.
A total of 135 counties in 12 States and the District of Columbia have had
confirmed findings of WNV in a mosquito, bird, or mammal, since 1 May 2000:
Connecticut (8), Delaware (1), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (8),
Massachusetts (11), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (20), New York (61),
North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (15), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (1), and
Virginia (2).
A total of 126 counties have detected at least one positive wild bird, and
108 counties in 8 States and the District of Columbia have reported 2 or
more confirmed findings of WNV-positive birds: Connecticut (8), District of
Columbia (1), Maryland (6), Massachusetts (8), New Hampshire (2), New
Jersey (17), New York (56), Pennsylvania (6), and Rhode Island (4).
Sussex County, New Jersey, has had WNV-positive horses (3), mosquito pools
(6), and a sentinel chicken, but no WNV-positive wild birds detected.
Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, has had a WNV-positive horse and mosquito
pools (2), but no WNV-positive wild birds detected. Kent County, Delaware,
has had WNV-positive horses (3), but no WNV-positive mosquito pools nor
wild birds detected.
A total of 29 counties in 5 States have now had at least one wild bird and
at least one mosquito pool reported as positive: Connecticut (Fairfield,
New Haven), Massachusetts (Norfolk, Suffolk), New Jersey (Bergen, Essex,
Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Passaic, Union), New York (Bronx,
Columbia, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens, Richmond, Rockland,
Suffolk, Westchester), and Pennsylvania (Chester, Cumberland, Lehigh,
Montgomery, Philadelphia City, York).
The following list summarises all WNV-positive findings from 1 May through
31 Oct 2000: 18 humans, 53 equines, 26 other mammals, 4 044 birds, 445
mosquito pools, and 6 sentinel birds. [The USDA summary provides a
breakdown of the data by State and County.

West Nile Virus Emergency Declared in New Jersey, USA
-----------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: On Wed 1 Nov 2000, President Clinton declared that an emergency
exists in New Jersey and ordered federal aid for the area affected by West
Nile virus since 5 Aug 200. The President's action authorizes the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to provide up to $5 million to local
governments to help protect life, property and public health and safety in
21 counties. The counties covered by the declaration are: Atlantic, Bergen,
Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson,
Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Salem,
Somerset, Sussex, Union and Warren.
Last year, 7 people died and 55 others were infected in the New York
metropolitan area during the first known appearance of the virus in the
Western Hemisphere. Its first [and so far only victim this year was an
82-year-old from New Jersey.
