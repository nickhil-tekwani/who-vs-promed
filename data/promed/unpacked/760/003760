Researchers at the University of Virginia say they have found a high correlation between meat allergies and tick bites. Dr. Scott Commins tells KRMG more than 90 percent of patients they've identified with the allergy to mammalian meats have also reported a history of tick bites. The catch: The study hasn't been able to determine just how the ticks might be passing the meat allergy along to their human hosts.

Commins says several types of ticks can apparently pass along the allergy, although some research indicates the Lone Star tick is especially inclined to do so. That's not good news for Oklahoma, which has a large tick population, many of them Lone Star ticks.

Commins says symptoms of the allergy can range from a mild itch with perhaps a hive or 2, to anaphylactic shock which must be treated with epinephrine. He did say they have no confirmed fatalities from the allergy so far. Many of the tick bite victims who reported the meat allergy say their tick bites were obvious. "Most of the patients in our studies will tell us the site where the tick bit them is really inflamed and itchy, and maybe even has like a hard knot under there." Commins told KRMG.

Preventing the problem means preventing tick bites, which requires a combination of smart outdoor habits and a good repellent containing Deet. The Centers for Disease Control has an excellent page on preventing tick bites (http://www.cdc.gov/Features/StopTicks/), and treating for ticks that have already attached themselves.

Some good news: Commins says they believe that the meat allergy will eventually lessen and perhaps go away entirely -- assuming the patient avoids further tick bites.

[The relevant study was published last year: Commins SP, James HR, Kelly LA, et al: The relevance of tick bites to the production of IgE antibodies to the mammalian oligosaccharide galactose-Î±-1,3-galactose. J Allerg Clin Immunol. 2011;127: 1286-1293.

Abstract:
-Background:
In 2009, we reported a novel form of delayed anaphylaxis to red meat that is related to serum IgE antibodies to the galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal). Most of these patients had tolerated meat for many years previously. The implication is that some exposure in adult life had stimulated the production of these IgE antibodies.

-Objectives
We sought to investigate possible causes of this IgE antibody response, focusing on evidence related to tick bites, which are common in the region where these reactions occur.

-Methods
Serum assays were carried out with biotinylated proteins and extracts bound to a streptavidin ImmunoCAP.

-Results
Prospective studies on IgE antibodies in 3 subjects after tick bites showed an increase in levels of IgE to alpha-gal of 20-fold or greater. Other evidence included (1) a strong correlation between histories of tick bites and levels of IgE to alpha-gal (P less than .001), (2) evidence that these IgE antibodies are common in areas where the tick _Amblyomma americanum_ is common, and (3) a significant correlation between IgE antibodies to alpha-gal and IgE antibodies to proteins derived from _A. americanum_ (rs = 0.75, P less than .001).

-Conclusion
The results presented here provide evidence that tick bites are a cause, possibly the only cause, of IgE specific for alpha-gal in this area of the USA. Both the number of subjects becoming sensitized and the titer of IgE antibodies to alpha-gal are striking. Here we report the 1st example of a response to an ectoparasite giving rise to an important form of food allergy.

It has been known for several decades that an immunological reaction occurs to tick salivary antigens in animals fed on by the tick. Indeed, a large amount of research has been published regarding the protection of humans and animals from tick-borne diseases by immunization with tick antigens which may block the ability of the tick to transmit infection (for a review, see: Lee R, Opdebeeck JP: Arthropod vaccines, in New Vaccines and New Vaccine Technologies, Lutwick LI (ed), Infect Dis N Am 1999;13: 209-226.

This study came about related to the monoclonal antibody cetuximab, which is specific for epidermal growth factor receptor, which was approved for use in treating cancer in 2005. Subsequently, it became clear that a significant number of treated patients were experiencing severe hypersensitivity reactions during their 1st infusion of this monoclonal antibody. Those reports appeared to be restricted to an area of the southeastern USA, including Tennessee, North Carolina, Arkansas, Virginia, and the southern half of Missouri. In 2007, a detailed investigation of serum antibodies established that these reactions were occurring in patients who had preexisting IgE antibodies specific for the glycosylation on the Fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody. The relevant oligosaccharide was found to be galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), which is a blood group substance of nonprimate mammals.
Of note, the known distribution of the immediate reactions to cetuximab was similar to the areas with high prevalence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and human ehrlichiosis. The authors of the paper became aware of patients who thought that reactions to red meat started after receiving multiple tick bites and were informed that several allergists had reported to their local allergy meetings about patients who had become allergic to meat after experiencing multiple tick bites.

Diseases linked to _A. americanum_ include erlichiosis, tularemia and STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/).
