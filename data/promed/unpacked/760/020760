From: Paul Millikin <millikin@mtco.com>

Is it within the purview of this group to ask how two H3N2 influenza
strains differ from each other immunologically? I refer to
A/Nanchang/933/95, this year's vaccine strain, and A/Sydney/05/97, which
seems to be cropping up fairly regularly.
Any comments or references?
Are the H3 molecules or the N2 molecules different in the two strains, or
is the difference somewhere else?

[Yes, the strains may be assumed to differ in the H3 (hemagglutinin) and/or
N2 (neuraminidase) genes, and the proteins produced from those genes. If
the strains differed in other genes that coded for internal viral proteins,
those changes would be immunologically irrelevant because protective
antibodies can't gain access to internal viral proteins, and only the H and
N proteins participate directly in the extracellular adsorption and
penetration events required for infecting host cells. Intracellular virus
is also inaccessible to antibody.
Differences in H3N2 strains imply antigenic drift.....usually resulting in
accumulations in point mutations that are selected for by the presence of
protective antibody in the susceptible host. Major antigenic shift is also
possible because the genes for influenza virus occur on discrete genomic
segments (fragments) that may be re-assorted during viral replication in a
cell that is doubly infected with two strains. Perhaps someone who knows
the specific genetic differences of the two strains referenced above could
further enlighten us. - Mod.ES
