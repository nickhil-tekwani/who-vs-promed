The public health laboratory last week received 17 blood samples from Phuentsholing and Samtse to test them for chikungunya, a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes.

On Monday [30 Jul 2012], one of the 1st 3 samples the laboratory had received tested positive for chikungunya [virus infection], making it the 1st case of the mosquito-borne viral disease in the country, said laboratory officials.

Of the 17 samples, 9 were sent from Phuentsholing and the rest from Samtse. The laboratory's head, microbiologist Sonam Wangchuk, said the infected or suspected cases are from those who live in areas close to West Bengal, India. "It's the 1st positive case of chikungunya [virus infection] reported in the country," Sonam Wangchuk said.

The lab has so far tested 7 samples negative for chikungunya [virus], after the polymerase chain reaction test. To further confirm the existence of any other viruses, all 17 samples were sent to the Armed Force Research Institute for Medical Science [AFRIMS] in Bangkok yesterday [31 Jul 2012].

The chikungunya virus is transmitted from human to human by the bites of infected female mosquitoes, mostly _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_, causing fever, severe joint pain, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. After the bite of an infected mosquito, onset of illness occurs usually between 4-8 days but can range from 2-12 days. The name "chikungunya" means "to become contorted" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.

Doctors in Samtse said a few of the chikungunya suspected patients have already left the hospital and recovered.

Chief of the communicable disease division Tandin Dorji said the disease shares some clinical signs with dengue and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. "There is no cure for the disease as such, but treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms," Tandin Dorji said. "There is no need to panic because it's usually not fatal; but precautions are a must, as its impact could last up to a year."

Health officials said prevention and control of the disease relies heavily on reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled container habitats that support breeding of mosquitoes, health officials say. For protection during outbreaks of chikungunya, doctors advise clothing which minimises skin exposure to the day-biting vectors and repellents to be applied on exposed skin.

The fluctuations in the city's weather over the past few weeks and the unpredictable rainfall during the onset of monsoon have led to an increase in flu-like infections, Sonam Wangchuk said. "The number of patients suffering from mild viral fever has gone up in the past few days and, if the weather continues in a similar way, cases of infections are likely to increase," he said.

[It is not surprising that an outbreak of chikungunya virus infections has occurred in Buhtan close to the border with India. Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, and cases occur there sporadically. It will be of interest to learn whether the samples tested at the AFRIMS laboratory confirm all as chikungunya virus infection.
