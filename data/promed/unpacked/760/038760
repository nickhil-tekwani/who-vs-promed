The British Columbia (BC) Conservation Officer Service is investigating after animals died or got sick from poisoning in recent weeks.

A statement said 2 coyotes were found dead near Pemberton Meadows area in the past several weeks. And a 3rd was found more recently on Wednesday [22 Apr 2020].

"Subsequent testing confirmed the animals died from poisoning," the statement read.

Meanwhile, the BC services said dogs around the area also got sick from contaminated processed meat. "All required veterinary care but survived," said the statement.

According to the BC Wildlife Act, people can face fines of up to CAD 250 000 (USD 177 371) for intentionally poisoning animals. So, if anyone has information regarding the Pemberton Meadows area, BC Conservation Officer Services ask people to contact them.

[The article gives very little specific information. There are no clinical signs provided for the "dogs in the area also got sick from contaminated processed meat."

Perhaps the domestic dogs were sickened from the same substance as the coyotes or perhaps not. Maybe the processed meat was only spoiled (rotting) and the domestic animals became sickened from that.

The supposition the coyotes died from poisoning is not really known unless a necropsy and some diagnostic testing was done.

The domestic canines and the wild canines are linked in the same story, implying these groups were suffering from the same toxin. But this may not be the case.

Animals, both wild and domestic, are often poisoned with strychnine. Rodenticides have also been used in bait for wild and domestic canines. So, speculation is a long list, without some diagnostic testing of the deceased animals and more information from the veterinarians regarding clinical signs and any positive diagnostic testing.

We look forward to more information, especially a definitive cause of death of the animals. - Mod.TG
