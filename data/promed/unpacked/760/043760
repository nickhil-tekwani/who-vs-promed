As of Thu 22 May 2008 the number of infants and children infected
with hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) virus in the outbreak has
continued to increase dramatically, with the Health Ministry
revealing that 1000 cases have been reported. All kindergartens,
primary schools, and 4th and 5th grades have been closed because of
HFMD, which is also known as enterovirus-71 (EV71) [disease].

Most of the infected are children aged between one and 2 years old,
who are particularly vulnerable to it. Adult immune systems are
usually capable of fending off the virus.

As of last Mon 19 May 2008, 910 infections were reported in 11
provinces and the capital city, with over 200 people hospitalized and
the remainder being treated at home. While local hospitals have had
extra beds put in place, there has been crowding into hospital
corridors to accommodate the influx of patients attributed to the disease.

The infections are more common in the Dornogobi, Selenge, Hentii,
Suhbaatar, and Tov aymags [provinces]. The number of people infected
has increased by around 100 each day, according to the Ministry of
Health, and shows no sign of decreasing. The 1st case was reported on
Thu 8 May 2008, before quickly escalating. On 14 May, the number was
at 491 child infections.

"It's predicted that the spread of the disease is likely to reach its
peak level in June or July [2008] since the disease thrives in warm
weather," said D Narangerel, an official at the Ministry. A
nationwide health campaign is ongoing as there is no specific
treatment for EV71 infections and a vaccine is not currently
available worldwide.

From last week, all schoolchildren in grades one to 5 were sent on
summer holidays earlier than the scheduled date at the request of
health authorities, while 6th graders and up are taking their exams
as scheduled. Across Mongolia, all types of schools are on heightened
alert as teachers and parents are being told to keep the fundamentals
of basic personal hygiene by taking simple precautions like washing
hands. Health authorities put information posters about major
symptoms of EV71 infection and general precaution advisories in all
public places in Ulaanbaatar [the capital city], and urged all public
institutions to wrap entrance door handles with disinfected and
chloride [chlorine impregnated] bandages.

No severe cases or deaths have been reported to date, with only mild
cases reported, according to health authorities.
