I should like to make some comments about the recent posting on melioidosis.
1. By far the strongest association with underlying predisposition to
melioidosis is diabetes mellitus, not mentioned in the discussion.
2. The suggestion that the infection might have been caught whilst
mowing the lawn is interesting, but this has never before been
reported as a risk factor for melioidosis. There is a fundamental
difference between this and tularemia in that the primary reservoir
for _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is the soil itself, whereas with
_Francisella tularensis_ it is animals that may deposit the organism
on the surface. Furthermore, _B. pseudomallei_ is usually only
readily detected in waterlogged soil, conditions that would not be
favourable for lawn mowing. There is increasing evidence, especially
from northern Australia, that infection may be acquired by inhalation
of aerosols during severe weather events, which may be far more
common than previously recognised and might account for cases of
infection that do not have regular contact with soil and surface water.
3. Chloramphenicol really has no place in the management of the
disease these days, except in extremely resource-poor settings where
other drugs cannot be obtained. The mainstay of acute phase treatment
is ceftazidime, imipenem, or meropenem, with co-trimoxazole and
doxycycline used as 1st choice treatment during the 'eradication' phase.
4. Serodiagnosis is fraught with problems in inhabitants of endemic
areas like northern Australia due to high background seropositivity.
