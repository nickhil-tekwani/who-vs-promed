The Georgia Department of Health has confirmed a horse in Brooks County has tested positive for Eastern Equine Encephalitis.

Now, health officials are asking you to make sure you wear mosquito spray when you go outside. The illness causes inflammation of the brain, which often starts as headaches. While there are no vaccines for humans to prevent mosquito-borne illness, horses can get vaccines for Eastern Equine Encephalitis and the West Nile Virus.

"While we see these types of reports each year, it's still important for us to remember the importance of preventing mosquito bites whenever possible," says Kenneth Lowery, district epidemiologist. "Mosquito borne illnesses can cause severe sickness, brain damage or death in some cases."

To prevent mosquito bites are:
- Use insect repellent containing DEET, picardin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing;
- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits;
- Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out;
- Empty standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, wading pools and other containers. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out.

[Brooks County is on the southern border of Georgia with Florida, and considering the frequency of EEE in Florida this report is not surprising; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_County,_Georgia.

EEEv infections kill horses so it is well worth routinely vaccinating your horses each Spring. Too many owners procrastinate and say "when I hear of a case I will get my horses vaccinated." The problem is it is their horses that are the trigger cases. So get your horses vaccinated.

It can be a very nasty disease in humans, and in my experience the further north you go and mosquitoes get less dense, the greater the probability of brain lesions. Here in Louisiana we have few human EEE cases and they are usually mild and go home in fair condition. And mosquito activity is around 49 weeks of the year with a high probability of "herd" immunity. Further north, cases match the textbooks. - Mod.MHJ
