As of 9 Dec [2006], there were 34 386 cases of dengue reported nationwide.
Of the figure, there were 13 deaths. "In Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya alone,
there were 6644 cases," said Deputy Federal Territories Minister Datuk Wira
Abu Seman Yusop at the launch of the Lifelong Health Carnival 2006 (Federal
Territories level) recently.
He said efforts had been made by the Federal Territories and City Hall
health departments to curb the menace, especially at crowded residential
areas. Among the plans is the Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI)
program. However, Abu Seman said the public ought to seek treatment fast if
they suspected that they had caught dengue fever.
Kuala Lumpur health department director E.G. Palaniyappan said the COMBI
program had been introduced at 3 zones: Setapak, Klang Lama and Kuala
Lumpur city center. "We hope more people from more zones will form
committees to begin the program," he said at the launch.

[It would be interesting to know how many of the nearly 35 000 cases
diagnosed as dengue were laboratory confirmed, which dengue virus serotypes
were circulating, and whether elimination of mosquito vector breeding sites
was included in the COMBI program. A map of Malaysia can be accessed at:

The number of dengue cases in Selangor has gone above 11 000 so far this
year [2006], and the State Government is unhappy over the statistics.
State Health Committee chairman Datuk Dr Lim Thuang Seng said he was
disappointed that the number exceeded the state's target of keeping the
cases below 11 000.
"Last year [2005], there were 12 700 cases, and our efforts to keep the
numbers low did not work," he said. "This is because the state government
lacked the cooperation and support from the public."
Lim said the difference in the number between 2005 and this year [2006] was
insignificant. "By the end of the year, it may surpass the 12 000 mark. We
have done everything possible, including holding anti-dengue campaigns and
carrying out fogging exercises, but the people failed to take precautionary
measures," he said after distributing free abate and flyers to motorists at
the LDP toll plaza in Bandar Sunway on Monday [18 Dec 2006].
A total of 4000 packets of abates, a contribution from BASF (M) Sdn Bhd,
were distributed at the Batu Tiga toll plaza along the Kuala Lumpur-Klang
Federal Highway. Some were distributed at the toll plaza in front of the
Eastin Hotel, along the Sprint Highway.
"Without the support from the public, the state's efforts would simply be a
waste," said Lim. "They must do their part, and they must do it earnestly,"
he said, adding that the public should destroy all mosquito breeding
grounds near their homes and compounds. "We have been educating the public
on this, but they don't seem to have learnt their lesson. Hopefully, their
mind sets will change soon."
Subang Jaya Municipal Council, Shah Alam City Council and Kajang Municipal
Council recorded the highest number of cases in the Klang Valley last week,
with 54 cases each. Gombak district had 43 cases, followed by 36 recorded
by the Petaling Jaya City Council.
"We hope those who are going for the year-end holidays will ensure that
their homes are free from mosquito breeding spots," said Dr Lim.

Local researchers and microbiologists have identified dengue virus type 3
as the main virus responsible for the recent epidemic of viral hemorrhagic
fever (VHF) in Karachi.
Dr Tahir Shamsi, associated with Bismillah Taqee Institute of Blood
Diseases (BMTIBD), told APP Wednesday [22 Dec 2006] that his team worked on
the blood samples of Karachi-based dengue patients and discovered dengue
type-3 virus as the major type. "The investigation report and the samples
were also forwarded to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Atlanta, USA, which also confirmed these results," he said.
The BTIBD examined blood samples of 80 of its dengue patients during
November [2006], and the molecular laboratory at BTIBD studied 47 more
patients reported from different parts of the country and confirmed that,
apart from dengue type-3 [virus], type-4 and type-1 [viruses] were also
present in Pakistan.
"The most important finding is the presence of chikungunya virus in 50
percent of patients who were negative for dengue virus," the senior
pathologist said and added that chikungunya, which broke out in India, had
some signs and symptoms similar to viral hemorrhagic fever. Dengue viral
fever (DVF) is largely self-limiting, however, the 2nd infection of the
disease does [may - Mod.TY] lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and then
even to dengue shock syndrome (DSS), which could be fatal.
A few patients suffering from both dengue and chikungunya were also picked
up from different hospitals in Karachi. The BTIBD has developed guidelines
to treat dengue fever. These guidelines are available in Urdu, Sindhi,
Pushto and English.

215 dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] cases were reported this year [2006] by
the State Secretary of Health [Secretaria Estadual de Saude Publica,
SESAP]. Of these [DHF cases], 40 died, 44 [of the 215] were [laboratory]
confirmed, including one who died due to complications of the disease.
It was reported by SESAP that cases and incidence of dengue in priority
municipalities have shown that there has been an increase in the
proliferation of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ in Rio Grande do Norte.

[This news is confusing because it reports that of the 215 DHF cases, there
were at least 40 fatalities, for a mortality rate of 20 percent, which is
extremely high. DHF mortality should not be higher than 5 percent. -
Mod.LJS; trans. Mod.TY]
[If the 40 mortalities are confirmed DHF cases, it suggests that there is
significant underreporting of DHF cases in this area. - Mod.JW]

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management. (Abstracted from the
