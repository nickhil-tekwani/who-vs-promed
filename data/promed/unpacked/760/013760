UPPER RESPIRATORY DISEASE OUTBREAK - USA (SOUTH DAKOTA)
=======================================================
Date: Tuesday, March 18, 1997 4:12:13 MST
From: Northern Hills Enviromental Health Dept.
Via: the OUTBREAK page http://www.outbreak.org/
Looking for help on an abnormal outbreak of URI [upper respiratory illness]
among youth at a work and education center.
This facility houses 237 young people. Since 2 Feb. 1997, they have logged
an excess of 600 cases of URI symptoms, with estimated 50% infection rate.
Signs and symptoms include: fever of 99-102F, sore throat, raspy cough,
swollen lymph nodes, runny nose, aches and fatigue. There have been 4
confirmed cases of pneumonia. One case of adenovirus. Duration of acute
illness = approximately 72 hours, with cough and fatigue lingering.
Also note that 95-100% of the people invoved had received influenza
immunizations.
If you know of anything with similarity, please respond to the address below.

[Crude calculations, if I understand the message correctly: 50% infection
rate in 237 people = about 119 people ill since 2 Feb. 1997. 600 illnesses
per 119 people = 5 illnesses per person. In seven weeks? 5 illnesses of 3
days means these people were sick for 15 (plus days of post-illness fatigue)
of 44 days. If this is not influenza and at least one adenovirus infection
has been documented, it might be a mixed series of infections or allergic
(environmental) reactions. Anyone have any ideas? Quickly!
Please note the submitter's request that responses should be addressed to the
Northern Hills Enviromental Health Department, not to ProMED-mail. Thanks.
