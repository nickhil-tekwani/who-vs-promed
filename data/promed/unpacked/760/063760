Officials in New Zealand report 10-fold increase in _Vibrio_ infections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
New Zealand recently recorded a sharp increase in _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infections. In January 2022, 30 illnesses were reported compared with 3 in the same month of 2021.

New Zealand Food Safety had previously reminded consumers to thoroughly cook mussels with evidence suggesting that a change in water temperature and conditions may make them more susceptible to the bacteria.

A total of 19 patients were reported from the Canterbury District Health Board (DHB), 7 from Bay of Plenty and Lakes DHBs and 4 from Auckland and Northland DHBs. From these, 13 people were hospitalized.

Sick people had eaten a variety of raw and cooked seafood including crayfish, mussels, kina [a sea urchin endemic to New Zealand], oysters, pipis [a saltwater clam], pƒÅua [large edible sea snails], Tua Tua [another type of clam], bluenose [also called Antarctic butterfish], cod, snapper and warehou [another local fish]. Several different sequence types were also identified, meaning there was likely more than one source of contamination.

Symptoms of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ [infection] may include watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and headaches. They usually occur within 24 hours of eating a contaminated product and last from 1 to 7 days.

[_V. parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea. It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ as well as other vibrios are naturally present in marine waters and do not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those in the western hemisphere and the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, clearly accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Transmission connected to cooked seafood suggests either inadequate cooking or contamination after cooking. - Mod.LL
