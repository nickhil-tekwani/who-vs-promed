Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) officers confiscated feral swine from a farm in El Paso County which later tested positive for pseudorabies.

It is illegal to bring invasive species such as feral swine into Colorado, remind CPW and the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA). For 15 years, Colorado has worked to eliminate feral swine, working with a partnership including CDA as well as federal agencies including APHIS and the U.S. Forest Service.

"This is exactly why we have worked so hard to eliminate free-roaming feral swine from Colorado," Travis Black, CPW''s Regional Manager for the Northwest Region based in Grand Junction and an expert on feral pigs, said in a release. "Roaming wild, feral swine destroy agricultural crops, wildlife habitat and out-compete native species for food. And feral swine kept on farms pose a huge risk to other animals by spreading diseases such as pseudorabies, as in this case."

A team of CPW officers led by Black, who was then Deputy Regional Manager for the Southeast Region based in Colorado Springs, and Area Wildlife Manager Cody Wigner, descended on a small farm on [3 Sep 2021] near Colorado Springs after reports the homeowner was raising feral swine illegally imported from Texas.

CPW found 3 of the wild pigs in a small barn and euthanized them. After sending blood samples to a lab for analysis, test results showed the presence of pseudorabies.

The homeowner was cited for illegally transporting and possessing the prohibited species. Each is a misdemeanor charge and carries a fine and surcharge amount of $137 per animal, CPW reports.

CPW is working with USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to trace the feral swine back to their original herd in Texas to help stop the spread of this contagious virus.

"The Colorado feral swine task force continues to monitor for reintroductions to ensure the state remains free of this invasive species and the damage it can inflict," CPW said in a release.

[Pseudorabies, Aujeszky's disease, and mad itch are all names for this disease. Although one of its names is pseudorabies, it has nothing to do with rabies virus, rather the animals are so affected by the intense itching, their attempts to relieve it cause some observers to think they are seeing the madness of rabies. It can affect a variety of animals with slightly different consequences and certainly a loss of condition, and marketability.

"Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. PRV-infected feral swine represent a potential source of infection for domestic pigs in North America, and thus active surveillance and other preventive efforts are important to maintain PRV-free status.

"The USA commercial swine industry obtained pseudorabies-free status in 2004, which was important because of the economic value of domestic swine production; however, feral swine remain competent hosts and represent a constant threat for reintroducing the virus into the commercial industry. Serologic surveys encompassing 35 US states showed the prevalence of antibodies against PRV in feral swine was high (18%)." (With thanks to ProMED Mod.PMB)

There are several sections of information posted below.

Pseudorabies general information:
"Pseudorabies (Aujeszky's disease, mad itch) is caused by a neurotrophic Î±-herpesvirus. The virus can be latent or subclinical in adult swine and pigs are thought to be the source of infection in other animal species. After a pig bite, the virus enters the skin and travels to the brain or spinal cord by retrograde axonal transport. The incubation period is 90 to 156 days. Piglets show seizures, tremors, ataxia, and death. In other species, severe pruritus, dermal abrasions, swelling, and alopecia develop at the site of virus inoculation.

"Other signs include ataxia, paresis, circling, aggression, depression, and seizures.

"Diagnosis is based on viral isolation and histopathology. There is no effective treatment. Pseudorabies has been eradicated from domestic swine in the United States."

Pseudorabies, swine, ruminants:
"Pseudorabies is caused by a herpes virus. Most often a mild disease to asymptomatic disease in swine, it is highly fatal in cattle. The clinical signs are to some extent similar to rabies and justify the name, pseudorabies.

"Epidemiology
Pseudorabies has a worldwide distribution. Infected pigs shed the virus in the nasal and pharyngeal secretions, and because of the proximity of the 2 species in some livestock operations, transmission of the virus from swine into ruminants may occur.(42,43) Ruminants are susceptible to pseudorabies infection after intradermal, subcutaneous, intranasal, or oral exposure to the virus. Following infection, the incubation period is between 2 and 7 days. Horses and human beings are resistant to pseudorabies virus infection.

"Clinical Signs
Because of the relatively short incubation period of the pseudorabies virus, ruminants may die suddenly without premonitory signs.(42) In more slowly developing cases, intense pruritus that may be localized or generalized develops. Dermal abrasions, swelling, pruritus, and alopecia occur at the site of virus inoculation.(44) Fever is often present. Other clinical signs reported are bloating, ataxia, aggression or depression, salivation, excessive chewing of the tongue, pharyngeal/laryngeal dysfunction, dyspnea, and seizures. Most affected animals die shortly (within 2 days) after the onset of clinical signs.

"Diagnosis
In ruminants, a tentative diagnosis is often based on clinical signs and history of possible contact with pigs. On postmortem, histologic examination reveals a nonsuppurative inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, with perivascular cuffing and focal necrosis. Virus isolation, immunohistochemistry, and polymerase chain reaction can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Serologic testing is most often used in pigs, since ruminants die rapidly and may not have detectable antibodies. Regional diagnostic laboratory should be contacted before submitting a sample.

"Treatment and Prevention
There is no effective treatment, and prevention is targeted toward reducing the exposure of ruminants to swine."

Pseudorabies, other species:
"Pseudorabies (Aujeszky's disease) is a notifiable disease caused by the alphaherpesvirus suid herpesvirus-1 (SuHV-1). Swine are the natural hosts for SuHV-1, but other domestic and wild mammals, including ruminants, dogs, cats, raccoons, rabbits, and rodents, are susceptible to infection and fatal encephalitis. The name pseudorabies was applied because the clinical signs caused by the virus in rabbits resemble those of rabies. SuHV-1 has been eradicated from domestic swine through use of vaccination programs in many countries, including Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, and New Zealand. The virus continues to circulate among wild boar and feral swine, which act as a reservoir for the virus.(2) Australia is also free of pseudorabies. Aujeszky's disease is a widespread problem in domestic swine herds in Asia, Latin America, and some parts of Europe.(2)

"SuHV-1 is shed in the saliva and nasal discharges of swine, and transmission can occur by direct contact with these discharges or aerosols, or ingestion of infected swine carcasses or other infected animals, especially wildlife. The virus can survive on fomites and in carcasses for several weeks. In swine, clinical signs depend on the age at exposure and virus strain. Subclinical infections and shedding occur commonly. When older pigs do develop signs, they typically develop respiratory disease. Encephalitis occurs in piglets or in adult pigs that are infected with virulent strains. Reproductive disease and fetal loss can occur in pregnant sows. Recovered pigs develop latent infection of neuronal tissues with reactivation and shedding of virus in semen and nasal, oral, or vaginal secretions following stress.

"Disease in dogs is uncommonly reported. However, clusters of affected dogs have been described over the past decade, primarily in hunting dogs that contact wild swine from parts of Europe (France, Germany, Belgium) and the southern United States (Florida and Oklahoma).(2-7) This has followed global expansion of wild swine populations. Disease in dogs may be more likely to occur in regions that are densely populated with wild swine, such as the southern United States (Figure 25-1) and parts of Europe such as Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and the Czech Republic.(2) Dogs that reside on swine farms may also become infected.(8) In some reports, packs of dogs have been infected after consumption of uncooked offal from infected pigs or pig carcasses.(9,10) Dogs of any age, sex, and breed can develop disease, but dog-to-dog transmission does not occur. Cats can be infected after ingestion of pork waste or infected rodents, but reports of naturally occurring Aujeszky's disease in cats are extremely rare.(11) Because subclinical infections and nonspecific signs are common in swine, identification of pseudorabies in dogs may be the first indication that disease is present in a swine herd or wild swine population."
