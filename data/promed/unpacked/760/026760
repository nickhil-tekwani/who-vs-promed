Fifty (50) people have died over the past six weeks in Mozambique's
northern Cabo Delgado province after eating fish deliberately killed with
pesticides, officials said on Wednesday. The health ministry said the
poisoning -- which affected a total of 586 people -- was caused by
fishermen dumping pesticides at several points along Cabo Delgado's Indian
Ocean coast to increase their catch. The fishermen killed huge numbers of
fish, more than they could carry away, the ministry said.
Health authorities in the neighbouring provinces of Zambezia and Nampula
have been alerted, and investigations are under way to identify those
responsible and bring them to justice.
