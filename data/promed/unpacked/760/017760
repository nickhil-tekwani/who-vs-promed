East Tennessee Children's Hospital said [Tue 5 Jun 2018] it has treated "close to 10" children, all younger than 4, for a "serious outbreak" of _Escherichia coli_-caused illness over the past 10 days. The Knox County Health Department has confirmed 2 likely sources of the outbreak are unpasteurized milk and farm animals.

Most of the ill children are known to have consumed raw milk from a local cow-share dairy, French Broad Farm in Knox County, the health department said in an alert issued [Tue 5 Jun 2018] evening. The health department recommends consumers dispose of all raw milk or other unpasteurized products they may have from this farm. "People need to be aware that if they choose to drink raw milk, they're taking a risk," said Dr Martha Buchanan, health department director.

The health department is also investigating whether any of the affected children were exposed to _E. coli_ after interacting with farm animals at a local child care facility. The facility, which officials declined to name, is not currently operating, Buchanan said.

Four of the children are in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit [PICU] with kidney failure, said the hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Joe Childs, who is director of the PICU. There have been no fatalities related to the outbreak, hospital staff said, but life-threatening infections can occur when the strain of _E. coli_ releases a toxin, Shiga toxin, that harms small blood vessels, of which the kidneys have many. Childs said the damage to the blood vessels is usually "temporary," but children can get very ill, require surgery to place catheters, and may have nonfunctioning kidneys for weeks. "We are concerned that some of these cases do have exposure to the consumption of raw milk," or milk sold unpasteurized, Childs said. "Tennessee is a state where that's legal, to obtain raw milk. The FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly discourage the consumption of raw milk and raw milk products because there are a lot of things that can be in milk and there's no real good way to decontaminate it other than pasteurizing it."

Buchanan said so far the children all have the same strain of _E. coli_, but the exact number of cases is "fluid" as the investigation continues. He added that health department epidemiologists are contacting customers of the dairy and children who interacted with the animals to identify possible cases. Per regulations, the dairy sells unpasteurized milk through a "cow-share" program, so all the customers are known. "We're reaching out to people at risk," Buchanan said.

Past outbreaks of this infection among children in East Tennessee have been traced back to swimming pools, hamburger meat and, in 2013, drinking unpasteurized milk from a particular dairy with contamination.

Buchanan said it is "uncommon" to have so many cases at once among children, but notes parents should continue general safety practices: carefully washing hands with soap and hot water, thoroughly washing greens and fully cooking meats, avoiding unpasteurized milk and juice, staying out of public swimming pools with diarrhea, and making sure children wear swim diapers. She reiterated that it is impossible to see risk with the naked eye. "Most people know _E. coli_ is spread by fecal-oral contact," Buchanan said. "But it takes a tiny amount of feces to make you sick; 1800 bacteria can sit on the head of a pin, but it only takes about 10 of those to make you sick."

Tennessee typically reports fewer than 150 cases of infection a year, with Knox County reporting around 20. Most occur in the summer months.

[Although not specifically stated, the _E. coli_ is certainly an enterohemorrhagic serotype such as O157:H7. Unlike most _E. coli_, these organisms are zoonotic and can be transmitted from raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products. There is some history of possible exposure to farm animals but a clear link of unpasteurized milk through "cow sharing".

In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, Lynch M, Angulo FJ and Mahon BE. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp were responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), _Listeria_ (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
