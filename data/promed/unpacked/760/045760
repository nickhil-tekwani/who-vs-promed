Kenya and Somalia: Rift Valley fever - WHO Update 3
-----------------------------------------------
Kenya
-------
As of Tue 30 Jan 2007, 411 suspected cases, including 121 deaths
(case-fatality rate, 29 percent) have been reported in North Eastern
Province, Coast Province, Eastern Province and Central Province (see the
WHO map at
<http://www.who.int/csr/AFRO_RVF_20070130.png>).
131 cases have been laboratory confirmed.
The North Eastern Province has been the most affected, with Garissa
district (175 suspected cases, 58 confirmed cases, including 57 deaths) and
Ijara district (125 suspected cases and 22 confirmed cases, including 23
deaths) reporting the most cases and deaths. Sporadic cases have also been
reported from districts in Eastern Province (Isiolo - 8 suspected cases, 3
confirmed cases) and from districts in Central Province (Kirinyanga - 4
suspected cases, 4 confirmed cases, including one death; Kajiado - 3
suspected cases, one confirmed case, including 3 deaths; Maragua - one
suspected case, one confirmed case); Thika - 2 suspected cases, one
confirmed case). Some of the cases from Central Province were diagnosed in
Nairobi.
The outbreak appears to be in decline, although the Ministry of Health
continues to coordinate activities to contain the outbreak, including
active surveillance. The team from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network (see previous report) has returned from the affected areas, having
provided a mobile laboratory for initial diagnosis of the disease, training
in case management/infection control to provincial health officials and
assistance with health education and informing affected communities about
the disease. WHO, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries Development developed key public health messages which have been
disseminated in the local community, and meetings were held with community
religious leaders.
Somalia
---------
As of Tue 30 Jan 2007, WHO has reported 100 suspected cases, including 48
deaths, in Somalia (see WHO map), with one case laboratory confirmed by the
Kenyan Institute of Medical Research (KEMRI) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention/ International Emerging Infectious Program (CDC/EIP)
in Kenya.
Medecins sans Frontieres is facilitating transport of samples, and the WHO
country office has held training sessions with Somali medical officers on
how to detect and contain the disease. However, the deteriorating security
situation continues to hamper control measures in the affected area.
