A man has become infected with a "superbug" NDM-1 resistant to [multiple antibiotics]. He had been admitted in July [2015] to Chalons-en-Champagne Hospital [Marne] before being admitted to the ICU of the University Hospital of Reims [Marne] in mid-July [2015] when he was diagnosed with the bacteria and placed in isolation. The patient had returned from Viet Nam.

According to national protocols in force, the hospital in Chalons-en-Champagne sent a letter to all the people who had contact with him, inviting them to be tested [for the bacteria]. "To date, all screenings conducted in patients present in this facility have not detected the presence of this bacterium," said the director of the Chalons hospital in a statement. "The risk of being a carrier for patients by contact is low."

Becoming a carrier has no consequence on the health of the patient," said hospital [staff]. Commonly called "superbug," the NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) is being monitored internationally. First identified in 2009, it is considered a time bomb by experts. It has a resistance gene that has spread to species of pathogenic bacteria responsible not only for dysentery, but also cholera.

[NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) was first identified in a strain of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolated in Sweden in 2008 from an Indian patient (1). NDM-1 is a metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) that confers broad-spectrum beta-lactam resistance, hydrolyzing penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems but sparing aztreonam, a monobactam. Plasmids that carry the NDM gene can also carry a number of genes that encode resistance to other classes of antimicrobial drugs such as aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolones, in addition to beta-lactams. Many NDM producers remain susceptible only to tigecycline and colistin. The fact that NDM gene is carried by a highly transmissible plasmid is thought to account for its rapid, widespread dissemination.

Cases of colonization or infection with NDM-producing Gram negative bacilli have been reported worldwide as either imported cases in patients with a travel history to, or contact with healthcare systems on the Indian subcontinent, and less frequently as cases following secondary transmission or as autochthonous cases with no history of travel to the Indian subcontinent (2).

Variants of the NDM-1 carbapenemase, such as NDM-2, NDM-4, and NDM-5, have subsequently been described.

NDM has been predominantly found in _Enterobacteriaceae_, mostly in _K. pneumoniae_ and _Escherichia coli_ isolates. However, NDM carbapenemases have also been found in non-fermentative Gram negative bacteria such as _Acinetobacter_ spp and _Pseudomonas_ spp.

We are not told in the news report above what bacterial species the NDM-1 producing organism is, and we are not told if it was suspected that the patient had acquired this organism in France or Viet Nam. France has had prior exposure to NDM (See Also's below). ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information in this regard from knowledgeable source.
