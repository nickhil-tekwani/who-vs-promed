A new influenza strain has been isolated in US swine herds in at least four
states and is responsible for serious outbreaks of illness, particularly
among sows. The strain, known as H3N2 was isolated at the Iowa State
University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Ames. H3N2 also was isolated
in samples submitted from Texas, said Dr. Beverly Schmitt of NVSL[National
Veterinary Service Laboratory. "This particular strain seems to be
somewhat widespread in pork-producing areas of the country," she said.
The origin of H3N2 is not known. However, Dennis Senne, a microbiologist
with NVSL, said the H3N2 viruses found in the Midwest and North Carolina
differed. "That would imply there's more than one source of introduction,
but no one knows at this time," he said.
The strain H3N2, should be suspected when a previously successful influenza
vaccination program fails to protect against the disease, according to
veterinarians and researchers participating in a recent teleconference to
discuss the discovery.
"H1N1 is still the predominant strain affecting US swine herds," Dr. Sibbel
says. "If you've vaccinated your herd and are still seeing significant
influenza disease -- particularly if animals run high fevers, abort and
there are sow deaths -- that may be a tip-off that the H3N2 strain is
present."
H3N2 has been seen in swine herds in Europe but, until now, was not found
in the United States. In most US swine herds, swine influenza virus is
still caused by the strain H1N1; H3N2 represents an additional strain and
has been confirmed among herds in North Carolina, Iowa, Minnesota and
Texas. There was no evidence of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), which has been associated with more severe clinical
disease when it coexists with other infections such as swine influenza, Dr.
Erickson noted.
"In Europe, including Great Britain, both H1N1 and H3N2 occur, and neither
strain has disappeared. Both have persisted, and it's likely that in the
future, we're going to need a vaccine that protects against both, just as
in Europe," Dr. Janke added.
"Diagnostic laboratories and swine practitioners in major pork-producing
states report an increase in swine influenza," says Schering-Plough's Dr.
Rick Sibbel.
In the meantime, swine producers vaccinating for H1N1 should continue to do
so, Drs. Janke and Sibbel said. Both the prevalence and pattern of swine
influenza are changing among US. herds.
