A calicivirus (viral rabbit hemorrhagic disease, for instance)
hypothesis should be tested.
The OIE laboratory is in Italy, but I guess there should also be a
local laboratory available.

[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is discussed in detail in ProMED-mail
postings 20050609.1603 and 20050613.1649. Clearly, this is a disease
that should be considered as the caretakers seek to protect the
rabbits. There are labs in the United States that can handle the
situation. We are hoping for an authoritative report from the
laboratory or the veterinarians involved. - Mod.TG]
