One last thought on this topic. Over the last 10 years Tufts Wildlife
Clinic has seen a number of large native wild rodents (mostly woodchucks,
but also porcupines and beavers) with neurologic signs that have tested
positive for rabies.
It has been our assumption that these species are (a) because of their
habits, fairly likely to come into contact with rabid native carnivores
(raccoons, skunks, etc.), and (b) large enough to survive a bite wound and
come down with the disease.
We teach our veterinary students that rodents appear to be just as
susceptible to the disease as other mammals and not to assume any innate
resistance.
