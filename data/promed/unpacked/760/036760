[We will await the results of the serotype O genotyping but this new
outbreak in a country near the China outbreaks detailed in the references
below is concerning. Of particular interest is the comment of Mod.AS in
ProMED-mail: Foot & mouth disease - China (04): (XJ) porcine, OIE
20100504.1445. Unfortunately, this situation is of significant concern and
ProMED-mail would appreciate knowing of any further outbreaks. - Mods.PC/FE
