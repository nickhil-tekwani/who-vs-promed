Anthrax cases cause cattle raisers to act
---------------------------------------------
This year's [2005] anthrax season started on 18 Jul 2005 with a diagnosis
of anthrax in a buffalo and beef herd. To date, there have been 38 herds
with anthrax diagnosed by laboratory testing. Total death losses have
reached 330 head of beef cattle and bison. Livestock producers are
vaccinating animals in the affected locales, and some producers have
vaccinated animals, as a precautionary measure, in areas of the state where
anthrax has not been active for a number of years.
Please access our website at

for a map of the anthrax affected counties in South Dakota.

[I strongly advise members to visit this site. The last official
update/newsletter was from 28 Jul 2005. The 16 Aug 2005 map has the
following numbers of outbreaks in the following 11 South Dakota counties:
Brown (4), Day (1), Dewey (7), Hand (2), Hughes (2), Hyde (2), Marshall
(3), Potter (7), Spink (2), Sully (9), and Walworth (1), which sum to 39
outbreaks. But the map, for some reason, is titled "2004-2005 Anthrax Cases
in South Dakota." It would seem that the cases in northeast South Dakota
may be epidemiologically linked to the cases in southeast North Dakota,
where the weight of the latter state's outbreaks are. See
<http://www.agdepartment.com/Programs/Livestock/BOAH/2005Anthrax.pdf>
for the North Dakota Department of Agriculture anthrax map. As of
yesterday, 16 Aug 2005, North Dakota has had 86 cases (premises) in 13
counties.
The veterinary authorities in both states are to be commended for keeping
their maps updated. - Mod.MHJ]
