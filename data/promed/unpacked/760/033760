FREETOWN: In a bid to halt Lassa fever from claiming more lives, a campaign
against the disease has started in Freetown. The campaign started yesterday
and is expected to last for 6 days. Health Education Manager, Mr. Valentine
Kawa said that the campaign targets the entire population with special
focus on displaced camps, depressed communities, and private medical
practitioners.
Mr. Kawa said the campaign aims at [educating people [regarding the mode
of transmission of Lassa fever, its signs and symptoms, and prevention and
control. The Disease Prevention and Control Unit is also training people on
barrier nursing while radio discussions are part of the campaign. Dr.
Haroun Turay of Disease Prevention and Control said that everything will be
done to crush Lassa Fever and pointed out that treatment is now available
and is free. Valentine Kawa noted that Lassa Fever recently claimed 4 lives
including a medical doctor.

Freetown is needed to clarify the nature and extent of the free treatment
now on offer. There have been no recent reports of new cases in the
