[This is the 1st report of a presumably laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV in a UAE citizen visiting Morocco. More details on the epidemiology of this case (age, gender, location of probable exposure, possible risk factors, date of onset of illness, clinical presentation, etc) would be greatly appreciated.

If in fact this case is laboratory confirmed this will be the 51st case of confirmed MERS-CoV infection.
