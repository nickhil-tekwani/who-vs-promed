The corporation health committee members visited the city zoo on
Thursday [19 Jul 2007], to review the situation following the
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Corporation health committee
chairman, G R Anil, led the team comprising the corporation
veterinary officer, health officers and ward councillors.
The team that analysed the healthcare and sanitation activities
inside the zoo expressed concern over the waste disposal mechanism in
the zoo. "The issue of garbage disposal inside the zoo needs to be
addressed immediately. We will be cooperating with zoo officials to
find out better methods of waste disposal," G R Anil said.
He added that the issue of space constraint in some enclosures,
including that of the black bucks, was also raised during the visit.
The zoo officials said that the Zoo and Museum Directorate had moved
papers seeking a government recommendation to appoint contractors to
remove waste from the zoo.
A review meeting of the technical committee of veterinarians and
officials will be held on Friday [20 Jul 2007]. The Animal Husbandry
Department director will convene the meeting that will decide on the
future course of action to be taken. A decision on a possible date to
reopen the zoo is also expected to be made at the meeting.

[Unfortunately, several protected species of cloven-hoofed
(artiodactyle) animals died during the FMD outbreak in the
Thiruvananthapuram zoo (Kerala state). Since the FMD virus, serotype
O, which infected the zoo is endemic in India, it would be sensible to
consider periodic vaccination of such susceptible animals. - Mod.AS]
