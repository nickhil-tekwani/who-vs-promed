Canadian scientists cast doubt on cause of SARS
-----------------------------------------------
So far, more than 4000 people worldwide have fallen ill with SARS, which
kills in 4 per cent of cases. In Canada, more than 300 are either
"probable" or "suspected" of having SARS, and 15 are reported to have died.
The outbreak centers on the city of Toronto.
The World Health Organization says it is reasonably certain that SARS is
caused by infection with a new strain [species] of coronavirus. However,
Canadian scientists have carried out hundreds of tests on samples from
patients diagnosed as suspected or probable cases of SARS in Canada. They
have found that only 40 per cent of people carried the new [species] of
coronavirus. In addition they found evidence of the strain [the new species
of coronavirus] in healthy people enlisted as "controls" for the experiment.
The results, from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory in
Winnipeg, contradict those from scientists in Hong Kong, where more than
100 people have so far died from the illness. The Hong Kong team found that
90 per cent of probable SARS cases harboured the [new] coronavirus, and
found no trace of it in healthy controls. Researchers around the world are
scrambling to provide diagnostic tests and treatments, and even working
towards vaccines, on the basis that coronavirus is the root cause. If it is
not actually caused by coronavirus, then these efforts would be in vain.
Many experts believe it will be some years before an effective vaccine for
this new strain of coronavirus is available.
Dr Frank Plummer, who led the Canadian research, said that: "There remain
some very puzzling things we are finding. "I'm still not convinced it's
coronavirus -- although it could well be, but the data are not conclusive."
