In the midst of the health scandal of the eggs contaminated with fipronil coming from the Netherlands, the prefecture [capital, Arras] of Pas-de-Calais confirms analyses carried out in a French farm. All eggs laid on the farm since 28 Jul 2017 will be destroyed. In parallel, the northern prefecture confirmed today [9 Aug 2017] that a processor of egg products based in Roncq (Nord department) received a delivery of batches of contaminated eggs. New investigations are underway.

The prefecture of Pas-de-Calais confirmed this [Wed 9 Aug 2017] the presence of fipronil in a chicken farm with laying hens in the department. It is the 1st French farm in which traces of this insecticide, which caused the crisis of contaminated eggs that originated in the Netherlands, have been found.

At the same time, the prefecture of the Nord department [Lille] also confirmed that a processing company the department is also involved: a processor of egg products based in Roncq was supplied with batches of contaminated eggs.


According to the Pas-de-Calais prefecture, cited by 20 Minutes, the risk of contamination of the chickens has been linked to the use, by the operator, of a pest control product, DEGA-16, containing the banned substance.

The site manager warned the authorities one of his suppliers was using DEGA-16, reports La Voix du Nord. Indeed, Chickfriend, the Belgian distributor of the product, illegally added fipronil to the composition of its antiparasitic [drug], intended to eradicate the red louse.

Pending the results of the analyzes, the eggs from this farm had been previously set aside and their sale suspended as a precaution, on 28 Jul 2017. As the results confirmed the presence of fipronil, these eggs will all be destroyed.

As for the manufacturing company located in Roncq, the northern prefecture provides details this [Wed 9 Aug 2017] on its site [http://www.nord.gouv.fr/Actualites/Actualites/Alimentation-Presence-de-fipronil-dans-des-oeufs-originaires-des-Pays-Bas; in French]. It said that it had been informed on 8 Aug 2017 that the processor of egg products, Ovoservices, had also "shipped batches of contaminated eggs." The authorities have told our colleagues that the company "immediately put in place the recall measures for destruction of the eggs so that they could not be sold to its customers."

"At the same time, the Departmental Directorate of Populations is conducting an investigation in each farm in the eggs sector of the department to ensure that the DEGA 16 has not been used," said the Nord prefecture.

The investigations should make it possible to check "the possible diffusion" of the products from this plant, on French and European territories. [This likely means the distribution of products from this plant. - Mod.TG]

Faced with the growing crisis, professionals in the sector are reassuring. Xavier Garenaux, president of the Licques Volaille [poultry] Defense Union of (Pas-de-Calais), reminds us that chickens intended for slaughter are killed too young to know about a possible treatment against the red louse. Most farmed chickens live only 35 to 40 days (81 days for Label Rouge chickens).

Only the eggs, resulting from the farming of laying hens, would therefore be potentially affected by this health scandal.

[Fipronil is not labeled for use in food animals. The WHO has set a very low level of fipronil in the eggs. While this article does not tell us the level of fipronil in the eggs, it is believed to be above the admissible limits.

Without regard to the amount of fipronil in the eggs, it is possible there are happy chickens as they are no longer facing mites. -

With current fipronil levels, Germany's Federal Institute for Risk Assessment estimates a child who weighs around 16 kg (35 lb) could eat 1.7 eggs per day without reaching the threshold where fipronil levels become dangerous. This includes products that contain egg, like pancakes or pasta. An adult who weights 65 kg (143 lb) could eat 7 eggs a day. The levels currently measured in contaminated eggs aren't very high and thus not dangerous for adults, however authorities and experts have advised parents to not let their children eat contaminated eggs (http://www.dw.com/en/fipronil-what-is-it-and-how-did-it-get-into-our-eggs/a-39963678).

Additionally, according to the UK Food Standards Agency (https://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2017/16423/update-on-fipronil-in-eggs): "Our risk assessment, based on all the information available, indicates that as part of a normal healthy diet this low level of potential exposure is unlikely to be a risk to public health and there is no need for consumers to be concerned. Our advice is that there is no need for people to change the way they consume or cook eggs or products containing eggs."

So while fipronil is not approved for use in food producing animals, the agencies monitoring this situation have a risk assessment in place indicating the risk is low to consumers, but nevertheless are acting out of caution to protect them. - Mod.TG]

[In addition to the detection of fipronil-contaminated eggs in France reported above, such findings have now been reported from several other European countries, including Romania, Sweden, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and the UK.

One ton of contaminated egg yolk liquid was uncovered in Romania later on Thu 10 Aug 2017, according to the country's veterinary health authority ANSVSA. It was the 1st discovery of contaminated egg product in eastern Europe since the scandal erupted. The egg yolk liquid was found in a warehouse on the western side of the country and had been imported from Germany, but "none of the product has been offered for sale," said ANSVSA.

British authorities reported earlier on [Thu 10 Aug 2017] that around 700 000 eggs from affected Dutch farms had been distributed in Britain. The UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the eggs were mixed in large batches to be used in processed foods and not sold fresh, as they were in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. 4 major British grocery chains have withdrawn such products, including sandwiches and salads, the FSA said in a statement. "However, as this represents 0.007 per cent of the eggs we consume in the UK every year, it remains the case that it is very unlikely that there is any risk to public health from consuming these foods," the statement said. The FSA also said that the recalls were not being carried out owing to safety concerns, but because the ingredient is not authorized for use.

Luxembourg said that eggs sold in the discount supermarket Aldi had been withdrawn after one batch was found to contain sufficient levels of fipronil to potentially pose a threat to young children, who cannot consume as much as adults safely. Aldi earlier this month [August 2017] pulled all Dutch eggs from its stores in Germany, but the company said on [Thu 10 Aug 2017] that its German markets would restock eggs as of [Fri 11 Aug 2017]. Police in the Netherlands have detained 2 men suspected of being involved in the illegal use of fipronil. Millions of fipronil-contaminated eggs have been recalled since the scandal broke.
