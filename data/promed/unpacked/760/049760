On Thu 20 May 2021, ARS Bourgogne-Franche-Comte announced that the tiger mosquito has been found since 2020 in Doubs and Jura. The regional health agency is monitoring the presence and development of the insect and the vector of chikungunya virus, dengue fever, and Zika virus.

The tiger mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_ from its Latin name [if this is the Asian tiger mosquito, it is _Aedes albopictus_ not _Aedes aegypti_. - Mod.TY], is now established in Doubs and Jura, according to a press release letter from ARS Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, published on Thu 20 May 2021. According to the agency, since last year [2020], the insect has been present in 2 Franche-Comte divisions. Therefore, a program to monitor its presence was launched. Therefore, "nest traps" [oviposition traps] were set up, especially in the most affected cities.

The tiger mosquito is an invasive species. Native to the forests of Southeast Asia, this insect has spread to many parts of the world thanks to trade. Away from the tropics, it has adapted to colder temperatures in the winter. It is estimated that it is now found in 100 different countries and 64 French departments. The tiger mosquito's progress is being closely monitored, as it can be a vector for 3 serious and deadly diseases: chikungunya, dengue fever, and Zika. In fact, if an infected person is bitten, the mosquito can then pass it on to other people by bite.

ARS gives some tips to identifying the tiger mosquito and preventing its spread. It can usually be recognized by its "white stripe on the thorax and spots on the legs." The same is the case with the 'biting apparatus.'

"_Aedes aegypti_ [_Ae. albopictus_] is small: less than a centimeter in wingspan, smaller than a coin, so, it should not be confused with other long-legged flying insects. The tiger mosquito is active from May to November. It bites day and night, and the bite is painful.

To protect yourself from this mosquito's arrival in our cities, the agency advises against leaving standing water in your garden or around your home. Hence, it is necessary to "empty cups and saucers at least once a week" from flowerpots, animal bowls, tarpaulins, buckets, or even umbrella bases. Other tips: maintenance of gutters, disposal of waste and used tires, and covering water pools. In ponds, fish and frogs eat larvae.

If you think you might spot a tiger mosquito, try snapping a photo of it. You can then report that to the online reporting portal. Additional information is available on their appearance and behavior. If you think you have been bitten by a tiger mosquito, it is recommended to disinfect the bite as quickly as possible (within 15 minutes) and then report it on the same site. In France, it is currently very rare for a tiger mosquito to carry a disease transmitted to humans; it must 1st bite an infected person. However, there is no current epidemic of the 3 diseases it transmits in urban France.

[Above, the mosquito species is doubtless misreported as _Aedes aegypti_ when it probably should have been written as _Aedes albopictus_.

Finding this mosquito in a new geographical area in eastern France is not surprising. As noted earlier, _Aedes albopictus_ has been expanding its geographic range in southern Europe for several years. The rapid expanse northward in France is noteworthy. It has gone from 41 departments reported in April 2018 to 51 departments in 2019, 57 departments in 2020 and now to 64 departments. The established mosquito surveillance system in France doubtless will detect further expansion, which seems likely. The risk of initiation of ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses following introduction from elsewhere will depend on population abundance of mosquito vectors and susceptible human population densities as well as the amount of time that people spend out-of-doors in areas where there is risk of bites by these mosquitoes.

Eradication of this mosquito from France is not possible with current pest control measures. This expansion will be an interesting situation to watch over the coming months and years. - Mod.TY
