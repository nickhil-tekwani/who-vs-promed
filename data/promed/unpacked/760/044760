The pertussis outbreak in Grand Traverse County [Michigan] has reached 70 confirmed cases, plus 14 cases of a similar disease, called parapertussis, according to the health department. Students at 19 schools in the county have been affected by the disease, also known as whooping cough. The county health department has received 3750 calls to the hotline set up to field questions from parents of children who may have been exposed to the illness.

As they announced the update on the outbreak on Thu 18 Dec 2014, health officials urged residents to get vaccinated in advance of holiday travel and get-togethers. "Preventing severe disease and death in infants is our highest priority," said Wendy Trute, the Grand Traverse health officer. "We urge all pregnant women to get vaccinated. We also urge parents to vaccinate infants as soon as possible."

A pertussis outbreak was reported in November 2014 at Grand Traverse Academy, a charter school. The number of confirmed cases linked to the school remains at 12, said Mike Lahey. He did not have numbers on the cases in the Traverse City Area Public School District.

As of Thu 18 Dec 2014, 9 students in Three Forks Schools [Gallatin County, Montana] are confirmed to have whooping cough. 4 children in grades kindergarten through 5th have the respiratory illness and 5 in the middle and high school contracted it. A press release issued on the school's website on states, "The school is a safe place for all stakeholders and unless your son or daughter has been diagnosed with pertussis, there is not any reason that they should not be in school."

Whooping cough is spread in much the same way as a regular cold virus, by coughing or sneezing while in close contact with others who then breath in the bacteria. There is a pertussis vaccination, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] says is the most effective tool in preventing the disease. But the vaccine is not 100 per cent effective.

Three Forks School officials say the Gallatin City-County Health Department is working closely with the school staff to interview every person with a confirmed case of pertussis to identify close contacts. According to Gallatin City-County health officer Matt Kelley, there have been no other confirmed pertussis cases at other schools in the Gallatin Valley.

An eastern Nebraska health department is reporting several cases of whooping cough. The Fremont Tribune reports that Three Rivers Health Department in Fremont says at least 2 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed in the district, which includes Dodge, Saunders and Washington counties.

Whooping cough, or pertussis, is spread when infected people cough or sneeze. It starts like the common cold and can progress into violent coughing spells.

California officials are battling the worst whooping cough epidemic to hit the state in 7 decades as a recent rebound in cases raises questions about the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine. Doctors emphasize that the inoculation has led to fewer deaths than in the past and in instances where people do get sick, their illnesses aren't as severe. But California officials say the limited protection of the vaccine introduced in the 1990s has led to the rise in cases. Research has shown it doesn't last as long as the one it replaced, and a new study suggests the vaccine may not prevent the spread of the disease. Whooping cough peaks every 3 to 5 years, and California's last epidemic was in 2010. But despite an aggressive public health campaign in response, the current outbreak is worse.

A total of 9935 cases were reported to the California Department of Public Health from 1 Jan 2014 to 26 Nov 2014, the highest number in 70 years. The cases included an infant who died. Elementary, middle and high school outbreaks have occurred across the state. San Diego County is among the hardest hit areas with 1819 cases reported so far in 2014.

"We'd have to go way back to the 1940s to find more cases," said Dr Eric McDonald, medical director of the epidemiology and immunization branch for public health services in San Diego County. That's when whooping cough was common, causing hundreds of thousands of illnesses annually and thousands of deaths. But after a vaccine was introduced in the 1940s, cases dropped to fewer than 5000 a year. That vaccine was replaced in the 1990s because of side effects, which included pain and swelling from the shot and fever. The newer vaccine is part of routine childhood vaccinations as well as adult booster shots. [the older killed whole cell vaccine was thought to be too reactogenic in adults. - Mod.LL]

2013 was the nation's worst year for whooping cough in 6 decades; health officials received reports of more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000.

Dr Gil Chavez, epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, does not believe low inoculation rates are the primary cause of the current epidemic: Of this year's [2014] pediatric cases that had information on the child's vaccination history, only 10 per cent of those infected in 2014 had not been vaccinated against pertussis. Chavez says the new vaccine's limitations and better tests have led to the increase in cases.

The East Holmes School District [Holmes County, Ohio] is telling 78 students from 2 elementary schools to stay at home after they might have been exposed to whooping cough, and have either not been vaccinated or their vaccinations are not complete. Holmes County Health Department director Dr DJ McFadden said 3 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, have been confirmed in the county.

"It does happen, but it doesn't happen as regularly as it is happening now. I mean, we are back to higher, as high of rates as we had before vaccinations in some parts of the country," McFadden said.

McFadden made the recommendation to the school district to keep the kids home to try and limit the spread of the disease. "They are well at this time and I certainly hope they are excluded for no good reason. There's about a week-long process to display symptoms so these children could be ill and we just don't know it yet so they are excluded as that precaution because if they are sick those symptoms will show up soon and they could be exposing other people at the same time," said East Holmes superintendent Joe Edinger.

Edinger said parents make decisions regarding the immunizations based on a number of good reasons. "Maybe history with other children having reactions to the immunizations or for religious and cultural reasons and with that decision they accept the fact that when an outbreak occurs they will be asked to stay home," Edinger said. Although the county has a large Amish population, Edinger said most of the kids who are being told to stay home are not Amish.

The timing means students will miss only about a week of classes before Christmas break. They will also miss their school's Christmas activities, but the school and the health district are not stopping them from attending family functions or other community events.

It's a startling sound, especially if you're the parent of a small child. A deep cough with a "whoop" sound is the sign of pertussis, also called whooping cough. It starts like a cold with a low fever and even a runny nose, but if left untreated, a lingering cough with the recognizable sound could lead to some serious health problems.

The number of pertussis cases is rising around the country, and has claimed 2 lives in Texas this year [2014]. More than 25 per cent of pertussis cases in children result in a hospital stay, according to health reports. Pediatrician Melanie Wick said adults or teenagers can be the culprits when it comes to spreading pertussis. "We can get a cough that lasts for several weeks and we are the ones that expose those little children to pertussis," wick said.

Wick said it's common to see more respiratory illnesses during the winter months when more people are indoors for longer times of the day. Some of the more serious complications of pertussis include pneumonia and apnea -- where one stops breathing for brief periods.

While pertussis has been elevated to an epidemic status by health agencies in California, Wick said the number of patients she has seen with the illness here in East Texas in 2014 is about average. NetHealth, which surveyed 6 counties, said 94 cases of pertussis have been reported: Smith County accounted for 74 of those cases.

In Texas, just under 2200 cases have occurred in 2014 including 2 deaths. Nearly 50 percent of cases have been in children under the age of 7.

A New Mexico school district is warning parents about whooping cough. Los Lunas schools [Valencia County] sent emails to parents and even called them saying there have been several cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, in the area.

Health officials say whooping cough tends to hit in waves. In New Mexico in 2012, there were nearly 900 cases. In 2013 there were more than 600; so far in 2014 there were about 300.

[The increase in the number of cases of pertussis in the past few years in the USA is likely multifactorial, although in part due to the wave-like nature of the disease over years it is clear that the acellular vaccine, which is much better tolerated in children and can be given to adults, does not protect against _Bordetella pertussis_ as long. There is also some evidence that recent clonal strains have toxins that are less antigenic similar to the vaccine strain. - Mod.LL
