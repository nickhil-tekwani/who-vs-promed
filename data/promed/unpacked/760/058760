Russia: Hepatitis A Outbreak Expanding in Tver Region
-----------------------------------------------------
The continuing spread of hepatitis A, a viral liver disease, in the Tver
region has prompted urgent measures to decontaminate sewage waters near the
Moskva River, Russian chief sanitarian Gennady Onishchenko said in an
interview with Rossiskaya Gazeta published on Thu 9 Jun 2005. The city of
Rzhev in the Tver region located 480 kilometers south of Moscow has been most
affected.
"It is important to prevent the further spread of infection," Onischenko said.
Epidemiologists have arranged additional control of catering services and
trade services, the water supply and sewage systems. Medical students will
interview people door-to-door about suspected symptoms. Workers in the
catering sector will be vaccinated in Rzhev.
Moscow's Central Institute of Epidemiology, St. Petersburg's Pasteur Institute
of Epidemiology, and the Gabrichevsky Institute of Epidemiology have sent
specialists to Rzhev, Onishchenko said. He said a diagnostic laboratory had
been relocated to Rzhev. A decision has been made to clean the city to prevent
contamination of the Moskva River, which flows to Moscow, and measures have
been taken to treat sewage, Onishchenko said.
An Itar-Tass correspondent in Tver said the incidence of hepatitis A is
growing unrelentingly in the southwestern Tver region, having reached 352
cases, including 75 children. 67 more people were hospitalised with symptoms
of infection on Wed 8 Jun 2005, including cases in the Rzhev, Zubtsovsky, and
Olenensky districts. Another batch of anti-hepatitis vaccine will be delivered
to Rzhev.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred throughout Russia recently due to
breakdowns in sewage disposal facilities, contamination of general water
supplies, and inadequacies in the provision of drinking water. Although
improvements in social infrastructure are being given priority, anti-hepatitis
A virus vaccination is advisable for all visitors to Russia. - Mod.CP]
