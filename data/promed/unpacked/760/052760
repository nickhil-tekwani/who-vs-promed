Bovine TB outbreak declared a disaster by Alberta government
------------------------------------------------------------
[This headline may well be true, with 10 000 or more cattle being slaughtered. Please see the 28 Nov 2016 article: http://globalnews.ca/news/3093706/10000-cattle-to-be-killed-after-bovine-tuberculosis-outbreak/. - Mod.TG]

The Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association says a ranch in the southwestern part of the province is under quarantine.

Citing "the economic losses and hardship" caused by the bovine tuberculosis outbreak among Alberta cattle this year [2016], the Notley government officially declared the problem a disaster in a release issued Thursday [15 Dec 2016].

Concerns about the contagious disease 1st surfaced in late October [2016] when dozens of southeastern Alberta ranches were quarantined after bovine tuberculosis was reported in a single cow from Alberta that was slaughtered in the United States.

Since then, the outbreak has resulted in about 26 000 cattle at farms in Alberta and Saskatchewan being quarantined. [According to the above referenced article, almost half of these were slaughtered. - Mod.TG]

Late last month [November 2016], federal Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay said the government will provide up to CAD 16.7 million [about USD 12.5 million] in compensation to western ranchers impacted by the quarantine.

The money is geared toward helping with feed for animals, transportation, cleaning and disinfection as well as interest costs on loans.

According to federal officials, at least 10 000 cattle will be slaughtered as a result of the outbreak with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) saying the animals are considered "high risk" for contracting or transmitting the infectious disease.

With Alberta declaring bovine tuberculosis a disaster, the province is able to increase its operating expenses beyond what was previously budgeted. The government will provide emergency financial relief to producers through the federal-provincial AgriRecovery Framework. To actually gain access to the financial help available, the ranchers will go through programs offered by the Agriculture Financial Services Corporation.

The CFIA also has information for producers on how to apply for compensation on its website.

According to the CFIA's most recent update Wednesday [14 Dec 2016], to date there have been 6 confirmed cases of the disease, a number which includes the cow that had the disease when it was slaughtered in the U.S.

The agency said all confirmed cases "are still from one infected herd located on 18 premises." [This statement is somewhat difficult for some people. A single herd occupying 18 different premises? Are they moved that often? Or are the 18 premises all owned by one owner who moves various cattle through these premises as calving, breeding, finishing all occur? Likely it is the latter. - Mod.TG]

As of Wednesday, the CFIA said 40 of the total of 45 premises that remain under quarantine are in Alberta, with the remaining 5 in Saskatchewan.

The total number of premises currently under quarantine and movement controls is approximately 45. Movement controls have been removed from animals at 6 low risk premises where appropriate testing has been completed.

The CFIA said all farms under quarantine will be subject to on-farm testing and it expects the process to be completed early next month [January 2017].

The last round of reactor animals were humanely slaughtered and showed no lesions or other clinical signs of the disease," the CFIA said in its update. "This is encouraging but is not confirmation the animal does not have bovine TB. Confirmation an animal does not have TB can only be provided by confirmed negative results of a culture test."

[This is a disaster for all involved: the cattle, the cattle owners, and the government. No doubt funding assistance for feeding, etc. is very welcome, but the funding issue seems to always come with red tape. Likewise, adjusting government budgets is necessary and will certainly have a ripple effect through other previously budgeted programs. We hope no new cases of TB are found. - Mod.TG
