The BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control and Vancouver Coastal Health officials are warning gay and bisexual men of an alarming increase in the number of syphilis infections.

The highly contagious disease is at the highest level seen in 30 years in the region, said Dr Reka Gustafson, medical health officer for the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority. The organization said in news release that last year [2012] there were 371 reported cases in BC, and 80 percent of them were in the Vancouver region. "We've had a significant increase in syphilis. It's mostly affecting gay men and other men who have sex with men," Gustafson said. "It's actually part of an increase that's being seen throughout North America in large cities."

The underlying cause of the increase is not clear, she said, but rates of infection for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases are stable. Health officials said syphilis is often mistaken for other diseases, and it can fail to present symptoms or present only mild symptoms. It's easily treatable but left untreated it can cause blindness, hearing loss, bone pain and neurological problems. Severe cases can be fatal.

The disease can be transmitted through close contact during oral, vaginal or anal sex, and it increases the risk of HIV infection. Symptoms include sores resembling bug bites, rashes on the palms and soles of the feet, fever, swollen lymph glands, and weight loss.

Health authorities are urging sexually active gay and bisexual men to be tested every 3 to 6 months. They also warned that pregnant women can transmit the infection to unborn children. Geoff Ford, a nurse educator with the health authority's STOP HIV outreach team, urged regular testing. "Catching the disease early and treating it with antibiotics is far easier than the consequences of syphilis when it's too late," he said.

[The increased incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis (the contagious forms of syphilis) in British Columbia is in line with reports from other parts of Canada, the US, and elsewhere in the world, that have appeared in prior ProMED-mail posts (see below).

The increase in incidence in recent years has been primarily a result of increases in cases among younger men and among men who have sex with men (MSM). For example, in the US, during the 1990s, P&S syphilis primarily occurred among heterosexual men and women; during the 2000s, however, cases increased among MSM; by 2011 MSM accounted for 72 percent of all P&S syphilis cases (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis-detailed.htm). In 2002, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 30-39 years old, but by 2011, rates of P&S syphilis were highest among men 20-29 years old (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/STDFact-Syphilis-detailed.htm).

Reported increases in incidence of P&S syphilis among MSM have been characterized at times by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in P&S syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue," that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Canada can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1*kk. British Columbia is the westernmost province of Canada; its largest city Vancouver, with a population of 603 502 in 2011, is a coastal seaport on the mainland of the province (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver). The population of Greater Vancouver is about 2.5 million (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia).
