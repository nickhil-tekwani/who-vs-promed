2003/077 Absence of Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid in Canada
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has recently informed the EPPO
Secretariat about the status of Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd -
EPPO A2 quarantine pest) in Canada.
There were occurrences of PSTVd in Canada in the 1950s, and at that time
several actions were taken, mostly through the seed potato certification
programme, to eradicate PSTVd from Canada. All nuclear stock seed potatoes
were laboratory-tested and inspections of other stages followed in cases of
suspected viroid infection.
As a result PSTVd has not been found in Canadian seed potatoes since 1980.
No PSTVd has been detected in Prince Edward Island or New Brunswick since
1989, and it has been officially considered eradicated on the basis of
regular surveys.
More recently, surveys confirmed its absence from 3 other provinces:
Alberta, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan (De Boer et al., 2002). In
these provinces, 400 leaves were randomly collected from 201 and 225 fields
of seed and ware potatoes, respectively, in 1999 and 2000. Composite
samples of 100 leaves were tested (by dot-blot) for PSTVd and all results
were negative.
Considering the negative results obtained in laboratory tests and the
failure to detect the disease in field inspections for many years, Alberta,
British Columbia, and Saskatchewan should be considered as PSTVd-free.
Additional surveys are ongoing in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Newfoundland,
Manitoba, Quebec on seed and ware potatoes, in an effort to declare PSTVd
officially eradicated from Canada. So far, PSTVd has not been detected.
CFIA also pointed out that PSTVd has never been found on tomato in Canada.
The situation of PSTVd in Canada can be described as follows: Absent,
reported in the 1950s but no longer found. Ongoing surveys are being
performed in view of an official declaration of eradication.

[Eradication of any pathogen is an accomplishment. However, pathogens have
a way of unexpectedly returning. The price of PSTVd freedom is vigilance on
the part of quarantine agencies and sensible actions of those who are in
the business of moving germ plasm around the world. - Mod.DH]
