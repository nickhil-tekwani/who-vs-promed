An outbreak of a disease transmitted by rat urine has killed at least
22 people in rural Thailand and made hundreds ill, health officials
said yesterday. The outbreak of leptospirosis, otherwise known as
Weil's disease, has centered on the northern province of Prae and
the northeastern province of Surin, the officials said.
An official in Surin said 12 people had died of the disease in the
province this year and about 90 people had been taken to hospital.

Puchong Veerapalin, chief of Prae provincial health office, said the
death toll in his province had risen to 10, while 121 were ill from
the disease.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease most commonly spread by rats and
other rodents. Humans can contract it via scratches or other wounds
when walking in contaminated water or by being bitten by an infected
creature. The officials blamed diseased rat urine for the outbreaks
and said most victims were infected through cuts and scratches caused
by rice stalks or sharp grass.
Leptospirosis is caused by hooked organisms that burrow into organs
like the kidneys, lungs and liver. It leads to jaundice, meningitis
and kidney failure.
