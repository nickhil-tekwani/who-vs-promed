[The location of the current outbreak is about 80 km (50 miles) north-west of the previous, initial reported outbreak (in Wazani; see map at the bottom of http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013040_20130218_171818.pdf). The disease is considered to be disseminated through significant geographical parts of Lebanon. The current case seems, reportedly, to have been discovered in animals illegally moved from infected premises elsewhere.

The applied vaccine is described as 'KenyaVac.' This, most probably, is the live Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine KSGP 0240. If this is indeed the case, the Lebanese authorities deserve to be aware of the potential adverse generalised reactions to this vaccine if applied in _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds, as observed and documented in south Israel/Gaza strip in the early 90's. - Mod.AS
