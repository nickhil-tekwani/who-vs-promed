A 16 year old youth, resident of Quilpue who is hospitalized in the Sótero del Río Hospital in Puerto Alto, is the 1st suspected case of hantavirus [infection] in the Valparaiso region so far this year [2018].

The Institute of Public Health (ISP) will issue the information to confirm or discard if this case involves this disease or not.

The Valparaiso Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat], Maria Graciela Astudillo, stated that, "we were informed about the admission of a suspected hantavirus [infection] case to the Limache Hospital and that the patient was sent to the Quillota Hospital, where the medical team determined he be sent to Santiago, to the Hospital Sótero del Río".

"According to the information that we have received from the staff, the patient is progressing positively with treatment and is currently in good general condition; we hope that the results of the corresponding tests [on samples] that were sent to the Institute of Public Health will determine the diagnosis," added the official.

The Valparaiso Health SEREMI also indicated that there is no epidemiological surveillance involving the family of the boy or his school classmates, since the disease [virus] is spread from rodents [Not always; see below. - Mod.TY].

[There is no indication that the infected boy has developed hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and requires mechanical ventilation. If this is confirmed as a hantavirus infection, the conditions under which the boy acquired it are not stated. The boy likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Valparaiso region, and cases of hantavirus infection, sometimes with the pulmonary syndrome, occur there.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person, and when it is, it is only through very close physical contact, usually within the family. This would justify careful monitoring of his family members. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
