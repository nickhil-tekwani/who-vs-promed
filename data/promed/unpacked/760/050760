Five geese which died in southeastern Hungary are
being tested for suspected bird flu, an official
of the farm ministry was quoted as saying on Monday [22 Jan 2007].
The dead birds, which are being tested in
Budapest, come from a large farm in southeastern
Csongrad county where about 40 geese fell sick
and some died, Farming Ministry Secretary of
State Fulop Benedek told the national news agency MTI.
Veterinarians who saw the birds said the suspicion of bird flu was justified.
The Hungarian authorities established a protected
zone around the farm and informed international
organizations concerned, Benedek said. Hungary
culled a million birds after the highly
infectious H5N1 strain of bird flu hit domestic poultry last summer.

[2] FAO update
Date: Tue, 23 Jan 2007
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
Source: FAO NEWS RELEASE 07/0 [edited]
<http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2007/1000483/index.html>

FAO today expressed concern about new flare-ups
of avian influenza in China, Egypt, Indonesia,
Japan, Nigeria, South Korea, Thailand and Viet
Nam but stressed that the number of outbreaks in
the first weeks of 2007 has been significantly
lower than the epidemic waves of 2006. The UN
agency urged countries to remain vigilant and
fully cooperate with international organizations.
The virus continues to kill people and damage farmers' livelihoods.
FAO noted that it seemed that the
intercontinental spread of the H5N1 virus by wild
birds migrating from Asia to Europe and Africa
had not taken place during this
autumn/winter season at the same level as it had in 2005.
However, poultry trade and the transport of live
birds could still spread the virus. Cold weather
enhances virus survival, but farming systems and
wild bird migration as well as the movement of
animals during important holiday seasons (Tet, Eid, etc.) also play a role.
The virus persists in several Asian countries as
well as in Egypt and Nigeria. Other countries may
have been affected but have yet to report.
With the start of the 1st epidemic wave in Asia
in late 2003 and early 2004, 8 countries became
infected. During 2004/05, the situation improved
in some countries but remained largely unchanged.
In 2005/06, the virus spread from East Asia to
Siberia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Africa with over 40 countries affected. Since the
beginning of 2007, 8 countries have reported infections.
"So far many countries have managed to
progressively control the virus and the global
situation has improved," said Juan Lubroth,
Senior Officer of the FAO Animal Health Service,
at a press conference in Bangkok today. "Recent
outbreaks are following a seasonal pattern and do
not come as a great surprise. But we need to
remain on the alert as the recent outbreaks show.
It is crucial that countries themselves step up
their surveillance, detection and rapid response measures."
It will probably take several years to contain
and finally eradicate the H5N1 virus from the
poultry sector. This requires a strong commitment
from governments, poultry farmers and the
international community. Targeting the
circulation of the H5N1 virus in poultry should remain the priority.
Absolute transparency about disease outbreaks,
involving farmers directly in surveillance and
reporting activities and establishing
compensation schemes are key to making bird flu control campaigns successful.
"Only immediate reporting of any suspected bird
flu outbreak makes possible rapid intervention by
farmers and veterinarians," Lubroth said.
"Unfortunately, many outbreaks remain unreported.
National and international bodies are often not
in a position to immediately verify rumors or
reports about unconfirmed outbreaks."
FAO warned that the banning of backyard poultry
or duck raising could lead to illegal poultry
production. "Implementing and controlling these
bans will be very difficult. For economic reasons
farmers will tend to hide their animals and will
not participate in vaccination or movement
controls," Lubroth said. Instead of banning
production, farmers should be encouraged to
participate in virus control and vaccination campaigns.
In view of the widespread virus distribution in
Indonesia, FAO has suggested that in addition to
ongoing control measures, day-old chicks should
be vaccinated before they leave their hatcheries
and are nationally distributed, as well as
blanket vaccination in heavily infected districts.
FAO also said that the private sector should be
more closely involved in avian influenza control campaigns.

The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department (AFCD) said today (22 Jan 2007) that
the Japanese White-eye, the House Crow and the
White-backed Munia found earlier were confirmed
to be H5N1 positive after a series of laboratory tests.
The carcass of the Japanese White-eye [_Zosterops
japonicus_, picture at

was collected by AFCD staff on 15 Jan 2007 on
Convair Drive, San Po Kong. The House Crow and
the White-backed Munia [_Lonchura striata_,

<http://pragtfinker.com/images/fugle/asien/lonchura_striata.png>]
were found on 16 Jan 2007 from Lai On Estate,
Sham Shui Po and at 101 ï¿½ 109 Boundary Street, Mong Kok, respectively.
A department spokesman reminded the public to observe good personal hygiene.
"They should avoid personal contact with wild
birds and live poultry and clean their hands
thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said.

[4] Japan (Miyazaki), suspected 2nd outbreak

A fresh outbreak of bird flu was suspected in
Japan on Tuesday [23 Jan 2007] after 250 birds
died at a poultry farm in southwestern Japan, Kyodo news agency reported.
Kyodo said the birds had died at a farm in
Miyazaki Prefecture, where earlier this month the
government confirmed a case of the lethal H5N1
strain of the virus -- Japan's first such case in 3 years.
Local officials were conducting tests to see
whether the deaths were from bird flu, Kyodo
added. Even if an initial test proves positive, confirmation could take days.
Neither agriculture ministry nor prefectural
officials could confirm the Kyodo report.
Renewed fears over the disease have rippled
across Asia recently. Hong Kong confirmed on
Monday that 3 more dead birds found in the city
carried the H5N1 virus, the third such case this month in the wealthy city.
Miyazaki on Japan's southernmost island of Kyushu
is the country's top breeder of chickens.
In 2004, Japan had 4 outbreaks of the H5N1 type
strain in poultry between January and March,
including an outbreak in Kyoto in western Japan
that led to the disposal of about 240 000 chickens and 20 million eggs.

Thailand's livestock authorities on Tuesday [23
Jan 2007] confirmed the country's 2nd case of
bird flu outbreak in 2007, saying they had
detected the deadly H5N1 virus among chickens in
the northeastern border province of Nong
Khai.[Bordering Laos; No 12, North-East,
interactive map
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand#List_of_provinces>].
The results of laboratory tests confirmed H5N1
virus in some 200 chickens at a poultry farm in
Nong Khai, a senior livestock department official
was quoted by Thai News Agency as saying.
Earlier reports said that some 2000 chickens at
the farm had been culled, in Si Chiangmai
district, Nong Khai province, some 615 km
northeast of Bangkok, bordering Laos, after the
230 chickens at the farm died of unknown causes last Saturday.
Thailand's Livestock Development Department
director-general Pirom Srichan said the district
has been declared an outbreak area with
round-the-clock monitoring to prevent the illegal movement of poultry.
The 1st bird flu outbreak of 2007 was reported on
15 Jan when authorities confirmed that the H5N1
virus was found in dead ducks in northern
province of Phitsanulok. [see the map referenced above, No 12, North].

[6] Japan, studies on origin

The avian flu that killed thousands of chickens
in Miyazaki Prefecture is almost identical to the
one that sparked an epidemic in China that has
been spreading since 2005, experts said.
The experts, citing test results of DNA samples,
said the highly virulent strain of the virus
might have been carried by migratory birds from China to Japan.
The National Institute of Animal Health in
Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, has been analyzing
the virus after obtaining samples from dead
chickens at a poultry farm in Kiyotake, Miyazaki
Prefecture, in mid-January 2007.
The test results showed that the strain found on
the Kiyotake farm was at least a 99-percent match
in terms of DNA sequencing with the H5N1 strain
confirmed in China in May 2005, the experts said.
The strain at the Kiyotake farm is apparently
genetically different from the other H5N1 strain
of avian flu that has caused outbreaks in Southeast Asia, they added.
Several thousand migratory birds have been killed
by avian flu at Qinghai Lake, China's largest
lake, in the western part of the country.
Scientists were shocked by the birds' deaths
because they had shared the view that wild fowl,
in general, would not develop symptoms stemming from avian flu.
According to the World Health Organization, 13
people were killed in China in 2005 and 2006,
possibly by the strain of avian flu in question.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries is trying to determine the route of the
infection that ended up killing thousands of
chickens at the Kiyotake farm, the sources said.
The same H5N1 strain is believed to have caused
an epidemic in South Korea in November 2006.

The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has resurfaced
in the city of Kano, northern Nigeria's
commercial capital, according to veterinary officials.
Shehu Bawa, the head of Kano State's avian flu
committee, has stated that in the last 2 months
it has been confirmed that at least seven poultry
farms in the city have been tested positive for
bird flu, resulting in the culling of about 10 000 birds.
Katsina and Sokoto, 2 northern states, have
recorded outbreaks of a disease suspected to be
avian influenza. Laboratory tests are still being
conducted at the national Veterinary Research
Institute in central city of Jos for confirmation.
Kano was worst affected by the bird flu outbreak
since the disease was first detected on a farm in Jaji in February 2006.
According to Nigeria's Department of Veterinary
Research, since the bird flu outbreak began in
February 2006, a total of 945 862 birds have been
lost, of which 602 160 were culled.
Bawa blamed migratory birds from Europe for the
outbreak in Nigeria, adding that as long as the
movement of these birds was not checked there
would be a recurrence every year, although
improved bio-security measures by farmers helped in minimising its spread.
