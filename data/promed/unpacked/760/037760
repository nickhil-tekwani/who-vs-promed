A mysterious lung disease that has infected and decimated large herds of
cattle in Sesheke district in Zambia poses an imminent threat to the
livestock industry in Caprivi.
The disease is said to have baffled experts who are trying to pinpoint the
virus [see commentary] that infects the lungs, from where it leaves the
diseased lungs in yellowish legions. Infected herds also suffer significant
weight loss.
Subsistence farmers who are said to have suffered significant stock losses
are mainly in areas such as Sikaunzwe, Simalaha, Kasaya, Mambova, and
Kazungula, sharing the Zambezi River as a natural boundary with settlements
along the river.
Though the unknown livestock disease is said to have broken out a few
months ago since the first cases were initially detected, it is believed to
have reached a crescendo in November, decimating large herds of livestock.
Villagers here depend mostly on these animals for a livelihood as they are
their source of beef and dairy products. They also use them for ploughing.
Sources say in the absence of a vaccine to contain the outbreak, officials
are rounding up and herding infected cattle towards makeshift
slaughterhouses, from where the carcasses are set on fire in an operation
akin to one that took place in Botswana where there was a similar outbreak.
The disease particularly poses a threat to Namibian livestock farmers along
the Zambezi River within the floodplain areas of the far eastern parts of
Caprivi such as Ikaba, Muzii and Impalila Island, among other villages.[See

<http://www.multimap.com/map//map/browse.cgi?lat=-17.7906&lon=24.2545&scale=4000000&icon=x>].
Some peasants in their despondence to salvage their highly-prized earthly
possessions are said to be driving their herds to relatives across the
Zambezi into villages for shelter away from the slaughter under way.
A village headman from Itomba area in Eastern Caprivi, who was approached a
day after his visit to Zambia, confirmed the disease has wiped out whole
herds of cattle in Zambia and that the Zambian government is also busy
transporting herds of cattle away from the affected areas using trucks.
He said he did not know where the cattle were being driven to and as such
he could not tell whether this was done for quarantine purposes or for the
mass slaughter of the infected livestock.
The headman also said the disease could spread to Namibia, a situation
which he believes might be detrimental to livestock farming in Caprivi. He
said he was in the process of relocating his cattle far away from the
border area with Zambia to prevent them from being infected.
State veterinarian at Katima Mulilo Dr Frank Chitate who is currently
attending a joint SADC veterinarian meeting in Livingstone, Zambia,
confirmed last week that he was aware that there has always been outbreaks
of lung disease in Zambia during the previous years though he had not yet
been informed by his Zambian counterparts about the latest outbreak.
Other efforts to seek clarity proved futile because most of the people
appear to have left for the annual Christmas break and they are simply
unreachable. If reports about the present outbreak are confirmed
officially, this could have dire financial implications on livestock sales
from Caprivi and farmers could find themselves in a very awkward financial
position when schools re-open in January as they in most cases depend on
livestock sales for school fees.

[The infectious disease which -- according to Namibian sources, is
threatening their farming industry -- is contagious bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP). The disease is caused by a mycoplasma and not a virus, as
erroneously stated in the above newswire.
CBPP is endemic in Zambia. It has been reported there in each of the recent
years, and vaccinations are carried out (450 000 bovines vaccinated in
2004). In December 2005, extensive spread was reported in Kazungula,
southern Zambia, adjacent to the borders with Zimbabwe, Botswana, and
Namibia; see map at <http://media.maps.com/magellan/Images/ZAMBIA-W1.gif>.
The causative organism of CBPP, an OIE notifiable disease, is _Mycoplasma
mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ SC (small colony), bovine biotype. For further
data, including the requirements from the vaccine, subscribers are referred
to OIE's "Manual of standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2004", Chapter
2.1.6, at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00029.htm>. Cattle breeds
should be assessed for their sensitivity before mass vaccination. -Mod.AS]
