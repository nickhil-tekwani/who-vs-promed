Helicopters and trucks will be used to spray all of New York City with
insecticide to stem [the outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis = SLE that has
claimed three lives and may be spreading, officials said Thursday. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani indicated the entire city would be sprayed. Current plans
are to extend the spraying of the insecticide malathion from the boroughs
of Queens and the Bronx to all five city boroughs in the coming weeks.
"The information we received is that there is a possibility that if you
don't continue to spray, the whole thing can start up again,'' Giuliani
said of measures to fight the first recorded outbreak of SLE in New York
City.
Three people, all of them in their 80s and living in the borough of Queens,
have died since the Sept. 2 outbreak of the viral infection that can swell
the brain, cause fevers, delirium and weakness. The disease is named after
the city where it first appeared in 1933. The number of confirmed cases
has risen from five to nine recent days, and for the first time health
officials have confirmed a case outside of Queens, in Brooklyn. But
officials said there was no reason for alarm or panic.
New York City Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said 56 other people were
waiting for laboratory results from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) to find out whether they were infected. Earlier,
officials said there were 48 suspected cases but eight more were reported
Thursday. Officials said the CDC had recommended that the entire city be
sprayed with malathion, which they say is not harmful to people, pets or
vegetables. "You have a very large [human population at risk,'' Roger
Nasci, a CDC entomologist said. "We believe this is the best approach.''
Health workers using three helicopters and six trucks will expand the
spraying effort starting Thursday in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx between
5 p.m. EDT and 9 p.m. EDT and Friday from 5 a.m. to 8 a.m., the periods
when mosquitoes are most active. Manhattan will be sprayed from trucks.
"We will continue spraying for the next few weeks and will set up a
schedule for regular spraying until there is a frost,'' said Jerome Hauer,
director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
Authorities have used helicopters and hand-held spraying devices since the
outbreak to spray malathion in Queens and the Bronx in parkland,
nonresidential areas and public schools.

[I feel a lot better knowing at Roger Nasci is working with the NY City
folks on this problem. From this, I assume that CDC's Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases (Fort Collins, Colorado) is handling the
serologic confirmation and perhaps the virus isolation and identification
work.
It continues to be disturbing but not surprising that cases continue,
having now extended from Queens to Brooklyn. SLE virus is not transmitted
person-to-person but is transmitted by mosquitoes that have fed on SLE
viremic birds. Some NY birds (common ones are house sparrows, pigeons,
blue jays, grackles, starlings, and robins) can move all over the city, so
whatever adult mosquitoes are in the area of an infected bird and need a
blood meal, bird-mosquito transmission can occur. There is no need for an
infected mosquito to fly from Queens to the Bronx to cause trouble.
According to Monath ("Epidemiology" in "St. Louis encephalitis", American
Public Health Association, Washington, D.C.; 1980) attack rates/100,000 in
elder people (60 - >70 y.o.) living in the affected Delaware Valley area in
1964 were about 30 to 71 with mortality rates 5-20/100,000 and Case
Fatality ratios 17-28%. There are more data for other areas of the U.S.
but the strains of SLE virus differ and such rates and ratios might not be
comparable. However, it is clear that the number of undetected infections
usually is well underestimated. As Yogi Berra said, "It ain't over until
it's over." and it ain't over yet. - Mod.CHC
