Tanzania Bans Import Of Chloroquine
------------------------------------
Dar Es Salaam (TOMRIC Agency, 5 Jul 2000) - Tanzania has officially banned
import of chloroquine for the treatment of malaria patients following its
ineffectiveness.
Announcing the decision yesterday [4 Jul 2000, the deputy Minister for
Health, Ms. Tatu Ntimizi told the National Assembly that her ministry has
already instructed the Medical Stores Department (MSD) not to import,
noting that what is available in shops is only a leftover of what was
imported earlier. She said the MSD has already made alternative medicines
for malaria treatment, to arrive in the country within 6 months [must be
imported medicine. "The MSD had already awarded a tender for the
importation of medicines which will replace chloroquine."
On Monday [3 Jul 2000 the government said it was reviewing its policy on
treatment of malaria to make fansidar the first treatment for malaria. The
Minister for Health, Aaron Chiduo had earlier said that research on
treatment of malaria carried out from 1997 to 1999 revealed that
chloroquine was ineffective in curing malaria by 20 to 25 percent. However,
Ntimizi said medical record show that depending upon locality, chloroquine
had lost the ability to cure malaria in up to 50 percent [of cases in some
areas. Discussion on the effectiveness of chloroquine became hot in April,
this year when it was disclosed that malaria would continue killing
millions of Tanzanians after its parasites, _Plasmodium [falciparum_ has
now developed a strong resistance against [to chloroquine which has been a
widely used drug in Tanzania. This was based on a research by the Ministry
of Health done between 1997 and 1999 which indicated that chloroquine has
lost the ability to cure malaria in almost 52 percent [of cases in various
areas in Tanzania also referred as malaria prone regions [Susceptibility is
classified as grade I, II and III and it is presumed that it must be grade
II or III in 52% of cases. -Mod. EP.
Without disclosing the figure, Ms. Ntimizi said that more patients die of
malaria in the country, noting that children and infants were more
vulnerable to the disease. The treatment is becoming complicated day after
day," she said urging the people to adopt preventive measures. The ministry
has recommended the use of other drugs like fansidar, amodiaquine and
comaquine [camoquine is the same as amodiaquine. She said quinine should
be used as a last resort.
In its report, WHO recommends sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [fansidar as an
alternative drug for treatment of malaria in Tanzania. Kenya is one of the
countries, which have already replaced chloroquine for the treatment of
falciparum malaria. Another country which stopped the use of chloroquine as
the first line medication for the disease, owing to resistant strains being
prevalent in many areas, is Malawi.

[The report is important in once again drawing the attention to the
increasing problem of drug resistance of _P.falciparum_ malaria in Africa.
Fansidar is considerably more expensive than chloroquine, and there are
already sporadic reports from East Africa of fansidar resistance.
Amodiaquine (camoquine), a chloroquine derivative, was in the eighties
thought of as an alternative because it showed higher activity than
chloroquine against _P.falciparum_ malaria. However, after introduction to
the market in industrialized countries, it was soon found that
approximately 1 per 2000 users developed agranulocytosis, and the drug is
now not used at all here. -Mod. EP
