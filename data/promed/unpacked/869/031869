[1] Liberia [Margibi County] Ebola-free soon
Date: 19 Jan 2015

http://www.heritageliberia.net/heritagenews/index.php/2014-07-17-10-02-56/health/item/896-margibi-on-path-to-becoming-ebola-free-nyenswah-discloses


The head of the Ebola Incident Management System (IMS) Tolbert Nyenswah has disclosed that Margibi County [Liberia] will soon be enlisted into the ranks of counties reporting zero Ebola cases. "Margibi County has gone 19 days without reporting a single Ebola case, and if the county continues for the next 3 days without reporting any confirmed Ebola case, it will be declared 'Ebola free' by the Ministry of Health," Nyenswah said.

He made the statement in Margibi County at the weekend at programs marking the lifting of the quarantine of Lonfaye Town in Margibi County. Recently, the Health Ministry announced that Margibi, Montserrado and Grand Cape Mount counties remain the only 3 counties in Liberia that are still reporting suspected Ebola cases, though none of the cases was confirmed.

Nyenswah, who is also Assistant Health Minister for Preventive Services, noted that the dedication and tireless effort of the Margibi County Health Team as well as support from local and international partners are a key factor in the county's success against the disease.

[2] Guinea: schools reopen, but fear persists

Schools shuttered during the height of the Ebola crisis in Guinea began reopening on Mon [19 Jan 2015], but many parents were still too afraid to send their children to classes.

Employees at the doors of schools in the capital were taking temperatures of everyone who showed up. Only those with normal readings were allowed to enter the building. Yet many pupils remained at home after rumors flew through the capital that masked workers were seen at a school building, raising questions about how safe the buildings were. "These masked people were spraying the classrooms without telling the school administration what the chemical was they were spraying and without saying why they were masked," said Idrissa Diallo, a spokesman for a local parents' association. "So we won't be sending our children to school for the moment."

Text messages also circulated Monday [19 Jan 2015] morning urging parents to keep their children at home. The misinformation frustrated teams that were working to disinfect the buildings.

The schools would normally have reopened 3 months ago, but authorities had feared that large groups of children congregating could allow the Ebola virus to spread. Guinea, though, is now showing signs of improvement. The World Health Organization [WHO] said several days ago that the country had had its lowest weekly total of new confirmed cases since mid-August 2014. Still, rumors were rampant, and some still incorrectly fear that health workers are actually spreading the disease. ... - more

[3] Vaccine trials
Date Sun 18 Jan 2015

http://www.fredericksburg.com/features/health_living/leading-ebola-vaccines-appear-safe-further-tests-starting/article_c7b3ba8b-cf3b-5be0-a931-142ec13abde5.html


The World Health Organization [WHO] says the 2 leading Ebola vaccines appear safe and will soon be tested in healthy volunteers in West Africa. After a meeting of experts this month [January 2015], WHO said there is now enough information to conclude that the 2 most advanced Ebola vaccines -- one made by GlaxoSmithKline and the other licensed by Merck and NewLink -- have "an acceptable safety profile."

Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, who heads WHO's Ebola vaccine efforts, said: "The cupboard [for Ebola vaccines] is filling up rapidly." She said further trials in healthy people in West Africa, including in health workers, are scheduled to start soon. Kieny added that several other vaccines were being developed in the U.S., Russia and elsewhere.

Despite the temporary suspension of a trial of the vaccine made by NewLink and Merck in December [2014], Kieny said there was no sign of significant side effects. That trial was put on hold while experts investigated reports of joint pain. It was an unexpected side effect, but Kieny said it was not worrying enough to stop the vaccine's development. No such side effects have been reported with the other vaccine.

The next phase of trials will likely take about 6 months, and manufacturers will ramp up their production at the same time, meaning millions of doses could be available later this year [2015].
