[Equine influenza is caused by 2 subtypes: H7N7 (formerly subtype 1) and
H3N8 (formerly subtype 2) of influenza A viruses (genus _Influenzavirus_ A
of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_). Although these are not genuine human
pathogens, humans can become infected with equine influenza virus subtypes.
Such infections are unusual and subclinical, but may represent a potential
biohazard to laboratory personnel.
In fully susceptible animals, clinical signs include pyrexia, and a harsh
dry cough followed by a mucopurulent nasal discharge. In partially immune
vaccinated animals, one or more of these signs may be absent.
Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population.
Diagnosis of influenza virus infections is based on virus isolation from
horses with acute respiratory illness, or on the demonstration of a
serological response to infection. Ideally, both methods are used.
Infection may also be demonstrated by detection of viral antigen in
respiratory secretions using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
According to OIE's epidemiological data, no outbreaks of equine influenza
have been reported by Tunisia since 1998; the disease has been reported
annually in neighboring Morocco at least since 1996 (last available report:
2003).
Readers may have noticed the optimal quality of the information included in
the current Tunisian notification. This is one of the 1st disease
notifications, obtained by OIE's Department of Epidemiology, which complies
with new, revised disease notification procedures. The proposed revisions
have been prepared by OIE's expert groups and were intended to improve
transparency in line with OIE's declared policy. The proposals can be seen
in the report of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Commission meeting of
17-28 Jan 2005:
<http://www.oie.int/tahsc/eng/Reports/A_SCCDAJAN2005.pdf>.
They were presented for final discussions to the General Session of the OIE
at the end of May 2005 and approved with minor modifications.
The current version of the notification requirements and the revised list
of notifiable diseases will be posted as soon as available. - Mod.AS]
