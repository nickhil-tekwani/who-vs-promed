Notice to Readers: Voluntary Recall of IMOVAX Rabies I.D. (Rabies Vaccine)
Used for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis
Through routine stability testing, Aventis Pasteur recently learned the
potency of one lot of IMOVAX Rabies I.D. (Rabies Vaccine), used as an
alternative to rabies vaccine administered intramuscularly for pre-exposure
prophylaxis, had fallen below specification 24 months after manufacturing.
Although this product met all specifications at the time of release, its
potency fell below specification before the product's expiration date. Only
lot P0313-2 was involved; however, lots P0030-2 and N1204-2 also are being
recalled as a precautionary measure. All 3 lots were prepared from the same
initial bulk lot.
To help ensure all persons who received a vaccination from 1 of the
recalled lots are alerted, the company is contacting all customers who
received a shipment of the recalled lots. A toll-free telephone number also
has been set up for medical inquiries about the recall, (800) 752-9340.
Persons who received pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should contact
their health-care provider to determine whether they should be re-vaccinated.
As a precaution, patients who were vaccinated with one of these lots for
pre-exposure prophylaxis---and who remain at risk for rabies
exposure---should either be tested to measure the presence of antibodies
and be vaccinated as needed (if the testing will not substantially delay
vaccination), or be re-vaccinated. Aventis Pasteur recommends patients
being re-vaccinated receive 1 dose of IMOVAX Rabies, Rabies Vaccine for
intramuscular (IM) use.
