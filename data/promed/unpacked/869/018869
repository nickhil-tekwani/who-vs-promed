Canine influenza, the potentially deadly H3N8 virus commonly known as
dog flu, is spreading. So far the virus has led to the death of one
dog last week [week of 10 Aug 2009], closed down the kennel at
Virginia's Fairfax County Animal Shelter, and, according to experts,
is now affecting dogs in at least 4 other states: Colorado, New York,
New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

While the reason for the shelter outbreak, which killed a 15-year-old
whippet owned by a clinical technician and sickened 26 dogs, remains
unknown, it's possible that one or more infected dogs from
Philadelphia or Washington DC introduced the illness to Virginia.

"Dogs often move in and out of shelter systems over long distances,
such as via breed and rescue groups," Edward Dubovi, director of the
virology center at Cornell's Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory,
told Discovery News.

"Boarding kennels and even elite doggie day care centers can also
result in cases, since, as for kennel cough spread, the virus is
highly contagious and dogs may catch it from one another," added
Dubovi.

He first isolated the canine influenza virus in 2004, after
University of Florida researchers sent him fluid and tissue samples
from greyhound race dogs that had died from a then mysterious
respiratory illness at a Florida racetrack.

Dubovi and his team determined the cause was the H3N8 equine flu
virus, which jumped from horses to dogs. In addition to spreading
from dog to dog, canines can also catch it from humans, who may have
come into contact with infected animals.

The illness has not yet sickened any people.

Signs in dogs can include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite, and a
respiratory infection that may last a few weeks. One to 5 percent of
victims die from related hemorrhagic pneumonia.

Although 30 states have reported cases over the past 5 years, Dubovi
said outbreaks are "usually sporadic and then die out." "For example,
we've seen outbreaks in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Pittsburgh, but
those all ended," he explained.

As officials work to contain the Virginia cases, nearby states and
cities are also on guard.

Tara deNicolas, a spokesperson for the Washington Humane Society,
told Discovery News, "No cases are currently in our shelter." She
added, "We're being very proactive, however, and are ordering tests
whenever any possible symptoms surface."

Just last month [July 2009], a vaccine was released for canine
influenza. Dubovi said that, "in clinical trials, it reduces viral
shedding and diminishes signs" of the illness. It's given in 2 doses,
3 weeks apart.

Dubovi would like to see "blanket vaccinations in affected areas, as
it would be nice to get this virus out of the dog population."

The virus at present is more adapted to horses than to dogs, so
wiping out the illness now would prevent future possible mutations
within canines.

Since dogs are in regular contact with their owners and other people,
the illness could potentially spread from dogs to humans in the
future, he suggested, given that it has already jumped from one
species of mammal to another.

More bad news appears to be on the horizon. Next month [September
2009], Dubovi said he will announce the discovery of yet another new
virus.

In the meantime, researchers continue to study why some viruses jump
species, and what can be done to eradicate these illnesses.

[This article sounds like cliffhanger soap opera television show:
next month he will announce the discovery of yet another new virus.

What is his motivation for waiting to make the announcement?
Marketing of another vaccine? Further confirmatory research? Or
waiting to see if it is already loose in the population? One conjures
up many endings to such a tease line, but let us hope the delay is
because of on going research for exact confirmation.

When dealing with canine influenza, it is critical to get early
medical intervention to prevent the death of the pet. We will all
welcome a licensed effective vaccine.

It is equally important to emphasize that this virus has not affected
people and is not a threat to human beings. - Mod.TG]
