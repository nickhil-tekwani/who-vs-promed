*******************
At this stage the killing of highly infected buffalo herds is still just
talk. We are starting a monitoring program in the middle of Sep 1998 during
which 600 buffalo will be culled to determine the prevalence and to get a
clearer picture of the effect of the disease on the population dynamics of
buffalo in the Park.
Mthethomusha is currently busy, with our help, to eradicate their infected
buffalo population of about 350 to 400 animals. We have made a deal with
them in that we [Kruger National Park, KNP will supply them with 60
pregnant uninfected cows from the northern part of the Park per year,
so that they can also have an opportunity to obtain disease-free
animals for their other parks.
However, it will not help them to release the cows, once the calves
have been weaned, into a heavily infected area like Mthethomusha.
That is why they have to first get rid of their infected animals.
They will, in turn, have to make 25% of the disease-free animals
available to SA National Parks for relocation to other areas.
Disease-free buffalo breeding programme
-------------------------------------------------
Disease-free buffalo have become very rare and expensive because of the
limited numbers that could be supplied by the Addo Elephant National Park.
At the same time buffalo populations in the KNP are under a serious threat
bovine tuberculosis (BTB), which has already infected the entire buffalo
population south of the Olifants river. The disease has the potential to
wipe out the entire buffalo population of the KNP. The Director of Animal
Health, in consultation with the Department of Research and Development,
National Parks Board, has agreed to allow an unique breeding programme where
it is possible to render disease-free buffalo from original KNP buffalo. The
programme involves capturing pregnant BTB-free buffalo cows in the
far-northern areas of the KNP and accommodating them in quarantine bomas
under tick-free conditions at Skukuza. The calves from these cows will be
weaned at an age of 4-6 months to assure them free of foot-&-mouth
disease.They will have to undergo various diagnostic tests and a separate
quarantine period away from the cows to determine their disease status. The
disease status of a calf will determine its destination: a disease-free calf
(the ideal) can go to any national park or game reserve; a Corridor disease
positive calf can only go to Vaalbos and Highveld, while foot and mouth
diseased calves would have to be sold to farms within the Red line.
The other national parks such as Dongola, Marekele and Highveld need the
buffalo to optimize their conservation and tourism potential. It is further
essential to have buffalo populations in other national parks, to enable
restocking of the KNP should the buffalo population need to be replaced.
We should know the prevalence in the buffalo population by the end of
October. The Southern Region is definitely the most heavily infected with
some herds having a prevalence of more than 70%. We also know that the
infection is spreading northwards, but the northern limit of infection is
not known at the moment.
Concern about transmission of _M. bovis_ to humans led to an investigation
by the Medical Research Council National Tuberculosis Research Program last
year to determine the level of infection and/or active disease among
individuals considered to be at thigh risk of infection (workers exposed to
infection, e.g. involved in slaughtering tuberculous buffalo). They found
that the workers in the KNP did not express any defined risk of infection,
neither was an active case of disease found. Bovine tuberculosis is
therefore not considered to be an occupational zoonosis in the Park, nor has
aerosol transmission been indicated as a mechanism for human infection in
this cohort of workers. Concerns about the public health implications of
tuberculosis in buffalo have not been validated.
Species that have been diagnosed in the Park with BTB include: buffalo,
kudu, lion, cheetah (1), baboon (one troop) and leopard (1) (Might have
missed one or two). Lions because of their social structure seem to be very
prone to aerosol transmission and the occurrence in the area where the
prevalence among buffalo is high is also very high. There is a currently a
research project on the go to determine the exact prevalence rate.
I do not know much about the situation in KwaZulu/Natal. The only other park
with BTB is Vaalbos National Park.
