Is it realistic to think that dengue is a preventable/eradicable disease?
There are undeniable similarities as well as differences between dengue and
malaria. The enormous effort to eradicate malaria has been cited as the
example "par excellance" of the inability of humankind to eradicate a
disease. Now smallpox had the characteristics which, when matched with the
level of human technology and travel, made eradication possible. It didn't
require the alteration of an ecosystem for its eradication as malaria
would. Mosquito elimination or severe population control of mosquito
reproduction would certainly affect the food web of the tropics and
subtropics. Ecosystem tampering would be inevitable. And would
undoubtedly trigger some kind of downstream/downwind effect, perhaps one
even more devastating than malaria.
Dengue control should continue to be that, control. Before long, as we
have seen, and as we have seen escalating, microbes and their vectors will
inevitably make an end run around whatever humans erect in their way. It
is unrealistic and money wasted in efforts at total eradication and total
prevention.

[Sure it's realistic. Before we cut this string allow me to say that it is
not necessary to knock out the food chain in order to knock out dengue and
malaria. What we do not have are the right people, the right funding, and
the right ideas. This is not to say we do not have good people, good
funding and good ideas, it's just that we haven't yet hit on the right
formula. When someone comes up with the proper modus operandi, they will
have their Nobel Prize and the thanks of millions.
Dengue and human malaria do not have non-human vertebrate hosts.
Therefore, to eliminate either of these diseases requires that there be no
dengue or malaria in humans for a time period that would allow the
eradication (drug or other treatment, natural decline) of these agents.
Here are a couple of ideas, neither of them mine: (1) Conjure up a vaccine.
This is being attempted but obviously is not a simple task. Nonetheless,
it is worth the effort if we have no other means available. (2) Make all
the mosquitoes of the world incompetent to transmit these agents. I favor
this approach (see paper by Beaty, Olson, Blair, Higgs, and Carlson in
"Science")[Olson et al., Science, May 10, 1996, 272(5263):884-886 -
Mod.ES. One infects mosquitoes with a carrier virus containing the proper
nucleic acid sequence of the virus, (or uses transgenic mosquitoes) then
releases the incompetent/resistant mosquitoes to breed happily and forever
after. Also easier said than done, of course, but the situation is not
hopeless. We need imagination, not willingness to accept minimal
suffering. What we have now is not minimal and it doesn't look as though
the situation will get any better any time soon. To accept human disease
as our fate is a bit too fatalistic for me. I am an optimist. - Mod.CHC
