The New Mexico State Department of Health says rabbits in New Mexico
are getting sick and dying from the bacterial disease tularemia. The
illness is potentially serious in people.

Tularemia is caused by a bacteria found in animals, especially
rodents and rabbits. Symptoms in people are similar to those of
plague: Sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches and
joint pain. Other symptoms can include pneumonia, chest pain, ulcers
on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and
painful eyes and a sore throat.

Public health veterinarian Dr. Paul Ettestad urges people to follow
the same precautions against tularemia as for plague. They include
not allowing pets to roam and hunt, using flea-control products on
pets, and not handling sick or dead rodents or rabbits.
