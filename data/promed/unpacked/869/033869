Anthrax, a disease which causes fever, swelling and often death in animals, has spread to an epidemic proportion in remote Galdha VDC [village development committee]-7 of Palpa district [southern Nepal]. Authorities have started an awareness campaign in the VDC upon detection of anthrax [bacteria] in dead cattle.

The District Veterinary Office said a campaign has been launched in the affected areas to immunise the animals. Veterinarian Dr Uttam Acharya said they will provide 300 vials of vaccines to the animals in the affected areas.

Dal Bahadur Jargha, former chairman of the VDC, said around 40 cattle have died in the last 5 months. The lab test conducted by a team of veterinarians from Tansen and Pokhara confirmed that the cattle had died of anthrax infection.

There are 60 households in the Galdha. Health officials and veterinarians said there has been no case of the [bacteria] infecting humans so far. Dr Japendra Dhakal of District Hospital said the disease can be transmitted to humans if they use animal products. The disease could be fatal if not treated in time.

Health workers said people suffering from anthrax will show the symptoms of fever, common cold, and skin infections. Ganesh Gaire, an auxiliary health worker at Galdha Health Post, said villagers have been informed about the disease and its symptoms.

[Anthrax is usually sporadic in Nepal. There were 3 bovine outbreaks in 2010 (one of which also involved buffalo), in 2013, and 4 in 2014. There were 5 buffalo outbreaks in 2010, one mixed previously noted, and buffalo outbreaks also in 2013. There was a single swine outbreak in 2014 involving 22 pigs and this was after an absence of porcine cases since 2001. The Nepali are sparse with their description of outbreaks.

So Nepal is anthrax naive and therefor it is not surprising that this outbreak in Palpa has got away from immediate control. The problem is that it may have involved more than 40 livestock deaths, possibly also in nearby villages. And with cases over "5" months tracking the original source will present problems. In a country with only sporadic cases it would be safe to presume that it originated from the use of contaminated bone meal, possibly from India. And if contaminated feed was the cause, we can assume that livestock in other villages using the same feed retailer will have suffered not dissimilar losses.
