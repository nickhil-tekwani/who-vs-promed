[Below are some details of the current UK Classical Swine Fever outbreak from
an Emergency report to OIE. Although the full text is excellent reading, I
have cut liberally. - Mod.PC
Extracts from a fax received on 14 Aug 2000 from Dr J.M. Scudamore, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF),
London:
Report date: 13 Aug 2000.
Initial detection of disease:
The herd comprised 3500 weaned pigs accommodated in 7 houses. Illness
had existed on the farm since 11 Jul 2000 when weaned pigs had been introduced
from a breeding/multiplier unit. Since that time infection had spread to
4 houses and at the time of the VO visit a total of 1110 pigs were ill
or unthrifty and some 200 had died. The clinical signs observed were
lethargy, yellow diarrhoea, incoordination, fever and excessive thirst.
Skin lesions were also in evidence, ranging from cyanotic patches on ears
and abdomen to raised, scabby lesions mainly on the legs. Pigs thereafter
became moribund and died. At necropsy, gross changes indicative of chronic
pneumonia and chronic peritonitis were observed together with swollen pale
kidneys and enlarged, sometimes haemorrhagic, submaxillary lymph nodes.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Veterinary Laboratories Agency,
Weybridge, for examination for CSF; Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright
Laboratory, for examination for African swine fever (to date, the results
of all the tests for African swine fever are negative). The virus has been
sent to the European Union Reference Laboratory, Hannover, Germany, for
additional analysis.
B. Diagnostic tests used: fluorescent antibody test; ELISA; RT-PCR; virus
isolation; analyses of the virus genome.
C. Causal agent: analyses of the virus genome have suggested that the
genotype of this isolate is 2.1. This is the same genetic group as was
isolated during the CSF epizootic in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and
Spain in 1997-98.
[There has been speculation that the causal agent was related to Asian wild
boar strains- see Swine fever, classical - UK (08) and other postings. -
Mod PC.
Subsequent outbreaks:
Two further suspect cases were reported on 7 Aug 2000. One was in a herd of
rearing pigs. The second was in the breeding herd that had supplied weaned
pigs to the other 2 CSF incidents.

Epidemiological and subsequent action:
The epidemiological enquiry initiated immediately following diagnosis of
CSF in the breeding herd (SF 00/02) revealed that infection may have been
present on the premises in mid-June. This herd was assumed to have been the
source of infection for incidents SF 00/01 and SF 00/03. Conservatively,
CSF virus was assumed to have entered the breeding unit (SF 00/02) on 1
May.
All the farms in which CSF had been confirmed were owned by or contracted
to one breeding/production company. Pigs were born on breeding units and
remained there for approximately three to four weeks before being moved to
rearing premises where they remained for a further 6 to 8 weeks. From the
rearing units, the pigs moved to fattening units where they remained for a
further 10 weeks before being slaughtered. The total production cycle
lasted 20 to 22 weeks. The company operated an all in/all out system for
its rearing and fattening units. Thus pigs born on the breeding unit
would still be within the production system and would not be slaughtered
until mid-September.
With this information, the following working hypothesis was created as a
basis for immediate action, in addition to the movement tracings already
initiated:
a) All rearing and fattening premises which had received pigs born after 1
May on the breeding unit would be traced and placed under official movement
restrictions with immediate effect. The pigs on these premises would be
clinically inspected and blood sampled to test for evidence of CSF. In
addition, all the pigs on the premises that had received pigs born after 1
June would be treated as "dangerous contacts" and would be destroyed. The
vast majority were expected to be still on rearing premises.
b) The 4 nucleus breeding herds which had supplied breeding pigs to the
multiplier breeding herd SF 00/02 from 1 April, would be traced, placed
under official movement restrictions, be clinically inspected and blood
sampled for evidence of CSF.
c) The other 47 breeding herds owned by or contracted to the breeding
production company would be traced, placed under official movement
restrictions, be inspected by a MAFF VO, clinically inspected and blood
sampled for evidence of CSF.
d) The movements of the pig transporter that moved weaned pigs from the
breeding premises SF 00/02 would be traced and the premises it visited
would be placed under official movement restrictions, be clinically
inspected by a MAFF VO and be blood sampled for evidence of CSF.
Position at 13 Aug 2000:
Table 2.- Number of pig herds within the protection and surveillance zones
Outbreak No. Protection zone* Surveillance zone
SF 00/01 6 150
SF 00/02 23 346
SF 00/03 8 116
SF 00/04 22 312
SF 00/05 19 409
* All premises in the protection zones have been placed under official
control.

holdings (premises placed under restriction and awaiting the outcome of
laboratory tests)
[see: <http://www.oie.int/info/isa13_31_tab4.htm> - Mod.PC
Primary breeding herds that supplied outbreak SF 00/02:
Four primary breeding herds were found to have supplied breeding stock to
SF 00/02 after 1 May. All have been traced and inspected by a MAFF VO.
There was no evidence of clinical illness on any of the farms. All 4 have
been placed under official movement restrictions (Form B) and blood samples
taken to test for evidence of CSF.
Other breeding herds owned by the production/breeding company:
The breeding/production company in whose herds CSF has been confirmed, owns
48 breeding farms, 42 of which are in East Anglia. Eighteen have been
officially inspected, placed under movement restrictions and blood samples
taken for serological evidence of CSF. It is hoped to complete official
inspections and blood sampling in the remaining 29 herds by 18 August.
Other suspect CSF incidents:
Of the 15 suspect CSF incidents reported to date (see Table 3), 12 have
occurred in rearing or fattening premises supplied by the primary case (SF
00/02) after 1 June.
Three other suspect cases are being officially investigated. One is in a
breeding herd in Suffolk and two are in fattening herds in Staffordshire.
The breeding/production company at the centre of this epizootic owns the
latter 2 herds.

[I know the report is long but the details are fascinating. It is a classic
disease control/stamping out effort and shows how hard it is to contain a
disease that has been around for a while before being discovered. Despite
the thoroughness of the work by MAFF, the virus appears to have shown up on
other farms - see references. How far it has spread is still an open
question. - Mod.PC
