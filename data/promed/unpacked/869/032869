A pseudorabies outbreak [Aujeszky's disease] has been confirmed near De Queen in Sevier County [Arkansas]. The outbreak claimed the lives of 10 hunting dogs after they encountered feral swine. The dogs were used to chase feral swine near a livestock pasture when an infected hog was caught and mauled by the dogs.

Feral swine are not native to the US. They are an invasive species, a public nuisance and a threat to Arkansas. They compete for wild animal food resources, destroy habitat by rooting and wallowing and will eat ground-nesting birds, eggs, fawns, and young domestic livestock.

The dogs in Sevier County scavenged and ate the meat from the infected feral swine. Soon after consuming the meat, the dog's showed signs of "mad-itch", a common side effect of the viral infection. The signs were reported to the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission, Arkansas Health Department, US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC).

Samples from the hog and dogs were collected and analyzed by Iowa State University as part of ongoing research on feral swine disease. Feral swine can be carriers of the pseudorabies virus which is transmitted through nasal and oral secretions. The virus is fatal to pets and livestock.

The Arkansas Department of Health stresses that pseudorabies is not transmissible to humans, but feral swine can be carriers of multiple viruses, parasites, and bacteria that can lead to severe illness, most notably swine brucellosis.

Other diseases include anthrax, brucellosis, _E. coli_, hepatitis E virus, swine influenza virus, leptospirosis, rabies, salmonellosis, toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, tuberculosis, and tularemia. Caution should be used when encountering and processing feral swine due to the potential health risks to both humans and pets.

The AGFC uses large-scale trapping as the most efficient and economical means currently available to reduce feral swine populations. Sport hunting of feral hogs has been more hindrance to hog removal than benefit. Illegal relocation of hogs for hunting purposes has spread the problem to new areas. The shooting of individual hogs also thwarts large-scale trapping efforts and makes it nearly impossible to catch the whole sounder, or family group, at once.

In 2013, the Arkansas Legislature passed a law prohibiting the possession, sale, or transporting of any live feral hog, except to Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission-approved terminal facilities by licensed individuals. The intent of the law is to limit the spread and impact of feral swine, as well as the diseases to domestic livestock producers and native species.

[A number of domestic swine over many years under varying conditions have escaped and become wild. Other species of swine have been imported into the USA for hunting. Some closely related species may have interbred, so whether wild pigs are native to USA may be open to debate, but not here. Swine, whether domestic or wild, native, or imported can carry pseudorabies.

Pseudorabies virus (PRV), also known as Aujeszky's disease, is caused by _Suid herpesvirus 1_, a member of the _Alphaherpesvirinae_ subfamily.

Pseudorabies is an acute, frequently fatal disease with a worldwide distribution that affects swine primarily and other domestic and wild animals incidentally. The pseudorabies virus has emerged as a significant pathogen in the USA since the 1960s, probably because of the increase in confinement in swine housing or perhaps because of the emergence of more virulent strains. Clinical signs in non-porcine animals are similar to those of rabies, hence the name "mad itch" (pigs do not display this sign). Pseudorabies is a reportable disease and has been successfully eradicated from the vast majority of the USA.

Pseudorabies virus is a DNA herpesvirus. The pig is the only reservoir host, but the virus can infect cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, and goats as well as wildlife, including raccoons, opossums, skunks, and rodents. These species are dead end hosts and generally they die or are humanely euthanized because of lack of response to treatment and continued deterioration of their condition. Experimental studies in non-human primates indicate that rhesus monkeys and marmosets are susceptible but chimpanzees are not. Reports of human infection are limited and are based on seroconversion rather than virus isolation. Infections in horses are rare. Only one serotype of pseudorabies virus is recognized, but strain differences have been identified using monoclonal antibody preparations, restriction endonuclease assays, and heat and trypsin inactivation markers.

The virus can be transmitted via nose-to-nose or fecal-oral contact. Indirect transmission commonly occurs via inhalation of aerosolized virus. Infectious virus can persist for up to 7 hours in air with a relative humidity of 55 percent or higher. Data from England indicate that virus may travel via aerosols for up to 2 km [1.25 mi] in certain weather conditions. Other studies have demonstrated that the virus can survive for up to 7 hours in non-chlorinated well water; for 2 days in anaerobic lagoon effluent and in green grass, soil, feces, and shelled corn; for 3 days in nasal washings on plastic and pelleted hog feed; and for 4 days in straw bedding. The virus is enveloped and, therefore, inactivated by drying, sunlight, and high temperatures (37 deg C [98.6 deg F] or higher). Dead-end hosts, such as dogs, cats, or wildlife, can transmit the virus between farms, but these animals survive only 2-3 days after becoming infected. The potential role of insects as vectors is being investigated. Birds do not seem to play a role in transmission.

Clinical signs in non-porcine species, such as cats, dogs, cattle, and small ruminants, include intense local pruritus (itching), CNS signs (circling, maniacal behavior, paralysis), fever, respiratory distress, and sudden death.
