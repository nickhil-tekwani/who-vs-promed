Taiwan: One Student Dead, 23 Ill from Undiagnosed Illness
---------------------------------------------------
One student at a Taiwan army college has died and 23 have fallen ill
following an undiagnosed virus infection, but health officials said
on Thu 29 Jul 2004 it was unlikely to be an outbreak of SARS.
The student at the college in southern Kaohsiung county suffered high
fever -- one of the 1st symptoms of SARS -- and coughing before dying
on Sat 24 Jul 2004, Shih Wen-yi, acting director general of the
Center for Disease control, said by telephone. 18 of the 23 who came
down with similar symptoms have already recovered but were being
monitored in isolation from other students, said Shih. Five remained
in hospital. "The chances of it being SARS I don't think are very
high," said Shih. "No new cases have been reported since the death."
"Dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis have been ruled out, but test
results due later should give a clearer idea of what the illness is,"
said Shih. Taiwan reported the world's 3rd-worst incidence of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 -- after China and Hong Kong --
with 346 cases and 37 deaths from SARS virus infection.
