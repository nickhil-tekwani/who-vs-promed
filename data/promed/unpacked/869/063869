The Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) is currently seeing an unusual increase of psittacosis in Skane and Kronoberg counties in southernmost Sweden. So far 20 cases have been reported in Sweden in 2013 in comparison to between 5 and 10 in a usual year. Almost all of the 20 cases have been reported from the above mentioned counties. We have found no link other than geographic between these sporadic cases. Interviews with cases have revealed that many have tended or cleaned bird feeders in their gardens. The Swedish Institute for Communicable disease control and the County medical officers in the affected counties have informed the public through media about the risks of the disease and precautionary measures to take when exposed to bird droppings or sick birds.

The Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) has not received reports of unusual numbers of sick wild birds. However this does not rule out an ongoing outbreak among wild birds as they may excrete the bacteria without showing symptoms of disease. It has been unusually cold for the season in Sweden and perhaps this affects the shedding of bacteria. Shedding has previously been shown to increase when birds are stressed. We would be interested to know whether an increase is seen in other countries as well and if there are other ideas as to why wild birds would currently be more contagious.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Wallensten for this 1st-hand report and alert regarding this apparent increase in human psittacosis in southern Sweden.

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing. People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Historically
http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/DISEASES-AND-PARASITES-AFFECTING-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html, the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895. An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America. - Mod.LL
