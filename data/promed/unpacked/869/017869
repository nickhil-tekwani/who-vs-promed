[It is unusual to see anthrax in very young cattle but by the time of presentation they would have been weaned and would have been grazing. I suspect the source may have been a recent cattle gravesite from which spores made their way to the surface. Cattle graves are concave: the soil column collapses as the carcass rots. The resulting basin will collect rainwater, which fosters tasty plant growth plus it will float spores up through the soil. Maybe the vets could revisit the farm, inquire and look for an old gravesite, and sample the soil. But 20 yearlings is a side loss.

Yearlings are curious creatures and will visit any sick or dead animal. They would have sampled any extravasated blood from the index carcass(es).
