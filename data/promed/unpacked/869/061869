Spread of damaging wheat rusts, new races
------------------------------------------
New studies by scientists in collaboration with FAO show the emergence of new races of both yellow and stem rusts in 2016 in Europe, Africa and Central Asia, [with the] Mediterranean [region] particularly affected. At the same time, existing rust races have spread to new countries.

"These aggressive races have emerged [while] we're working to help countries combat the existing ones, so we have to be swift and thorough in the way we approach this," said FAO's Fazil Dusunceli. "Preliminary assessments are worrisome, but it is still unclear what the full impact will be on different wheat varieties in the affected regions."

On the Italian island of Sicily, a new race of the stem rust pathogen â' called TTTTF [see link below] â' hit several thousands of hectares of durum wheat in 2016, causing the largest stem rust outbreak that Europe has seen in decades. Bread wheat varieties may also be susceptible [to] TTTTF, the most recently identified race of stem rust. Without proper control, it could soon spread over long distances along the Mediterranean basin and the Adriatic coast.

Italy, Morocco and Scandinavian countries have seen the emergence of an entirely new, yet-to-be-named race of yellow rust. It was most prevalent in Morocco and Sicily, where yellow rust until recently was considered insignificant. Preliminary analysis suggests the new race is related to a family of strains that are aggressive and better adapted to higher temperatures.

Wheat farmers in Ethiopia [ProMED-mail post 20161117.4637042] and Uzbekistan have been fighting outbreaks of yellow rust AF2012 in 2016. [This race] was previously only found in Afghanistan before appearing in the Horn of Africa, where it affected tens of thousands of hectares of wheat.

As new races emerge, old ones continue to spread. The established Warrior race of yellow rust [ProMED-mail posts 20140523.2489629 & 20140122.2224928] continued its aerial march in 2016 and is now widely present in Europe and West Asia.

The Digalu (TIFTTF) race of stem rust continues to devastate wheats in Ethiopia, while the highly potent Ug99 is now present in 13 countries. Having spread in a northward trend from East Africa to the Middle East, it keeps producing new variants. Most recently, it has been detected in Egypt [ProMED-mail post 20160322.4109568], one of the Middle East's most important wheat producers.

Fungicides can help to limit damage [by wheat rusts], but early detection and rapid action are crucial. So are integrated management strategies in the long run. FAO, CIMMYT [International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre], ICARDA [International Centre for Agriculture in Dry Areas] and Aarhus University [Denmark] are working together [in] the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative (BGRI).

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat. While stem rust poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale.

Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 per cent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is the Ug99 group of strains (see ProMED-mail post 19990519.0812), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Since then Ug99 strains have spread (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

The 3rd known rust that can affect wheat, which is not mentioned above, is leaf rust (also called brown rust) caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_. Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" during favourable weather.

Rust spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. For example, genetic analysis of aggressive stripe rust strains, which have recently arrived in Europe, has shown that these incursions were due to the pathogens being spread by prevailing wind currents from Asia (ProMED-mail post 20150717.3517395).

Rusts are also spread by mechanical means and with infected plant material (straw, grain). The fungi need living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and some wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars and control of volunteer crop plants. Early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of the 3 cereal rusts with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution. Development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple rusts (ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190) is particularly difficult since the pathogens can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.
