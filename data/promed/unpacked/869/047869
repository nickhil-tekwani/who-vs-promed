An estimated 119 people died in a malaria outbreak in Mizoram between
January and October this year [2009], state health department officials
said today [17 Dec 2009]. The increase in number of deaths is due to the
fact that malaria patients approached the hospitals and health centers too
late, they said.

Those who died were without any medical treatment for at least 4 days or
more, and the average hospitalization period was just 2 and half days, the
officials said.

State vectorborne diseases control sources said that out of 151 631 blood
samples tested, 8426 people were found to be infected with the
mosquitoborne disease [malaria].
