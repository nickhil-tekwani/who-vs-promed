New NICHD-Sponsored Pertussis Vaccine Approved
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the
National Institutes of Health today joined North American Vaccine in
announcing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given its
approval to manufacture and market a new DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-acellular
pertussis) vaccine for use in immunization against these diseases. The
vaccine, marketed as CERTIVA(tm), uses as the pertussis component the
vaccine developed in the NICHD laboratory of Dr. John Robbins, one of the
world's leading scientists involved in vaccine research and development.
The NICHD licensed its patent for producing this pertussis vaccine to North
American Vaccine.
The pertussis vaccine consists of a single antigen, pertussis toxoid, which
is pure pertussis toxin detoxified by treatment with hydrogen peroxide. It
differs from all other marketed pertussis vaccines in that the others
contain multiple pertussis antigens, and in the way the pertussis toxoid is
prepared. The trials of the NICHD/North American Vaccine product
demonstrated its efficacy and safety. "Approval of this vaccine represents
the culmination of years of NICHD research, intended to produce a safe
toxoid for a vaccine," said Dr. Duane Alexander, MD, Director of the NICHD.
The extensive trials of the vaccine were conducted in the United States
(primarily North Carolina and Texas) and in Sweden, initially by NICHD, and
later by North American Vaccine. "Surveillance and epidemiologic studies in
Goteborg, Sweden, were ongoing for more than a decade," said Dr. Robbins,
Chief of the Laboratory of Developmental and Molecular Immunity at NICHD
where the vaccine was developed. Dr. Robbins shared the 1996 Albert Lasker
Clinical Research Award in recognition of his pioneering role in developing
the vaccine against _Hemophilus influenzae_ type b meningitis.

"The results from clinical trials and the mass vaccination program have
shown that pertussis toxoid alone confers immunity both to vaccine
recipients and the unvaccinated population at large, i.e., 'herd'
immunity," Dr. Robbins added. "These data also demonstrate that it may be
possible to eliminate pertussis by vaccination with a single component of
_Bordetella pertussis_. FDA licensure of the product allows for the
availability of this acellular pertussis vaccine for administration to
infants and children."
"The extensive studies done on this vaccine clearly show safety and
protection against pertussis from a single antigen. Its availability in
the U.S. brings to our children the benefits of this important research
advance," said Dr. Alexander.
The NICHD is one of the Institutes of the National Institutes of Health,
the world's premier biomedical research organization, located in Bethesda,
Maryland. NICHD supports and conducts basic, clinical, and epidemiological
research on the reproductive, developmental, and behavioral processes that
determine and maintain the health of children, adults, families, and
populations.
