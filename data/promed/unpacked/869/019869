The Allegheny County Health Department and state Department of Health
have provided a comprehensive list of places and times that exposure
to measles might have occurred last month [Mar 2009] throughout
southwestern Pennsylvania. The source of the measles was a child from
India who arrived 7 Mar 2009 in the United States. Since then, 5
other people have contracted measles, which is highly contagious,
with possibly more awaiting confirmation. Health officials continue
to track down unvaccinated or susceptible people who might have been
exposed to people with measles and face a risk of infection.

Exposures may have occurred at the following places and times:

- The Emergency Department of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of
UPMC:

- anytime on 10 Mar 2009;
- between 8 p.m. 21 Mar 2009 and 11 a.m. 22 Mar 2009;
- between 6 p.m. 25 Mar 2009 and 5 a.m. 26 Mar 2009;
_-between 6 p.m. 27 Mar 2009 and 3 a.m. 28 Mar 2009; and
- between 2:30 p.m. 28 Mar 2009 and 4 a.m. 29 Mar 2009.

- People also could have been exposed to measles anytime on 23 Mar
2009 at Children's Hospital's 3rd floor Ear Nose and Throat and
Specialty Clinics.

- Alle-Kiski Medical Center's Emergency Department, main lobby and
ground floor public areas in Natrona Heights, between 10 a.m. and
3:30 p.m. 28 Mar 2009.

- During an EMS-1 Conference at Seven Springs Mountain Resort in
Somerset and Fayette counties, exposure in the Snowflake Room and the
main dining room might have occurred between 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.
26 Mar 2009.

- On the following Allegheny County Port Authority buses:

- Route 28X (Airport Flyer) between 10 a.m. and noon 24 Mar 2009 and
between 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. 28 Mar 2009;
- 33X (West Busway all stops) between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. 27 Mar 2009; and
- 71A between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. 24 Mar 2009 &between 11 a.m. and 2
p.m. 27 Mar 2009.

People who aren't immune to measles, including those not fully
vaccinated, should contact a primary health-care provider immediately
to let them know you may have been exposed, especially if you have
had a fever and rash anytime since 15 Mar 2009. Those who had
possible exposure to someone with measles and have become ill with
measles symptoms from one to 2 weeks after possible exposure also
should contact a health-care provider.

Emergency personnel from across the region who attended a conference
at Seven Springs Mountain Resort may have come in contact with an
individual infected with measles. In an alert issued Friday [10 Apr
2009], the state Health Department said at least 6 measles cases in
western Pennsylvania have been traced to a traveler from India who
attended the Somerset County conference on 26 Mar 2009. Officials
suspect there are other measles cases that have yet to be confirmed.

The person from India, who has not been identified, was in the Seven
Springs Snowflake Room and the main dining room between 9:30 a.m. and
3:30 p.m. on that date. While no numbers could be confirmed,
emergency services officials from Cambria and Somerset counties said
they are confident some of those in attendance were local emergency
responders. "Almost definitely, people from Cambria County were
there," said Brian Feist, executive director of Cambria County
Department of Emergency Services. "It's an annual event. That's a big
thing with our ambulance services." The training was sponsored by
Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Institute of Allegheny County, a
multicounty out-of-hospital medical services oversight agency and a
division of the state Health Department. Some Somerset County EMS
personnel would have attended the conference, said Rick Lohr,
executive director of Somerset County Department of Emergency
Services.

Along with one day at the EMS conference, the traveler also visited
the emergency rooms of UPMC Children's Hospital and the Alle-Kiski
Medical Center. The person also traveled on several public transit
buses in Pittsburgh in late March 2009.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website says the
disease can cause more serious problems such as ear infections,
pneumonia, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), and the CDC says
that although measles was declared eliminated in the USA in 2000, it
still is common in many other countries. Worldwide, 20 million cases
of measles occur each year. The virus can be imported by foreign
visitors or returning travelers who are not fully protected against
the disease. Close to 90 percent of the measles cases reported this
year [2009] in the United States either were acquired abroad or linked
to imported cases.

Measles symptoms include fever, rash, cough, runny nose or red watery
eyes, said Stacy Kriedeman, state Health Department spokeswoman. "We
want people to make sure they take notice so that if they have any of
these symptoms, they contact their primary care doctor," she said.

[The USA has eliminated indigenous measles by a comprehensive
vaccination policy. It remains vulnerable to importation of infection
from endemic areas with subsequent limited spread through the
minority of individuals who have declined or escaped routine
protective vaccination. So far, all importation-related outbreaks
have been self-limited, but vigilance has to be maintained. The
current importation has given rise to 5 additional cases, and there
is risk of further spread, hence the current alert in Pennsylvania.

Measles can be really nasty; 2 of ProMED's senior moderators had
life-threatening cases of measles when sub-teen-aged in the
pre-vaccination era. - Mod. JW]
