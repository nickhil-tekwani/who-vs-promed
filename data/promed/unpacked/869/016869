A new strain of cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_ has been detected on a farm in Mid Canterbury. The property is one of 4 to recently test positive for the disease.

As a result, summer testing for the disease will be "stepped up," _M. bovis_ programme director Simon Andrew said.

"This strain doesn't behave any differently than the strain we have been dealing with, and our existing testing will pick it up, as it has done in this case. It doesn't affect our efforts to eradicate _M. bovis_ from New Zealand."

Andrew said a thorough investigation was underway into historic pathways, which include recorded and unrecorded animal movements dating back to 2018, imported feed and farm machinery, and frozen semen imported prior to the tightening of import health standards for bovine germplasm.

"While considered a very low risk, frozen semen used on the affected property, which had been imported prior to the introduction of the new import health standard, is being looked at.

"Our team is carrying out an investigation on the affected property. At this stage, there is no evidence to suggest there has been any forward spread on any farms that received cattle from this farm."

Andrew said bulk tank milk and beef herd screening (alongside cattle-tracing work) had not identified this strain anywhere else.

"But disease control is all about being cautious, so we will be increasing the summer frequency of our national bulk milk surveillance testing from once a month to every fortnight, as we do over spring."

There is now a national testing regime to find infection, which wasn't available when _M. bovis_ was first found in 2017, Andrew said.

_M. bovis_ is currently on just 4 farms compared to 40 at the height of the programme.

Andrew said it was important for farmers to know MPI [Ministry for Primary Industries] was 4 years into a 10-year programme and remained on track for eradication.

"We are moving towards a national pest management plan for _M. bovis_ much like that used for TB. The aim will be to monitor and deal with any disease popping up over time."

If the investigation into pathways reveals further actions are required, including targeted testing and surveillance on-farm, MPI would let farmers know, Andrew said.

"But at this stage, the increased frequency of summer bulk tank milk testing, beef surveillance, and tracing animals will serve us well."
