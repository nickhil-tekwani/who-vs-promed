The state Center for Health Surveillance (CEVS) today [11 Jun 2012] received the laboratory confirmation of yellow fever [virus infection] in 2 dead monkeys in the cities of Santa Maria (one case) and Barros Cassal (one case).

The CEVS has taken the required health measures in the vicinity of these 2 municipalities. In the list for vaccination against yellow fever are Gramado Xavier, Boqueirao do Leao, Progresso, Restinga Seca, Formigueiro, Sao Sepe, e Sao Gabriel.

[Surveillance of epizootics is one of the main pillars of yellow fever [YF] surveillance. When they occur, epizootics must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggestive of virus circulation), which can eventually lead to occurrence of human YF cases in a given locality.

To become familiar with the (excellent) Manual de Vigilancia de Epizootias em Primatas Nao- Humanos [Manual for Epizootic Surveillance in Non-Human Primates; in Portuguese] of the Ministry of Health of Brazil, access http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/arquivos/pdf/epizootias.pdf.

To see the map of the distribution of epizootics investigated in Brazil, access http://portal.saude.gov.br/portal/saude/profissional/visualizar_texto.cfm?idtxt=37357&janela=1.

YF virus is endemic in its sylvan (jungle) cycle in the South American tropics. Cases occur sporadically in Brazil, with dead monkeys as the indicators of the occurrence of YF virus transmission in given localities. The rapid response, as indicated in the report above and in Mod.RNA's remarks, is essential to prevent spill-over of the sylvan virus transmission cycle into the urban cycle with rapid transmission by _Aedes aegypti_, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008 [see ProMED-mail archive no 20080308.0949). - Mod.TY]
