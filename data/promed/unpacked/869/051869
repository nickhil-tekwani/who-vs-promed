Three officials from the Department of Antiquities believed to have contracted typhus while excavating an ancient burial site in the Nicosia district have not been infected with the bacterial disease, the Health Services confirmed on Wed 18 Jun 2014. Speaking to the media, standing head of the Health Services Christos Christou said the archaeologists are currently recovering in Nicosia General Hospital and are not in any danger. "They have responded well to the treatment prescribed, but they have all tested negative for typhus."

The officials were excavating an archaeological site near Denia Village on 3 Jun 2014 when they suddenly developed high fevers and other symptoms of typhus. "They are now undergoing other specialized tests to determine what caused the symptoms they are experiencing."

Christou denied criticism that the Health Services failed to take necessary precautions to ensure the safety of workers at the dig site. "The area where the excavation is taking place is deep within the Buffer Zone and falls under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. It is, however, the responsibility of the Antiquities Department to take necessary health and safety precautions on excavation sites."

The Health Services official also confirmed that pest control experts are currently spraying the archaeological site and surrounding areas after Denia community leader Christakis Panayiotou complained about an influx of rodents. "The excavation site is not accessible to members of the public, but we are urging residents to stay away from the other areas being sprayed."

[The diagnosis here is not likely to be epidemic typhus but rather murine typhus, which is rodent-borne and does exist on the island of Cyprus. This posting does not say that it is not murine typhus, just not typhus. - Mod.LL

"Denia community leader Christakis Panayiotou complained about an influx of rodents" which does suggest murine typhus. - Mod.JW
