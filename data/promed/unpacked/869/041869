RE: Recent posting about the concerns of using avoparcin in animals,
particularly in poultry "as Thanksgiving approaches."
Avoparcin is used widely in most parts of the world for treatment of
infections and for growth promotion in a variety of livestock, including
hogs, turkeys, chickens, and other animals. Some of the recent surveys
provide compelling evidence that the use of avoparcin in agriculture indeed
contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance in enterococci and
staphlococci.
I would like to point out two important points in perspective for the
readers of this newsgroup:
1. Avoparcin is not now used in the USA, nor has it ever been, on a
commercial basis, in poultry. Thus, any concerns (of Americans) for the
safety of the Thanksgiving turkey (on this particular point) are unfounded.
2. Approval of new products in the USA by the FDA requires demonstration
that the antibiotic NOT influence the transfer of resistance factors to
non-target bacteria. I believe this is a good requirement.
3. The routine prescription of vancomycin for NON-LIFE-THREATENING
infections in humans may be an additional source of resistant organisms.
In the past year or two I have heard of several of my friends or relatives
being treated with long-term courses of vancomycin, not for life
threatening infections, but merely for TROUBLESOME infections, or in some
cases for the prevention of potentially troublesome infections.
Vancomycin has been in use in the USA for over 25 years. It is remarkable
that an antibiotic of this class, with the well known potential for
resistance development, has remained alive so long. It was first described
to me in 1971 as relegated to the category of "antibiotic of last resort."
Clearly the product has not been reserved for this use by the practicing
physician and specialist. Even so, we have gotten enormous benefit from
this product. How long should we expect an antibiotic like this to remain
effective in widespread use? The answers to these and related questions
are the subject of lively debates for more than a quarter of a century, and
are just as elusive as ever. Personally, I have found my own mind made up
more than once, on both sides of most of the issues, and continually change
my view as more information is available. I agree with some of the
opinions from both extremes, but in the long run favor conservation.

[Thanks to Larry McDougald for this informative posting about the use of
avoparcin in food production, and especially for putting the minds of our
fellow Americans at ease about their traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner
on this coming Thursday. I agree with the point that medical practitioners
should look first at their own uses of antibiotics as we worry about the
emergence of bacterial resistance in strains that infect humans. The long
term and widespread use of avoparcin in agriculture worldwide with limited
impact on vancomycin resistance among bacterial isolates from humans to
date does not portend imminent disaster as a result of this practice.
Nonetheless, there are other ways to make livestock grow faster, but there
are sometimes few alternatives to vancomycin for treatment of intractable
human infections. - Mod.ES
