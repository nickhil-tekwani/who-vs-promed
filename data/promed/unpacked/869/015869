The number of diagnosed cases of rabies in animals increased in Texas from
303 cases in 1998 to 400 in 1999, a 32 percent rise. Already this year,
about 213 cases were seen during just the first 3 months.
Most rabies occurs in skunks and bats, but the number of cases in dogs and
cats has risen from 23 in 1998 to 34 last year - a public health concern
especially in Willacy, Tom Green, Nolan and Cooke counties where most of
last year's rabid dogs and cats lived.
This year, rabies cases in January through March centered in Denton (26
cases), Wise (18), Cooke (12), Freestone (10), Limestone (10), Leon (9),
Erath (7) and Terrell (8) counties. Most of the 213 cases reported in
January, February and March were found in skunks (152 cases), but 9 dogs
and 1 cat also tested positive for rabies.
Why is there an increase in rabies among pets? Jane Mahlow, DVM, director
of the Zoonosis Control Division at the Texas Department of Health (TDH)
points to pet owners not getting their animals vaccinated annually against
rabies as required by state law. "Often, pet owners think if everyone else
gets their pet vaccinated, then there's not a problem for their own pet,"
she said. "Or they think because their cat never leaves their yard, the
animal really does not need a rabies shot every year. But the fact is every
dog and cat needs a rabies vaccination each year."
Rabies is a killer disease attacking the nervous system, resulting in
paralysis and almost certain death once the symptoms appear. The rabies
virus is present in the saliva of the rabid animal. The most common way the
disease is spread is by a bite from an infected animal. Though rare, rabies
also can be spread if the infected animal's saliva comes in contact with
fresh scratches, open wounds or mucous membranes such as the lining of the
eyelid.
Prompt, appropriate treatment after being bitten and before the disease
develops can stop the infection and prevent the disease in people. Symptoms
of rabies usually develop within 2 to 8 weeks after a person is bitten by
a rabid animal. If a pet develops rabies, the people most likely to be
exposed to this deadly disease are the pet owner and family and friends. An
annual rabies vaccination for each dog and cat is very inexpensive life
insurance for the pet and its owners. Likewise, horse and livestock in
close contact with people, such as 4-H animals, should be vaccinated
against rabies.
Improved rabies vaccination and animal control programs and better
treatment for people who have been bitten have dramatically reduced the
number of human rabies cases in this country. "The majority of recent
human cases acquired in the United States are due to the type of rabies
virus found in bats," said Mahlow. "So if you see a bat that's on the
ground or acting strangely, do not touch it. Immediately report it to local
animal
control authorities."
