The chikungunya viral disease detected in the Pokok Sena and Pendang
districts of Kedah has spread to 2 more districts, Kota Setar and Padang
Terap, according to Kedah director of health, Datuk Dr Hasnah Ismail.

She said the health department had detected 2 cases in Kampung Baru in the
Kota Setar district and several cases in Kampung [village] Baru Naka,
Kampung Padang Kerasak, Kampung Tong Plu, Kampung Banggol Pong, Kampung
Padang Setol, and Kampung Malau in the Padang Terap district.

"Health teams are carrying out spraying to control the spread of the
vector-borne disease," she said in a statement. Dr Hasnah appealed for the
cooperation of the people in taking preventive measures by keeping their
surroundings clean and getting rid of vessels in the open, which could trap
water and allow mosquitoes to breed. She advised farmers and rubber tappers
to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants to prevent bites by mosquitoes,
the carriers of the virus which causes the disease.
