PAUP: RFI
=========
I'm looking for PAUP phylogeny analysis software to run on an IBM.
This was developed by Dr. David Swofford at Illinois Natural
History Survey, but seems as though I remember he has left there?
If anyone has information regarding where I might obtain the PAUP
program, I would be eternally (or at least for the rest of the
week) grateful.
Thanks,
Mike

[Mod: Are people who use this program PAUPers?]
