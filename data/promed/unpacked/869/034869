No new cases in pig disease outbreak
-------------------------------------
No new cases of the _Streptococcus suis_ infection were identified in Sichuan
Province between noon Sun, 31 Jul 2005 and noon yesterday, 1 Aug 2005,
according to the Ministry of Health. Health workers identified 17 previously
undiagnosed cases, but all these were in people who had already carried the
infection for several days.
In another development, scientists in Beijing announced yesterday that they
have developed a test for the disease in pigs which takes just 4 hours to
provide results.
By noon yesterday, 1 Aug 2005, 198 human cases had been reported in 176
villages in 9 cities across Sichuan. 2 more deaths were reported yesterday, 1
Aug 2005, and 30 patients are in a serious condition.
In South China's Guangdong Province, 1 more human case was reported over
the weekend, but the patient has already recovered and been discharged from
hospital, health officials said. The man became ill on 27 Jul 2005 in Chao'an
County, where he had been slaughtering pigs, they said.
In a related development, the Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine
announced yesterday, 1 Aug 2005, it has developed a testing method to identify
_Streptococcus suis_ in pigs in 4 hours. The technique, known as
the "multiple PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing method," can be used to
screen pigs in an "accurate and convenient" fashion, said a statement by an
expert panel that assessed and approved the method yesterday.

WHO urges more tests on pig fever
---------------------------------
The WHO has urged China to carry out further tests on the pig disease that
official figures now show has killed 36 people since Jun 2005. The WHO said
the high mortality rate could mean other factors were involved. "Another
bacteria, another virus, some sort of toxic substance or something happening
in the environment, we don't know," said WHO spokesman Bob Dietz.
The agency praised China's diligence in informing them of the latest
developments on the outbreak.
It is thought to be the biggest recorded outbreak of infection from the
streptococcus suis bacteria. However, correspondents say Chinese media
coverage of the outbreak has been restricted.
China's health ministry says the disease is still spreading through the south-
west province of Sichuan where the number of confirmed or suspected cases of
people infected is now at 198. Cases were originally identified near cities
including Ziyang and Neijiang, but it has now spread to Chengdu and 4 other
Sichuan cities.
China's health ministry is in the process of producing vaccine doses for 10
million pigs.

China bans reporters from sites of deadly pig-borne disease outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese authorities have banned local reporters from visiting areas where an
outbreak of a pig-borne disease has killed 34 farmers, ordering newspapers to
use dispatches from the state news agency, a Hong Kong newspaper reported Sun,
31 Jul 2005.
Officials have reported a total 181 confirmed or suspected cases linked to
bacterium _Streptococcus suis_ in China's southwestern Sichuan province, where
farmers who handled or butchered infected pigs have been sickened in dozens
of villages and towns. Symptoms include nausea, fever, vomiting, and
bleeding under the skin.
Sichuan authorities have ordered local journalists to stay away from locations
where the disease has surfaced, and told newspapers to carry stories as issued
by the official Xinhua news agency, including the headline, Hong Kong's Ming
Pao Daily News reported.
Calls to Sichuan's provincial government headquarters in Chengdu seeking
confirmation of the media ban went unanswered.
