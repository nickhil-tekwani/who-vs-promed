Deer contaminated by chronic wasting disease (CWD) have made their way into Stone and Taney counties. CWD is a deadly illness spread from deer to deer through direct contact with soil, food and water contaminated through feces, urine, saliva or carcasses of infected deer.

During the summer and fall deer hunting season of 2018, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) tested more than 28 000 deer for CWD. From those thousands of collected tissue samples, 28 deer, from 11 counties across Missouri, tested positive for CWD.

Hundreds of CWD cases have been identified in northwest Arkansas counties bordering southwest Missouri, but for the 1st time ever, positively tested deer were harvested in Stone and Taney counties. MDC Wildlife Health Specialist Keith Cordell said the deer were found in northeast Stone County, near Reeds Spring, and southern Taney County, in the Drury-Mincy Conservation area.

"Not entirely surprising," said Cordell. "I mean, seeing as what we're observing just south of the border in Arkansas, and we've really ramped up and increased our surveillance efforts on those southern border counties, I was actually kind of surprised last year [2017] when we did not detect any.

"So it was pretty much inevitable we knew we were going to find it down there eventually. That's why it was so important to find it early, so we've got something we can actually do about it before it gets too widespread."

In an effort to slow down and manage the number of CWD cases, Cordell said, the MDC performs what is known as targeted culling. "So when we do find a new encounter of a positive deer, we will verify that it actually is accurate," said Cordell. "Once we're certain we got a CWD-positive deer down there, we go to a 2-mile buffer around and map out a management area.

"Then we will increase the number of deer harvested within that boundary, either through voluntary efforts of hunters during the hunting seasons, and then after the season we'll go into our winter operations mode where we'll recruit the help of landowners residing and having property within the management area. Then we supplement some of those deer harvested with some MDC shooting teams." Since the department began these efforts several years ago, MDC staff and participating landowner's have taken about 4600 deer through targeted culling, according to a press release.

Cordell said he would like to encourage anyone who spots a suspected CWD-infected roadkill or sick deer to contact their MDC regional office. A deer with CWD will display a drooping head, excessive salivation, a ragged coat with their ribs or bones showing and abnormal behavior.

While there has not been a single case of CWD transferring to humans, pets or livestock, at this time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that hunters do not consume the meat from their kill if it tests positive for the disease, Cordell said.

In 2018, infected deer were also found for the 1st time in west-central Oregon County, near Alton, and in Mercer County, around 2 miles from the Iowa state border. Since the MDC began its efforts in 2001, they have tested nearly 130 000 deer and discovered 103 positive cases of CWD since 2012.

[Missouri appears to have a plan. They were expecting infected deer to be found in the counties adjacent to already infected counties. It is another indication of spread of the disease. - Mod.TG
