Recent deaths of endangered boreal toads (_Bufo boreas boreas_) in one of
the largest remaining populations in the southern Rocky Mountains has been
linked to a chytrid fungus, identified last year as being responsible for
amphibian die-offs in Central America and Australia, according to
pathologists at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National
Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin.
Sick and dying toads in the Colorado population were first discovered in
May of 1999 by Colorado Division of Wildlife researchers, who have been
intensively studying the animals for the last 5 years. Since May, dead
toads have been found every month at a site on private lands west of
Denver. USGS researchers have identified chytrid fungus in many of the dead
and living toads examined from the site. Live toads show few clinical signs
of the disease, but some may appear weak, lethargic and reluctant to flee
at the approach of humans.
Dr. D. Earl Green, a USGS wildlife pathologist, microscopically examined
many of the dead toads and identified myriads of minute chytrid fungi in
the skin of the abdomen and toes of the toads. His microscopic
identification of this fungus is being confirmed in collaborative work by
Dr. Joyce Longcore, a world-renowned chytrid expert at the University of
Maine.
These amphibian losses are well documented and have occurred in a wide
range of habitats, including remote and pristine areas in Arizona, Oregon,
California, the Rocky Mountain states, Costa Rica, Panama, Puerto Rico and
Australia.
Chytrid fungus in amphibians was first identified in 1998 by Green and
other researchers from the U.S., Great Britain and Australia, who
discovered this fungus had been responsible for large amphibian die-offs in
Panama and Australia. Scientists don't know how this fungus is transmitted
from one area to another, or why it is affecting amphibian populations
around the world. Green emphasized diagnostic tests on the boreal toads are
still being completed, and infectious diseases or other possible causes of
death may yet be found in this population. Because fungal infections are
often considered secondary infections in other vertebrates, USGS is
completing further tests for viruses, parasites and bacteria to rule out
other factors predisposing the animals' susceptibility to the fungus.
Two other Colorado populations of boreal toads in Rocky Mountain National
Park had serious declines this summer and previously in 1996, according to
zoologists at the USGS Midcontinent Ecological Science Center in Fort
Collins, Colorado, who have been studying these populations for the past 9
years. Although dead or dying toads have not been found in association with
these declines, the chytrid fungus has not yet been identified from toads
or tadpoles in the park, but may still be linked to the declines.
The boreal toad is listed as endangered by Colorado and New Mexico,
although no known populations exist in New Mexico now. The southern Rocky
Mountains population -- Colorado, New Mexico and southeastern Wyoming -- is
listed as a federal candidate species. These toads were once common around
lakes, ponds and streams in the mountains of Colorado, northern New Mexico
and southern Wyoming, but the population numbers dropped precipitously in
the last 20 years.
Research by USGS scientists and others have identified many deadly virus
infections and chytrid fungi as causes of some amphibian die-offs and
population declines. Scientists investigating other hypotheses to help
explain these worldwide declines, including increased exposure to
ultraviolet radiation due to ozone thinning, the spread of non-native
predators, contamination from pesticides and other chemicals, and rising
temperatures. Many biologists suspect a combination of factors may be
responsible.
As the nation's largest water, earth and biological science and civilian
mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2000
organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial, scientific
information to resource managers, planners, and other customers. This
information is gathered in every state by USGS scientists to minimize the
loss of life and property from natural disasters, contribute to the sound
conservation, economic and physical development of the nation's natural
resources, and enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological,
energy and mineral resources.
