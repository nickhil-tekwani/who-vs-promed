B.C. farms declared free of bird flu
----------------------------------------
The federal food watchdog has lifted a quarantine on dozens of poultry
farms in British Columbia's Fraser Valley, saying they are free of avian
influenza.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials said on Saturday [10 Dec
2005] that 21 days of testing turned up no sign of the disease on about 80
chicken and duck farms that had been quarantined.
The measure was originally imposed as a precaution after a low-pathogenic
strain of the H5N2 virus was detected in November 2005 at a duck farm near
Chilliwack and another near Abbotsford.
Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials quickly determined the virus
wasn't from the same deadly strain that has been blamed for killing at
least 65 people in Asia since 2003 and led to the cull of millions of birds.
However, they imposed a quarantine on any operation that lay within a 5-km
radius of either of the 2 infected BC farms.
On Saturday [10 Dec 2005], CFIA veterinarian Cornelius Kiley said officials
were confident the virus hadn't spread.
He said health officials would next focus their energies on trying to get
other countries to lift bans on imports of poultry from British Columbia.
The United States, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong had all imposed temporary bans.
The 2 farms where the virus was detected will remain under quarantine until
the area has been completely disinfected, Kiley said.
British Columbia's poultry industry was devastated in 2004 when the highly
infectious H7N3 strain of bird flu spread rapidly from barn to barn,
leading to a cull of more than 16 million birds in the Fraser Valley.

[Canada is clearly taking no chances that a low pathogenic strain could
mutate. They took the precautions of quarantining and depopulating. They
are also cleaning and disinfecting those premises regarded as having low
pathogenic avian influenza.
Hopefully, with this aggressive action, those countries having imposed
temporary bans will reopen their borders. - Mod.TG]
