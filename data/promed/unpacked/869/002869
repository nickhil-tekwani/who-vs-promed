A health warning has been reissued to students after 15 more cases of mumps were reported at Glasgow University. It brings the total number of students infected since the start of the month [February 2012] to 30 although university officials had claimed the outbreak was leveling off.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Public Health Protection Unit is liaising closely with the university and health officials said none of the students were giving cause for concern.

[Previously the HPS (Health Protection Scotland) Weekly Report dated 15 Feb 2012 indicated that since 7 Feb 2012, the Glasgow University Medical Centre has seen 26 cases of mumps in students attending Glasgow University. The students are between 18 and 22 years old, both male and female, attending different courses, and staying in different places.

Glasgow University has asked all students to contact their GP for MMR vaccine if they have not already had 2 doses. MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps, and rubella and is usually given at the ages of 13/14 months and around 4 years. Those who have missed doses of vaccine should get MMR vaccine from their GP. NHS [National Health Service] Greater Glasgow and Clyde has contacted all universities and colleges within its area to advise of the outbreak at Glasgow University and urge a reminder to all students in all institutions to obtain vaccine from their GP if they are under-immunized (see http://www.documents.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/pdf2012/1207.pdf).

Of the students who have contracted mumps virus infection it would be relevant to determine if any had received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine and were not protected. There are continuing doubts about the effectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine.
