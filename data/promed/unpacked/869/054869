An outbreak of _Chryseobacterium indologenes_ that affected 12 patients in ICUs in Spain, resulting in 1 death, was possibly caused by drainage water from hand-washing sinks, underscoring the need to protect patients and equipment from sink splashes to avoid infection and contamination, according to researchers.

_C. indologenes_ is a nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli mostly found in soil and water, Mireia Cantero, MD, PhD, MPH, of the preventive medicine department at Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda University Hospital in Madrid, and colleagues reported. The pathogen has "intrinsic resistance" to several antibiotic classes, including cephalosporins and carbapenems. "Since 2009, _Chryseobacterium_ has been identified in environmental samples from hospital tap water, disinfectants and respiratory equipment," the researchers wrote in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology [1]. "It has also been postulated to be a potential pathogen in critically ill patients."

At a tertiary-care hospital in Spain, 12 patients in 2 ICUs were infected with _C. indologenes_ over a 6-week period. A total of 4 of the patients developed pneumonia, and 3 had died. Only 1 death, however, was attributable to the infection. _C. indologenes_ was isolated from the respiratory tract of all patients. One blood sample from a patient was also positive.

Investigators obtained 232 environmental samples to identify a potential source of the outbreak. They isolated _C. indologenes_ from 8 hand-washing sinks in patients' rooms. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses revealed that 5 of these isolates were related to patient cases. _C. indologenes_ was also recovered from 3 air samples that were taken near sinks in a reprocessing room (n = 1) and patients' rooms (n = 2). Other pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae and fungi, were found in the hospital's drainage system, as well.

Although the outbreak was controlled after wash basins were removed from the affected areas, the researchers were unable to confirm the source of the outbreak because of a lack of data. Still, they said their findings show how sinks can act as a reservoir for _C. indologenes_ and other pathogens. "The recovery of the same PFGE of _C. indologenes_, as well as other microorganisms, from drainage sinks and air in its vicinity, demonstrates that contamination of devices close to the sinks is possible by aerosolization of drainage water, which potentially played a role in this outbreak," the researchers concluded. "Also, contamination of respiratory devices during reprocessing could have played an important role because the same PFGE pattern was shared by patients and the air sample close to the sink in the reprocessing room that occasionally serves both ICUs."

Abstract
"In this outbreak, 12 patients in intensive care units acquired a _Chryseobacterium indologenes_ infection. Cultures from sinkholes and air samples were positive for _C. indologenes_. After removing wash basins, no new cases appeared. Sinkholes, potentially contaminated, can act as a reservoir for _C. indologenes_ and other microorganisms. Thus, patients and equipment should be protected from sink splashes to avoid contamination."

_Chryseobacterium indologenes_, formerly _Flavobacterium indologenes_, a yellow pigmented, Gram-negative filamentous, non-motile, facultative anaerobic bacillus, first isolated from a clinical specimen in 1983 (https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Chryseobacterium_indologenes). _C. indologenes_ is most commonly found in soil, plants, foodstuff and water sources including those in hospitals. It is not a member of the normal human flora, but is reportedly the most commonly isolated _flavobacterium_ in the clinical microbiology laboratory (https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Chryseobacterium_indologenes). _C. indologenes_ has been reported to be multidrug resistant to a wide variety of antimicrobial agents (http://www.ijmm.org/article.asp?issn=0255-0857;year=2011;volume=29;issue=2;spage=196;epage=198;aulast=Sudharani).

Drains of sinks, which can be potential reservoirs for nosocomial pathogens, have been implicated in an increasing number of outbreaks in the past decade (1-4). It has been speculated that these outbreaks might be an unexpected consequence of efforts to improve hand sanitation in hospitals. Backsplash with contaminated droplets onto nearby surfaces where medical staff prepared tubing and other equipment used in patient care is thought to be a mode of dissemination (https://www.statnews.com/2016/10/25/hospital-sinks-infections/). Biofilms containing colonies of these bacteria form in the sink drain and in pipes that drain the sinks (https://www.statnews.com/2016/10/25/hospital-sinks-infections/). Replacing contaminated sinks and their nearby plumbing may not be sufficient, as the biofilm may regrow from plumbing that remains in the wall.
