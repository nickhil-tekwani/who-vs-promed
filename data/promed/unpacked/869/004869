A Hampshire [South East England] resident has been hospitalised as 2 others have fallen ill with rare infections spread by a tick bite. [The] person from Hampshire has fallen ill with TBE, and a person from Devon has been reported ill with babesiosis. Both are in hospital.

Health officials confirmed the diagnosis of a case of babesiosis and a probable case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE).

Public Health England (PHE) said that this is the 1st record of a UK-acquired case of babesiosis and the 2nd case of TBE being acquired in the UK.

Most people with babesiosis will have either no symptoms or mild symptoms of infection, but people with weakened immune systems can become very ill and present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue, and jaundice.

Around 2/3rds of people with TBE infections will have no symptoms, and, for those who develop symptoms, there are often 2 phases. The 1st is associated with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache and fatigue, which can then progress to a more serious 2nd phase, which involves the central nervous system, which can lead to meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis.

This year [2020], PHE has surveyed sites in Devon close to where the person with babesiosis lives, collecting and testing hundreds of ticks, and all tested negative for the parasite that causes babesiosis.

PHE also tested deer blood samples from Hampshire in areas near where the person with probable TBE lives, and they have shown evidence of likely TBE virus infection, which matches similar results found in 2019 (see Tick-borne encephalitis - UK (02): more details 20191031.6756180).

The risk of babesiosis or TBE for the general public is very low, but a number of infections can develop following a tick bite, including Lyme disease, and there are things people can do to reduce the risk of being bitten by ticks.

Dr Katherine Russell, consultant in the emerging infections and zoonoses team at PHE, said: "It is important to emphasise that cases of babesiosis and TBE in England are rare, and the risk of being infected remains very low. Lyme disease remains the most common tick-borne infection in England. Ticks are most active between spring and autumn, so it is sensible to take some precautions to avoid being bitten when enjoying the outdoors. Seek medical advice if you start to feel unwell after a tick bite," [she said].

If you have been bitten by a tick, it should be removed as soon as possible using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool.

[TBE virus appears to be established in Hampshire county in the UK, now with the 2nd human case. Public Health England (PHE) says it has confirmed cases of tick-borne encephalitis virus in ticks from 2 parts of England: Thetford Forest and an area on the Hampshire-Dorset border (see Tick-borne encephalitis - UK: (England) 20191029.6752219).

The ticks in that previous report identified _Ixodes ricinus_ as those in which the TBE-EU full sequence was found. That report also provided evidence that several species of deer had antibodies to TBE virus (see reference below). No mention was made about possible involvement of rodents in TBE virus transmission in the UK. In mainland Europe, where TBE is endemic, the bank vole (_Myodes glareeolus_) is the rodent host of the virus. That rodent is found throughout the British Isles, and it would be interesting to know whether TBE virus is present in that rodent population.

Although vaccines for humans are available in Europe, 2 cases alone do not provide justification for a campaign in the areas were the virus has been detected. Avoidance of tick bites, however, is prudent.

_Babesia_ spp. is well known in several animal species in the UK; see for instance:

It is important to have the isolate genotype to get an idea of the host animal. - Mod.EP
