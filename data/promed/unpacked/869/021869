Malaysia finds more bird flu cases in area of previous outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------
Malaysia found new cases of bird flu Saturday in
an infected area that had been under quarantine
for 3 weeks, setting off a new round of culling
poultry and screening people to contain the
potentially deadly disease.

Health Ministry officials said that one
veterinary worker had been hospitalized with
fever and cough. The worker was being held in
isolation until tests are completed for bird flu.

Hawari Hussein, director general of the
Veterinary Department, said inspectors had found
about a dozen chickens and ducks dead in 3
villages from the H5 bird flu virus in the latest
incidents.

The discovery underscored the stubbornness of the
virus after weeks of eradication efforts within
10 kilometres the northern village where it
appeared 17 Aug 2004 in fighting cocks smuggled
from Thailand.

More tests would determine whether the strain was
in fact H5N1 -- the lethal variant that has
killed 28 people in Vietnam and Thailand -- but
in 2 earlier outbreaks in the area, the virus has
turned out to be H5N1.

"We have not found any human infection," Hawari
said. "We will be doing active surveillance by
going from house to house to check whether anyone
is sick."

No humans have been infected by H5N1 in Malaysia,
though several have been hospitalized for
observation. [According to a posting of 8 Sep
2004, a 10-year-old boy was admitted to hospital
for suspected bird flu; has the suspicion been
refuted? - Mod.AS]. Some 4000 people have been
screened, and thousands of chickens and ducks
have been slaughtered.

Culling of poultry and other birds in the newly
infected villages was to begin immediately, and a
ban on moving chickens and ducks in and out of
the area remained in force, Hawari said.

The emergence of bird flu in Malaysia in August
2004 has led to massive losses for poultry
farmers as several countries banned imports.

Since January 2004, avian influenza has ravaged
poultry stocks across Asia. Tens of millions of
birds have been culled in an effort to halt the
spread of the disease. It subsided after a few
months but re-emerged in July.
