Rift Valley fever fears 'unfounded'
-----------------------------------
Veterinarians have moved to allay the public's fears of possible Rift
Valley fever infection as the outbreak spreads across the country.
"There is no threat, no fear," Angela Zucca of the Kenilworth
Veterinarian Hospital told News24 on Thursday [8 Apr 2010]. Zucca,
who has been with the hospital for 7 years, said she had never
witnessed a case of cross contamination while working at the
hospital. "That only happens when a place is dirty," she said adding
that the hospital was sanitised thoroughly.

The risk of exposure to members of the public is further lowered by
the fact that animals infected in outbreaks such as this one are
usually not treated by private vets, said Dr Gary Buhrmann, Boland
chief state veterinarian. "State veterinarians are usually
responsible for a large bulk of the cases," he told News24. He urged
members of the public to remain calm, as they were "not really at risk."

In the Western Cape -- the latest province to report infections after
the outbreak started in the Free State, spread to the Eastern Cape
and the Northern Cape -- 3 farms in Beaufort West have reported Rift
Valley fever infections, Buhrmann said. Infected animals there were
dying at a rate of 5 - 10 percent, he said.

Beaufort West state veterinarian Dr Jaco Pienaar, who is recovering
from what he believes to be Rift Valley fever (he is waiting for
laboratory confirmation), reiterated Buhrmann's assertions. He said
although the risk remained high for people who come into contact with
the bodily fluids of infected animals, he had never heard of a human
to human infection case and infection through mosquito bites was yet
to be proven. Pienaar was infected while performing a post mortem on
an infected cow.

"I'm feeling a lot better now," Pienaar said although his eyes were
still hurting. Sensitivity to light is one of the symptoms of Rift
Valley fever in humans. According to the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases other symptoms include flu-like symptoms, neck
stiffness, vomiting and loss of appetite.

As of Thursday [8 Apr 2010], there were 100 confirmed cases of human
Rift Valley fever infections in the country, 77 of them in the Free
State. A total of 7 people have died from the disease.
