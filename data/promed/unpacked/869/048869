Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Sweden
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 18 Sep 2015 from Dr Ingrid Eilertz, Chief Veterinary Officer Director and Head, Swedish Board of Agriculture Department for Animal Welfare and Health, Ministry for Rural Affairs, Jonkoping, Sweden

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 22 Jun 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 13 Aug 2015
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hisings Backa, Hisings Backa, Goteborg, Vastra Gotaland [County]
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Jun 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 26 Jun 2015
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 3 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a domestic (pet) rabbit. It was one of 3 rabbits in a household and was the dam of the other 2 animals. One daughter died 4 days before the mother but no necropsy or examination was performed.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: in addition to this outbreak in domestic rabbits, cases from 2011 to 2014 were retrospectively identified in archived material saved from wild rabbits examined within the National Veterinary Institute's passive surveillance program. During initial examination (2011-2014), these rabbits were diagnosed with rabbit hemorrhagic disease based on typical necropsy and microscopic findings. Banked samples were then analyzed in 2015 for the presence of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2). These were opportunistic samples of wild rabbits found dead and submitted to the National Veterinary Institute for examination. To verify that our diagnostic methods (real-time PCR and sequencing) were working, samples from some wild rabbits were submitted to the OIE Reference Laboratory for rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Brescia (Italy).

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Rabbits / real-time PCR / 13 Aug 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[According to recent publications, the emerging lagovirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) has been described as a strain that infects not only rabbits but also hares (http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5).

RHDV2 is less virulent and with lower observed mortality rates than RHDV and RHDVa. However, the disease resulting from RHDV2 is longer in duration and will take a chronic or subacute course more often than RHD caused by the other viral strains (http://biome.biomedcentral.com/new-lagovirus-identified-as-cause-of-rabbit-haemorrhagic-disease/).

For more information on RHDV-2 see commentary in ProMED-mail posting 20150708.3494836 . - Mod.CRD]
