Prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding tied to in-hospital delirium, death by 6 months
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is tied to a higher risk of in-hospital delirium and death by 6 months, according to a study published this week in GeroScience.

A team led by Northwestern University researchers retrospectively evaluated viral shedding in 2518 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Illinois from 5 Mar to 9 Aug 2020. A total of 959 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at least once 14 or more days after their initial positive test, 405 (42.2%) of whom were still shedding virus. Average age of patients who underwent repeat testing was 59.4 years.

Prolonged viral shedding was linked to male sex, higher body mass index, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and corticosteroid treatment during initial COVID-19 hospitalization. After adjustment for factors such as severity of respiratory dysfunction, shedding remained linked to in-hospital delirium (odds ratio [OR], 2.45) and death by 6 months (OR, 2.43). Of persistent shedders, 56% experienced delirium.

Relative to nonshedding patients, shedders were more often men (53.8% vs 47.1%) and had more repeat tests (median, 4 vs 3), but nonshedders were tested for a longer time (median, 131.5 vs 64.0 days after the initial positive result).

The last positive PCR test in persistent shedders was obtained at a median of 34.6 days after initial testing, but 49 (12.1%) still tested positive 90 or more days later. A total of 111 (27.4%) had a positive repeat test after a negative repeat test at a median of 53.4 days after their initial test. One patient was still shedding SARS-CoV-2 at 269 days.

"Many studies, even pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that patients who are delirious during hospitalization are more likely to have long-term cognitive issues and may experience accelerated cognitive decline with aging," senior author Eric Liotta, MD, said in a Northwestern Medicine press release. "As such, patients with persistent viral shedding may warrant closer surveillance and monitoring for development of complications following COVID-19."

"In the persistent shedding group:
• 54% of patients were men
• 56% experienced in-hospital delirium, the primary neurologic complication of acute COVID-19
• Less likely to be discharged to home from the hospital
• 15% of patients died within 6 months
• Common comorbidities were diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension and increased BMI

"This study is one of the first to inform the care of patients who continue to test positive for COVID-19," said Ayush Batra, MD, a Northwestern Medicine neurocritical care specialist who treats COVID-19 patients and co-authored the study. "We were intrigued to see the strong and large association between persistent viral shedding and long-term post-hospital mortality, even after adjusting for age, severity of respiratory dysfunction, and presence of delirium. This suggests that the presence of persistently positive RT-PCR tests has important clinical implications for patients.

"These patients were much more likely to have been delirious while they were hospitalized, even after adjusting for other factors that put patients at risk for delirium. This is an important finding because many studies, even pre-dating the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest that patients who are delirious during hospitalization are more likely to have long-term cognitive issues and may experience accelerated cognitive decline with aging. As such, patients with persistent viral shedding may warrant closer surveillance and monitoring for development of complications following COVID-19," said Eric Liotta, MD, a Northwestern Medicine neurocritical care specialist who treats COVID-19 patients and co-authored the study.

"The strong link between prolonged viral shedding and experiencing delirium also suggests studies are needed to investigate if prolonged viral shedding is related to neurological symptoms in COVID-19 long-haulers. To date, the Northwestern Medicine Neuro COVID-19 Clinic has treated more than 1400 patients with neurological long-hauler symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell." - Mod.LK]

Omicron COVID-19 variant tied to croup in children
--------------------------------------------------
Boston Children's researchers have found evidence that the COVID-19 omicron variant is more likely to cause croup in children than previous SARS-CoV-2 iterations, according to a study today [13 May 2022] in Pediatrics.

The investigators noted that, from 1 Mar 2020 to 15 Jan 2022, 75 children were diagnosed as having COVID-19-associated croup at Boston Children's Hospital. Of those, 61 (81%) were diagnosed during the omicron period. One child tested positive for rhinovirus in addition to SARS-CoV-2.

Children with croup have a swollen larynx and trachea, often accompanied by a barking-type cough and difficulty breathing.

Nine of the 75 children (12%) were hospitalized (7 during micron; 2 pre-omicron), and they spent a median of 1.7 days in the hospital. Four of them required intensive care. The rest were treated in the emergency department.

All but 2 patients were treated with dexamethasone. Hospitalized patients received a median of 6 dexamethasone and 8 racemic epinephrine doses.

The study authors wrote that the data present "compelling evidence" that omicron causes croup. The variant's tendency to affect the upper airway may help explain the connection, they added. They concluded, "Further research is needed to characterize the underlying mechanisms of COVID-19-associated croup, differences in clinical features from other viral etiologies, and appropriate management strategies."

"Discussion
This retrospective analysis of a freestanding children's hospital found that the incidence of croup cooccurring with SARS-CoV-2 infection sharply increased in December 2021, strongly correlating with emergence of the omicron variant. Other spikes in COVID-19 were not associated with increased diagnoses of croup. Interestingly, the observed rates of hospitalization and redosing of croup-directed therapies may indicate a more severe phenotype compared to other viral etiologies. Taken together; our preliminary findings lend compelling evidence to the hypothesis that the omicron variant causes laryngotracheobronchitis. This tropism shift may stem from differences in protein expression between cells of the lower respiratory versus upper respiratory tract, although variant-specific mechanistic studies remain an active research area." - Mod.LK]

Coronavirus 'ghosts' found lingering in the gut
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists are studying whether long COVID could be linked to viral fragments found in the body months after initial infection.

In the chaos of the 1st months of the coronavirus pandemic, oncologist and geneticist Ami Bhatt was intrigued by widespread reports of vomiting and diarrhoea in people infected with SARS-CoV-2. "At that time, this was thought to be a respiratory virus," she says. Bhatt and her colleagues, curious about a possible link between the virus and the gastrointestinal symptoms, began to collect stool samples from people with COVID-19.

Thousands of miles away from Bhatt's laboratory at Stanford Medicine in California, gastroenterology internist Timon Adolph was puzzled by accounts of gut symptoms in infected people. Adolph and his colleagues at the Medical University of Innsbruck in Austria started to assemble specimens, too -- gastrointestinal-tissue biopsies.

Two years into the pandemic, the scientists' foresight has paid off: both teams have recently published results suggesting that pieces of SARS-CoV-2 can linger in the gut for months after an initial infection. The findings add to a growing pool of evidence supporting the hypothesis that persistent bits of virus -- coronavirus "ghosts", Bhatt has called them -- could contribute to the mysterious condition called long COVID.

Even so, Bhatt both urges scientists to keep an open mind and cautions that researchers have not yet nailed down a link between persistent viral fragments and long COVID. "Additional studies still need to be done -- and they're not easy," she says.

Long COVID is often defined as symptoms that linger beyond 12 weeks after an acute infection. More than 200 symptoms have been associated with the disorder, which ranges in severity from mild to debilitating. Theories about its origins vary, and include harmful immune responses, tiny blood clots and lingering viral reservoirs in the body. Many researchers think that a mix of these factors contributes to the global burden of disease.

An early hint that the coronavirus might persist in the body came in work published in 2021 by gastroenterologist Saurabh Mehandru at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and his colleagues. By then [2021], it was clear that cells lining the gut display the protein that the virus uses to enter cells. This allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect the gut.

Mehandru and his team found viral nucleic acids and proteins in gastrointestinal tissue collected from people who'd been diagnosed with COVID-19 an average of 4 months earlier. The researchers also studied participants' memory B cells, which are pivotal players in the immune system. The team found that antibodies produced by these B cells were continuing to evolve, suggesting that, at 6 months after the initial infection, the cells were still responding to molecules made by SARS-CoV-2.

Inspired by this work, Bhatt and her colleagues found that a few people continued to shed viral RNA into their stool 7 months after an initial mild or moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection, well after their respiratory symptoms had ended.

Virus goes for the gut
----------------------
Adolph says the 2021 paper inspired his team to look at their biopsy samples for signs of coronavirus. They found that 32 of 46 study participants who had had mild COVID-19 showed evidence of viral molecules in their gut 7 months after acute infection. About 2/3 of those 32 people had long COVID symptoms.

But all of the participants in this study had inflammatory bowel disease, an autoimmune disorder, and Adolph cautions that his data do not establish that there is active virus in these people, or that the viral material is causing long COVID.

In the meantime, more studies have suggested lingering viral reservoirs beyond the gut. Another team of researchers has studied tissue collected from autopsies of 44 people who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and found evidence of viral RNA in many sites, including the heart, eyes and brain. Viral RNA and proteins were detected up to 230 days after infection. The study has not yet been peer reviewed.

Viral hideouts
--------------
Nearly all of the people in that sample had had severe COVID-19, but a separate study of 2 people who had had mild COVID-19 followed by long COVID symptoms found viral RNA in the appendix and the breast. Pathologist Joe Yeong at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at the Agency for Science, Technology, and Research in Singapore, who is a co-author of the report, which has not been peer reviewed, speculates that the virus might infiltrate and hide out in immune cells called macrophages, which can be found in a variety of the body's tissues.

All of these studies support the possibility that long-term viral reservoirs contribute to long COVID, but researchers will need to do more work to conclusively show a link, says Mehandru. They will need to document that the coronavirus is evolving in people who are not immunocompromised, and they will need to link such evolution to long COVID symptoms. "Right now there is anecdotal evidence, but there are a lot of unknowns," Mehandru says.

Bhatt is hopeful that samples will become available to test the viral-reservoir hypothesis. The US National Institute of Health, for example, is running a large study called RECOVER, which aims to tackle the causes of long COVID and will collect biopsies from the lower intestines of some participants.

But Sheng says he does not need to wait for a billion-dollar study to get more samples: an organization of people with long COVID has contacted him and offered to send samples from members who have had biopsies for various reasons, such as a cancer diagnosis, after their infections. "It's really random, the tissue can come from everywhere," he says. "But they don't want to wait."

North Korea's Kim says COVID 'great turmoil', 21 new deaths reported
--------------------------------------------------------------------
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Saturday [14 May 2022] that the spread of COVID-19 had put the country in "great turmoil" and called for an all-out battle to overcome the epidemic, while 21 new deaths were reported among people with fever.

North Korea this week acknowledged for the 1st time a COVID outbreak, imposing a nationwide lockdown. But there was no sign of a rigorous testing or treatment campaign in the isolated country's rudimentary healthcare system.

"The spread of the malignant epidemic is a great turmoil to fall on our country since the founding," Kim told an emergency meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, according to state news agency KCNA.

"But if we don't lose focus in implementing epidemic policy and maintain strong organisation power and control based on single-minded unity of the party and the people and strengthen our epidemic battle, we can more than overcome the crisis."

The numbers probably represent a fraction of total cases, given North Korea's limited testing capabilities, and could lead to thousands of deaths in 1 of only 2 countries without a vaccination campaign, experts have said.

The outbreak could also deepen a dire food crisis, with the lockdown hampering anti-drought efforts and mobilisation of labour.

The Workers' Party meeting heard reports of about 280 810 people being treated and 27 deaths since a fever of unidentified origins was reported starting in late April [2022], KCNA said.

State media did not say whether the new deaths were due to COVID. One death had been confirmed from the omicron variant, KCNA said on Friday [13 May 2022].

Since late April [2022], 524 440 people have shown signs of fever including 174 440 new cases on Friday [13 May 2022], KCNA said. About 243 630 have been treated but KCNA has not said how many people have been tested or confirmed the total number of COVID cases.

North Korea has been testing about 1400 people a week, according to Harvard Medical School's Kee Park, who has worked on healthcare projects in the country, not nearly enough to survey the hundreds of thousands of people with symptoms.

Kim told the meeting the crisis had been caused by the incompetence and irresponsibility of party organisations but transmission was not uncontrollable and the country must have faith in its battle to overcome the crisis in the shortest possible period.

The meeting also heard a report from epidemic control officials that "in most cases, human casualties were caused by negligence including drug overdose due to lack of knowledge of treatment methods".

Kim offered to donate his family's medical supplies for families experiencing hardship "with his resolution to always share the destiny with the people", KCNA said.

"It is good to actively learn from the advanced and rich anti-epidemic successes and experience already gained by the Chinese party and people in the struggle against malicious epidemic," Kim was quoted as saying.

China and Russia are among countries offering help with vaccines, but Pyongyang has not publicly sought assistance.

Kim's comment will prompt health officials to study China's zero-COVID policy more closely and possibly reach out to Chinese health authorities, said Cheong Seong-chang, who heads Sejong Institute's North Korea studies near Seoul.

"By natural extension, we can expect the North to ask China for COVID-19 treatment and testing equipment," he wrote in an analysis.

While much of the world is seeking to live with COVID, China continues to enforce a zero-COVID policy putting hundreds of millions in dozens of cities under tight movement restrictions.

North Korea said that party officials, workers and youth continued to be mobilized for work to prevent drought damage and for rice-planting in different parts of the country, KCNA said.

North Korea has not reported on the possible source of the outbreak. A Seoul-based website that reports from sources in North Korea said on Friday [13 May 2022] some students of a university in Pyongyang had tested positive after participating in an event on [1 May 2022]. Kim attended the event.

The students had relatives who worked in trade with China and may have spread the virus when they subsequently visited their hometowns outside Pyongyang, the Daily NK website said, citing a source in Pyongyang.

Reuters could not independently verify the report.

North Korea's border with China was reopened for trade early this year [2022], but in April [2022] China suspended freight service between Dandong on its side and North Korea's Sinuiju due to COVID in China.

[The testing capacity of 1400 tests per week is a drop in the bucket when 524 440 illnesses have been reported with 27 deaths, amid a rapid spread of fever since late April 2022. This comes when the country had previously held for more than 2 years to a widely doubted claim of a perfect record in keeping out the virus that has spread to nearly every place in the world. One wonders where the index case came from in such a closed country.

"Kim, who said he was donating some of his private medicine supplies to help the anti-virus campaign, expressed optimism that the country could bring the outbreak under control, saying most transmissions are occurring within communities that are isolated from one another and not spreading from region to region."

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries: the USA (108 142), Spain (68 234), Germany (67 670), Taiwan (65 000), Australia (52 600), Japan (42 378), Italy (39 029), France (32 773), South Korea (29 541), Brazil (25 609), and Belgium (14 315) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2095 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 11 May 2022 to late 12 May 2022).

A total of 29 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 15 of the 29 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, none from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 19.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 39.2% increase in daily reported cases and a 43.4% increase in reported deaths. There is an overall global trend of decreasing cases and deaths (the US has shown an increasing trend in cases and deaths over the last few days).
