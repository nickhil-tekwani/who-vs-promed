French health inspectors have seized more than 100 000 bottles of Rhone
Valley wine amid fears it might have been treated with powdered cattle
blood, which has been banned in the European Union (EU) since 1997 after
concern over mad cow disease.
As a government swoop on 14 vineyards in the Vaucluse and Bouches du Rhone
region revealed blood could still be being added illegally to wine as a
purifying substance. One French table-wine exporter, Jean Pistonier, said
millions of bottles of wine containing ox blood could have been exported to
Britain in the years after the ban.
Blood is traditionally used after vinification to clarify the wine by
eliminating resin and suspended particles.
The Rhone Valley regional Wine and Spirits Inspection Office said 480lb of
purifying products based on cow's blood had been seized, with more than 100
000 bottles of suspect wine between June 7 and 14 [1999 in the region
around Avignon.
Although the vineyards and wine wholesalers involved were located in areas
that carry the renowned Cotes de Provence and Cotes du Rhone AOC or
"appellation d'origine controlee" -- the French label guaranteeing quality
wines -- three quarters of the impounded wine carried the lower quality VDQS
table-wine label. However, the equivalent of 27 000 bottles of an AOC
"natural sweet wine" was seized by inspectors.
Gerard Bedos, who heads the regional Consumer and Anti-Fraud Office in
Marseilles, assured customers yesterday the Cotes du Rhone and Cotes de
Provence AOC wines were not involved. The impounded wine is being tested to
determine whether it has been treated with ox blood.
Dried cow's blood had been used for centuries to purify wine until the
European Union banned it as a precautionary measure in November 1997 after
scientists found links between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and
the human brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD).
Jamie Quiot, head of the National Institute of AOC wines, defended the use
of such products. "They are not toxic at all. We only asked for their
withdrawal to protect our image," he said.
Emmanuel Lerat, of the National Confederation of AOC Wine and Spirits
Producers, said the vineyards found using the ox blood were small producers
using outdated methods such as egg white to purify wine. Such practices are
increasingly being abandoned for more modern and efficient methods, notably
using clay-based purifying substances such as bentonite.
The affair comes as France has suffered a succession of food scares
involving BSE, dioxin-contaminated poultry products from Belgium, and
allegations of illness caused by contaminated Coca-Cola products and French
unpasteurised cheese.
Wine producers now fear they will be next to suffer the economic
consequences of customers' fears concerning the safety of their food.
