It was learned on Wednesday that a woman, 34, who died on Sunday from the
chronic ailment lupus also was infected with bird flu [influenza A/H5N1.
She was the fifth person with the H5N1 influenza virus to die and the 18th
confirmed case so far. One suspected case remains.
But Department of Health officials said the new case did not mean there was
a resurgence of the bird flu as her illness began a day before the
slaughter of chickens on 29 December.
A spokesman believed Hong Kong to be in the clear as no new cases have been
reported in the past two weeks.
"We can say that the high risk period is over" as the incubation period of
the H5N1 virus was estimated to be between seven to 14 days, he said.
The local woman was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 28 December
suffering from multiple complications due to systemic lupus erythromatrosis
(SLE), a multi-system infection caused by a depressed immune system.
Dr Lily Chiu, deputy hospital chief executive at Queen Elizabeth, said,
"She presented with a lot of complications of SLE and we were treating her
for that." The woman had pneumonia, septicaemia (blood poisoning) and
kidney failure when admitted. She had been sick for two weeks at home
before her admission. She was transferred to the hospital's intensive care
unit on 7 January and died four days later.
Dr Chiu said it was not until 9 January that the hospital took samples from
the patient for influenza A tests. But the quick test at the hospital
laboratory proved negative. The results of further tests for H5N1 which
came in only on Wednesday showed the woman had the bird flu.
Dr Chiu said the anti-viral drug, amantadine, which could cure H5N1, was
not administered to the woman because she had kidney failure. She was
treated with antibiotics. "She's not like any other patient in which you
would suspect the flu. She had ample reasons for the pneumonia and the
fever with the flare-up of the SLE," she said.
