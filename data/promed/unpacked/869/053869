Microbe found in fish on East Coast linked to memory disorder
Researchers reported the first scientific evidence of a human health threat
from _Pfiesteria piscicida_ Thursday, saying the toxic microbe found in
waterways along the U.S. East Coast was responsible for a new neurological
syndrome. Writing in The Lancet medical journal, Maryland researchers
blamed the single-cell dinoflagellate for problems among 24 commercial
fishermen, sportsmen and environmental workers exposed to contaminated
water on Chesapeake Bay's Eastern shore last year. The syndrome, though
temporary, was marked by several disturbing symptoms including impaired
memory, disorientation and learning difficulties. The symptoms were most
severe among those with the highest exposure to _Pfiesteria_-contaminated
water. But in each case, health problems began to fade after three months
and were gone after six.
In separate but unpublished studies, the team of scientists from the
University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University also found evidence
linking _Pfiesteria_ to changes in brain metabolism and said contact led to
skin lesions among those with the most pronounced neurological
difficulties. The health problems appeared to be caused by unidentified
toxic chemicals secreted by the microorganism. "These are extremely potent
toxins," said Dr. Glenn Morris, the University of Maryland epidemiologist
who heads the team.
"What this does is to open up a completely new field of research. We don't
know what the toxins are or how they act. And we don't know how they are
transmitted to the brain." Although _Pfiesteria_ has long been identified
in the press as causing health problems including memory loss, politicians
and policymakers in some states have denied any threat to the public and
concentrated instead on the millions of fish that have developed lesions or
died in massive fish kills in contaminated waters. New outbreaks already
have been reported this year in North Carolina and Maryland...
