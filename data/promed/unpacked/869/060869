The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [11 Mar 2016] investigating a case of severe paediatric influenza B infection and again urged the public, particularly young children, to get vaccinated promptly and observe strict hand, personal and environmental hygiene amid the winter influenza season. Children, the elderly and those with chronic diseases should promptly seek medical advice if influenza-like symptoms develop.

The 6-month-old baby boy, with good past health, has presented with fever, cough and runny nose since 4 Mar 2016. He was taken to a general practitioner on 5 Mar 2016 and to the Accident and Emergency Department of Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), where he was admitted on 6 Mar 2016.

He developed shortness of breath on 11 Mar 2016 and was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit for further treatment. He is now in a stable condition.

His nasopharyngeal aspirate tested positive for the influenza B virus antigen by PMH. His clinical diagnosis was influenza B complicated with pneumonia.

The CHP's initial enquiries revealed that the patient had no recent travel history.

His grandmother, who lives with him, recently suffered from upper respiratory tract symptoms. She has been in a stable condition all along. His other home contacts were asymptomatic. Investigations are ongoing.

The public should maintain good personal and environmental hygiene against influenza and other respiratory illnesses:

* Receive seasonal influenza vaccination for personal protection;
* Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
* When hands are not visibly soiled, clean them with 70 to 80 per cent alcohol-based handrub;
* Wash or clean hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, or after touching public installations such as handrails or door knobs;
* Cover the nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing, and wash hands thoroughly afterwards;
* Dispose of soiled tissue paper properly in a lidded rubbish bin;
* Put on a surgical mask when respiratory symptoms develop;
* Maintain good indoor ventilation;
* When influenza is prevalent, avoid going to crowded or poorly ventilated public places; high-risk individuals may consider putting on surgical masks in such places; and
* Maintain a balanced diet, exercise regularly, take adequate rest, do not smoke and avoid over-stress.

[Influenza virus B is the only species in the genus in the virus family _Orthomyxoviridae_. Unlike type A influenza viruses, type B influenza is found only in humans (and seals). This limited host range is apparently responsible for the lack of influenza virus B-caused influenza pandemics in contrast with those caused by the morphologically similar influenza virus A, as both mutate by both antigenic drift and reassortment. Type B influenza may cause less severe symptoms than type A influenza virus, but occasionally, type B can still be extremely harmful. Influenza B viruses are also thought to evolve more slowly than A viruses. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. - Mod.LK
