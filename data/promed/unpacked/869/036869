Mystery fever spreads in Andhra, toll 80
-----------------------
A mystery fever suspected to be Japanese encephalitis continues to wreak
havoc in the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh, claiming 80 lives during
the last 2 weeks.
10 children died on Tuesday in Warangal, Nizamabad, and Adilabad districts,
while 400 children are undergoing treatment in Karimnagar district, where
the disease was first reported late last month. After Karimnagar, where 30
children have succumbed to the viral fever, the disease has claimed an
equal number of lives in the neighbouring district of Warangal.
Initial reports from the New Delhi-based National Institute Communicable
Diseases and Pune's National Institute of Virology show that the children
have died of Japanese encephalitis.
The final reports of the blood samples sent to the 2 institutes are
expected by the weekend.
The children are dying within hours after their admission into hospitals.
They complain of high fever, headache, diarrhoea, and convulsions. Many
seriously ill have been shifted to the government-run Niluofer Hospital in
Hyderabad. Concerned, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has asked the
district authorities to take all measures to control the epidemic.
Naidu deputed senior officials to Warangal to monitor relief operations and
directed the local administration to take up cleaning operations on a war
footing. Mosquitoes are believed to be spreading the virus. The affected
districts also have a high number of pigs, the breeding ground for JE virus.
Even as the authorities battle to control the disease in the 4 districts,
reports from districts and regions say children were being admitted to
hospitals with symptoms of viral fever. The viral fever has reportedly
claimed 6 lives in Khammam district, also in the Telangana region. Acute
and infectious diseases characterized by allergic rashes and high fever
have been spreading on epidemic proportions in the district.
One death has been reported from the coastal district of Krishna. 6
children died of viral fever in the district in June 2003. In Cuddapah
district, about 100 students of a residential school were hospitalised with
viral fever.
Health Minister Kodela Sivaprasad Rao said in the last 15 days, 165
children of the age group of 2 to 14 years were admitted to hospitals in 6
districts, and 71 of them have died.

[The description of the illness in the newswires, "high fever, headache,
diarrhoea and convulsions," is different from the description of the
illness in the reported outbreak in West Bengal "high fever,
breathlessness, convulsion, increased salivation, followed by stiffening of
jaws within 5-6 hours of the onset of the disease and death", suggesting
that the 2 outbreaks are not related, but not conclusively. Japanese
encephalitis is endemic/epidemic in India
According to the CDC travel website, Japanese encephalitis occurs in all
areas within India with the exception of Arunachal, Dadra, Daman, Diu,
Gujarat, Himachal, Jammu, Kashmir, Lakshadweep, Meghalaya, Nagar Haveli,
Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Sikkim. The transmission season: in South
India is May to October in Goa; October to January in Tamil Nadu; and
August to December in Karnataka. Second peak, April to June in Mandya
District Andrha Pradesh: September to December North India: July to
December. Outbreaks have been reported in West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka,
Tamil Nadu, Andrha Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, and Goa. While
it is primarily seen in rural areas, urban cases have also been reported
(e.g., in Luchnow).
