Experts have released data on the incidence of syphilis among residents of Bashkiria [Bashkortostan] for January-November 2021. The statistics were published by Roszdravnadzor [Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare]. Over 11 months of last year [2021], 200 cases of the disease were recorded in the Republic. Compared to the same period in 2020, the incidence decreased by 8%, or 12 cases.

Also in January-November [2021], experts discovered syphilis in 2 children under 14 years of age. In 2020, this diagnosis was made in one child.

The incidence rate of sexually transmitted diseases in Bashkiria is 4.94 per 100 000 population. In the Volga Federal District, the region most affected by syphilis is the Saratov region -- 16.95 per 100 000 inhabitants.

Note that syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. There are times when infection occurs in a household way: through dishes, towels, toothbrushes, and so on.

Bashkiria, also called the Republic of Bashkortostan, is a republic of Russia located between the Volga (the longest river in Europe) and the Ural Mountains, with a population of 4 million; its capital and largest city is Ufa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashkortostan). Bashkiria is one of 14 federal subjects in the Volga Federal District, which forms the southeastern part of European Russia. A map of the Volga Federal District showing the location of Bashkiria (indicated as 1 on the map) within the Volga Federal District can be found at https://bit.ly/3G5XT6x. Saratov, the region in the Volga Federal District that is most affected by syphilis according to the news report above, is indicated as 10 on this map. A map of Russia showing the location of Bashkiria can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Republic+of+Bashkortostan,+Russia.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection, caused by the spirochetal bacterium _Treponema pallidum_. Person-to-person transmission of syphilis can occur during vaginal, anal, or oral sex by direct contact with the sore that characterizes the primary stage of syphilis, known as a chancre. Chancres can occur on or around the external genitals, in the vagina, around the anus, or in the rectum, or in or around the mouth. Syphilis can also be transmitted by direct contact with the skin rashes or mucous membrane lesions (in the mouth, vagina, or anus) that characterize secondary syphilis. Pregnant women with syphilis can transmit the infection to their unborn child.

Although syphilis transmission has occurred via blood transfusion in the past, transmission by this route is believed to be very rare since the implementation of screening of the blood supply and refrigeration of blood products (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973824/). Transmission has also occurred in recipients following organ transplantation (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973824/).

Sharing contaminated items such as sex toys could also transmit the disease (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/syphilis/). Using a razor after it has been in contact with infected sores may also transmit the disease (https://yoursexualhealth.co.uk/blog/ca-you-catch-syphilis-without-having-sex/), as has occupational exposure to syphilis via accidental injury with a surgical scalpel (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973824/). However, transmission is unlikely via toilet seats, cutlery, and towels (https://yoursexualhealth.co.uk/blog/ca-you-catch-syphilis-without-having-sex/). - Mod.ML
