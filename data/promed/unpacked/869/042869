PANAMA DISEASE, BANANA - OMAN

[I] recently travelled to Oman where assistance is being requested with control of the most dangerous strain (4th strain) of Panama disease of banana (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_). They suspect that it was introduced to the country from India.

[We are] interested to hear news of recent advances in control methods or any other advice to effectively control this disease.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. Several races of the PD pathogen exist which vary in host range.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

An undiagnosed disease of banana was reported from Oman in 2010 (ProMED-mail post 20100909.3249) on new plantings of G9, the Cavendish type banana cultivar Grand Naine (see links below). Cavendish varieties are attacked by temperate and tropical PD races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510). No information is provided above about which one of the races 4 has been implicated in Oman. The item also does not state whether the 2010 report is regarded as the 1st appearance of PD, or whether there may be several different problems affecting bananas in Oman. It appears that the origin of the current outbreak of PD still needs to be clarified.

We thank Dr Alrouechdi for this contribution and would be grateful to readers for information as requested by him.
