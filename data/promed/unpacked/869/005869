[1] Agoutis NOT
Date: 27 Apr 2014
From: Luis Ruedas <ruedas@pdx.edu> [edited]


Note with respect to the post below that the animal identified as "agouti" most likely refers (for the English speaking members of the list) to the cane rat, _Thryonomys swinderianus_, a hystricomorph rodent of the family Thryonomyidae. Agouti more properly refers to the South American members of the genus _Dasyprocta_, which indeed is the animal illustrated in the link to the "photo of agouti."

Given the habitat of _Thryonomys swinderianus_, or other cane rats for that matter, it is unlikely that they would be associated with ebolavirus, but the reprieve noted on hunting is welcome.

[The cane rat lives by reed-beds and riverbanks in Sub-Saharan Africa. It can grow to nearly 2 ft (0.61 m) in length and weigh a little less than 19 lb (8.6 kg). They are nocturnal and make nests from grasses or burrow underground. Individuals of the species may live in excess of 4 years. If frightened, they grunt and run towards water.

As humans expanded into the cane rat's native habitats, the cane rats likewise expanded from their native reeds into the plantations, particularly the sugar cane plantations from which they derive their name. Their tendency to adopt plantations as habitat, where they feed on agricultural crops such as maize, wheat, sugar-cane, and cassava, often earns them the label of agricultural pest. However, the peoples of the region also utilize the cane rat as a food source (bushmeat), considering the meat a delicacy. Consequently, grasscutters (as they are often called in Ghana and other regions of West Africa) are beginning to be raised in cages for sale [excerpted from Wikipedia].

[2] Ebolaviruses from duikers?
Date: 27 Apr 2014
From: David Quammen <dq@davidquammen.com> [edited]


Is it true that ebolaviruses have been isolated -- that is, live virus, not just detection of antibodies -- from duikers and porcupines, as stated in today's post? I would like to go to the paper.

[3] Gambia preparedness

Ever since the deadly Ebola virus broke out in neighbouring Guinea in Conakry, the Gambia government through its Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and partners have been on their toes and have been devising various strategies to prevent it from hitting the country.

As part of these strategies, the Ministry in collaboration with the UN system, through the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), recently organised a training of trainers' synergy for health workers and non-health workers on ebolavirus disease preparedness and response.

[4] Guinea: Where are we?
Date: 28 Apr 2014

Is the fact that little is said about the outbreak of ebolavirus disease in recent weeks the result of the change made in the communication strategy? Or is it that the disease is really declining, as the Guinean authorities would have us believe? After the last newsletter produced by the Presidency of the Republic on Thu 24 Apr 2014, but only made public on Sat 26 Apr 2014, we realize that the answer lies among these 2 cases.

Indeed, while the previous communication strategy, taking into account also suspected deaths whose causes were not formally (clinically) connected to the ebolavirus, the latest [cleaned] statistics indicate that 72 people up to the date of 24 Apr 2014 have succumbed to the terrible virus out of a total of 115 confirmed cases.

Although these figures are deplorable as such, nevertheless, they are well below those previously available to the public. Particularly quick to highlight the "success stories" of the management of the epidemic, the Presidency of the Republic hastens to add that 21 people have survived after being tested positive for ebolavirus.

These lucky 21 are distributed as follows: 12 in Conakry, 7 in Guekedou and 2 in Macenta. In the same vein, the authorities also mention the fact that of 878 people under surveillance (contact persons), 588 did not show any signs of the disease after 21 days [the incubation period]. Therefore, their names were removed from the watch list. Good news, except that the remaining 290 are waiting also to be cleared.

Besides this relatively positive news, there is some about which we cannot rejoice, relating to the progression of the epidemic. Statistics from the Presidency of the Republic indicate that 6 new confirmed cases have been reported between 17-24 Apr 2014; 5 of these cases occurred in Gueckedo; this city in the south remains the main focus for the spread of the disease. But in this latest information, the most disturbing fact lies in the interval of time during which the new cases were recorded. This interval information in effect means that the chain of propagation is not yet controlled. However, it is at this level where the biggest challenge lies, hence the need to continue and intensify the fight.

[In relation to duikers and porcupines, I should not have used the word "isolated," but I did not write, nor mean to imply, that any of those animals are hosts or commonly infected. Partial sequences can be misleading, e.g. a North American "ebolavirus-like" L-sequence fragment was later, after full L gene sequence determination, shown to belong to a lyssavirus (rabies group). Similarly, antibodies can cross-react, although they usually indicate an encounter with a virus of the same group. - Mod.JW
