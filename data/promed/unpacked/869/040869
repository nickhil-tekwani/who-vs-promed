The Florida Department of Health in Marion County stated Wednesday [23 Apr 2014] there has been an increase in mosquito-borne disease activity in areas of Marion County.

A horse in the Sparr area tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) infection, and there is a heightened concern residents could become ill, according to a news release.

The department reminds residents and visitors to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take basic precautions to help limit exposure.

The department issued the following tips and advice:
Drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying:
- drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots, or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected;
- discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances, and other items that aren't being used.
- empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week.
- protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
- maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

Cover skin with clothing or repellent:
- Clothing: wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent: apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide), picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.
Tips on repellents:
- always read label directions carefully for the approved usage before you apply a repellent. Some repellents are not suitable for children;
- products with concentrations of up to 30 percent DEET are generally recommended. Other US Environmental Protection Agency-approved repellents contain picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. These products are generally available at local pharmacies. Look for active ingredients to be listed on the product label.
- apply insect repellent to exposed skin, or onto clothing, but not under clothing;
- in protecting children, read label instructions to be sure the repellent is age-appropriate. According to the CDC, mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under the age of 3 years. DEET is not recommended on children younger than 2 months old;
- avoid applying repellents to the hands of children. Adults should apply repellent first to their own hands and then transfer it to the child's skin and clothing;
- if additional protection is necessary, apply a permethrin repellent directly to your clothing. Again, always follow the manufacturer's directions.

Cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house:
- repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

For more information to help choose skin-applied repellent products, visit the Environmental Protection Agency's search tool at http://cfpub.epa.gov/oppref/insect/#searchform.

Residents of Florida are encouraged to report dead birds via the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's site at http://www.myfwc.com/bird.

[The tips mentioned in the article are all important to protect yourself, your children, and your animals by reducing the mosquito breeding areas.

However, there is a very effective vaccine for horses and it should be given now if it has not been given. Horses need boosters yearly and in areas in the South and East the vaccine should be given every 3 to 4 months.
