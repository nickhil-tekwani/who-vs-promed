A Lowood property has been placed in quarantine after a horse died from Hendra virus. Biosecurity Queensland confirmed a horse had died on the Somerset region property after it fell sick at the weekend [22-23 Jun 2013].

On Monday night [24 Jun 2013] a vet sent samples from the horse to the agency. The samples tested positive for Hendra virus.

It is the 3rd case of the virus in Queensland this year [2013]. Local health officials said 4 people had been identified as having had some contact with the sick horse. But all were assessed as having an extremely low risk of infection.

Biosecurity officers on Monday [24 Jun 2013] investigated the property [north west of Ipswich] where 20 other horses were believed to be under quarantine. Chief Biosecurity officer Dr Jim Thompson said his organisation was working with the owners to determine the risk to other horses on site. Testing and monitoring would be undertaken during the next month and that the infected horse had been put down on Monday, he said.

"While under quarantine, restrictions will apply to moving horses and horse materials on and off the infected property," he said.

As news spread through Lowood, veterinary surgeons were swamped with calls from panicked horse owners wanting to have their animals vaccinated.

Dr Thompson confirmed that vaccination was the most effective way to reduce the risk of Hendra virus [infection], which is spread by bats, and urged owners to have their horses vaccinated.

Biosecurity officials will also investigate whether there were bats on the Lowood property.

Since 1994, 4 people have died from the virus in Australia -- all of them in Queensland.

Acting West Moreton Hospital and Health Service Public Health physician Dr Kari Jarvinen reassured the community that transmission of the virus required close contact with body fluids of the sick horse.

"There is no evidence the virus can be passed directly from flying foxes to humans, from the environment to humans, or that it can be transmitted by airborne droplets," Dr Jarvinen said.

Somerset Mayor Graeme Lehmann offered assistance to Biosecurity Queensland after learning of the confirmed case of Hendra.

He encouraged residents concerned to get information on the virus through the Biosecurity Queensland website or its 13 43 25 84 hotline.

Scientists believe Hendra virus pre-dates human settlement of Australia. Since the 1st outbreak in 1994, to July 2012, 77 horse fatalities have been attributed to Hendra virus.

Hendra virus is responsible for an average of about 4 horse fatalities per year since it was discovered. The probability of a person dying as a result of Hendra virus infection is about 1 in 100 million.

[While Hendra virus seems to be hanging on, the upside is horse owners are getting on board with the vaccination policy. Hendra virus vaccine is going to become much like rabies vaccine. Vaccination for both of these diseases builds a barrier between the disease and humans. And it helps protect the pets.
