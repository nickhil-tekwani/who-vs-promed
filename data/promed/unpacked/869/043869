2nd case of late blight found in Bingham County
----------------------
Potato experts confirmed a 2nd case of late blight, a potato disease,
in a Bingham County field Tuesday. Potato disease specialist Jeff
Miller said the 2 cases are probably unrelated -- the fields are
several miles apart. Both cases are cause for concern, he said.

Miller said that the potato disease was discovered in 1 field Monday
in south Bingham County, and the 2nd was found Tuesday. Miller said
both farmers plan to destroy affected portions of their fields to
avoid spread.

Late blight is the potato fungus involved in the Irish potato famine
in the 1850s. It first occurred in Idaho in 1995 and in 1997 it
devastated potato crops. The disease is common in more moist
climates, but hasn't been prevalent in Idaho for a few years, Miller
said.

Chemicals are effective, he said, but because the fungus is rarer in
southeast Idaho, many fields are not sprayed often. "There are a lot
of fields in Idaho that are unprotected."

While the discovery of late blight in southeast Idaho fields is cause
for concern, it isn't a big surprise. Forecast models created at the
University of Idaho predicted late blight would appear in Idaho
potatoes during 2004, Miller said. Considering the regular
thunderstorms and rain, it's not unexpected said University of Idaho
student Extension Educator William Bohl. If the wet weather
continues, the disease could become hard to control.

Bingham County has been hit by regular thunderstorms and rain, Bohl
said, creating good conditions for the fungus. Miller is encouraging
farmers to walk their fields as much as possible, and to spray more
often. Fungicides are like sunscreen, he said. It protects only where
it has been applied, and it must be reapplied regularly.

[Potato late blight, caused by _Phytophthora infestans_ can, if
unchecked, result in catastrophic losses. The current University of
Idaho recommendation, if a protectant fungicide has not been applied
in the past 7-10 days is to put on an immediate application of
fungicide. For those who have applied a protectant fungicide, the
recommendation is stay on a 7-10 day fungicide spray schedule.

General strategies for disease management include forecasting and
reporting programs to predict late blight incidence, cultural control
(strict adherence to sanitary regimens to bury and compost culls,
removal of volunteer plants, avoidance of over-fertilization with
nitrogen, avoidance of solanaceous crops such as tomato, pepper and
eggplant in any crop rotation, and use of certified seed).
Unfortunately, there are no resistant cultivars, although some
cultivars such as Kennebec, Sebago and others express some resistance
and are being used in breeding programs. Compost teas made from horse
or cow manures in combination with beneficial bacteria are being
investigated as possible alternative fungicides.
