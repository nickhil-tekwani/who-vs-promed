Tobacco mosaic virus in Jalapeno Pepper in New York.

2003. Accepted for publication 14 Nov 2002.
Jalapeno pepper plants (_Capsicum annuum_ cv. Jaladuro) grown in Erie
County, New York expressed chlorotic oak-leaf patterns along the
primary vein of fully expanded leaves. Fruit had patterns of
irregular ripening with a bumpy surface. Symptom expression was most
obvious in August 2002, when leaf and fruit abscission occurred.
Symptomatic fruit samples were tested by western blot analysis for
the presence of 4 potyviruses [Cucumber mosaic (CMV), Potato Y (PVY),
Pepper mottle (PepMoV), Tobacco etch (TEV)], and Tobacco mosaic
tobamovirus (TMV). A positive reaction for TMV, but none of the other
viruses, was observed.
Symptomatic leaf samples were tested by Agdia, Inc. (Elkhart, IN) for
Alfalfa mosaic alfamovirus, CMV, Impatiens necrotic spot tospovirus,
Peppper mild mottle tobamovirus (PepMMoV, PepMoV, PVY, TEV, TMV,
Tobacco ringspot comovirus, Tomato ringspot comovirus, and TSWV and
for potyviruses using a group-specific test.
The Agdia test confirmed that the pepper plants were infected with
TMV. The pepper field where the original samples were collected was
surveyed for TMV-infected plants. 50 symptomatic plants expressing
foliar and fruit symptoms similar to those originally tested, and 50
asymptomatic plants were sampled by collection of 3 leaves per plant
and tested using ELISA for the presence of TMV. All symptomatic
plants and 18 percent of asymptomatic plants tested positive for TMV.
To our knowledge, this is the first occurrence of TMV causing losses
in commercially grown pepper in New York.

[TMV can cause severe necrosis on pepper fruits and according to
correspondence with John Murphy, most of the pepper fruits were not
marketable, indicating that substantial yield loss was incurred. It
appears that TMV is the only virus involved in the current outbreak
in New York, based on Murphy's tests and those of Agdia. The source
of the infection is unknown, but from my experience, seeds of
TMV-infected pepper can be heavily contaminated with the virus, and
this virus leads to infection of seedlings either during the
germination process or by handling infected plants. Buffer washes of
seed from infected peppers are generally infectious. - Mod.DH]
