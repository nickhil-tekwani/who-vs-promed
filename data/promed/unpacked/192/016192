From: Jacques Morvan <morvan@intnet.cf>

The diagnosis for viral hemorrhagic fever [HF must be suspected on
clinical grounds and on the reported mortality rate. Several viruses
responsible for HF have already circulated in the region and caused
epidemics (Ebola 1976 and 1979, RVF virus, CCHF virus).
What is the exact location of the outbreak?
Considering the closeness of the Central African Republic, samples can be
sent to the WHO Collaborating Center for hemorrhagic fevers at the Pasteur
Institute in Bangui (CAR) where the diagnosis tools are available (P3 lab,
ELISA antigen detection, ELISA IgM capture, PCR...).
