India said on Tuesday [14 Mar 2006] that it had detected a fresh
outbreak of avian influenza in the western state of Maharashtra, the
scene of the country's 1st brush with the virus in February 2006.
"Several poultry samples were received ... towards the end of February [2006].
Some of these samples have tested positive for avian influenza (H5)," a
government statement said.
Officials said that they were checking whether the latest outbreak
was of the deadly H5N1 strain that has killed dozens of people
elsewhere in the world.
They said 4 villages in Jalgaon district in the northern part of
Maharashtra were affected by the outbreak.
Jalgaon is a district away from Nandurbar, where India reported an
outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain. [See map of Maharashtra at

No 39, while Jalgaon is No 32. - Mod.AS]
Hundreds of thousands of chicken were culled in the town of Navapur
and neighbouring areas after that outbreak, and the authorities said
last week they had contained the virus there.
In Jalgaon, the government said it would start the culling of chicken
in the area.
"In these 4 villages, control and prevention actions will be
started," India's animal husbandry joint secretary Upma Chawdhry told
a news conference.
After the Navapur outbreak, India tested more than 100 people for
bird flu but all the results proved negative.
The government said it would step up surveillance of residents of the
4 villages in Jalgaon.

[According to India's official reports to the OIE (Follow-up report
No.2 at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/India_AI_08_03_2006.pdf>),
2 States were initially affected, Maharashtra and Gujarat. However,
although falling under 2 different administrative divisions (States),
the episode was regarded as one single outbreak, as the infected zone
in both administrative divisions fell within a 3-km radius of the
infected premises. See interactive map of India, showing the various
states, at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?

The current reported outbreak in Jalgaon is a new, separate focus of
the disease; its official notification is anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] Romania, Constanza, wild birds: suspected

The Romanian town of Cernavoda is now isolated, under quarantine
measures imposed following the discovery of dead wild birds there. No
one is allowed to enter or leave the town. A suggestion to allow
cars to pass through the town after disinfection was rejected by the
authorities. The culling of the about 15 000 (domestic) birds began
this morning. Schools and institutions are working at a reduced rate,
as workers living in suburban areas have been prevented from
attending to their duties.

[Cernavoda is situated about 80 km northwest of Constanza, in eastern
Romania; map at <http://www.candu.org/images/romania-map-web.jpg>.
The extremely severe measures described in the news item might be
indicative of serious suspicion of HPAI. This should not surprise:
according to Romania's official reports, which are sent meticulously
to the OIE, 3 outbreaks have recently been identified in the
Constanza region -- see follow-up report No. 20 at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_28.HTM#Sec5>
Information on the observations on the wild birds (numbers, species)
and results of the laboratory investigations will be helpful.- Mod.AS]
