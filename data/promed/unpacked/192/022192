Death of poultry in Bashkortostan, Kalmykia not related to bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
The death of poultry in a Bashkortostan village and Kalmykia is in no way
related to bird flu, head of the Rosselkhoznadzor Federal Service for
Veterinary and Phitosanitary Inspection Sergei Dankvert told Itar-Tass on
Thursday [18 Aug 2005].
"According to preliminary test results, the death of poultry was caused by
saline poisoning," Dankvert said, adding that "the birds were given the
fodder intended for cattle by mistake."
He also said the death of poultry in the Kalmyk republic had happened
because of helminthiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms.

It mentions that the Pyatigorsk laboratory provided negative results for
avian influenza on the afternoon of 18 Aug 2005. No further details on the
tests are available, but it seems that these results are not final: samples
have been forwarded for confirmation to the virologic center in the city of
Sergiev Posad, near Moscow, the results of which are expected at the end of
22 Aug 2005. - Mod.AS]
