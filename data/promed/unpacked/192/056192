Re: "In 1999 the epidemic began about two weeks early (in early July) and by
the end of August, appears to be larger than in 1992.  This is attributed to
an early start to the monsoon rains."
*****
Please note a recent analysis suggesting that "increased surface
temperatures over Eurasia in winter and spring, which are part of the
midlatitude continental warming trend" associated with global warming may
be sustaining monsoon rainfall at normal levels despite strong El Nino
events that have historically weakened them. It would be intriguing to
conduct a similar analysis for the US southwest monsoons, and implications
for mice populations and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

[We are doing just that with respect to hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome/prevalence of Sin Nombre virus but I could take the data to
Harvard and have an expert show me how. All I need is an invitation and a
little notice. - Mod.CHC
