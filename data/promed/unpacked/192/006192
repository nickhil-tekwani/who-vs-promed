New Approaches for Detecting and Curtailing Foodborne Microbial
Infections
[Excerpts]
...President Clinton's recent announcement that he will ask Congress to
allocate $43 million to improve food safety in the United States,
including about $11.5 million to establish an early warning system for
foodborne disease, [will] enable researchers and public health officials
to expand and hasten the implementation of the [existing] technology
and surveillance effort.
Currently, a collaborative effort by the CDC, Food and Drug
Administration, US Department of Agriculture (USDA), and a group of 5
sentinel sites at state health departments is under way to conduct
population-based active surveillance of cases of bacterial foodborne
infections among the 13.2 million residents of Minnesota, Oregon, and
selected counties in California, Connecticut, and Georgia. The goals of
the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network, known as *FoodNet,*
include measuring the burden of diarrheal disease in the United States,
developing the means to respond rapidly and collaboratively to emerging
foodborne diseases, and evaluating the effectiveness of various
prevention strategies. According to a discussion draft outlining
possible goals of the food safety initiative, the efforts of the 5 sites
should be strengthened and 2 new sentinel sites added in 1997 and at
least 1 additional site in 1998.
One important new tool [is]:
molecular subtyping, or DNA fingerprinting, of E coli O157:H7 and other
pathogens. Such a technique makes it possible for scientists to create a
molecular profile of a bacterium cultured from an ailing patient, which
in turn can be compared with bacteria isolated from other patients and
from foods suspected of being possible vehicles for a given infection...
With the addition of a half-dozen state laboratories (which used their
own funds to purchase the necessary equipment and CDC training) and the
USDA Food Safety Inspection Service laboratory, in Athens, GA, there are
now 11 laboratories participating in a project to perform DNA typing of
E coli O157:H7 isolates. The ultimate aim is for public health
laboratories to be part of a network of laboratories submitting the
patterns of their isolates to a national computerized database at the
CDC for comparison with patterns reported in the past or the future.
What is envisioned is a process that allows a state health department
laboratory to report a DNA fingerprint to the database, day or night.
Minutes later, the computer will tell the reporting laboratory whether
the submitted pattern is unique or matches others in the database. In
the latter case, information related to the fingerprint on file--such as
where the bug had been isolated in the past, whether it was involved in
a previous outbreak, and what kind of toxin it produces--is also
provided...
Although the molecular subtyping system for E coli O157:H7 and other
pathogens is still something of a work in progress, "smart" computer
programs are already helping identify foodborne outbreaks caused by
strains of Salmonella bacteria that otherwise would have gone
undetected. The program, called the Salmonella Outbreak Detection
Algorithm (SODA), tracks the 45 000 to 50 000 clinical isolates of
Salmonella that are routinely serotyped by state public health
laboratories each year and reported electronically as they arise to a
CDC computer.
Weekly, the CDC's Biostatistics and Information Branch uses SODA to
sample the serotyping information that came in from the states during
the previous 4 weeks, compare the serotypes and head counts of new
isolates with those reported to the CDC over the past 5 years, and
crunch numbers to see if any unusual patterns emerge. If the program
detects a sudden rise in any single serotype above threshold levels that
may signal a budding outbreak, the program alerts CDC personnel, who in
turn notify their state counterparts to take a closer look...
Despite the promise offered by DNA typing, electronic databases, and
other advances, technology alone won't derail foodborne outbreaks unless
investigators are available to collect samples, interview patients, and
track down the source of contamination, experts caution... while active
surveillance and new technologies hold out promise in detecting and
containing outbreaks, the entire process depends on physicians
recognizing and reporting cases of foodborne illness... "
