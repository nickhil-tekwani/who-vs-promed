By 20 Nov [2010], the number of cumulative cases of dengue reached
114 855, according to figures reported in the Epidemiological
Bulletin of the Ministry of Health.

This figure is the highest reported in the country in 21 years and
represents 2.14 times more than that recorded last year [2009] during
the same period, which reached 53 462 . In the last 4 weeks, there
were 10 814 new cases, as calculated in the Epidemiological Alert of
the Network of Scientific Medical Societies. For each 11 [dengue
fever cases], one case is DHF.

The majority of cases, 70 395 or 61.3 percent, relate to 7 Federal
States: Miranda, Zulia, Merida, Capital District Tachira, Lara and
Aragua. Miranda is in 1st place with 14 672 or 13.06 percent. Eight
states are maintaining an epidemic [status], and 10 are registering
increasing figures.

Falcon state remains in an alarming situation because it has been in
an epidemic situation for 4 weeks. In the current epidemiological
week, 46 336 new cases have been reported, making Falcon state the
state with the highest number of cases nationwide. The Scientific
Alert Network says this situation may become worse due to the
flooding in recent weeks.

[The flooding along the Caribbean coasts of Venezuela and Colombia,
especially Falcon state in Venezuela, has been catastrophic, with
many people displaced from their homes. That situation surely must
significantly complicate dengue surveillance and timely medical
treatment of dengue cases. It is difficult to assess how the floods
may have affected breeding sites of the _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus
vector mosquito and populations of these mosquitoes in flood-impacted
areas. Further information from health professionals active in those
areas, including those in neighboring Colombia, will be appreciated.
