Anthrax kills elephant, more may be infected
----------------------
Deadly anthrax has killed one elephant and might have infected more in
south eastern Bangladesh, veterinarians said today.
Officials in the Chittagong Hill Tracts said they were taking measures to
stop the spread of the disease, which can infect humans. The disease might
have infected other elephants and wild animals in the 14 200 square
kilometre hill tracts, said Mohammad Hafizur Rahman, deputy commissioner of
Bandarban district.
"Veterinarians are planning to adopt effective measures to stop the spread
of the disease," he said.
The area is home to 400 wild elephants, including 100 believed to have
migrated from forests in Burma and India.

[This is not a new phenomenon in this region, as there are published
reports from the 1960s. While elephants graze, they are also subject to
infections via tabanids and blowflies. They can get infected either as a
result of their feeding near villages or near wildlife cases, though
primary cases are seen in the Etosha National Park. So it is possible that
this forest case is not primary and follows upon cases in other species yet
to be found. Elephants respond well to treatment if caught in time, which
can of course be difficult when they are wild. Though very willing to be
corrected if wrong, I believe that they respond well to vaccination with
darted Sterne vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]
