Non-vaccinated Persons Advised Not to Travel to Certain Regions
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Director of the National Center of Epidemiology of the National
Foundation of Health (FUNASA), Jarbas Barbosa, said on Sat 7 Jul 2001 that
persons who have not been not vaccinated against sylvan yellow fever at
least 10 days [prior to departure should not travel to the northwest of
Rio Grande do Sul, towards Parana, north of Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso, Federal
District, north and central west of Minsa Gerais, Goias, Amazonas, Acre,
Rondonia, Para, Amapa, Maranhao, Tocantis, west of Bahia and south of Piaui.
According to FUNASA, the virus causing sylvan yellow fever is circulating
in the wild and can cause a serious and fatal disease. In the endemic
regions of the entire country, 30 percent [of those affected by the virus
are fishermen. The Foundation has distributed additional supplies of
vaccine to health clinics in the Northern and Central-Western regions of
the country.
