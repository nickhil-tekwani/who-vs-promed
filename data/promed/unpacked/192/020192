Gonorrhoea diagnoses in England have risen to their highest level for 40 years and jumped 26 per cent since 2017, sparking warnings from health chiefs about the threat from drug resistant strains.

Public Health England [PHE] figures show there were 447 694 sexually transmitted infections [STIs] diagnosed in 2018, a rise of 5 per cent in a year. The biggest increase was in gonorrhoea where there were 56 259 cases diagnosed, 14 000 more than in 2017.

Experts warned about the UK's 1st case of "super-gonorrhoea" a year ago, although the man was eventually cured it required extensive treatment with a cocktail of drugs usually held in reserve for the most serious infection. "This is of concern given the 3 cases of extensively drug resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ identified in England in 2018," PHE warned.

"The number of gonorrhoea diagnoses in 2018 was the largest annual number reported since 1978; since 2009, gonorrhoea diagnoses have risen by 249 per cent (from 16 141 to 56 259), mostly due to increases among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (referred to collectively as 'MSM')."

Sexual health groups have warned about the damaging impact of repeated cuts to sexual health programmes. These disproportionately hit some groups, including young people, black ethnic minorities, and MSM.

While testing, at clinics and online, rose 7 per cent, the latest figures show that testing through the National Chlamydia Screening Programme, aimed at 15 to 24 year olds who are at highest risk, has fallen more than 22 per cent since 2014. Testing fell again, by 1 per cent, last year [2018] but the number of chlamydia cases rose by 2 per cent since 2017, with roughly 1 in 10 tests resulting in a positive diagnosis, 131 000 infections in all.

Syphilis and herpes cases also continued to rise, jumping 5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.

"The continuing escalation in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses must be addressed as an urgent health priority, otherwise there is the potential for devastating consequences to the wellbeing of the wider population and the health system as a whole," said Dr Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV. "Recent years have unfortunately however seen severe and damaging cuts to sexual health service funding, jeopardising our ability to meet these challenges at a critical time. The workforce issues currently being experienced have left the sector at breaking point."

Cases of genital warts fell by 3 per cent, to 57 318, and halved in 15 to 17 year olds, because of the routine vaccination of school age girls against the human papillomavirus (HPV).

Dr Gwenda Hughes, head of STI surveillance at PHE, said: "The rise in sexually transmitted infections is concerning. STIs can pose serious consequences to health -- both your own and that of current and future sexual partners. No matter what age you are, or what type of relationship you are in, it's important to look after your sexual health. If you have sex with a new or casual partner, make sure you use condoms and get regularly tested."

[The rising incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea has become a problem in many countries worldwide. The reasons for the increase in incidence of these sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for STDs could contribute to some extent to the increased incidence in some groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Some of the factors that could promote unprotected (condomless) sex include lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers and young adults; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive "party drugs"; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/PrEP_fact_sheet_final.pdf). The increasing incidence of gonococcal disease has been associated with increasing reports of antibiotic-resistant strains. - Mod.ML
