In December 2015, a tourist in the Kruger National Park saw an African wild dog attack the tyres of a car. She called park officials thinking the animal had rabies, but veterinarians have since confirmed that the dog had another, unexpected, disease: tuberculosis (TB). Researchers have identified TB in 24 animal species, from mongooses to elephants, but this was the 1st time that tuberculosis in African wild dogs had been documented.

The implications of the diagnosis are far-reaching. African wild dogs are an endangered species. Park officials estimate the wild dog population in Kruger National Park to be 450 to 500 animals and the International Union for Conservation of Nature says the global population of this endangered species is a mere 1400 mature adults.

Wild dogs are adept hunters, but depend on the pack for survival. Some packs number more than 40 and, because tuberculosis is highly contagious, one dog with the disease is likely to infect several others. When the pack size drops too low, the remaining animals aren't able to hunt effectively and may also die.

The discovery of tuberculosis in the Kruger Park wild dog was also unusual because it occurred in a young animal, said Paul van Helden, head of the Centre for Tuberculosis Research at the South African Medical Research Council. Tuberculosis is a relatively slow-developing disease and normally manifests in older animals. "The age of this animal shows that the disease moved quickly," he says.

Professor Michele Miller, the research chair in animal tuberculosis at Stellenbosch University, says wildlife, particularly buffalo, in the Kruger National Park is likely to have become infected with respiratory TB from infected cattle grazing on neighbouring property, or through the environment. "Once the host becomes infected, that animal can spread bacteria through contact or by contaminating the environment" says Miller. "It's a significant problem." TB bacteria can be shed around water holes, and if it's in shady, moist soil, the bacteria can remain contagious for months.

Miller says the problem with tuberculosis in wildlife is that the animals do not show the typical signs of disease such as weight loss, loss of condition, and lethargy until the disease is advanced. "During this time they are continually transmitting the disease to other animals and contaminating the environment," says Miller. "Their loss of health means they are slower and less likely to keep up with the pack or herd, making them more vulnerable to predators."

The disease can be spread further when the carcass of the infected animal is eaten by other animals. Tuberculosis can not only spread between animals, but also from animals to humans, and from humans to animals.

Van Helden says tuberculosis in wild animals is relevant to people for several reasons: from an ecosystem conservation perspective, from a tourism industry point of view and for their personal health. "Tourism attracts people looking for jobs, who may bring their cattle to the conservation areas and this is also where cattle mix with animals as well as other people," he says. Thus a cycle of infection and re-infection between people and animals can spiral.

[Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) poses a serious threat to free-ranging wildlife and domestic animals, as well as having significant zoonotic potential. In Africa, bTB is present in cattle in the majority of countries. The bacterium has relatively recently infected certain populations of native wild bovids, most notably the African buffalo. From them, the bacterium may spill over to other wildlife species that inhabit their ecosystem. One of the possible routes of transmission is via host-predator interaction. This entails infection of lions (_Panthera leo_), leopards (_Panthera pardus_), cheetahs (_Acinonyx jubatus_), and other carnivore species, which do not appear to be able to maintain infection in the absence of an infected maintenance host in the system, but such infections are of conservation concern.

It is noteworthy that the claim that there had been no previous reports of bovine tuberculosis is incorrect (Michel AL, de Klerk-Lorist LM, Buss P, et al: Tuberculosis in South African wildlife: lions, African buffalo and other species. In: Tuberculosis, leprosy and mycobacterial diseases of man and animals: the many hosts of mycobacteria. Editors: Mukundan H, Chambers MA, Waters WR, Larsen MH, CAB International. 2015). Thanks to Dr Michel for bringing this to our attention.

The African wild dog (_Lycaon pictus_) is the largest canid in Africa. It is classed as endangered by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), as it has disappeared from much of its original range.
