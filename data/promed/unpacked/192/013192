Today, Friday [16 Sep 2022], the Mauritanian Ministry of Health announced the registration of 4 deaths of people infected with Rift Valley fever [RVF], and 8 cases of 2 types of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

The ministry added that it conducted 63 tests to detect hemorrhagic fevers, which resulted in the registration of 7 cases of RVF and one case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

Yesterday evening [15 Sep 2022], the Ministry of Animal Development announced that the number of livestock infected with RVF had risen to 149, distributed over several states.

The ministry said that it reached this conclusion after conducting a set of 564 analyses, noting that the recorded injuries are distributed among 5 foci.

It added that the positive cases of Rift Valley fever were recorded in the states of: Tiris Zemmour (Municipality of Zouerate), Hodh Gharbi (Municipality of N'Savenni), Tagant (Nimlan), Hodh El-Sharqi (Atwiel) and Trarza (Municipality of Nabaghiya).

The ministry indicated that it had taken a number of measures to confront the disease, including treating and isolating infected animals, and limiting the movement of infected or suspected animals; the use of insecticides, control of vector insects, and vaccination against Pasteurella disease in camels.

[1. RVF in humans:
With 4 human deaths and a widespread outbreak going on in animals, it is important for public health and animal health authorities to work together in dealing with this situation. The people in the affected areas need to be aware of risk in handling infected animals, their slaughtering and processing and fresh animal products (uncooked meat and crude milk). RVF virus can also be mosquito transmitted. However, vector control over this large geographic area would be difficult. There is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod. TY

2. RVF in animals:
The ongoing RVF event in Mauritania, as far as the animal realm is concerned, had started on 25 Sep 2021 and notified to the WOAH on 26 Oct 2021 in an "immediate notification" according to which sheep were affected in 4 villages in Tintane, in the state Hodh el Gharbi (see 20211027.8699284). The 1st follow-up report of this event was submitted to the WOAH on 31 Aug 2022, informing about an RVF-affected camel herd of 119 animals in AÃ¯oun, Hodh el Gharbi, where 41 were clinical cases, of which 21 died (see https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=59462).

According to the current media-derived information, the disease has already spread to 4 additional states and the number of camel deaths increased from 95 to 146 in a few days. It is not clear if the added cases are clinical or based upon serology. An updated, detailed follow-up report is anticipated. It will be interesting to note if other susceptible species, in particular sheep and goats, have also been affected. - Mod.AS
