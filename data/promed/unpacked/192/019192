Hundreds of people were quarantined for hours inside a nightclub after a
phony anthrax threat, at least the seventh such hoax in Southern California
this month. No trace of the potentially deadly bacterium was found in
preliminary tests, authorities said Sunday.
A Los Angeles County hazardous materials team and the FBI's Domestic
Terrorism Task Force were called to the Glass House club at 11:50 p.m.
Saturday after a man called the Police Department and said "a significant
quantity" of anthrax would be released into the air, police Lt. Gary Graham
said.
About 800 people were kept inside the club for about four hours while the
air-conditioning system was checked and samples taken for further study,
Graham said. Club-goers then were taken outside and given information on
anthrax symptoms. They were then allowed to return to the club if they
wished.
Authorities had not immediately determined whether the threat was related
to six others since the middle of the month. In each case, no evidence of
anthrax was found:
--On Dec. 14, a secretary at the Perris School District in Riverside County
opened a letter that said, "you've been exposed to anthrax." About 20
people were isolated and decontaminated.
--On Dec. 17, an office building in the Westwood area of Los Angeles
received a letter threatening exposure to anthrax. Nearly two dozen workers
had to strip and go through a decontamination process.
--On Dec. 18, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Woodland Hills area was
targeted and about 90 people underwent antibiotic treatment. [91 people
were held for almost eight hours after a threat claimed that "anthrax" had
been released in the air conditioning ducts. They were given antibiotics
and special suits to wear over their clothing while tests were run.
--On Dec. 21, a telephoned threat emptied two Van Nuys courthouses and
forced about 1,500 people into quarantine for several hours.
--On Wednesday, the Chatsworth office of Time Warner Cable was evacuated
after a threat. About 200 people had to leave their workstations.
--On Thursday, Christmas Eve, a Mervyn's store in Palm Desert was the
target of a hoax, and 200 people had to disrobe and were rinsed with a
bleach solution.
Anthrax hoaxes also have happened in Colorado, Kentucky, and Tennessee.

[This appears to be the nasty hoax du jour in California, unfortunately.
How those affected are handled seems to vary -- see above. Presumably when
the holidays are over, the hoaxers will retarget federal buildings because
of the gross disruption caused. A moments thought would suggest other
seasonally attractive targets. Epidemiologically it would be interesting to
know how psychologically similar these hoaxers are to those thrilled by
setting fires to watch fire brigades at work. - Mod.MHJ
