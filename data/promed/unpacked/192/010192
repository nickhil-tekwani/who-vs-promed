Dozens of people in Guinea have been hospitalized after eating rice cooked with petrol. "In all, 114 people were admitted" to the main hospital in Guinea's capital Conakry, said a doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The patients suffered stomach aches, diarrhea, and vomiting, the doctor said, adding that they were "treated after having consumed rice with sauce prepared with petrol."

Another doctor confirmed the hospitalization, adding that it appeared that a cook in a small restaurant in Conakry had "mistaken petrol for peanut oil."

The mass hospitalization caused panic among patients and visitors at the hospital, prompting dozens to flee as they thought the incoming patients had contracted the [ebolavirus] -- a highly contagious hemorrhagic fever that has claimed more than 200 lives in Guinea.

[This article indicates the clinical signs of the affected, but does not indicate what the patients were treated with.

Petrol or hydrocarbons are a heterogeneous group of organic substances that are primarily composed of carbon and hydrogen molecules. They are quite abundant in modern society. Some of the most commonly ingested hydrocarbons include gasoline, lubricating oil, motor oil, mineral spirits, lighter fluid/naphtha, lamp oil, and kerosene. Other common sources of hydrocarbons include dry cleaning solutions, paint, spot remover, rubber cement, and solvents. In addition, many volatile substances that contain hydrocarbons (such as glue, propellants) are commonly abused for their euphoric effects.

The hydrocarbons can be derived from either petroleum or wood. Petroleum distillates include kerosene, gasoline, and naphtha, whereas wood-derived hydrocarbons include turpentine and pine oil. The length of the chains as well as the degree of branching determine the phase of the hydrocarbon at room temperature; most are liquid, but some short-chain hydrocarbons (such as butane) are gas at room temperature, whereas other long-chain hydrocarbons (such as waxes) are solid at room temperature.

Toxicity from hydrocarbon ingestion can affect many different organs, but the lungs are the most commonly affected organ. The chemical properties of the individual hydrocarbon determine the specific toxicity, while the dose and route of ingestion affect which organs are exposed to the toxicity. Unlike the aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, the halogenated hydrocarbons tend to cause a wider range of toxicity. Many of the hydrocarbons create a burning sensation because they are irritating to the GI mucosa. Vomiting has been reported in up to one third of all hydrocarbon exposures.

Pulmonary complications, especially aspiration, are the most frequently reported adverse effect of hydrocarbon exposure. While most aliphatic hydrocarbons have little GI absorption, aspiration frequently occurs, either initially or in a semi delayed fashion as the patient coughs or vomits, thereby resulting in pulmonary effects. Once aspirated, the hydrocarbons can create a severe pneumonitis.

The type of hydrocarbon makes all the difference. There are many different hydrocarbons, of varying chain lengths and molecular weights. Some, such as mineral oil, may be relatively non toxic, while others, such as gasoline may cause a variety of clinical signs. However, in all cases of ingestion, the treatment is largely supportive.
