ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS, AGE-SPECIFIC MORBIDITY?: REQUEST FOR INFO
*****************************************************************
A ProMED post

From: Bill Graney <wmgraney@bellatlantic.net>

Could a reader comment on possible reasons for the concentration of deaths
in the elderly in the NY SLE episode?
Is there a specific immune deficit in the elderly or an impairment of some
part of the blood brain barrier? Or is the problem one of greater exposure
to insect bites in elderly because of frailty or living quarters?
Do younger people have any "soft" neurologic signs suggesting that
encephalitis is more frequent but only lethal in the old?
Thanks in advance.

[Many studies, including oligonucleotide fingerprint mapping (in the days
before easy sequencing) by Trent, Monath and others, and recent, more
sophisticated studies by Laura Kramer, have indicated slight differences
between SLE virus isolates from the far western U.S., from the Mississippi
Valley flyway, and from Florida. These isolates differ in other
characteristics as well. The litany has been that the far western strains
more often cause disease in the young because many older people already
have antibody to the virus and that strains from the eastern U.S. more
often cause disease in older people. Given that the outbreak in NY is such
an oddity, and still only older people have been shown to be infected,
there must be something to the apparent age-specific morbidity. It has
been suggested that cholesterol levels might have something to do with it.
If anyone has data that would answer this complex question or can suggest
how such a question could be answered, please let us know. Lots of
possibilities here but we are looking for data. - Mod.CHC]
