Outbreak of measles cases in Amur Oblast
----------------------------------------
The Rospotrebnadzor [the Russian equivalent of a health protection agency]
has reported that between 15 Apr and 4 May 2010, a total of 31 cases of
measles were registered in the Amur Oblast, 17 of which have been confirmed
by laboratory testing. 27 people have been admitted to infectious diseases
wards. 3 have been discharged as of 4 May 2010. The outbreak investigation
revealed that the 1st cases were connected with travel to China. Most of
cases have been adults who had not received protective immunization previously.

An emergency immunization programme has been initiated for the 18-55 age
group, and 925 people have been immunized so far. Contacts have been traced
and are under medical observation. This outbreak raises doubts about the
announcement last year by the chief sanitary physician of the Russian
Federation that Russia is planning to achieve certification as a
measles-free country. He indicated that to achieve this status an incidence
of one case of measles per million inhabitants has to be achieved. During
the 1st 11 months of 2008 there had been only 27 measles cases across the
breadth of Russia (a total population of more than 140 million).
Furthermore only 6 of the cases were children.

[The Amur Oblast is a federal subject of Russia, situated about 8000
kilometres (5000 miles) east of Moscow on the banks of the Amur and Zeya
Rivers. It shares its border with the People's Republic of China in the
south. The Amur Oblast had a population of 869 600 (in 2008). A map and
description of the Amur Oblast can be accessed at

In 2007 (see below) an outbreak of measles occurred in the neighbouring
Primorsky Krai which also involved travellers returning from China. - Mod.CP]
