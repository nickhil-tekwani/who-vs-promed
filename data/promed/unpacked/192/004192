The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has confirmed that an Ingham County, Michigan, horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"On [Wed 8 Feb 2017], a horse from a small stable in Ingham County, Michigan, was diagnosed with EHV-1," the EDCC said [Fri 10 Feb 2017]. "The horse had only mild clinical signs and is recovering. The farm is under quarantine until all horses are free from clinical signs, including fever, for 21 days. Horses at this farm rarely travel and there have been no recent movements."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[If there is no history of recent travel, were horses brought into this facility? How did the horse become exposed to this disease? Is there a horse across the fence that is infected?

It would seem this is already an active year for EHV. Hopefully someone is working a vaccine to combat the neurological form of these diseases.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

"EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7 to 10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

"Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus."

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions. These horses need rest, rest and more rest and lots of care.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
