Low-risk flu strain found in Italian turkeys - EU
-------------------------------------------------
Italy has detected a low-risk strain of bird flu in turkeys in one of its
northern regions, but the outbreak does not pose a threat to public health,
the European Commission said on Wednesday [20 Apr 2005].
"A low pathogenic form of avian influenza was notified to the European
Commission on 18 Apr [2005] concerning 10 turkey flocks in the province of
Brescia," a Commission official told Reuters. "These findings are not
associated with any concern for public health," he said, noting that the
strain was H5N2. It was not immediately clear how many birds were affected.
Italian authorities were now expected to carry out vaccinations in the area
in question, the official said. Earlier on Wednesday [20 Apr 2005],
Russia's Agriculture Ministry said it had suspended imports of poultry and
poultry products from Italy to prevent the spread of bird flu. The Russian
ban also applies to poultry meat products subjected to thermal treatment.
Bird flu, also known as avian influenza, is an infectious disease of birds
caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. All birds are thought to
be susceptible to infection. Italy was the country where the disease was
1st identified, more than 100 years ago. It now occurs worldwide.

Russia bans poultry imports from Italy
--------------------------------------
Russia banned poultry imports from Italy on 20 Apr 2005 due to a breakout
of bird flu in that country, Sergei Dankvert, head of the Federal
Veterinary and Plant Sanitary Control Oversight Service, or
Rosselkhoznadzor, told Interfax. The ban will affect live birds, incubated
eggs, poultry, all kinds of poultry products that have not undergone
thermal treatment and bird feed, he said.
The ban is based on a European Commission report that bird flu has been
discovered in turkeys in the Italian province of Brescia, Dankvert said.
