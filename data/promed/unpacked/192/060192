- The next immunization days are planned for early March [2018].
- As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.

[The above report provides confirmation that there are 2 newly confirmed cases of WPV1 associated polio reported from Afghanistan. According to this report, the cases are both in Kandahar, 1 in Shawalikot district, with onset on 5 Jan 2018, and 1 in Boldak district, with onset on 6 Jan 2018. In the ProMED-mail update earlier this week, there was a media report mentioning 2 newly identified cases in Kandahar province, 1 in Sha Wali Kot district (Shawalikot), and 1 in Baldak district. New information on these cases relates to the dates of onset, both cases occuring in 2018. The report of positive environmental samples for the WPV1 in Hilmand province are disconcerting as no new cases have been diagnosed there, but positive environmental samples confirm there is ongoing circulation of the WPV1 in the province. Similarly, the persistent identification of positive environmental samples in Pakistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and in Sindh province where no cases have been identified is also disconcerting.

On the positive note, it does seem as though transmission of the cVDPV2 in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Syria has been interrupted.
