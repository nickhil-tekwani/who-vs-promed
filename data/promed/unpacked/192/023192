Agriculture department warns growers about California rice seed
---------------------------------------------------------------
High demand for medium grain rice might prompt some Missouri rice
growers to try a crop, but the Missouri Department of Agriculture is
warning farmers not to purchase medium grain rice seed from
California.

Missouri currently has a quarantine on California rice seed and on
California seed from other states because of the threat of bakanae
infection.

Bakanae is a fungus common to other countries but first introduced to
the USA in 1999. Missouri currently has no reported cases of bakanae
disease in rice seeds.

Once established, bakanae cannot be eliminated from a rice-growing
area, according to the department.

[Bakanae disease of rice (also called foot rot in some Asian
countries) is caused by the fungus _Gibberella fujikuroi_ and can
cause significant crop losses of up to 20 percent. The fungus also
affects other crops, including barley, maize, sorghum, sugarcane,
tomato, banana, and cowpea. Symptoms on rice include abnormal growth
patterns, death of seedlings, reduced tillering, and partially filled
or empty seed heads.

The fungus infects plants through roots or crowns and later becomes
systemic. Seeds are usually infected during the flowering stage and
the disease is primarily seed-borne. The fungus survives under
adverse conditions in infected seeds and diseased plant parts.
Disease management is difficult and includes use of certified clean
seeds and fungicides, however rapid development of pathogen
resistance has been observed.

Similar warnings of possible bakanae incursions with Californian rice
seed have been issued for Arkansas and other states earlier (see
ProMED-mail posts below).
