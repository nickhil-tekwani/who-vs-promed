New Brunswick has its 1st confirmed case of enterovirus D68, which is the strain that has hospitalized children across North America and been linked to at least 3 deaths.

A Fredericton child, who tested positive for enterovirus D68, was hospitalized for 4 days but is now doing well, public health officials say. The patient, a Fredericton school-aged child without underlying medical conditions, was hospitalized for 4 days, released in early October 2014 and is now doing well, said acting chief medical officer of health Dr. Jennifer Russell. There are no other suspected cases in the province, she said in a statement on Monday [27 Oct 2014]. Public health announced the confirmed case after receiving test results from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Confirmation of test results takes several weeks, Russell said. The results do not impact the treatment, which is the same for all strains of the disease, but they can be beneficial for researchers, she said.

Earlier this month [October 2014], test results confirmed 2 other children in Fredericton, who tested positive for enterovirus infection, did not have the D68 strain.

Parents should know that EV-D68 is one of more than 100 non-polio enteroviruses, which are common at this time of year. Symptoms are similar to those of the common cold, such as a runny nose and fever, but can cause serious respiratory problems. Much like the common cold, the virus is transmitted through close contact, from nose or throat secretions. New Brunswickers are encouraged to take proper measures to protect themselves through frequent washing of hands, coughing into one's sleeve and staying home when sick.

[Cases of enterovirus D-68 in Canada have been few in number, and only a single case has been recorded in New Brunswick, and the patient has recovered after a short spell in hospital. In contrast, as of Mon 27 Oct 2014, the US CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html) has declared that from mid-August to 28 Oct 2014, the CDC or state public health laboratories have confirmed a total of 1105 people in 47 states and the District of Columbia with respiratory illness caused by EV-D68. CDC expects that, as with other enteroviruses, EV-D68 infections will likely begin to decline by late fall [2014]. CDC has received informal reports from some hospitals and states that are seeing signs of decreasing EV-D68 infections.

Every year, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses cause millions of respiratory illnesses in children. This year [2014], EV-D68 has been the most common type of enterovirus identified, leading to increases in illnesses among children and affecting those with asthma most severely. Other rhinoviruses and enteroviruses continue to be detected as well. CDC has prioritized testing of specimens from children with severe respiratory illness. There are likely many children affected with milder forms of illness. Of the more than 2000 specimens tested by the CDC lab, about 40 percent have tested positive for EV-D68. About 1/3rd have tested positive for an enterovirus or rhinovirus other than EV-D68.

In the United states almost all the confirmed cases of EV-D68 infection have been among children. Many of the children had asthma or a history of wheezing. EV-D68 has been detected in specimens from 8 patients who died and whose samples had been submitted for testing.

As of 18 Oct 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-activity.html), 34 states and the District of Columbia reported low or declining activity; 8 states reported elevated activity, and one state reported increasing activity. - Mod.CP
