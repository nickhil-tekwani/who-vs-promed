Veterinarians have warned the public not to transport, trade, or eat
livestock that have died as a result of hemorrhagic disease, as outbreaks
spread across the country. Some people in rural areas continue to eat the
meat of infected animals, as they are unaware of the disease or uninformed
about preventative measures.

The disease can easily spread to other livestock, and people may fall ill
with diarrhea if they eat animals that have died from the disease, said
Livestock and Fisheries Department veterinarian Dr Phouth Inthavong. "We
should incinerate and bury infected carcasses at the place where the
animals died or at other places far from where other livestock graze," he
said. Infected livestock suffer from a swollen stomach and neck and a
fever, after eating grass or water alongside other infected animals, he said.

People should bury dead livestock in pits that should be dug at least
1-1.50 metres [3-5 feet] deep to prevent dogs or pigs from unearthing
infected carcasses. They should be covered with soil, and then lime should
be sprinkled on the surface. These burial practices will prevent the
disease from infecting other buffalo and cattle, he said.

Xaythany district Livestock and Fisheries Unit head Mr Thongtem Luangxay
said illegal livestock movement around the country causes the disease to
spread. There have also been reported cases of black leg disease in
Xaythany district, Vientiane. This disease bears some similarities to
hemorrhagic disease but was less likely to spread across the country, he said.

According to Dr Phouth, livestock with this disease suffer from swollen
legs and find it difficult to walk. But the disease is not fatal if animals
are treated appropriately and in a timely fashion. Anthrax, which could
potentially cause far greater damage to livestock populations, was unlikely
to occur in Laos at present, despite outbreaks having occurred in past
decades, Dr Phouth said. "The most obvious symptoms humans infected with
the disease display are boils on their face or body. They will also become
ill after eating infected meat," he said.

In light of these risks, traders must be responsible, and consumers should
exercise caution. "We should not eat any dead animals infected with any
disease, both to prevent an outbreak from occurring and in the interests of
public health and safety," Dr Phouth said.

[The described disease in cattle seems suspected to be hemorrhagic
septicemia (HS), a bovine disease rather endemic in the region caused by
the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_; its Asian serotype (Carter and
Heddleston system) is B:2. In many Asian countries, HS outbreaks mostly
occur during the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high humidity and
high temperatures).

However, HS is not zoonotic; in view of the reports that people who consume
dead animal meat have had "boils on their face or body," other diseases --
in particular anthrax -- deserve consideration and should be excluded.

An official, laboratory-based diagnosis of the described outbreak is to be
anticipated identifying the causative pathogen(s). - Mod.AS

There are some aspects of this report that puzzle me, specifically "as
outbreaks spread across the country" and the livestock "suffer from swollen
legs and find it difficult to walk". This might be because the journalist
had got confused with the information he was being given. Anthrax has a
long history in Laos of being sporadic, plus they have not been regular
reporters to OIE. In 2001 there were some 15 cattle cases and 13 buffalo
with some 46 human cases; in 2002 there were 21 cattle cases and 14
involving humans. There is no reason to exclude Laos from widespread
anthrax cases facilitated by tabanid flies, but I have not seen reports of
their involvement in South East Asia. So while this report indicates that
it might be anthrax, we would be wise to await the results of laboratory
confirmation. - Mod.MHJ]

Since there are reports of diarrhea and "boils on their face or body" after
eating meat from dead cattle, it is worth mentioning that anthrax in
humans, especially its skin or cutaneous form, may begin as a raised itchy
bump that resembles an insect bite but within 1-2 days develops into a
vesicle and then a painless ulcer, usually 1-3 cm in diameter, with a
characteristic black necrotic (dying) area in the center (see picture of
cutaneous anthrax at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/anthrax/anthrax-images/cutaneous.asp>).

Intestinal anthrax is characterized by an acute inflammation of the
intestinal tract. Initial signs include nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting,
and fever, followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe
diarrhea. In respiratory anthrax or the inhalation form, the initial
symptoms may resemble a common cold. After several days, the symptoms may
progress to severe breathing problems and shock. (More information on
anthrax is available at <http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/anthrax.html>).
