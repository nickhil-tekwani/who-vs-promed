Although none of these reports (see: Wound infections, tsunami-related -
Asia 20050110.0079) mentions the wounds being surgically closed (such as by
suturing), this factor should be specifically asked for in reports of
severe wound infections, including tetanus and gas gangrene, since:
1. In large scale emergencies, there is often immense pressure from staff,
patients, and their families to deal with wounds in one single surgical
procedure, avoiding the need for planning a follow-up surgical procedure of
delayed primary or secondary closure.
2. Unfortunately, suturing wounds that are contaminated during one single
procedure will inevitably lead to more severe infection, often with life or
limb threatening consequences.
3. Knowledge of adequacy of wound surgery allows better interpretation of
bacteriological results from such wounds.
4. Education regarding wound infection and wound healing directed toward
staff operating in the field encourages good (and often simple) tetanus
cover and surgical technique (such as debridement and wound cleaning), and
encourages leaving the wound open, allowing it to drain and covering it
with an appropriate dressing, to be closed at a later stage if infection is
not present.
Reassuringly, some of the reports specifically mention debridement, which
together with wound cleaning and irrigation is the correct initial
management of these potentially contaminated wounds, which may include
devitalized tissue. However, wound management experience from most
disasters and wars in many countries suggests that this basic principle has
to be relearned again and again, often regardless of technical levels of
skill or facilities available. In this respect, some of the affected
countries will already have considerable wound management expertise that
can be shared.

Infection control put to one side
---------------------------------
After arriving in Indonesia's tsunami-shattered province of Aceh, the
Australian surgeons did what they had been taught never to do. In a
building with no running water and under hand-held lights powered by
faltering generators, they picked up their instruments, unsure about
whether they were sterile, and began to operate.
"We just had to lower our standards and deal with what we had to deal
with," Dr Annette Holian said on 9 Jan 2005, as she and her colleagues
returned home after becoming the 1st emergency team to leave Australia for
the provincial capital Banda Aceh. "We had to accept that the infection
that patients were already suffering was much worse than anything we were
about to put on if our instruments weren't sterile."
After landing in Sydney, the team of 28 doctors, nurses, firefighters and
ambulance officers told of the death, destruction and desperation that
greeted them when they reached Aceh.
"You were confronted with an overwhelming and vast area of destruction,
cars on their sides, buses still with the remains of deceased in them, and
mud," team leader and medical director of the NSW Ambulance Service Dr
Michael Flynn said, "and lots and lots of deceased initially in the
streets, and there were large numbers of deceased in the river. It was one
of the most austere environments that I've ever worked in, and it was a
tribute to my team that they went through that, and they still performed in
an exemplary manner."
Dr Holian said the ability to improvise had been crucial, as the team
struggled under unsanitary conditions and were hit by frequent blackouts
when operations were under way. "Once we were in there trying to operate,
we had very little to actually work with," she said. "With our 1st
patients, we were really just tipping water into wounds to wash out the
infection."
About 240 patients came to the hospital's emergency ward each day,
infectious diseases physician Dr James Branley said. Many of them had huge
lacerations from corrugated iron and other debris ripped from buildings
when the tsunami struck. "You've seen some of the footage of black, oily
stuff flowing through the streets, and that was all washed through these
patients' lacerations," Dr Branley said, "People had been bathed in a
mixture of salt water and what could only be described as open drain fluid.
Many of them died." Dr Branley said conditions on the ground would hasten
the spread of disease in refugee camps.
