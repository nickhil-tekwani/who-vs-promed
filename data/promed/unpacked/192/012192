The Official Veterinary Services of the Junta de Castilla La Mancha have notified the detection of serotype 4 of the Bluetongue virus [BTV] in 2 sheep farms, located in a free zone in the Oropesa region, in the province of Toledo.

These are 2 sheep farms, in which symptoms compatible with the disease appeared and after proceeding to the official visit and sampling, positive results were obtained at the Animal Health Laboratory of the Junta de Castilla La Mancha. The samples were immediately sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory of Algete, the national reference laboratory for Bluetongue in Spain, where the presence of BTV-4 was confirmed. The circulation of the virus has been detected in the framework of the implementation of the bluetongue surveillance program in Spain for the year 2022. The region of Oropesa is currently considered a free zone (ZL), and given the verification of the circulation of the virus in this region, Spain's restriction zone for BTV-4 is going to be increased, by means of a Resolution that will be published in the next few days, including the counties of Oropesa, Belvis de la Jara, Talavera de la Reina, Los Navalmorales and Torrijos, in the province of Toledo.

Immediately, prevention, surveillance and control measures have been reinforced in the area and mandatory vaccination against BTV-4 will be established for all animals over 3 months of age in the ovine and bovine species in these new territories included in the ZR. Restrictions have been established on the movement of animals of species sensitive to the disease and passive surveillance has been reinforced, recalling the obligation to immediately notify the OVS [veterinary authorities] of any suspicion, as well as the obligation to disinfest the farms. Bluetongue is a viral disease transmitted by midges of the _Culicoides_ genus and affects ruminants of different species, but doesn't affect humans.

[Spain is one of the EC member states in which certain zones have obtained 'Bluetongue-free' status, allowing movements of the relevant animals (cattle, sheep, goats) to and from free zones in other member states. A map with the Member States and their respective status, presenting their respective infected and free zones, can be found at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-09/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.pdf. The map was last updated on 28 Jul 2022. Since then, BTV-4 has spread, in Spain, northwards into the autonomous community of Castile and Leon (20221018.8706213) and currently eastwards into Castille La Mancha. The map is expected to be updated accordingly.

BTV-4, one of the 27 known serotypes of BTV, is considered highly pathogenic for susceptible sheep breeds. Cattle, on the other hand, are readily infected by the BTV vector (_Culicoides_ species) and undergo viraemia, but in most cases, with the exception of BTV-8 infection, without clinical disease. Due to their prolonged viraemia following infection, cattle become a potential transmitter of the virus into free areas and, in case the vector is present there, may infect susceptible local sheep, potentially causing considerable losses. According to EC legislation, cattle are not allowed to be moved outside an infected zone unless vaccinated and or tested negative by PCR. The costs caused by such measures and by delayed movement for slaughter or breeding purposes, are considerable. The bluetongue season in Spain is expected to terminate when temperatures drop. - Mod.AS
