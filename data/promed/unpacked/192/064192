The Food and Drug Administration has expanded its recall of dog food brands that have too much Vitamin D, which could make your pets sick.

The food was sold nationwide in both stores and online, and the FDA says the list of recalled products could continue to grow.

Luckily none of the tainted foods were sold at storefronts here in Nevada, but we reached out to Chewy, an online retailer of pet food and supplies. They say that they were aware of the recall before it was published with the FDA and did quarantine the tainted food before it was sent out to customers.

Some of the recalls are as follows:

Nutrisca
Chicken and Chickpea Dry Dog Food

Natural Life Pet Products
Chicken and Potato Dry Dog Food

Sunshine Mills, Inc.
Old Glory Hearty Turkey and Cheese Flavor Dog Food
Evolve Chicken and Rice Puppy Dry Dog Food
Sportsman's Pride Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food
Triumph Chicken and Rice Recipe Dry Dog Food

ANF, Inc.
ANF Lamb and Rice Dry Dog Food

Lidl (Orlando brand)
Orlando Grain-Free Chicken and Chickpea Superfood Recipe Dog Food

Kroger
Abound Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe Dog Food

Elm Pet Foods, Inc.
Elm Chicken and Chickpea Recipe
Elm K9 Naturals Chicken Recipe

Ahold Delhaize
Nature's Promise Chicken and Brown Rice Dog Food
Nature's Place Real Country Chicken and Brown Rice Dog Food

King Soopers
Abound Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe Dog Food

A complete listing of all brands involved may be found on the FDA website (https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/NewsEvents/ucm627485.htm).

[The following list was extracted from the FDA website (see source URL), because it is important to know the UPC codes and the "best by" date to know if your product is in the recalled food list.

Excess vitamin D in the diet can cause vomiting, loss of appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, excessive drooling, and weight loss. Vitamin D at toxic levels can cause kidney failure and death. Pet owners whose dogs have been eating the recalled brands and are showing these signs should contact their veterinarians.

It is also important to realize your dog may not have consumed this food yet experience some of these signs. Your dog may be affected by a condition not associated with the food, in which case the dog would still need veterinary care.
