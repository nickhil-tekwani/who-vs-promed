https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-19-vaccines-protect-against-severe-illness-during-delta


A trio of studies in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) today [10 Sep 2021] show that COVID vaccines protect very well against the delta (B1617.2) variant, with unvaccinated people having 5 times the risk of infection and more than 10 times the risk of hospitalization or death compared with vaccinated people.

Researchers analyzed data that included the period of delta variant dominance in the United States, and their results indicate that the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines all show strong vaccine effectiveness (VE) against severe COVID-19. The new data join several studies published this week on high COVID-19 VE (https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/covid-vaccines-very-effective-hinder-spread-studies-say).

In the 1st of today's studies, which looked at US incidence rate ratios (IRRs), the researchers found that, after delta became the predominant strain, VE for full Pfizer or Moderna vaccination was 90% against hospitalization and 91% against death. But VE dropped from 91% to 78% for any adult COVID-19 infection during the delta period (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7037e1).

While the IRR study's 570 000-case cohort had a larger pool than the other MMWR studies, those 2 showed similar patterns. Both used test-negative designs, with a veterans-focused one suggesting a VE of 86.8% against COVID-19 hospitalization (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e3.htm) and a 9-state surveillance suggesting a VE of 86% against hospitalization and 82% against emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) clinic visits (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e2.htm). The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also retained high VE against COVID-19 infection overall, while Johnson & Johnson VE against overall infection was not assessed.

The IRR study looked at data from 4 Apr to 17 Jul [2021] and included 569 142 cases, 35 972 hospitalizations, and 6132 deaths in adults with COVID-19 across 13 US jurisdictions. Of these, 8% of cases, 8% of hospitalizations, and 9% of deaths were among people who were fully vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.

The largest increase in breakthrough events was among cases of any disease severity: Fully vaccinated people went from accounting for 5% of cases to 18% after delta surpassed the 50% mark on 20 Jun 2021. Once delta became the dominant strain, VE went from 91% to 78% against COVID-19 infection, 92% to 90% against hospitalization, and 94% to 91% against death. Those who were older, however, had higher hospitalization and death rates whether they were vaccinated or not, the researchers say.

Averaged weekly, age-standardized IRRs for cases among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people decreased from 11.1 to 4.6 compared with those fully vaccinated, according to the data. In other words, the infection risk in a fully vaccinated person was one-fifth that of someone not vaccinated. IRRs for hospitalizations and deaths also declined, from 13.3 to 10.4 and 16.6 to 11.3, respectively. The study authors note that unvaccinated people in the delta-dominant era are more than 10 times likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 or to die from it than vaccinated people are.

Looking at the context of the delta variant's surge, the researchers say that, from the study's start to its end, the variant went from a less than 1% share of cases to more than 90%. Adult vaccination rates did increase as well, though, with final age-group rates ranging from 45% (18-49 years) to 73% (65 years and older).

The other 2 studies focused on hospitalization and ED or UC clinic visits during the delta variant's emergence.

The veterans study consisted of 388 COVID-positive and 787 COVID-negative participants who sought healthcare for COVID-like symptoms at 5 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Almost 14% of the case-patients and 48.0% of the controls were fully vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna. VE against hospitalization actually went up from its pre-delta to its post-delta period (80.4%, 1 Feb-30 Jun 2021 vs 89.3%, 1 Jul-6 Aug 2021; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e3.htm).

The overall VE rate against hospitalization was 86.8%, but the researchers note that veterans 65 years or older had a lower rate of 79.8%, compared with 95.1% in those younger. No difference was found between people who were fully vaccinated less than 90 days before their qualifying test and those who had been vaccinated longer.

The findings were encouraging to the researchers, as their cohort included demographics shown to be more vulnerable during the pandemic. Most (93.0%) were men, older (median age, 68 years), or non-White (48.9% were Black and 7.9% were Hispanic). Additionally, 44.4% had a Charlson comorbidity index score of 3 or above, and common health conditions included obesity (46.8%), diabetes (43.8%), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (29.2%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (25.4%).

As for the other test-negative study, the researchers used the VISION Network to look at 32 867 medical encounters from 187 hospitals and 221 EDs and UC clinics in 9 states from June to August [2021] after delta became the dominant COVID strain (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7037e2.htm).

VE was measured for Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson and was 86% against COVID hospitalization and 89% against ED or UC clinic visits. Here too, however, data showed a lower VE for the elderly (76% in those 75 and up vs 89% in those younger).

More than 68 000 COVID-19 cases and 16 000 related deaths in US nursing homes may have gone uncounted because they occurred before federal guidelines required facilities to report case and death data in late May 2020, suggests a study yesterday [9 Sep 2021] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784031).

Led by a Harvard University researcher, the study compared the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported by 15 415 nursing homes in 20 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) with those reported to state departments of health by 24 May 2020. Analysis took place from December 2020 to May 2021.

Until 24 May 2020, more than 3 months after the 1st US COVID-19 nursing home outbreak at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, the federal government didn't mandate nursing home reporting of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Facilities could have voluntarily reported retrospective data, but many didn't.

For instance, the researchers pointed out that Life Care Center reported no coronavirus cases in the 24 May 2020 NHSN submission, even though a March 2020 CDC investigation had identified 81 cases and 23 deaths of residents in that facility. "The delay in required reporting means that the NHSN data miss a significant period of the pandemic, in which cases and deaths were increasing more rapidly than any other point in 2020 except during the wave in the final months of the year," they said.

Of all nursing homes in the sample, 4599 facilities were in 12 states that mandated case reporting, while 7405 were in 19 states that mandated death reporting. On average, 43.7% of COVID-19 cases and 40.0% of related deaths before 24 May 2020 in sample states weren't reported in the NHSN submission, suggesting the omission of 68 613 cases and 16 623 deaths, representing 11.6% of cases and 14.0% of deaths in nursing home residents in 2020.

Nursing homes in both analytic samples had significantly more COVID-19 cases and deaths using the NHSN data than facilities in nonsample states (average cases per facility, 8.1 vs 2.4; average deaths, 2.2 vs 1.4). There were no differences in nonreporting before 24 May 2020 by nursing home characteristics such as region, ownership, chain affiliation, or star rating.

From 40% to 60% of COVID-19 cases and 30% to 50% of deaths before 24 May 2020 went unreported. In the last 2020 NHSN submission on 27 Dec 2020, the percentages of unreported COVID-19 cases and deaths had fallen (average, 13.9% of cases, 18.7% of deaths), which the researchers said reflected the continued toll of the virus on facilities after mandatory reporting began.

After 24 May 2020, California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania's state and federal case and death data were aligned, while Connecticut, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island had higher cases and deaths in the state data than the federal data. In contrast, state reports of COVID-19 cases and deaths were lower than those in the federal data in New Hampshire, Tennessee, and New York.

The researchers said that academic and policymakers' analyses of nursing home-level determinants of COVID-19 cases and deaths have been compromised by their reliance on federal data. "Consistent with the fact that states in the Northeast were hit hardest in the early months of the pandemic but generally experienced lower case and death rates in later months, we found that unreported cases and deaths represented a significantly larger share of year-end totals in the Northeast than in the South and West, where most cases and deaths occurred later," the authors wrote.

Federal underreporting of nursing home cases and deaths "may lead to misleading conclusions about the role of different facility characteristics and state or federal policies in explaining COVID outbreaks," the researchers said.

In a commentary in the same journal, Elizabeth White, PhD, APRN, of Brown University School of Public Health, said that future research using the NHSN data needs to account for the significant data limitation uncovered by the study (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784034). "A large body of research has already developed examining various facility- and community-level factors associated with COVID-19 outcomes in nursing homes using the NHSN data," she said. "The study by Shen and colleagues provides important context for evaluating the rigor of these studies."

White noted that only half of US states collected and publicly released nursing home coronavirus data in early 2020 and that the data limitations were compounded by scarce testing resources that limited timely, accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. The estimates in the study "help to quantify the amount of underreporting in the federal NHSN data but they are just that: estimates," she wrote. "As such, although current measures of COVID-19 prevalence and mortality reflect a devastating public health crisis for the nursing home population, it is likely that even more lives were impacted that will never be fully captured in existing data."

A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study shows that 65.9% of a sample of US adults who tested positive for COVID-19 reported at least one lingering symptom more than a month later. The study, published today [10 Sep 2021] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), involved online nonprobability sampling of 3135 community-dwelling adults who had been tested for COVID-19 since January 2020 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036a1.htm). Of the participants, 698 reported a diagnosis of COVID-19, while 2437 said they tested negative. The sampling took place 9-23 Apr 2021.

Among respondents who tested positive, 86.5% reported initial symptoms compared with 61.7% of those who tested negative. Relative to participants who tested negative for COVID-19, those who tested positive reported a significantly higher prevalence of any persistent symptom (65.9% vs 42.9%), fatigue (22.5% vs 12.0%), loss of smell or taste (17.3% vs 1.7%), shortness of breath (15.5% vs 5.2%), cough (14.5% vs 4.9%), and headache (13.8% vs 9.9%). A larger proportion of coronavirus-positive respondents indicated that they believed that their long-term symptoms improved after they received a COVID-19 vaccine (28.7%) than negative respondents did (15.7%).

The weighted prevalence of a positive COVID-19 test result was 22.2%. Compared with participants who tested negative for COVID-19, infected respondents were younger (39.3 vs 45.3 years), were more likely to be employed (70.5% vs 61.6%), had higher household incomes (50.8% vs 43.9% made at least USD 60 000), and were more likely to live in an urban area (43.8% vs 37.6%).

The researchers said the findings can inform public health preparedness efforts, guide resource allocation for the care of patients with long COVID-19, and support communication efforts about experiences with vaccination. "The findings can also aid efforts to address post-COVID conditions, including helping healthcare professionals recognize the most common symptoms and optimize care for patients whose symptoms persist," the authors concluded.

[Long COVID leads to a broad range of symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2. A new paper examining the cause of long COVID, or "post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2" (PASC) was recently published:
Arthur JM, Forrest JC, Boehme KW, et al: Development of ACE2 autoantibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. PLoS ONE. 2021; 16(9): e0257016; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257016
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Conclusions: Many patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have antibodies specific for ACE2. Patients with ACE2 antibodies have lower activity of soluble ACE2 in plasma. Plasma from these patients also inhibits exogenous ACE2 activity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ACE2 antibodies develop after SARS-CoV-2 infection and decrease ACE2 activity. This could lead to an increase in the abundance of Ang II, which causes a proinflammatory state that triggers symptoms of PASC." - Mod.LK]

Hospital admissions related to eating disorders (EDs) increased 123% among 10- to 23-year-olds during the pandemic at Michigan's C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, according to a study today in Pediatrics (https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2021/09/09/peds.2021-052201).

The researchers compared the number of ED-related admissions during the first 12 months of the pandemic (1 Apr 2020 to 31 Mar 2021) with the same months from 2017 onward. Despite lower admissions in April 2020 -- which the researchers say could be due to the start of the state's lockdown -- the pandemic period still had 125 admissions compared with an average of 56 in the past 3 years.

Patient demographics remained similar before and after the pandemic began. Most were girls (88.4% pre-pandemic vs 90.2%), White (84.9% pre-pandemic before vs 90.2%), and about 15 years old (average, 15.1 pre-pandemic vs 15.2). The only significant change during the pandemic was a decrease in the proportion of publicly insured patients (8.8% vs 19.9%).

"Psychologically, adolescents with low self-esteem or depressive symptoms are more likely to develop EDs, and many describe worsening of these factors during the pandemic," the researchers write, adding that disruptions to day-to-day lives and relationships may have also exacerbated behaviors. While they note that some patients may have been more likely to be admitted because they were spending more time with their parents, they also say that COVID-related disruptions may have decreased access to ED care. They conclude, "Our findings suggest those who care for adolescents with EDs in the inpatient setting and beyond should be prepared to address challenges posed by increasing numbers of severely ill ED patients."

Only restrictive EDs (e.g., anorexia nervosa) were included in the study. Patients admitted solely for psychiatric reasons, those who had weight loss without ED diagnosis, or those with nonrestrictive EDs or bulimia nervosa were excluded.

["Eating disorders are thriving during the pandemic. Hotline calls to the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) are up 70-80% in recent months. For many, eating is a form of control -- a coping mechanism tied to stress. Food scarcity and stockpiling behavior can trigger anxieties about eating, or overeating among some.

"'We know that eating disorders have a strong link to trauma,' says Claire Mysko, CEO of NEDA. 'Many people with eating disorders have past experiences with trauma, and this [pandemic era] is a collective trauma.'

"It's also a lethal threat. Eating disorders have the second-highest mortality rate of any psychiatric diagnosis -- outranked only by opioid use disorder.

"A survey in International Journal of Eating Disorders in July [2020] found 62% of people in the USA with anorexia experienced a worsening of symptoms as the pandemic hit. And nearly one-third of Americans with binge-eating disorder, which is far more common, reported an increase in episodes.

"'Many people in our study...were talking about concerns that their eating disorder would get worse because of a lack of structure, a lack of social support, living in a triggering environment. And now that sense of structure has just kind of gone out the window,' says Christine Peat, a co-author of the study. 'And with that can go the structure you had around your meals and your snacks'" (https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/08/908994616/ eating-disorders-thrive-in-anxious-times-and-pose-a-lethal-threat).

Eating disorders are another consequence of the lockdown, stay-at-home orders during the early days of the pandemic. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 14 countries, including the USA (171 125), India (37 873), UK (37 391), Turkey (23 562), Malaysia (21 176), Iran (21 114), Russia (18 341), Philippines (17 912), Brazil (15 951), Mexico (14 828), Thailand (14 403), Germany (12 667), Viet Nam (13 321), and Japan (10 680), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 9607 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 8 Sep 2021 to late 9 Sep 2021). There appears to be a weekend-related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 58 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.2%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.8%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.7% decrease in daily reported cases and a 4.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted approximately 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 224.64 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.63 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
