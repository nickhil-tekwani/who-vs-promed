In June 1996, Ugandan health officials in the mostly rural Rakai District
noted a number of cases of an acute febrile illness with polyarthralgia and
skin rash, often accompanied by posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. The
typical case was characterized by onset of low-grade fever and malaise,
followed by symmetric polyarthralgia and often by lymphadenopathy and
followed within 48 hours by an often pruritic, generalized maculopapular
rash. Patients usually recovered within 1-2 weeks of clinical onset,
although a small number experienced more prolonged arthralgia. O'nyong-nyong
(ONN) fever or chikungunya fever were suspected.
By September-October 1996, cases had been described in the Mbarara and
Masaka Districts of Uganda and the Bukoba District of northern Tanzania.
Initial field studies of the epidemic, conducted in September and October by
scientists at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, included
collection of clinical specimens. Tests of these specimens, conducted at
UVRI and subsequently by the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases,
National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Fort Collins, Colorado, confirmed the illness as ONN
fever both serologically and by virus isolation and identification.
International collaborative field studies centered in the Rakai District
were conducted during January-February 1997 by scientists from UVRI, the
Ugandan Ministry of Health, CDC, World Health Organization, the Kenya
Medical Research Institute, and Makerere University, Kampala. Preliminary
results suggest that the epidemic in south-central Uganda had subsided but
did not terminate with the onset of the major dry season in December 1996.
Sporadic clinical cases, some now virologically confirmed, continued to
occur with illness onset dates as late as January 26 [1997.

[And no deaths have been reported, just as in the original pandemic in
1959. Thank you, Bob, for catering to my interest; as you know, I was one
of the investigators in 1959
