I read the booster policy article published in the Journal of Infectious
Diseases, 1998. I am a bit concerned as to whom this may apply.
The vaccine regime that I went through prior to veterinary school was of
three doses with a titer check 3 years after the vaccine to determine if a
protective titer was present. The study of the New Booster Policy includes
a booster one year after the initial vaccine which may not be the protocol
applied to most veterinarians in this country.
Is there a study that examines the scenario of 3 vaccines without a booster
follow up a year later?

I feel fortunate that we only have to deal with bat rabies, so far. Last
year an animal rehabilitator was bitten by two different, "injured" bats as
she seeking to help them. Each tested positive for rabies. She had been
bitten by a rabid bat earlier in the year and received a booster shot. Her
exposure was continuous and she was concerned about the costs, etc. We
concurred and offered her the option of having annual titers and booster as
needed rather than post-exposure prophylaxis after each rabies exposure.
She agreed to that option and her titer showed she was protected
for that incident.
