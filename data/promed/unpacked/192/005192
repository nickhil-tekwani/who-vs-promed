Animal disease spreads in North Cotabato
-----------------------------------------
The provincial veterinarian's office of North Cotabato has urged Gov.
Emmanuel F. Pinol to put the whole province under a state of emergency due
to the spread of an infectious blood disease that affects farm animals.
The disease, called surra, has, reportedly, already spread [into] 12 towns
in the province, including the capital city.
Based on reports gathered by the veterinarian's office, 135 farm animals
have died in these areas since 2003.
Dr. Enrico Garzon, the provincial veterinarian, told MindaNews that, last
month [Jun 2004], 16 carabaos, and 19 horses, died suddenly in Makilala
town apparently due to surra disease.
"The death of their working animals is a great loss. This will affect the
socio-economic condition of the farmers in the area, who depend solely on
agriculture," Garzon said.
The provincial government, the office of the provincial veterinarian, and
the college of medicine of the University of Southern Mindanao, in Kabacan,
North Cotabato have conducted random blood sampling in the 12 affected
towns, where surra disease was observed.
The team collected, and tested, 1430 blood samples, of which, 32 percent
tested positive.
The diagnosis urged the office of the provincial veterinarian to conduct
massive information dissemination and consultations with the town mayors.
This resulted in the provision of funds to control the disease, with the
provincial and the municipal governments sharing 50-50.
So far, a total of 5251 large animals, from the 12 surra-infested towns,
have been treated. The veterinarian's office also conducted de-worming
activities, and, gave out free vitamins.
Garzon said his office will seek assistance from the Department of
Agriculture to help in their campaign against surra disease in North Cotabato.
Pinol has already earmarked P2 million [USD 35 676] for the purchase of
medicines to combat surra infestation.
