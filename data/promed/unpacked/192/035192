Three children have died in eastern China from hand, foot and mouth
disease in the country's 2nd outbreak of the potent toddler virus
this year [2008], state media reported on Monday [20 Oct 2008].

Health officials warned that the disease was epidemic in some parts
of the coastal Fujian province, with 113 cases reported since the
start of October 2008, the official Xinhua news agency stated. The 3
victims were all less than one year old and from the same place,
Jian'ou City, it added. A flare-up of the virus [infection] in
southern China killed at least 42 people in April and May 2008, and
27 500 further cases, largely affecting toddlers, were reported.

Hand, foot and mouth disease is a common childhood illness, but the
outbreaks in China have been linked with enterovirus 71 (EV71), which
can cause a severe form of the disease characterised by high fever,
paralysis and meningitis.

There is no vaccine for the disease, and, normally, patients recover
within a week to 10 days. Enteroviruses spread mostly through contact
with infected blisters or feces.

In the most recent ProMED-mail report concerning hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD) in China, dated 25 Jul 2008 (see archive report
below), it was indicated that the outbreak which had moved from
southern and central China further north was in decline. Today's
report from Fujian province suggests that there has been a resurgence
of HFMD accompanied by an appreciable number of fatalities.
Enterovirus 71 has been identified as the etiologic agent, the virus
responsible for the Asia-wide outbreak of HFMD during the past year. - Mod.CP]

[It should be noted that 2008 is the 1st year in which reporting of
HFMD is mandatory, hence, while the numbers of reported cases may
appear to be exceptionally large, there are no official reports from
earlier years to make comparisons. In a newswire posted on PRO/MBDS
in June 2008 there was mention of an estimated 176 000 cases of HFMD
reported in China during the period January through Mid-May
2008. The estimated number of fatalities nationwide was not provided
in that newswire. (see PRO/MBDS posting Hand, foot & mouth disease -
China (11) 20080611.1844, available at <http://www.promedmail.org>).
