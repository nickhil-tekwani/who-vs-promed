Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animals(s) at grazing/watering, contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: the outbreaks are occurring in FMD vaccination zones of the south-eastern lowveld which lies close to a national park (Gonarezhou) and wildlife conservancies. Routine vaccinations in these areas are now long overdue. Mixing of cattle and buffaloes is being exacerbated by the shortage of grazing pastures. All the infected districts have been placed under quarantine with veterinary check-points also manned by police personnel placed at strategic areas to prevent cattle movement. Inspections and community education campaigns are currently on-going.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s), surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, quarantine, control of wildlife reservoirs, zoning, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 25 Jul 2017 / Positive
Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / virus isolation / Pending
Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.
