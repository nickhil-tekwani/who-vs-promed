ENZOOTIC BOVINE LEUKOSIS - NEW ZEALAND (02): ERADICATED, NOT

The ProMED-mail posting Enzootic Bovine Leukosis - New Zealand: Eradicated
20090928.3388 is not correct.

The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry makes no claim to have
eradicated EBL. As the story itself states, the programme was carried out
by a farmers' cooperative with no involvement of the Ministry.

As the story makes clear, the programme covered the dairy sector only. The
status of the beef sector is unknown.

The story claims the programme was 'internationally recognized". That claim
is suspect. Internationally recognized by whom? Certainly not by the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health), which recognises the status of only
4 diseases in Member Countries: foot-and-mouth disease, contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia, rinderpest, and BSE.

[One can obtain information about the (self-notified) EBL status in OIE
member countries by downloading the table "List of countries by disease
situation", available in OIE's WAHID interface at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease_status_lists> (select
enzootic bovine leukosis).

Iceland and New Caledonia claim "disease never occurred" while maintaining
"general and targeted surveillance".

Denmark and Switzerland claim disease absence, respectively since 1990 and
May 2005, while maintaining "general and targeted surveillance". (For the
May 2005 case in Switzerland, see ProMED-mail posting 20050625.1783).

United Kingdom and Slovenia claim disease absence, respectively since 1996
and June 2006, while maintaining "targeted surveillance".

According to the data above, it may be deduced that Denmark and Switzerland
regard themselves as having accomplished EBL eradication.

While the OIE does not maintain members' recognition of EBL freedom, the EC
recognises freedom of (member) states or parts of their territories.
Denmark's freedom of EBL was recognised in 2003 by the European Commission
(Decision 2003/467/EC). The EC supports EBL eradication programs in member
states. According to EC legislation, maintained EBL freedom is subject to
ongoing surveillance, which includes testing of bulk milk samples and blood
samples according to a prescribed sampling strategy.
