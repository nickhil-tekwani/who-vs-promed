Transplant Patients Get Rabies From Organs
------------------------------------------
3 hospital patients in Germany appear to have been infected with
rabies through organ transplants and are in critical condition, a
medical foundation said on Wed 16 Feb 2005. 3 others who received
transplants from the same donor, a woman who died of a heart attack
late in 2004, are doing fine, the German Foundation for Organ
Transplants said.
The donor showed no rabies symptoms at the time of her death,
although a recent examination of her brain showed typical signs of
the disease, the group said. How the woman may have contracted rabies
was unclear, but the group noted that she had been in India in
October [2004]. Although rare in developed countries, rabies kills
thousands of people each year in developing nations.
The critically ill patients, hospitalized in the cities of Hanover
and Marburg, received the donor's lungs, kidneys and pancreas. All
showed rabies symptoms, the group said. A patient in Heidelberg who
received the liver, as well as 2 patients in Mainz who received her
corneas, were in good health. "Something like this has never happened
in Germany" the Foundation head Guenter Kirste said in a statement.
"Unfortunately there is no way to medically rule out such rare
infections, despite thorough tests of the donor." All health
professionals who were involved in the transplants or caring for the
patients have been identified and inoculated, Kirste said.
Most human cases of rabies arise from dog bites, though many other animals
can carry the disease. Symptoms include fever, violent spasms, panic,
hallucinations and coma leading eventually to death. 4 people in the
United States died of rabies in 2004 after receiving infected organs
from a donor in Arkansas. That donor had shown no signs of the
disease before his death from a brain hemorrhage.

message stated that: "There is interesting information posted at the
web-site of the German Transplantation Organization (DSO) about
rabies recently acquired by 6 German patients (3 of them apparently
in critical condition due to fully developed rabies) with
transplanted organs from a donor unfortunately not diagnosed as
having rabies. The original text in German is entitled "Tollwut nach
Organspende" and can be found at <http://www.dso.de> in the section
"Aktuell". - Mod.CP]
