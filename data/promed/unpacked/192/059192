In January 2016, _Aedes albopictus_ adults were found in the Jardin Zoologique in central Kinshasa [Democratic Republic of Congo]. Subsequent visits found more adults and larvae at numerous sites in Kinshasa. The finding of _Ae. albopictus_ in Kinshasa is not unexpected, but its presence is of importance as it is a vector of multiple mosquitoborne viruses. Further work is needed to determine the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

_Aedes albopictus_ Skuse is a mosquito with a worldwide distribution. Along with _Aedes aegypti_, it is an important vector of yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses. It also has been shown to play an important role in chikungunya and Zika virus transmission in central Africa (Paupy et al. 2012; Grard et al. 2014). There was an outbreak of chikungunya in Kinshasa in 1999-2000 (Pastorino et al. 2004) but vectors were not identified.

Subsequent outbreaks of chikungunya have been investigated but no _Ae. albopictus_ larvae or adults were collected prior to 2016 (S. Fasine, pers. comm.). Despite the identification of chikungunya-positive _Ae. albopictus_ in nearby Brazzaville, Republic of Congo (Mombouli et al. 2013), and the prediction that the potential distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ could include the entire territory of the DRC (Benedict et al. 2007), no reports of _Ae. albopictus_ have been published for DRC. This report is the first to document the occurrence of _Aedes albopictus_ in DRC.

On 18 Jan 2016, one of the authors (S.R.I.) was visiting the Jardin Zoologique, a zoo located in Gombe, Kinshasa, DRC. This zoo holds many animals including chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_), olive baboons (_Papio anubis_), and other monkeys. There are a variety of other animals including crocodiles, birds and buffalo. While in a shady area of the park, mosquitoes were noticed and photographed (Fig. 1).

Subsequent visits (20-25 Jan 2016) to the zoo and the nearby Parc deBoeck resulted in the collection of 28 adults (human landing collection) and 246 larvae. Collections were then expanded to other sites across Kinshasa (Fig. 2), where 405 adult mosquitoes were collected using aspirators. These were identified to species using standard morphological identification keys (Huang 2004; Edwards 1941).Of the 405 mosquitoes, 199 (49%) were _Ae. albopictus_ and 206 (51%) were _Ae. aegypti_.

Larvae were also collected. While a majority of these were identified as _Culex_ sp., both _Ae. albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypt_i were also encountered.

Our survey shows a wide distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in the city of Kinshasa. _Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. aegypti_ were often found in the same areas. Moumbouli et al. (2013) found the same result in nearby Brazzaville, Republic of Congo.

The identification of _Ae. albopictus_ in Kinshasa is certainly not surprising, but its presence in Kinshasa, a city of over 10 million inhabitants, where chikungunya outbreaks have occurred and where the virus has also been found in pools of _Aedes_ mosquitoes (Mbanzulu, pers. comm.) is of concern. Additionally, _Ae. albopictus_ has been found to play a role in Zika outbreaks in nearby Gabon (Grard et al. 2014).

The mosquitoes present in the zoo have the opportunity to bite both the primates housed in the zoo and nearby human populations. Of particular concern is the general hospital of Kinshasa (MamaYemoHospital), located approximately 40 m from where the 1st mosquitoes were found, where those attending the sick often remain outdoors throughout the day, this is also the case for university hospital.

Further work should be conducted to determine the distribution of _Ae. albopictus_ in Kinshasa and the rest of the country.

[Although the finding of _Ae. albopictus_ in Kinshasa city was made 3 years ago, it is still important because of the risk this species poses to the public's health. As the authors note, finding _Ae albopictus_ in Kinshasa was not surprising, since it was present just across the river in Brazzaville. Chikungunya virus has been present in the area before. An epidemic of chikungunya began in early June 2011 in the Republic of the Congo's capital Brazzaville, and spread to the neighbouring Pool region. From 1 to 23 Jun 2011, there were 7014 cases in Brazzaville and 460 in Pool.

The presence of _Ae aegypti_ in Kinshasa city is of concern as well. When yellow fever spilled over into the DRC from Angola in 2016, the risk of a large outbreak in Kinshasa elicited a successful massive vaccination campaign. Eradication of these 2 vector mosquito populations in Kinshasa is not possible with current control methods. Surveillance for early detection of the viruses that these 2 mosquito species can transmit will be important to take early measures to reduce the numbers of these vectors. - Mod.TY
