Abstract
Anthrax is a zoonosis produced by _Bacillus anthracis_. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the clinical findings, therapy, and
outcome in children with cutaneous anthrax (CA). Data on age, gender,
occupation, clinical symptoms and findings, location and type of
lesions, clinical history, laboratory findings, treatment, and
outcome were recorded from patients' medical records, retrospectively.

The study included 65 patients between 1 month and 18 years old (9.0
plus or minus 4.0 years), 37 patients (56.9 percent) were male and 28
(43.1 percent) were female. Most of the patients (89.1 percent) were
admitted in summer and autumn (p < 0.001). Of the 65 patients, 20
patients (30.8 percent) had received antibiotherapy before admission
to our hospital. All patients except one had a contact history with
infected animals. A 1-month-old patient had a contact history with
his mother who had CA.

On clinical examination, anthrax edema was noted in 36 (55.3 percent)
patients, anthrax pustule in 27 (41.5 percent), and anthrax edema and
anthrax pustule in 2 (3 percent) patients. Gram staining and culture
was positive for B. anthracis in 35 (53.8 percent) patients, and only
Gram staining was positive in 10 (15.4 percent) patients. In the
remaining 20 (30.8 percent) patients, the diagnosis was made by
clinical findings. Because the anthrax outbreak in Turkey was
associated with slaughtering or milking of ill cows, sheep, or goats,
and handling raw meat without taking any protective measures, persons
in the community must be educated about using personal protective
equipment during slaughtering of animals and handling of meat and
skins.

[Human anthrax is a serious zoonotic problem in Turkey. They
presently average some 300 to 150 human cases each year (the
incidence is slowing), with significant numbers of originating
outbreaks in cattle, and small ruminants, and the occasional equine
case. This is an informative cross-section of what can be expected
and the problems of diagnosis. Contagious cases are rare -- see the
infant infected by its mother -- but they can happen. For those
interested the full article is worth reading. - Mod.MHJ]
