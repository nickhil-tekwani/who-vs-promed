To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

(https://www.news.gov.hk/eng/2020/06/20200625/20200625_183153_513.html. I was unable to find more information on these cases (symptomatic vs asymptomatic; location visited).

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours.

There was one case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 21, 22, 23, and 24 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time, and 2 cases were reported on 14, 18, and 20 Jun 2020.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 39 cases with no new deaths, compared with 28 cases and 2 new deaths in the previous day (24 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 76 consecutive days. There were 27 locally transmitted cases -- Seoul (16), Daejeon (4), Chungnam (3), Gyeonggi (2), Incheon (1), and Gangwon (1); and 12 imported cases -- airport quarantine (7), Gyeonggi (2), Seoul (1), Incheon (1), Gyeongbuk (1). There were 10 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the 'ncov' website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative positive testing rate has been 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/) down from 1.1% over the past 48 hours.

The overall impression hasn't changed: lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

Details on the 28 cases reported on 24 Jun 2020, can be found on the English language page, notices 395 and 396 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030. In the presentation of the clusters (notice 396) there were 71 cases related to door to door sales with cases in 7 provinces.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 239 706 cases, including 34 678 deaths, up by +190 cases and +34 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (24 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +190 cases. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 170 newly confirmed cases, up from 88 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data". Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (170). There are increases in cases reported from Emilia-Romagna (47), Piedmont (20), Campania (17), Liguria (14), and Lazio (12). 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 51 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 35 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. Northern Italy warrants close monitoring...

[4] Iran: 215 096 total cases, 10 130 deaths

The number of COVID-19 cases in Iran has increased by 2595, a bit more than the previous day, reaching 215 096, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported on Thursday [25 Jun 2020], citing Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari. On Wednesday [24 Jun 2020], the daily increase was at 2531. According to the spokeswoman, the death toll has grown by 134 and is now at 10 130.

Meanwhile, the Iranian authorities are planning to make masks mandatory in some areas of the country, President Hassan Rouhani said at a meeting with heads of the special committees on counteracting COVID-19 earlier in the day. "The heads of Social-Security Committee and the Economic Committee, as well as the Health Committee of the National Task Force for Fighting Coronavirus have prepared instructions about how and in what areas of the country the use of masks will be compulsory, which will be announced when approved by the national committee," Rouhani said.

He also noted the need to produce enough masks at a low price to sustain the new regulation.

The country experienced a massive spike in coronavirus cases in early June [2020], which since then has translated into an increase of fatalities. For the 2nd week, the country has seen the daily death toll exceed 100 almost every day.

[As of 25 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 215 096, including 10 130 deaths, an increase of 2595 cases and 134 deaths since 24 Jun 2020. No mention was made over the number of provinces currently considered as "red zone" or which provinces will have mandatory face mask requirements (actually with active transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, mandatory use of face masks should probably apply to the whole country).

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a recrudescence (a challenge as to whether to call this a continuance of the 1st wave with transmission never having been interrupted, or to acknowledge there while had been relative control of the outbreak that was lost due to restrictions being lifted too early). As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 504 588, including 126 780 deaths, an increase from 2 462 554 cases and 124 281 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 210 523 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 25 Jun 2020, including 17 715 confirmed deaths and an additional 4669 probable deaths, representing an increase of 338 newly confirmed cases and 30 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, California, Florida, Arizona, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, South Carolina, and Mississippi. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All 10 states each reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours with the range being 1092 to 5960.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. Of note is the 7 day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 38.5% higher than the 7 day average for the preceding 7 days,

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of today (25 Jun 2020) the percent positive testing results nationally is 9%, down from 10% over the past 2 days, but still consistent with the ongoing as yet not under control, pandemic in the country.
