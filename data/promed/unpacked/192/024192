[The 1st report suggests that this unusually large outbreak of
hepatitis A may have passed its peak and that containment measures
are beginning to take effect. However, in view of the extent and
frequency of hepatitis A outbreaks in Russia, visitors are advised to
seek hepatitis A vaccination prior to travel. - Mod.CP]
