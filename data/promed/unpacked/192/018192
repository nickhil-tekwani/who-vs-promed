[Unfortunately, HPAI continues to spread in Europe. The fact that HPAI subtypes H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is indicative that these viruses spread wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must implement all the biosecurity measures necessary to protect their flocks from exposure and infection.

A map of the cases of HPAI outbreaks confirmed in different EU Member States and in the UK can be seen at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_2020_map.pdf (latest update 9 Dec 2020).

"As the autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe continues, and given the expected local movements of these birds, there is still a high risk of introduction and further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. The risk of virus spread from wild birds to poultry is high, and Member States should enforce in 'high risk areas' of their territories the measures provided for in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136."
