About 200 cases of human infection with brucellosis have been registered in Azerbaijan from 2014, Department Head of the Epidemiology of Infectious and Special Dangerous Infectious Diseases of the Republican Anti-Plague Station, Rita Ismayilova reported.

Brucellosis is a contagious zoonosis caused by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat from infected animals or close contacts with their secretions. It usually begins with a high fever, which lasts for 7-10 days, but in case of absence of appropriate therapy, the temperature would keep up even for 2-3 months [so-called indolent fever - Mod.LL]. The fever is accompanied by chills, excessive sweating and general symptoms of intoxication. Later, it is joined by symptoms involving the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, nervous, and other body systems.

"Frequency of cases in 2014 has not changed in comparison with 2013," she noted. "The highest number of cases is reported in Ganja, Imishli and Bilasuvar, and the lowest number in Baku, North and South regions (Guba, Khachmaz, Astara and Masalli). There have been no cases of death resulting from the infection in 2014 or 2013," she said.

Ismayilova stressed that human infection occurs through direct contact with animals or eating contaminated foods such as raw milk and cheese made from unpasteurized milk.

Ismaylova noted that brucellosis infection is endemic in the country. "Epidemic analysis of materials related to the main sources and routes of brucellosis transmission in our country in recent years has shown that the main source of infection is small livestock."

Such cases have been recorded throughout the current year [2014] in Azerbaijan. The number of cases of brucellosis increases in summer and autumn.

[Brucellosis (http://www.medicinenet.com/brucellosis/article.htm) is a disease that is thought to have existed since ancient times, as it was 1st described more than 2000 years ago by the Romans and Hippocrates. It was not until 1887 that a British physician, Dr David Bruce, isolated the organism that causes brucellosis from several deceased patients from the island of Malta. This disease has had several names throughout its history, including Mediterranean fever, Malta fever, Crimean fever, Bang's disease, and undulant fever (because of the relapsing nature of the fever associated with the disease).

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive, and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, working in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital. - Mod.LL
