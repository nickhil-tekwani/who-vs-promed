Officials confirm avian flu found in 2 more locations in south
-----------------------------------------------
The Agriculture Ministry confirmed Monday [20 Mar 2006] afternoon that
avian flu has been detected in 2 more locations in Israel, bringing the
number of sites at which the disease has been found to 6.
Suspicions that the virus had reached Kibbutz Nir Oz [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/1/Nir_Oz.html>]
and Moshav Amei Oz [map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/1/Ammioz.html>],
both in southern Israel, were raised when dead turkeys were found at both
locations, and the presence of the virus was confirmed Monday [20 Mar 2006].
"We are talking about infections in 6 flocks in 4 locations when there are
thousands of flocks in Israel in a vast number of locations," Shimon
Pokomonsky, a senior veterinarian at the Agriculture Ministry, told reporters.
Turkeys from Amei Oz had been sent Sunday [19 Mar 2006] for slaughter, the
media reported, and Agriculture Ministry officials were trying to locate
and stop the trucks carrying them.
Representatives from Israel met on Monday [20 Mar 2006] afternoon with
officials from the Palestinian Authority's Agriculture Ministry at Erez
crossing to confirm that the avian flu had not reached the Gaza Strip.
Meanwhile, Labor Chairman Amir Peretz and 2 former agriculture ministers
Monday [20 Mar 2006] joined calls from the poultry growers' association for
Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to declare the outbreak of avian flu
strain in Israel a natural disaster.
Representatives of the Kibbutz Movement on Monday [20 Mar 2006] also sent a
request to Olmert to declare the avian flu a natural disaster.
"The avian flu may cause the poultry industry in Israel to collapse and
leave thousands without their livelihood," the request said.
The demands came as the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary service ordered
the culling of poultry transported to the "Off Kor" slaughterhouse in the
southern town of Sderot, as the birds had come from one of the communities
infected with the strain.
But Agriculture Minister Ze'ev Boim said in response that it was premature
to make such a declaration. He told Israel Radio that the outbreak of the
virus was still on a local scale and had not yet reached national proportions.
The secretary-general of the poultry growers' association, Ya'akov Cohen,
warned Monday [20 Mar 2006] that many farmers may not cooperate with the
authorities unless the avian flu outbreak is recognized as a natural
disaster, for fear of losing livestock without receiving proper compensation.
The veterinary service confirmed Sunday [19 Mar 2006] that the bird flu
virus that has hit turkeys in southern Israel is the lethal H5N1 strain,
which may pose a danger to people who come into regular contact with the fowl.
The strain was isolated and identified in the turkey coops at the Ein
Hashlosha and Holit kibbutzim and at Moshav Sdeh Moshe. The strain of virus
that attacked the fowl at Kibbutz Nachshon has not been isolated yet, but
ministry sources think it will also be H5N1.
The initial culling of birds in infected coops was completed Sunday [19 Mar
2006] at Holit, Ein Hashlosha and Sdeh Moshe. The operation moves Tuesday
[21 Mar 2006] to Nachshon and Kibbutz Harel, and to the Tekoa and Tzalfon
moshavim nearby, where Agriculture Ministry teams will be aided by
personnel working for Defense Ministry contractors. In these communities,
there are very large numbers of chickens, so the damage there will be
enormous. In the western Negev, culling of the fowl will begin Monday [20
Mar 2006] at Kibbutz Sufa near Holit, and at the Kissufim and Nirim
kibbutzim near Ein Hashlosha.
The Agriculture Ministry estimates the culling operation will be completed
by week's end. Officials were hopeful Sunday [19 Mar 2006] that the
measures taken thus far -- such as culling all fowl within a 3-km radius of
the infected coops, and imposing a quarantine on communities within a 10-km
radius -- will prevent the virus from spreading.
However, farmers and veterinarians in the infected areas say the
Agriculture Ministry is moving too slowly. So far, the culling has been
done to only half of all birds at Holit and 1/3rd of those at Ein
Hashlosha. The culling at Nachshon began only last night [19 Mar 2006],
more than 48 hours after the deadly virus was discovered.
Acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said Sunday [19 Mar 2006] at the start of
the weekly cabinet meeting that there is no evidence of the avian flu
spreading to humans, and added that the government is taking every
precaution to ensure that this does not happen.
The cabinet approved the creation of an inter-ministerial team to formulate
a compensation plan for poultry farmers who are being forced to destroy
tens of thousands of fowl.
The Agriculture Ministry's deputy director general, Itzik Ben David, told
Haaretz on Sunday [19 Mar 2006] that the culling process could affect a
total of 900 000 birds. He estimated that the financial compensation to
farmers will total between NIS 15 and 20 million [USD 3.2-4.3 million],
assuming no additional communities are affected.
Ministry officials on Sunday [19 Mar 2006] denied a report in the media
claiming the ministry was concerned that infected poultry had been
slaughtered in Kiryat Malakhi and sold to stores and markets. The ministry
also denied rumors that the slaughterhouse in question had been identified
as the source of contamination of turkeys with avian flu.
Agriculture Minister Ze'ev Boim and Health Minister Yaakov Edri briefed the
cabinet on the measures being taken to contain the flu outbreak. Boim said
that a shipment of 4 million doses of vaccine will be arriving from the
Netherlands in the next few days. He explained that this vaccine will be
used only if the quarantine imposed on infected areas proves ineffective.
Health Ministry director general Prof. Avi Yisraeli told the cabinet that
30 senior ministry officials were dispatched to oversee the culling process
and to ensure that everything possible is done to prevent human infection.
Meanwhile, the Health Ministry is continuing to administer Tamiflu pills to
several dozen workers who handled turkeys in the moshavim and kibbutzim
that had the virus, as well as to Agriculture Ministry employees involved
in the culling operation there.
The Health Ministry has sent blood samples from several dozen workers to
the laboratory to check whether they have been infected.

New outbreak of H5N1 bird flu virus detected in northern Malaysia
-----------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus has killed several chickens in a poultry farming
village, indicating that it has spread from central to northern Malaysia,
officials said Monday [20 Mar 2006].
Officials will slaughter more than 200 birds in Penang state's Permatang
Bagak Village after tests confirmed that at least 6 chickens died of H5N1
there last week, said Mustapa Abdul Jalil, acting director general of
Veterinary Services Department.
"We're not in a state of panic, but we will take every action to prevent
the virus from moving any further," Mustapa told The Associated Press.
It was the 1st bird flu outbreak in the northern state of Penang, following
2 cases reported last week in Perak state to the south.
No human infections from the virus have been reported in Malaysia. About
100 people have died worldwide from the disease, which recently spread from
Asia to the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
The virus has killed or forced the slaughter of tens of millions of
chickens and ducks across Asia since 2003.
In Perak, the virus was detected among chickens in a village and birds in a
wildlife ecotourism park. The country's 1st outbreak this year [2006]
occurred in February in 4 villages outside Malaysia's largest city, Kuala
Lumpur, in the central part of the country.
Officials have not determined how the virus spread to Permatang Bagak
Village, but all the birds that will be slaughtered have been found within
one km (half a mile) of the site where the chickens died, Mustapa said.
Officials will also declare a 10-km (6-mile) radius observation zone in the
area, meaning residents' health will [be] monitored in the zone and the
removal of birds will be prevented.
The village is located on Penang state's mainland in peninsular Malaysia,
near the state's main island, a popular tourist destination and hub for
international manufacturing companies.
