Egypt: Rift Valley fever outbreak death toll reaches 17
-------------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 28 Aug 2003, WHO has received reports of 45 cases of Rift Valley
fever (RVF) including 17 deaths in Seedy Salim District, a remote rural
area in Kafr Al-Sheikh Governorate, about 150 kilometres north of Cairo.
All cases are Egyptian farmers.
Laboratory testing carried out at the Naval Medical Research Unit No.3
(NAMRU-3), Egypt, has confirmed the diagnosis of RVF in clinical samples.
The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, and WHO have joined
efforts to control the outbreak and institute appropriate control measures.
WHO is closely monitoring the situation.
A gradual increase in the number of suspected cases of RVF in Seedy Salim
District has been reported as a result of active surveillance.

[This is a decrease of 16 deaths from the total of 33 fatalities in the
earlier report -- see ref. below. There is still no estimate of the total
number of cases, nor reports of cases in livestock. ProMED-mail would
welcome more information. - Mod.JW]
