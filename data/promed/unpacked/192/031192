Abstract
-------
Background
Anthrax outbreaks in Tanzania have been reported from the human, livestock, and wildlife sectors over several years, and is among the notifiable diseases. Despite frequent anthrax outbreaks, there is no comprehensive dataset indicating the magnitude and distribution of the disease in susceptible species. This study is a retrospective review of anthrax outbreaks from the human, livestock, and wildlife surveillance systems from 2006 to 2016. The objectives were to identify hotspot districts, describe anthrax epidemiology in the hotspot areas, evaluate the efficiency of the anthrax response systems and identify potential areas for further observational studies.

Methods
We prepared a spreadsheet template for a retrospective comprehensive record review at different surveillance levels in Tanzania. We captured data elements including demographic characteristics of different species, the name of health facility, and date of anthrax diagnosis. Also, we collected data on the date of specimen collection, species screened, type of laboratory test, laboratory results, and the outcome recorded at the end of treatment in humans. After establishing the database, we produced maps in Quantum GIS software and transferred cleaned data to Stata software for supportive statistical analysis.

Results
Anthrax reported incidences over 4 years in humans were much higher in the Arusha region (7.88/100 000) followed by Kilimanjaro region (6.64/100 000) than other regions of Tanzania Mainland. The health facility based review from hotspot districts in parts of Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions from 2006 to 2016, identified 330 human anthrax cases from the selected health facilities in the 2 regions. Out of 161 livestock and 57 wildlife specimens tested, 103 and 18 respectively, were positive for anthrax.

Conclusion
The findings of this study are critical for consideration by respective authorities for setting up prevention and control measures of anthrax outbreaks in the human, livestock, and wildlife sectors within Tanzania. There is a gross under-reporting of anthrax cases in existing human and animal surveillance systems, which can be an obstacle for estimating the real burden of anthrax in the hotspot districts. We also noticed that people living in the marginalised communities like the Maasai remain at high risk of contracting anthrax infection given their ties to cultural practices of handling and consuming dead animals and their products. Moreover, repeated occurrences of anthrax in livestock, wildlife, and humans suggest for strengthening links and promoting inter-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaboration to enhance the improved prevention and control measures for anthrax outbreaks in a One Health approach.

[This is not a trivial study. This study was jointly supported by the World Bank through the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Network (EAPHLN) project (ID Number P153665) and the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU). The authors worked closely with the Tanzania Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MoHCDGEC), and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries (MoLF) who provided historical anthrax data in humans and livestock respectively. Also the Staff of health facilities from Siha, Hai, Moshi Rural, Rombo, Meru, Monduli, and Ngorongoro districts, National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency (TVLA), and Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI-Serengeti Centre) for their valuable contributions during record review of livestock and wildlife laboratory results at their workplaces that enabled realization of this study.

All too often the numbers provided to OIE and other agencies are derived from the sample log at the relevant diagnostic laboratory or laboratories and lack any background information, relevant or irrelevant. To quote a cliché they represent the mere tip of the true disease incidence iceberg. This is not a new problem and we need to do better, not just in recognizing the true extent of livestock and human anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
