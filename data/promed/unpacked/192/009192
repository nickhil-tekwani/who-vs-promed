PARIS - A mysterious outbreak of listeri[osis has killed seven people in
France over the past few weeks, Health Minister Jean Glavany said Saturday.
Glavany told reporters the dead were among 23 people affected by the
disease, which is caused by eating food tainted by the bacterium _Listeria
monocytogenes_.
Listeri[osis is uncommon but can be fatal for pregnant women, children,
the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.
A health ministry statement said widespread checks were carried out in
areas where those affected lived and shopped but the cause of the illness
in their cases was not ascertained.
_Listeria_ was blamed for 20 deaths in a 1992 epidemic in France.
