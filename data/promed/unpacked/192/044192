Richard Knox has kindly provided us with the program's script:
For the past 6 weeks, researchers have been tracking a bird flu virus
across northern Asia. This isn't an ordinary virus. It's the same one that
has killed nearly 60 people in South East Asia who got infected from
poultry. Scientists fear the virus, with a slight genetic change, could
touch off a global flu pandemic worse than any disease outbreak in nearly
90 years. NPR's Richard Knox reports that experts are worried about the
sudden spread of the virus. But they don't know how worried to be.
KNOX: The virus is called H5N1. Since it first showed up 9 years ago in a
Hong Kong goose, hundreds of millions of chickens have died from it...or
been put to death to contain outbreaks. Over the past 2 years, the virus
has infected 112 people and killed nearly half, most of them in Vietnam.
But until this summer, it hadn't been seen outside southern China and South
East Asia.
Now the virus has popped up nearly 2000 miles north of Hanoi...in [a swath]
from Kazakhstan to neighboring Siberia...northwest China...Mongolia and
Tibet. No human cases are known in the north. But the unexpected spread has
got flu researchers very jumpy.
Dr Juan Lubroth is with the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization.
Lubroth: We are concerned because we have seen spread into Kazakhstan,
Siberia, to the Ural mountains. We have evidence that there has been
migratory waterfowl that have died of the disease.And how did the infection
get to them? We don't really know.
KNOX: And this mystery is full of suspense. Because billions of wild birds
are just beginning to leave their breeding grounds for points south.
Lubroth: With the migration that will be occurring in the next month month
and a half, we are quite concerned there could be an introduction of H5N1
into the Indian subcontinent or even towards the Middle East or Europe.
KNOX: That's why Germany and the Netherlands have ordered their poultry
farmers to keep their flocks indoors. Other European countries think that's
an over-reaction...for now.
To the uninitiated, it seems obvious that migratory birds picked it up from
backyard poultry in southern Asia and carried it north. But Lubroth says
the clues don't add up yet.
Lubroth: Dead birds don't fly. Sick birds probably don't fly either, since
they're weak and will not be able to migrate.We have to look at the healthy
birds, the ones that are not dying, to get a better understanding of where
the virus is and where the virus is not.
KNOX: That's just what William Karesh of the Wildlife Conservation Society
did a few weeks ago. His team studied wild birds -- alive and dead -- at a
lake in Mongolia remote from any poultry farms.
Karesh: We picked Mongolia because it was right in the middle of those 2
outbreaks, halfway in between, and we figured same birds are in Mongolia
that are in both Russia and China.
KNOX: Karesh's group counted 55 species of wild birds on the Mongolian
lake...about 65 000 individual birds.
Karesh: None of the healthy birds so far have turned up to be positive. The
live birds don't look like they're positive. It's only in one dead swan
that we actually found the virus.
Knox: That's only one out of a 100 dead birds. Mongolian researchers
identified the virus in 2 or 3 other bird carcasses.
That's enough to keep Karesh concerned.
Karesh: I've come back from this recognizing that truly wild birds have
been infected. And I think the source has probably been in domestic
chickens and ducks and now has been introduced into the wild bird populations.
Knox: But the striking thing is that the researchers didn't find the virus
in MORE dead birds. And -- so far -- in none of 750 apparently healthy
ducks, geese, swans and gulls. If migrating birds aren't infected with
H5N1, they can't shed the virus, as scientists say, and thus infect other
birds.
Karesh: Until we start to see that some of these birds are clearly shedding
the virus, I'm not sure how far it will get or if it'll just burn itself out.
Knox: To solve that mystery, scientists need answers to questions such
as...What species are susceptible? And...Can some wild birds be infected
without getting sick? That is the case with domestic ducks. And a recent
report in the Journal of Virology shows that the virus can infect mallards,
which can pass it on without getting sick themselves.
Keiji Fukuda of the World Health Organization says if researchers have
learned anything about H5N1, it's that anything is possible. Fukuda has
studied this virus since it first emerged in the late 1990s.
KEIJI FUKUDA: I'm hardly ever surprised by anything this virus can do. It's
really a pretty amazing virus. And so if it continues to expand its
geographic range, I'm not going to be surprised.
Knox: In the face of a potential flu pandemic, public health planners can't
afford to be surprised. Researchers say they urgently need at least 100 000
000 dollars to track this virus as it spreads and mutates. So far...they
don't have it.

As of 9 pm, 8 Sep 2005, 5460 blood samples arrived at the regional
veterinary laboratory for AI testing. 1956 samples came from poultry
plants, 73 account for synanthropic birds (pigeons), 2728 were from poultry
(chickens, ducks, geese), 694 from wild birds, 9 from the zoo (Seversk).
According to the Tomsk region administration press service, 5441 samples
tested negative for AI. Blood serum samples from wild ducks killed on 15
Aug 2005 in Verkhneketsky district were found to contain antibodies to the
H5 virus in the titre 1:32. The blood serum of 2 wild ducks from Orlovka,
Teguldetsky district contained antibodies to avian influenza H5 type in the
titre 1:16. The blood serum from a raven that came in 19 Aug 2005 from
Teguldet contained antibodies to AI type H5 in the titre 1:32. Antibodies
to AI H5 were found in titre 1:32 in blood serum taken from a wild duck
killed 22 Aug 2005 near the village of Druzhny, Verkhneketsky district.
Antibodies to AI H5 were found in titre 1:32 in blood serum from a wild
duck that arrived 28 Aug 2005 from Rodionovka, Kolpashevsky district.
Antibodies to AI H5 were found in titre 1:16 in a blood sample from the
island of Timyan, Krivosheinsky district. 11 more samples are being tested.
Based on the results received from the Novosibirsk interregional veterinary
laboratory genetic material of AI type H5 was found in 4 samples taken from
wild ducks that were delivered 30 Aug 2005 (Kolpashevsky, Verkhneketsky,
Krivosheinsky, Tomsky district).
No outbreaks or losses of poultry in the Tomsk region have been registered.

[It will be useful to obtain more information on the H5 virus strain
reportedly detected in Tomsk from wild ducks, as well as about the ducks'
clinical status. Was this an H5N1? If not, which serotype? If affirmative,
has it been compared to other Asian/Russian isolates?
A comprehensive review paper titled "Potential risk of HPAI spreading
through wild water bird migration", including maps, has been prepared by
FAO's avian influenza task force (Rome and Bangkok) and published in issue
No 33 of FAO-AIDE-NEWS update on the avian influenza situation, as of 1 Sep
2005. See <http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/documents/ai/AVIbull033.pdf>.
There seems to be no dispute about clinically unaffected aquatic birds,
both sedentary as well as migratory, being the reservoir of avian influenza
viruses (especially LPAI) that might mutate into HPAI when introduced into
susceptible populations of domestic poultry. As reflected in several
postings in this thread, including the above NPR program, there is an
ongoing debate about the role of migratory birds in the dissemination of
the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain which has been the causal agent of the
pandemic in southeastern and central Asia, and particularly about their
potential to spread the agent to other parts of the globe. The debate is
related to the observations about the potential of the said strain to
clinically affect -- and kill -- several species of migratory avians. All
parties seem to agree about the urgent need for enhanced virological
surveillance in healthy, free-roaming avians, within and outside the
affected areas. - Mod.AS]
