Two people are being treated after being potentially exposed to rabies in Coronaca in Greenwood County [South Carolina], according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control. One person and a dog were bitten by a fox that had made its way into a home on [Mon 11 Apr 2016]. Another person was attacked exiting a car about 1 mi [approx. 1.61 km] from the 1st attack, also on Monday.

The fox was sent to DHEC for testing and tested positive for rabies on [Tue 12 Apr 2016]. This is the 1st animal from Greenwood County to test positive for rabies in 2016. The total number of rabies cases in South Carolina this year [2016] is now 25.

DHEC is reminding people that all bites and scratches from wild animals need to be reported. Anyone between the Coronaca and the Saluda River who has been bitten or scratched by a fox should contact the Upstate Environmental Quality Control Office at 864-227-5915.
