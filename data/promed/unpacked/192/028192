A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee will vote Thursday
morning on whether the agency should relax rules on tallow and its
derivatives related to the threat of mad cow disease.
The panel will also determine if more rules are needed regarding gelatin
and the human brain covering, dura mater, which is sometimes transplanted
during surgery.
At its meeting Wednesday, the FDA's transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies advisory committee heard from industry representatives who
insisted tallow products are safe.
The committee explored tallow's uses and manufacturing processes as it
discussed the threat of bovine spongiform encephalopathies, commonly called
mad cow disease, in light of European outbreaks of the disease.
Tallow is made from cooked animal remains including bones, hides and
muscles taken from places like slaughterhouses, restaurants and butchers.
The remains are cooked and the resulting oily substance is used in
thousands of products. The FDA panel is only concerned with its use in
foods, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Tallow and its derivatives can be
found in contact lenses, lipstick, lotion, soap, cooking oil, capsules and
tablets.
Dr. John Bailey, director of the FDA's office of cosmetics and colors,
asked the panel to "assess the safety of imported and domestic tallow and
tallow derivatives."
Dr. David Taylor, a representative from Scotland's Institute for Animal
Health, said there have been 167,336 confirmed cases of mad cow disease in
Great Britain.
According to industry representatives, edible tallow doesn't contain heads,
eyes or spinal cords, which are considered infectious materials.
Mitch Kilanowski, of Darling International Inc. (DAR), an Irving, Texas,
re cycler of food processing by-products, spoke to the committee about the
market for tallow.
He said 1.45 billion pounds of edible tallow are produced each year in the
U.S. Almost 6.5 billion pounds of inedible tallow are produced.
"Tallow to us is the building block used to make many products," said Dr.
Charles R. Green, a director in the Soap and Detergent Association. Dr.
Philip Merrell of Mallinckrodt Chemical said virtually every solid drug
used contains magnesium stearate, a tallow derivative. Mallinckrodt
Chemical, a unit of Mallinckrodt Inc. (MKG), is the largest supplier of
magnesium stearate.
"In pharmaceuticals, 1.5 million to 2 million pounds of magnesium stearate
are used annually," Merrell said.
Stan P. Gorak, of ICI Americas, spoke about the manufacturing process for
polysorbates, another tallow derivative.
Although polysorbates can be made from vegetable sources, tallow is widely
used because it is less expensive and more readily available, Gorak said.
Dennis Walker, of Proctor & Gamble Co., said "in our estimation tallow
contains no discernable risk of (mad cow) infectivity."
