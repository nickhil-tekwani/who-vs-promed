Food poisoning hits island
------------------------
A serious salmonella outbreak, which has spread across England and Northern
Ireland, has hit the Isle of Man. "There has been a sharp increase in the
number of notifications of cases of food poisoning in the Island," said Dr.
Parameswaran Kishore, public health consultant. "On investigating this, it
has become clear that the cases in the Isle of Man are a part of a much
larger outbreak occurring across England and Northern Ireland."
"The specific organism responsible for the outbreak is Salmonella Newport.
The outbreak seems to have started in north east Lincolnshire and has
affected the West Midlands, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man. The
investigation of the likely source is being coordinated from London," Dr.
Kishore added.
More than 100 people have been affected by the outbreak so far, the
majority of cases coming in the 20 to 40 age bracket.
Dr. Kishore said no definite source had been identified, but Salmonella
Newport can be present in a large number of foods. "As far as the Island is
concerned, it is clear that the food product causing the outbreak is likely
to have come from abroad rather than one produced locally," he said.

Race to trace bug outbreak
------------------------
Worried health experts are racing to find the source of fresh salmonella
outbreaks sweeping Ulster. Sunday Life can reveal that officials from the
Department of Health are probing the causes of up to 70 new cases of the
infection.
The cases have been reported in Belfast, Dungannon, Limavady, and a number
of other towns across the province. This latest development comes after the
Eastern Health Board confirmed, earlier in September 2004, that it was
continuing to monitor an increase in the number of cases of salmonella in
its area. The Northern Ireland Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, in
conjunction with 4 health boards, is also looking into the source of the
outbreak. They say there is no firm evidence of the cause but are urging
people to ensure salad vegetables are washed.
Sunday Life revealed, in July 2004, that health experts were probing a new
line of inquiry into the outbreak of salmonella in Downpatrick, which
affected more than 100 people.
A senior Department of Health source said the fresh outbreaks of salmonella
were causing "serious concern". Said the source: "Investigators are working
around the clock to find the origins of these latest outbreaks. It's hard
enough trying to find the origins of salmonella in one town, and the
experts are really up against it, because they have launched investigations
in a number of areas. They want to find the source of the food poisoning as
soon as possible, because the last thing they need is more cases being
reported. The officials are determined to find where the salmonella is
coming from, but their investigations will take time. The only thing they
can do now is hope and pray that no one else is struck down."
A spokesman for the Eastern Health and Social Services Board confirmed new
cases of salmonella were being probed in different parts of Northern
Ireland. Added the spokesman: "Investigations into an ongoing outbreak of
salmonella infection are continuing, with 24 further cases of illness
reported across Northern Ireland since last week [4th week of September
2004]. Similar circumstances prevailing in some parts of England have
already prompted public health teams working here to join a national
investigation that is seeking a common source of the infection."

[Despite the increasing number of cases and the geographic spread of
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Newport (_S._ Newport), there is no report
indicating the vehicle of the outbreak. Initial reports mentioned "take
away" (take out) food, but, so far, the vehicle(s) of the spread, and the
origin of the food, are unclear. - Mod.LL]
