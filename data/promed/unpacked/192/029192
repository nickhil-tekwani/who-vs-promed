MalaysiaÂ´s Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the Hendra-like virus
that has been confirmed by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) will be given top priority in terms of prevention,
control and treatment.
"But we have to be very clear as we approach this problem that there are
two problems. Now the main problem to our mind is the Hendra-related virus.
At the same time, we must not forget the preventive and control measures
for JE," he said today. Two sets of procedures must be maintained to check
the viral outbreak, said Chua, a member of the task force.
"We do not know much at this moment about the Hendra-related virus. In
terms of public health, in terms of preventing people from getting
infected, we assume the worst-case scenario," he told reporters.
The task force has accepted the five Taiwanese experts' recommendations
that detergents be spread all over the pig pens in Bukit Pelanduk, Sungai
Nipah, Kampung Sawah and Sepang.
"Workers must wash their clothes with detergent, they must wash their
hands, bathe themselves with soap... cleanliness is very important because
the CDC has confirmed that this virus is killed by soap and detergent," he
said.
He said intensive publicity had been given on the steps to control JE and
the same was being done for the Hendra-like virus.
