The fact that the folks in Michigan were wondering if the deer were dying from
CWD or EEE should not cause them to stop with just the isolation of EEEV. Was
CWD totally ruled out?
The reason I bring this up is because in 1969, there were a number of deaths
among woodland caribou on a commercial game reserve in northern Wisconsin.
While we recovered a Bunyamwera group virus (subsequently identified by
Charlie Calisher as Tensaw virus), the cause of the mortality proved to be
meningeal worms, _Pneumostrongylus tenuis_.

[Dr Hoff is correct that the fact that a particular disease agent has been
isolated from a case does not necessarily mean that it was the cause of the
current illness. Double infections are known to occur. - Mod.JW]
