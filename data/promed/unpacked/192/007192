Karnal bunt -- a minor disease of wheat with major trade implications
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Although Karnal bunt is recognized in most wheat trading nations where it
occurs as being a minor disease of wheat, its presence has very important
economic consequences. The vast majority of costs incurred are caused by
trade restrictions, disease surveillance, disinfestations of equipment, and
other quarantine measures to prevent spread and to meet the requirements of
wheat grain importing countries.

Karnal bunt has only been reported to have established in arid- and
semi-arid environments with hot summers. Not all wheat producing parts of
India and Mexico are affected despite many years of undoubted teliospore
movements within these countries. Bulk seed consignments from infested
areas of Mexico were sent to Europe for sowing without quarantine
precautions in the 1970s and early 1980s without disease establishment. The
evidence for _Tilletia indica_ being restricted to certain climatic niches
is compelling.

More research is needed to find minimum teliospore threshold levels and
sporidial concentrations necessary to establish the disease so that risks
to Karnal bunt-free regions, especially Europe, can be more accurately defined.

[Quarantine risk assessment for crop diseases is not a straightforward task
due to the complexity of biological and environmental systems involved in
pathogen epidemiology. Difficulties are often compounded by the absence of
factual data as is illustrated by the controversy about Karnal bunt. In
many cases, biosecurity decisions lead to disagreements between producers
and importers of commodities (see, for example, ProMED-mail post
20070625.2046).

A pathogen introduced into a new environment may profit from the absence of
competing organisms or parasites, lack of genetic resistance in local
hosts, new available hosts, or favourable environmental factors. It is
sensible to err on the side of caution and take the long term view of
protecting the importer's primary industries. Once a pathogen has been
introduced into a new area, eradication attempts are very rarely successful
and costs due to the incursion may be enormous.

We would like to thank Dr Jones for this informative contribution.
