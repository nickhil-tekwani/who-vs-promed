[1] Cholera - Mali (Gao Region)

Since Mon 2 Jul 2012, 32 cases of cholera have been identified in the village of Wabaria, situated along the Niger River near Gao in northern Mali. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) stepped in immediately with support for a treatment center set up on the spot by the health authorities to prevent the disease from spreading. 2 people have already died from the cholera, but the situation now appears to be under control.

"On Wed 4 Jul 2012, we identified 7 new cases of cholera in the village, half as many as the day before, and no new deaths," said Annick Hamel, the ICRC's medical coordinator for Mali and Niger. "This is a positive development, but the population needs to remain vigilant and adhere to recommended hygiene measures."

The ICRC provided the treatment centre with intravenous fluids, oral rehydration salts, doxycycline, other medications and medical supplies, bottled water, hygiene products, and sanitizers. It is now considering the possibility of providing the center with greater quantities of clean drinking water and with chlorine, and of restoring a pump in the village to working order.

The ICRC is monitoring information concerning any new cases of cholera occurring elsewhere in Mali or in neighboring Niger.

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Bududa District)
Date: Mon 2 Jul 2012

An outbreak of cholera has hit Bunakasala parish in Bulucheke sub-county in Bududa district, spelling double tragedy to the area that was struck by landslides last week [week of 25 Jun 2012].

Betty Mukyala, the Bududa acting district health officer disclosed in an interview on Sunday [1 Jul 2012] that 3 cholera patients from Bunakasala parish were admitted to Bushika Health Centre for treatment. Mukyala attributed the outbreak to the inadequacy of safe water points in the parish located along the steep slopes of Mt Elgon.

"Bunakasala parish had one spring well serving multitudes of people in the area. This well, however, was buried when landslides struck the area on 25 Jun 2012. As such, many residents are left with no option but to fetch surface water from contaminated streams that crisscross the parish for consumption and domestic use," Mukyala said.

Bududa district, like its neighbors Mbale and Pallisa, has been grappling with the cholera epidemic since February 2012. The disease has killed 8 people with a cumulative figure of 197 cases. Whereas the safe water coverage in the district is at 62 percent, the figure is a dismal 40 percent in Bulucheke sub-county.

Stephen Womukota, the eastern regional disaster management officer for the Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS), said they had sunk 5 pit latrines in Bunakasala parish to step up the sanitation in the area and check the spread of cholera. He added that URCS also distributed water purification tablets among residents in the parish.

[4] Cholera - Uganda (Kisoro District, Congo DR border)
Date: Mon 2 July 2012

A cholera outbreak has been reported at Karambo near Bunagana border post and Busanza border line at Uganda's border with DR Congo, Kisoro District Health Officer Dr Steven Nsabiyunva has said.

The outbreak comes at the peak of the influx of refugees from DR Congo to Uganda. Speaking to the New Vision at his office on Fri 29 Jun 2012, Dr Nsabiyunva said the district health team was considering making a quarantine to protect refugees already at Nyakabande refugee reception center and the district population at large.

He urged health officials at Nyakabande to ensure proper use of mobile toilets and to emphasize hand washing. "We are considering isolating new comers as one way of controlling spread of the disease and protecting the district population.

In February 2012, an outbreak of dysentery hit the camp and has reportedly lingered on due to poor disposal of excreta. "Saucepans are used for bathing and washing clothes while basins are used for serving food" said a source at the refugee center who preferred anonymity.

[5] Cholera - India (Banaskantha district, Gujarat State)
Date: Thu 5 Jul 2012

http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_5-die-of-cholera-in-dhanera-200-ill_1711081


5 people have died of cholera in the last 3-4 days in Dhanera town of Banaskantha district while nearly 200 others have taken ill with diarrhea-like symptoms. The district administration, however, says only one person has died of cholera.

The district collector on Wed 4 Jul 2012, declared Dhanera, a town of around 25 000 people, as cholera-affected. JB Vora, district collector, Banaskantha, was in Dhanera on 4 Jul 2012. He said nearly 200 cases of diarrhea had been reported in the town over the last 3-4 days.

"Some samples from patients were sent to BJ Medical College in Ahmedabad for testing. As one patient had tested positive for cholera, we have notified Dhanera as a cholera-affected town," Vora said.

Talking about the possible reasons for the outbreak of the disease, chief district health officer Dr AH Acharya said that water contamination was the most likely reason.

"But how the water got contaminated is being looked into by teams from Dhanera municipality. Currently, there are 18 indoor patients. The rest were given primary treatment and then under observation for some time. They were then discharged," Acharya said.

[6] Cholera - India (Ahmedabad, Gujarat State)

http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_45-cases-of-cholera-in-ahmedabad-since-january_1709968


In the month of June 2012 alone, 25 cases of cholera were registered in various hospitals of the city of Ahmedabad, taking the total number of cases to 45 since January 2012. It should be noted that in 2011, 57 cases of cholera were reported in the entire year, whereas 45 cases have already been recorded in 6 months of the new year. Also, the officials of AMC's health department believe that the numbers will rise further. They say that the situation, though not alarming now, as the cases of cholera are coming from scattered vicinities and not from any concentrated areas, yet the civic body is taking adequate precautions so that things don't get out of hand, said IK Patel, deputy municipal commissioner of AMC's health department.
