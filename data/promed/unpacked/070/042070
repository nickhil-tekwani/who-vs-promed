I wish to point out errors in the recent posting on community MRSA in
Australia. As presented at the ICID meeting in Cancun, Mexico, there are a
considerable number of community MRSA strains circulating in Australia.
These are truly community strains (they are sensitive to most
non-betalactam antibiotics). They were 1st described in 1986 as originating
from remote Western Australian settlements.
By MLST/SCCmec typing, there are currently 18 different (unrelated)
community MRSA clones throughout Australia, only a limited number of which
are PVL positive. The infection reported at ASID, and, subsequently, in the
Australian Newspaper, represents only one of these clones.
In Western Australia, most MRSA isolates are non-multiresistant and
originate in the community. Epidemic MRSA is not endemic in any of the
state's hospitals unlike the hospitals in Eastern Australia.

I would like to add that Eastern Australia sees different community MRSA
than does Western Australia. However, they are all non-multiresistant.
Initially, these strains were the Western Samoan types, which appear to
have been imported from the Pacific Islands to NZ and then Australia (as
pointed out in the Collignon Lancet letter). More recently, the Queensland
clone has emerged (the Ipswich strain).
