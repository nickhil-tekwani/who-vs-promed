Avian Flu Alert in 29 Thailand Provinces
----------------------------------------
The Thailand red sanitary alert extended to 29 provinces due to the
appearance of avian flu cases in those territories, reported the
Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Sudarat Keyuraphan.

A 17-year-old boy and a young man of 27 died from the H5N1 virus over
the last 2 weeks, while dozens of patients with similar symptoms were
declared in quarantine and submitted to strict clinical observation.

Provinces declared under "high avian flu risk" are: Bangkok, Sing
Buri, Angthong, Ayutthaya, Nonthaburi, Suphan Buri, Chai Nat, Pathum
Thani, Lop Buri, Chachoengsao, Nakhon Nayok, Nakhon Phanom, Kalasin,
Khon Kaen, Phichit, Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan & Chaiyaphum.

Also on the red list are Nakhon Phatom, Phitsanulok, Udon Thani,
Kanchanaburi, Samut Prakan, Nakhon Ratchasima, Prachin Buri,
Phetchabun, Uttaradit, Sukhothai & Uthai Thani. [It would be
helpful to note what "red sanitary alert" stands for; see
commentary]. A 27-year-old patient died on Thursday [3 Aug 2006] in
this last province.

Thailand was one of the countries worst hit by avian flu in 2004,
when the virus seriously affected several Asian countries, including
China and Viet Nam.

Up to now, official sources have confirmed 24 [human] cases, of which 16 were
fatal. The Thai food industry has reported losses in the 2nd quarter of the
present year [2006] due to a fall in prices and a drop in poultry sales due to
the scare generated by the fever.

200 more chickens die after Uthai Thani bird flu death
-----------------------------------------------
Some 200 chickens at an Uthai Thani farm died Sunday [6 Aug 2006],
only 3 days after Thailand's 2nd H5N1 victim in 10 days died from
exposure to the deadly virus in the same province, Agriculture and
Cooperatives Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan said Sunday [6 Aug 2006].

Mrs. Sudarat said Livestock Development Department officials on
Thursday [3 Aug 2006] night had culled 116 chickens raised at 12
family farms in Sawang Arom district near the victim's home.

Small-scale farmers in the neighborhood of the latest avian influenza
victim -- who died Thursday [3 Aug 2006] after having contact with
sick chickens -- had their flocks culled.

The agriculture minister said some 200 chickens out of 20 000 raised
on farms in Uthai Thani's provincial capital district died Sunday [6
Aug 2006] and that government workers will cull the rest of the
poultry without waiting for laboratory tests, as the situation could
worsen.

Officials will launch a week-long campaign Monday [7 Aug 2006] to
eradicate the virus in 29 provinces thought to be more at risk from
bird flu. The activities will include registration of all poultry,
she said.

The ministry has asked each district to establish a team of 20
officials to be responsible for destroying sick chickens.

Thailand is among the countries hardest hit by the deadly H5N1 virus,
having recorded 24 human cases (including 16 fatalities) since the
outbreak in 2004.

[Since 24 Jul 2006, when H5N1 was officially reported to have
reappeared in Thailand, the Thai authorities notified 2 distinct
outbreaks: on 16 Jul 2006 in the province Pichitr (BangMulnarg
district), and on 24 Jul 2006 in the province Nakhon Phanom (Muang
district); see references 20060731.2113 and 20060805.2167.

Uthai Thani seems to have now joined the list; unfortunately, again,
a human patient was the sentinel. This province can be found as No.
16 in the list of Thailand's northern provinces, at the website
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand>.

From the above newswires, one might get the impression that the
disease is currently widely spread throughout Thailand: "appearance
of avian flu cases in 29 provinces"?!

Firsthand clarification will help. - Mod.AS]
