Health officials in Cyprus remain on alert after cases of avian flu have been detected on the island, where 2 private farm owners are self-monitoring and about 1000 birds are to be killed out of an abundance of caution.

According to the state's Veterinary Department, bird flu cases have been detected at 2 private waterfowl collections in Paralimni, Famagusta district.

The specific strain of influenza has been detected in birds but no humans were known to have been infected, according to Health Ministry spokesperson Constantinos Athanasiou.

The spokesperson told Kathimerini Cyprus on Tuesday [22 Nov 2022] that the owners at the 2 locations have been told to self-monitor out of an abundance of caution, adding that so far they had not shown any symptoms.

In an earlier version of this article, Kathimerini Cyprus stated that human cases of bird flu had been confirmed in Cyprus [see archive 20221204.8707084]. The newspaper now points out that no human cases have been detected.
