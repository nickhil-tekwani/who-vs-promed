Farmers count losses after banana disease ravages crop
------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Kakamega County [Western Province] have suffered losses running into millions of shillings following the outbreak of the deadly Panama disease. The infectious disease has ravaged the crop in the region, especially Kakamega Central and Kakamega North.

The sweet banana is the most affected variety of the fruit and this has led to its scarcity in the market. Small-scale farmers in the area have appealed to the Government to intervene and save them from further losses. According to some farmers, the Cavendish is now preferred by farmers who are uprooting the [other varieties of] sweet banana.

Joash Owino, Kenya Agricultural Research Institute, urged farmers to try out other varieties besides Cavendish. He warned that bacterial infections [banana bacterial wilt, see comments below] affecting all banana varieties could still manifest the same symptoms as Panama.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish varieties, which include most of the commercial eating bananas, are attacked by temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510).

It is not clear from the report above which fungal strain is causing the problems. It is also unclear which "sweet banana" (as opposed to cooking banana) cultivars are being affected by this outbreak, and whether they include the newly planted Cavendish varieties.

The bacterial infection mentioned above refers to banana bacterial wilt, which is rife in the region. In central Africa, it is caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ (BXW; see links below). It affects all banana types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit.
