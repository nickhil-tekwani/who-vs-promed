At least 63 people out of a cumulative total of 1607 confirmed new
cases have died of meningitis in the West Nile region since the
epidemic broke out in mid-December 2006. A total of 1534 cases have
since been successfully treated.
Addressing journalists in Kampala yesterday, 8 Feb 2007, health
minister Stephen Mallinga said the epidemic was, however, on the
decline following mass vaccination campaigns against the disease. He
said a "significant decline" had been registered in the Koboko and
Arua districts, and also in the Kotido district in Karamoja, where
the epidemic was 1st reported before it spread to the West Nile
region. However, Adjumani and Yumbe still experienced sporadic cases.

[Primorskiy means "maritime" in Russian, hence the region is
sometimes referred to as Maritime Province. It is located at the
southern extreme of the Russian Far East, bordering China, North
Korea, and Khabarovsk Krai, and is separated from Japan by the Sea of
Japan. It can be seen on a map of Russia at:

Two Armenian women, aged 25 and 49, died in the Tyumen regional
Infectious Diseases hospital. Both patients had meningococcemia.
Michael Orlov, the head of the medical center, informed
Uralinformburo that only 7 Tyumen residents with meningococcal
disease were admitted during January 2007, of which 5 survived. Orlov
said that epidemiological data on meningococcal disease is far below
the annual average morbidity and that an outbreak cannot be declared.
