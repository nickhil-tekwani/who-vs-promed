Luis Suarez, chairman of the Directorate for Epidemiology at Peru's
Ministry of Health, called on the Peruvian population to remain calm
and discounted claims that the latest occurrences of bartonellosis,
also known as Peruvian wart or Carrion's disease, has reached
epidemic proportions.
Suarez stated that the sandfly responsible for the infections does
not exist in the capital of Lima and that the disease cannot be
transmitted from one person to another. He gave assurances that if
the necessary sanitary precautions are taken seriously, spreading of
the disease will be prevented.
He explained that bartonellosis is an endemic disease that stems from
the pre- Inca era and that since 1998, individual infections have
increased in some parts of Peru. The last time the Health Ministry
declared an epidemic was in 2004, after more than 7000 cases were treated.
Suarez emphasized that so far this year [2006], 4200 cases have been
registered. Unfortunately, he said, a vaccine against infection does
not exist, but effective individual treatment can avoid fatal consequences.
He also said that the transmitting insect does not bite before
sundown, and the typical symptoms do not appear until weeks after the
incubation period, which can be up to 2 months.

Initial report: Bartonellosis outbreak, Collo Locality, Arahuay
Distric, Canta Province, DISA Lima North, 2006
----------------------
Current situation:
On 12 Sep 2006, the Epidemiology Unit of the Lima North DISA,
reported 10 cases of bartenellosis coming from the Collo locality in
the Arahuay District in the Canta Province.
The Collo locality is located 80 kilometers and 2 hours by car from
the city of Lima, located at approximately 2000 meters above sea
level and has various annexes, such as Oropel, Archu, Licahuasi,
Shimay, located on the shores of the Rio Grande. The population is
dedicated to cattle ranching, cultivation of fruits and grains for
bread productions. People tend to work on small farms, and children
tend to work the fields after school is out.
The Arahuay district is in one of the Leishmaniasis endemic zones of
the country and each year reports cases [of leishmaniasis]; in 2003
there were 11 cases reported, in 2004, there were 12 cases reported
and in 2005 there were 8 cases reported. No cases of bartonellosis
had been reported from this zone in the past.
The 1st case, in a 7 year-old girl, resident of the Orobel caserio
[small cluster of houses, small villages] in Arahuay District, at a
distance of approximately 10 kilometers from Collo, with date of
onset of symptoms on 10 Apr 2006, had the appearance of a verruga
[wart] on her right arm, was treated with doxacillin for 7 days
without good result.
Treatment of 10 persons, 70 percent of which were children less than
10 years of age was done.
The majority of the cases had presented between epidemiologic weeks
19 to 26, and were distributed geographically in different localities
and caserios from each other. Specimens were obtained from 10
patients, of which 10 were negatie for bartonella, 3 were positive
for rickettsias and are presently being studied for leptospirosis.
Activities conducted by the DIRESA [District health unit]
- Notification and Investigation of cases
- Household visits to cases and active search for additional cases
- Coordination with Health Facilty staff and Zonal authorities, the
Cayetano Heredia Hospital [terciary hospital in Lima] for laboratory
results and referrals
Commentaries:
10 probable cases of bartonellosis presented of which one case was
confirmed by the laboratory as "Verruga Peruana" [Peruvian wart], in
a zone endemic for leishmaniasis, and is considered as the first
outbreak of bartonellosis in the Rio Grande Valley - Arahuay. The
identification of additional cases in the area is highly likely as
they do not tend to come to the attention of the health sector.

[It does appear as though bartonellosis has been increasing its
geographic expansion in Peru, and there is a concern that it is now
reaching areas that have become weekend and day trip localities for
Lima residents. In an earlier posting there was mention of it being
diagnosed in an individual who just day-tripped to an area
approximately 2 hours from Lima. More information from knowledgeable
individuals in Peru would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

"Outbreaks near sea level in Huaral, and Ica [1,8] ... occurred
during the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon of
1997-1998. Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated that the
Carrion's Disease outbreaks that occurred in Ancash and Cusco were
related to climatic factors, mainly the ENSO [36]."
