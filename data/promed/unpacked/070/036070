An immediate mass vaccination of 300,000 people and 500,000 pigs has been
ordered by the Malaysian government in order to halt the spread of Japanese
encephalitis [JE. The epidemic has killed 34 people since October.
The government will pay for the vaccinations which will cover about 30,000
pig farmers, their families and workers, as well as another 262,500
children under the age of 15 years living within two kilometres of a
piggery. The government's decision follows a public outcry over the
mounting deaths of mostly pig farmers and farm hands from JE virus, which
is spread from an infected pig to humans [via mosquitoes - Mod.CHC. Health
authorities blame unhygienic pig farms with stagnant pools for allowing the
_Culex_ sp. mosquito, which transmits the virus, to breed unchecked.
The government also ordered weekly sprayings of pig farms in infected areas
to kill the mosquitoes, and directed police and the civilian guard to
enforce a ruling banning the illegal transfer of pigs except to licensed
abattoirs.
Chief Secretary to the government, Abdul Halim Ali, said health
authorities decided to vaccinate young children first as they were the most
susceptible to the virus.
Malaysia will import more doses of the vaccine from Taiwan and Japan, which
have expertise in combating the virus. [From other reports: the Malaysia
pork industry has summoned experts of JE from Taiwan to assist in
controlling the disease in pigs.
So far 3,500 pigs have been slaughtered after they were found infected with
the virus. Another 4,000 are also due to be killed as they were abandoned
by frightened farmers. A public awareness campaign of the virus and its
prevention will also be aired on television and radio to allay fears that
the disease was spread through the consumption of pork.
The issue is politically sensitive in Moslem Malaysia, as almost all pig
breeders are Chinese Buddhists. Pork, which is considered unclean to touch
or to eat by Moslems, is sold in separate sections at supermarkets. Most
restaurants and hotels in Malaysia are pork-free.

The Cabinet today directed immediate vaccination to be conducted on
residents and hogs in areas confirmed to be infected by the JE virus, Chief
Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Abdul Halim Ali said. He said RM35.5
million had been allocated for the vaccination exercise, one of five
immediate measures taken by the Cabinet to deal with outbreak of the
disease. [The number of fatal cases now stands at 30.- Mod.CYC
Some 500,000 pigs in Ipoh, Bukit Pelandok (Port Dickson) and
Seremban-Sikamat would be immediately vaccinated at a cost of RM7.5
million, he told a news conference here [Kuala Lumpur. He said that the
vaccination would be conducted by the Veterinary Services Department, which
will provide the vaccine and logistics.
Abdul Halim said residents in the affected areas had been divided into two
groups for the exercise. The first group comprises some 30,000 pig farmers,
their workers and family members at affected farms, and the second some
262,500 residents aged between one year and 15 years who are staying within
a two-kilometre radius of the affected farms. [The flight range of the
vector _Culex_ mosquito is believed to be two kilometres. - Mod.CYC The
vaccination for these two groups is to cost RM28 million.
Abdul Halim said local authorities had been instructed to fog the affected
areas once a week for at least the next four weeks. The Cabinet had also
banned the movement of pigs except to abattoirs, and the police and Rela
[? would be asked to help enforce this, he said. Abdul Halim said the
Information Ministry was required to disseminate information on ways to
control and prevent the spread of the disease. The radio and television
will also be used to inform the public that the disease is spread by
mosquitoes and not by eating pork. On the destruction of pigs at farms in
affected areas, he said the Cabinet decided not to give any compensation.

[Although we know the number of "fatal cases", we have yet to hear how many
have been confirmed as having been due to JE virus infection. I would hate
to think that all these efforts, all this money, and all this time is being
spent on JE virus eradication when the epidemic is either of mixed etiology
or principally due to something other than JE virus. I suppose we will
know soon. - Mod.CHC
