More than 1000 animals have died following the outbreak of anthrax in Arua district. The disease has also claimed 2 people, according to the district veterinary officer, Dr Willy Nguma.

The blood tests carried out by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) in Entebbe have confirmed the outbreak of the disease although the Minister of Health, Dr Ruth Aceng, recently downplayed its presence in Arua and Kween districts. According to reports from the district, the 1st outbreak was reported in December 2016 and confirmed in March 2017, after blood samples were tested by UVRI.

Speaking to Daily Monitor on [Mon 10 Sep 2018], Dr Nguma said: "We have confirmed from the laboratory tests the presence of anthrax. So far, we have 28 people infected and we have recorded 2 deaths. [19 people were infected in April 2018 following the outbreak of the disease in Arua district.] If the ministry still believes there is no anthrax despite the positive results from the central laboratory from Ministry of Agriculture, then this is contradictory. There shouldn't be denial game in this because economic and social lives of people are being affected."

Statistics
----------
The statistics from the district indicate that so far 1087 animals have died following the outbreak. Rigbo, Rhino Camp, Uriama, Odupi, Imvepi, and Pawor sub-counties are the most affected. "We have tried to mobilise farmers to buy their own vaccines, but they are not willing to do that. So long as the animals are not vaccinated and carcasses are being eaten, the outbreak cannot end," he said.

The people of Arua depend on animals for economic livelihood because they sell off the animals to enable them pay school fees for their children and to fend for their families. Farmers are worried that if they continue losing their herd, they will not be in position to look after their families. The district had requested government to supply vaccines to contain the outbreak, but none has been released.

This was after the chief administrative officer endorsed a report to the various ministries but there has been no response. The district health officer, Dr Patrick Anguzu, said: "We have some drugs that can help in treating the human beings who are infected. We are sitting on a time bomb. We have been liaising with the World Health Organisation and veterinary department. We have developed strategic plans but at the moment we do not have funding to do extensive sensitisation and vaccination." He suggested that the best way to end anthrax is through vaccination and that the district has proposed that the farmers form groups to have their animals vaccinated.

For one animal to be vaccinated, a farmer has to spend Shs 2000 [about USD 0.53] to purchase the vaccines.

The MP for Lower Madi, Mr Ismail Ogama, said: "I will have to approach the relevant ministries on this because we cannot continue losing lives of people and animals. The district should give us more documents so that I can present them on the floor of Parliament."

[With over 1000 animals dead they have a national emergency on their hands. And the only way out is the immediate vaccination of the livestock at risk. For maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness it should be overseen by the government veterinary service. One should not be waiting for individual farmers responding and procrastinating. Also, there will have been severe soil contamination from the dead and butchered animals leading to risk of outbreaks in the next few years. Thus, they are looking at compulsory annual vaccination for the next 3-5 years unless they want repeat outbreaks in the affected Arua and Kween districts. USD 0.53 per dose is about standard for Sterne vaccine. It may not seem much but in areas of rural poverty it can be prohibitive.

The use of cattle for economic purposes is common globally. They are not raised to be eaten on the farm. They are raised to be sold when money is needed, such as for house and roof repairs, school fees, etc. For meat they will depend on goats. By sharing a goat carcass with friends, relatives, and neighbors it assures a regular supply of goat meat on the family table. And this is why a dead cow will be butchered and eaten.
