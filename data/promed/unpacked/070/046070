meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.

[A 26 Jul 2007 Associated Press release [edited] printed in the 27
International Herald Tribune
(<http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/26/america/NA-GEN-US-West-Nile-Season.php>
indicated that "America is on pace to have its worst West Nile virus
season in years, federal health officials said Thursday [26 Jul 2007]."
"So far this year, there have been nearly 4 times as many cases
reported as there were at the same time last year [2006]. However,
cool weather in August or September -- when the bulk of West Nile
cases usually occur -- could take the sting out of the season,"
officials added.
"If this trend continues like this, it's going to be a very high,"
said Dr. Lyle Petersen of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"At least 177 people died from West Nile in 2006 out of 4269 cases;
264 people died out of nearly 10 000 cases in 2003."
The numbers of West Nile virus cases cited in the original article
(not shown) are considerably lower than the most recent case numbers
cited in the CDC update above. The situation may be even more serious
than this article indicated. - Mod.TY]
