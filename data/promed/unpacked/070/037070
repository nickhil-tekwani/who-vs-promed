On 13 Nov 2018, a previously healthy 57-year-old man presented to the outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease (STIDH) [Kathmandu, Nepal], with a history of sudden onset of high-grade fever, headache, fatigue, sensation of tingling, pricking, and burning over arms, and enlarged right inguinal lymph node. These signs and symptoms developed approximately 2 weeks after a tick bite on his right buttock. A red patch [had] developed that gradually expanded with central darkening, hemorrhage, and necrosis. The patient is being treated with the antibiotic doxycycline for suspected a Lyme disease (lab test is not available in Nepal) and showing that his fever and skin findings are gradually improved. Patients presenting with similar signs and symptoms after tick bites have increased unexpectedly over the past few months in Nepal. All patients responded well to treatment with doxycycline. Among tick bite illnesses, Lyme disease is considered as a serious but still neglected or unrecognized systematic disease, which may still go unnoticed in Nepal. Lyme disease was first reported in 2018 in Nepal [1].

[Dr Pun is thanked for sending in this report.

As many as 80 percent of patients develop erythema migrans, the characteristic feature of early Lyme disease, an expanding round or oval skin lesion, at least 5 cm [2 inches] in size, occurring at the site of the tick bite, that is either entirely red or has a central clearing or a distinctive target-like appearance, from which _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the cause of Lyme disease, can be isolated in culture or detected by PCR. Erythema migrans may go unrecognized by the patient if it is located on a site not readily seen by the patient. The skin lesion may have a purpuric center, but vesicles, bulla formation, or necrosis at the center are unusual (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153519/ and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26498075). The skin lesion in Dr Pun's patient reported above may represent this more unusual form of erythema migrans.

Associated symptoms are nonspecific and include fatigue, the most common symptom, fever, which is usually low-grade, headache, neck stiffness, arthralgias, and myalgias. Regional lymphadenopathy is found on physical examination in about one fourth of patients (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/41/7/958/309317).

Dr Pun's patient reported above, as did the previous patient that he reported in ProMED-mail post Tick-bite fever - Nepal: (DO) eschar, hard-bodied tick 20170417.4976181 had a history of high-grade fever. High-grade fever would suggest co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/9/1089/422463).

We are not told what type of tick bit the patient above, but presumably it was a hard-bodied, _Ixodes_ species like the tick that bit the previously reported Nepalese patient, in which case these ticks could possibly transmit pathogens in addition to _B. burgdorferi_ that could cause the high-grade fever in the patient above. These co-infecting pathogens, include _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, and Powassan virus, the cause of Powassan virus encephalitis. Clinical improvement on doxycycline suggests either spontaneous recovery or a bacterial pathogen, such as _B. miyamotoi_, susceptible to this drug. What is sorely needed, however, is the ability to make a microbial diagnosis. - Mod.ML
