COVID-19 variants of concern (VOCs), especially the delta (B1617.2) variant, are more virulent than the wild type, according to an Ontario-based study published in CMAJ [Canadian Medical Association Journal] yesterday [4 Oct 2021] (https://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2021/10/04/cmaj.211248). The cohort included 212 326 cases of non-VOCs (22.4%) and VOCs with the N501Y mutation (76.7%), such as alpha (B117), beta (B1351), gamma (P1), and delta.

The researchers found that those infected with VOCs had a 52% increased risk of hospitalization (95% confidence interval [CI], 42%-63%), 89% increased risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (CI, 67%-117%), and a 51% increased risk of death (CI, 30%-78%). The delta variant, although only 2.8% of the sample size, was associated with a 108% increased risk of infection (CI, 78%-140%), a 235% increased risk of ICU admission (CI, 160%-331%), and a 133% higher risk of death (CI, 54%-231%). Data also indicated that those infected by VOCs were significantly younger and less likely to have comorbidities than those infected with the wild-type virus.

"Canada is battling a different pandemic from the one it faced in early 2020," writes Kirsten Patrick, in a related editorial (https://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2021/10/04/cmaj.211656). "The virus has become smarter and more dangerous, which means that we need to be smarter too. Canada's governments can keep people safe by enacting policies that wisely combine all the measures that have been shown to be effective."

Both Patrick and the researchers highlight the usefulness of the COVID-19 vaccines, with the researchers adding, "The effects reported here represent a substantial degree of protection against death conferred by vaccines (about 80%-90%), even when they fail to prevent infection. Such direct protective effects may help reduce the health impacts of ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ontario, even if herd immunity proves elusive, given the high reproduction numbers of VOCs."

The study included COVID-19 tests that took place 7 Feb to 26 Jun [2021]. During that time, delta was first detected in Canada in April, and by July, it was the predominant strain.

["The enhanced virulence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, their capacity to cause breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people and reports of reduced effectiveness of approved vaccines against the delta variant are not the only factors dimming the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. A perverse pandemic of misinformation has led to widespread vaccine hesitancy and refusal in Canada and beyond, jeopardizing efforts to reach SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity, which would facilitate the relaxation of public health measures.

"...requirements that people be vaccinated to work or enter certain settings are supportable; the Ontario Human Rights Commission recently stated that people who hold antivaccination or antimask beliefs have the right not to use these protections, but they do not have the right to threaten the health of others. Governments should extend vaccine mandates to require more public sector workers who operate in congregate settings, such as educators, to prioritize the safety of their charges" (https://www.cmaj.ca/content/early/2021/10/04/cmaj.211656). - Mod.LK]

Convalescent plasma didn't help adults with critical COVID-19 have better outcomes, according to a randomized trial published yesterday [4 Oct 2021] in JAMA [Journal of the American Medical Association] (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784914).

The 2011-person study was rolled out at sites in the United Kingdom (115), Canada (9), Australia (4), and the United States (one, the only location that offered delayed convalescent plasma to 11 patients). The median age was 61 years, and 32.3% were women.

Almost 1050 people received 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma an average of 42.7 hours after hospital admission and 17.7 hours after ICU admission; 916 didn't receive anything beyond the standard of care.

The median number of organ support-free days within the first 21 days was zero in the treatment group and 3 in the control group (odds ratio, 0.97). Overall mortality was lower in the treatment group (37.3% vs 38.4%), but serious adverse events were commoner (3.0% vs 1.3%). The posterior probability of futility was 99.4% across the primary outcome of being organ support-free within 21 days.

"We speculate that [the futility] could be a combination of too few high-quality antibodies in the plasma and these patients being too far along in their illness with a run-away inflammatory immune response for those antibodies to turn the tide," said co-senior author Derek Angus, in a University of Pittsburgh press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930459). "It is still possible that convalescent plasma helps people in earlier stages of illness, though it is likely not efficient to use given that monoclonal antibodies...are such an effective treatment for early COVID-19."

While the study was stopped 15 Jan [2021] for futility, the researchers noted that convalescent plasma appeared to help the 126 immunocompromised patients (posterior probability of superiority, 89.8%), unless it was given more than 7 days into their hospitalization (posterior probability of harm, 90.3%). However, the sample size was too small to draw any conclusions.

[C] Excess pandemic deaths hit minorities harder

Excess pandemic deaths in the United States were disproportionately higher in Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Latino people than in White and Asian people, according to a study today [5 Oct 2021] in the Annals of Internal Medicine (https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-2134).

The researchers used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Census Bureau data to compare mortality per 100 000 people from March to December 2020 with the corresponding months in 2019. Excess deaths by racial population size were calculated under the assumption that the 2019 population sizes still held true.

During the 2020 study period, about 2.88 million people died, for an excess of 477 200 excess deaths compared with the 2019 period. About 74% of them were attributed to COVID-19, but Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Latino people had more than double the COVID-19 deaths per 100 000 people compared with White and Asian people.

Among non-COVID-19 deaths, Black and American Indian/Alaska Native people had 3- to 4-times more deaths per 100 000 people than White people, while Latinos had almost twice as many deaths. Broken down by race, non-COVID-19 deaths made up 22.6% of excess 2020 deaths among White people, 29.7% among Black people, 22.8% among Latino people, 25.8% among Asian people, and 30.9% among American Indian/Alaska Native people.

Data also showed that non-COVID-19 deaths were more prominent in those under 45 years of age (75% of deaths vs 22% in those older), and racial disparities were more prevalent in those 75 years and older (for example, deaths per 100 000 people were 9 times higher among Black men than among White men).

"It is possible that fear of seeking out health care during the pandemic or misattribution of causes of death from COVID-19 are responsible for a majority of the excess non-COVID-19 deaths," said lead author Meredith S Shiels, in a National Cancer Institute (NCI) press release (https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/covid-19-pandemic-disparities-excess-deaths).

The researchers note that American Indian/Alaska Native deaths may be underestimated, as this race is misclassified 40% of the time on death certificates.

[2] Africa: COVID-19 vaccination climbing slowly

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/covid-19-vaccination-climbing-slowly-africa


Though the pace of COVID-19 vaccination in Africa is well behind the rest of the world due to persistent supply inequity, the region is making modest progress, with some countries reaching the goal of immunizing 10% of their population by the end of September [2021], the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [5 Oct 2021] in its latest outbreaks and health emergencies update.

Of the 12 countries that hit the 10% goal, most have small populations, except for South Africa, WHO said. Most had the resources to acquire vaccines or make bilateral deals beyond their COVAX deliveries.

Currently, 4.5% of the African population is fully vaccinated, well below the average 55%-66% levels seen in the United States and Europe. WHO said African countries have received 201 million doses, which makes up 2.4% of the world's distribution. The African region has administered 71% of the doses it has received. "Countries still need to double their efforts to reach the year-end target of fully vaccinating 40% of the population," WHO said.

The region's COVID-19 cases continued a downward trend for the 11th week in a row, though some countries experienced increases over the past week, including Angola, Benin, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Mauritius, and Sao Tome and Principe. Deaths are also continuing to drop.

[3] Pfizer: vaccine effectiveness over time

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/pfizer-covid-vaccine-90-effective-vs-hospitalization-study-finds


The 2-dose Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is 90% effective against hospitalization caused by all SARS-CoV-2 variants, including delta, for at least 6 months, a Kaiser Permanente and Pfizer study confirmed yesterday [4 Oct 2021] in The Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02183-8/fulltext).

The researchers retrospectively mined 3.4 million electronic health records of patients 12 years and older from Kaiser Permanente Southern California from 4 Dec 2020 to 8 Aug 2021. Roughly 1.1 million patients had received at least one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, 91% of whom were fully vaccinated, and 6.6% of whom were partially vaccinated. Among vaccinated cohort members, an average of 3.4 months had elapsed since their 2nd Pfizer dose.

During the study period, 5.4% of patients were infected by SARS-CoV-2. Relative to uninfected patients, a higher proportion of infected patients were younger (median age, 42 vs 45 years), Hispanic (57.7% vs 39.5%), and obese (body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or higher). Among the 6.6% of infections that resulted in hospitalizations, patients were more likely to be older, male, and have more underlying illnesses and greater healthcare use.

Adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) over 6 months was 73% against infection and 90% against hospitalization. While VE against SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations remained high, VE against infection with any strain declined, from 88% in the 1st month after the 2nd dose to 47% after 5 months. The authors said that the results confirm those of earlier reports that showed declines in Pfizer VE against infection about 6 months after the 2nd dose.

VE differences were also seen across age-groups. VE against infection among fully vaccinated patients aged 12-15 years was 91%, while it was 61% for those 65 and older. From 1-5 months, VE against infection in patients 65 years and older fell from 80% to 43%. VE against hospitalization was 92% for patients 16-44 years and 86% for those 65 and older.

Overall median patient age was 45 years, 52.4% were female, 40.5% were Hispanic, 32.3% were White, 11.6% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 8.0% were Black, and 2.2% had one or more positive COVID-19 tests in the year leading up to the study. Of 5008 SARS-CoV-2 samples for which a whole-genome sequence could be determined, 28% were the delta variant. The share of cases caused by delta rose from 0.6% to nearly 87% from April to July 2021.

VE against delta variant infections also fell, from 93% in the 1st month to 53% after 4 or 5 months, as it did for other variants over the same period (97% to 67%). The authors noted that over the study period, the rapid spread of delta coincided with the 6-month post-vaccination mark for many high-risk patients given priority access to the vaccine.

"COVID-19 infections in people who have received 2 vaccine doses are most likely due to waning [VE] and not caused by delta or other variants escaping vaccine protection," study coauthor Luis Jodar, of Pfizer said in a Lancet press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930441).

While VE against hospitalization held steady over the study period, the authors noted that an unpublished 11 Aug 2021 report from the Israel Ministry of Health suggested declining Pfizer VE against hospitalization and severe illness among people 65 and older (https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/vpb-12082021/he/files_publications_corona_vpb-12082021-01.pdf).

"Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring vaccine effectiveness over time and suggest that booster doses might eventually be needed to restore the high levels of protection observed early in the vaccination programme," they wrote. "These factors are especially important to help control heightened transmission of the delta variant as we enter the upcoming autumn and winter viral respiratory season."

["These findings are consistent with preliminary reports from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Israel Ministry of Health that found reductions of BNT162b2 against infection after approximately 6 months."

"A whole genome sequencing and viral lineage analysis of 8911 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 samples from the study cohort determined that the delta variant comprised 28% of the overall proportion of positive sequences. During the study period, the proportion of positive cases attributed to the delta variant increased from 0.6% in April 2021 to nearly 87% by July 2021, confirming the delta variant had become the dominant strain in the United States.

"Vaccine effectiveness against delta variant infections at one month after 2 doses of BNT162B2 was 93% and fell to 53% after 4 months. Effectiveness against other (non-delta) variants at one month after receiving 2 doses was 97% and declined to 67% after 4 months. Effectiveness against delta-related hospitalizations remained high (93%) for the duration of the study period.

"Researchers did not observe a difference in waning between SAR-CoV-2 variant types. However, the authors note that because delta became the dominant strain in the middle of the study period, analyses with longer follow-up to measure the rate of waning for delta compared to other variants are warranted" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930441). - Mod.LK]
