Possibility of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak Discounted
------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD: The Shifa International Hospital was sealed when an incurable
Congo virus [infection was detected in a patient who died in the hospital
on Thu 29 Mar 2001. Hospital sources stated that the patient, a 30-year old
resident of Bashirabad, Peshawar, had been admitted to the hospital with
severe fever. The features of the patient's [illness were similar to those
[observed in confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. It has
been learned that following the death of the patient, 2 nurses at the Shifa
International Hospital were found [to be suffering from the same disease,
but the hospital authorities have not confirmed this. Sources said that the
father of the deceased also died of the same viral disease a few days back
in Peshawar.
The viral disease [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has reportedly hit
northern parts of the country and a number of patients have lost their
lives. A doctor at the hospital said the situation was completely under
control and there was no chance of an epidemic spreading in the capital. He
said the disease known as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever originated in
Africa in 1967 and it is still common there. "Samples of blood of deceased
have been sent to Africa for analysis," he said.

[The name of the hospital at the center of this report differs from that in
the first report from Islamabad, but otherwise the reports are similar.
Though 2 nurses at the Shifa Hospital may have contracted the disease, it
is unclear whether they were treating the deceased patient. The diagnosis
of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever still awaits laboratory confirmation. -
