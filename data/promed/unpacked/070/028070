A major outbreak of measles has killed almost 320 people and infected more than 20 000 in the southeast of [DR] Congo, the UN has announced.

"The toll is heavy and worrying: since January 2015, Medecin san Frontieres (MSF, Doctors without Borders), stated that more than 20 000 cases of measles have been registered in Katanga province alone," and stated that "almost 320 people have died," the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement this week. "Dozens of others may have succumbed to the illness, but they don't figure on official records," the statement added.

The outbreak in mineral-rich Katanga is the worst since 2011, according to Medecins Sans Frontieres, which is on the front line of a vaccination campaign in remote areas. In 2011, MSF staff immunised about 1.5 million children.

In 2013, 9400 cases of measles were registered in Katanga, compared with more than 12 000 the following year. OCHA warned that in 2015, the situation "is only getting worse", and said that "some of the affected areas also face malnutrition and cholera".

In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate health care, up to 10 per cent of measles cases result in death, the World Health Organization noted on its website.

Aid agencies say that about 1/3 of the affected areas in Katanga are covered by a vaccination programme. The United Nations and medical charities estimate that more than USD 2.4 million are needed to complete vaccinations and provide other essential care. But to contain the disease of "an epidemic nature", other serious obstacles must be confronted.

OCHA cites insecurity provoked by armed groups, the isolation of some regions that makes it hard to conserve vaccines properly, and the refusal of some parents to allow their children to be vaccinated on religious or cultural grounds.

Though a highly contagious disease, measles can easily be countered by a vaccine, which has virtually wiped it off the map in western countries. "Most deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease," according to WHO. "The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis (an infection that causes brain swelling), severe diarrhoea, and related dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia."

[Katanga is one of the provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Between 1971 and 1997 (during the rule of Mobutu Sese Seko, when Congo was known as Zaire), its official name was Shaba Province (https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=katanga%20province).

Katanga's area is 497 000 square km, 16 times larger than Belgium. Farming and ranching are carried out on the Katanga Plateau. The eastern part of the province is a rich mining region, which supplies cobalt, copper, tin, radium, uranium, and diamonds. The region's capital, Lubumbashi, is the 2nd largest city in the Congo. Moise Katumbi Chapwe, a businessman, is the governor of Katanga province. He took office on 24 Feb 2007. - Mod.CP

An outbreak of measles in Sudan has led to the deaths of at least 43 people, according to the country's Ministry of Health.

The Ministry confirmed in a statement seen by the African Press Agency on Friday [14 Aug 2015] that the death toll had reached 43 by the end of July 2015, with nearly 3000 confirmed cases. The Ministry said it is one of the worst measles outbreaks in Sudan's recent history.

"The highest number of deaths (14) was reported in East Darfur," it stated. In the majority of cases, 72 per cent have been children under the age of 15, with the highest number reported in the states of West Darfur (666), Kassala (516) and the Red Sea area (432).

Last April [2015], the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said that 22 people had died from measles in Sudan. The number of confirmed cases has since risen from 1730 to 2896. The measles outbreak started in December 2014 and has affected 61 localities across all 18 states in Sudan.

[Darfur is a region in Sudan the size of France. It is home to about 6 million people from nearly 100 tribes, some nomads, some farmers, all Muslims. In 1989, General Omar Bashir took control of Sudan by military coup, which then allowed The National Islamic Front government to inflame regional tensions. In a struggle for political control of the area, weapons poured into Darfur. Conflicts increased between African farmers and many nomadic Arab tribes.
