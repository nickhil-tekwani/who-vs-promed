--------------------------------------------------------------
This report is either, as usual from news organizations, misreporting facts, or someone broke many state laws.

The secondary purpose of rabies vaccination is protection of an animal, the primary is to create "herd immunity" and to prevent endemic canine rabies in dogs -- which leads to an estimated 30-50 000 human deaths a year in the world. Vs. less than 10 a year in the US. (Since 2004, no human case of rabies from a US native dog -- people were exposed in other countries, from bats, wildlife, or transplanted tissue).

Considering not all dogs get vaccinated at all (rates vary from mediocre to abysmal) realistically a far fewer number of 'pediatric' patients would get a series of 2 or 3 vaccinations, which would protect all of them. 12 to 16 weeks is considered old enough, most will respond to the vaccination, young enough that few are 'out and about' interacting with other animals. The fact is one single vaccination with currently available 3 year rabies vaccines are proven to protect for a minimum of 3 years -- in dogs with no maternal immunity. After the 2nd or 3rd, the animal is likely immune for life. It is not cost effective to prove this, when a relatively small percentage live to natural old age. Dogs having had only one vaccination as a pup, should be scrutinized differently. Thus a standard of one vaccination at 12-16 weeks, or if presented older with no vaccination history, a dog is vaccinated, a year later to catch those that might not have responded, and then every 3 years (if using a 3 year vaccine) has been established. The possibility of a non-responder is addressed by the 10 day quarantine if the dog bites a human.

So, with the prime directive of human protection, its all standardized -- a dog is given a 1st vaccination, is revaccinated in a year and then as manufacturer's recommendations (there are 1, 3 and 4 year vaccines). State and local ordinances, often arcane and non-scientific, may add other caveats. If this pup was old enough to "catch rabies" it was old enough to respond to vaccination. I have given a few pups being moved to high risk countries a series of 2 vaccinations in order to increase protection (there are references as to safety in younger dogs) but only 'certified' the vaccination given over the age mandated by state law.

The reason why vaccination after exposure -- the basis of rabies "treatment" in humans, works is -- rabies is a slow virus, which has to travel up axons to the CNS. A dog is consider immunized 28 days after the 1st vaccination partially to cover the possibility they are already incubating virus from an unknown exposure; if they are alive in 28 days, the immunization by vaccination beat out the virus! I can't think of a medical reason why a puppy, which had been bitten by a skunk, but had not bitten a human, couldn't have been vaccinated with a killed virus at any age. Texas, which has some of the most sensible and justifiable rules and regulations, does allow an unvaccinated animal to be vaccinated once, again in 3 and 8 weeks (and quarantined 90 days). I don't know what age Texas would consider too young. Many states would force euthanasia in a case like this. Logically the cost of a lengthy quarantine is a death sentence for most beloved adult pets, much less a puppy either recently obtained or one of a litter. A puppy, or a human bit on the face, will have a shorter incubation than a large dog bit on a leg or a person on the foot so it is possible the pup still would have succumbed. The dog is only a risk to humans or other animals for the last 10 days of an infection -- that is the time they can pass the virus on. Because at one time we used modified live rabies vaccines which could occasionally cause disease, and to remove any other variables, a dog which bites a human, with a current, lapsed, or no vaccination can never be vaccinated until 10 days has passed. If the animal has to be euthanized before 10 days, based on its vaccination status and the situation, the brain may be checked. If alive and healthy in 10 days, it can be euthanized, or vaccinated.

Years ago, a dog showing signs of rabies was allowed to progress and die to optimize a solid diagnosis, but with the sophistication of testing now, the dog which shows signs of rabies within the 10 days of inflicting a human bite, it is euthanized and the brain checked. Either someone didn't follow the law, or the history presented is wrong. Skunk (big risk wildlife) bites puppy and runs off. Pup presented to a veterinarian, whether "old enough" to vaccinate or not, whether vaccinated upon entry into quarantine or not, would be quarantined, or possibly confined at home, for between 45 and in many states, 180 days. If during that time it shows signs of illness consistent with rabies -- euthanasia and rabies tested. Pup bites human, regardless of vaccination or exposure history, it is not vaccinated, monitored or quarantined for 10 days, and if signs of rabies commence, euthanized and rabies tested. This pup was likely maintained at home, where it died, and then it was checked. When or if a medical professional was involved prior to this -- I would be surprised if they didn't misinterpret or ignore many DOH [department of health] or DEM [department of environmental management] rules. As to a question posed about the pup getting immune-globulin -- ignoring expense, remember the prime directive -- that wouldn't be considered, much less allowed, for AKC [American Kennel Club] best in show!
