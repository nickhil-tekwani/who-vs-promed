Sharing my personal story, I received 3-dose HDCV IM in 1981, and have had
no further vaccinations. In 1984 my titer was greater than 1/250, and in
1997 greater than 1/1250. I've had no known exposure to rabies but have
administered killed RV vaccines daily in practice, for years. Has anyone
tried to correlate titer decay with exposure to domestic animal vaccines?
