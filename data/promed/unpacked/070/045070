1st Report of _Leifsonia xyli_ subsp. _xyli_, Causal Agent of Ratoon
Stunting of Sugarcane, in Jamaica.

Accepted for publication 5 Nov 2005.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report that _Leifsonia xyli_ subsp.
_xyli, previously named _Clavibacter xyli_ subsp. _xyli_ (2), has
been detected and identified in sugarcane in Jamaica. Although ratoon
stunting (also known as ratoon stunting disease or RSD) has been
reported in Jamaica since 1961, presence of the pathogen had never
been confirmed in symptomatic tissues.
A major industry-wide survey conducted in 1987 using the fluorescent
antibody staining technique failed to detect positives in any of the
61 fields sampled in Jamaica. A new survey was conducted in 2004 on 8
estates and the Sugar Industry Research Institute (SIRI) in Jamaica.
6 arbitrarily selected stalks were sampled from each of 64 fields
representing 25 different sugarcane cultivars.
A 1-cm diameter core was extracted from the center of the bottom part
of the stalk and used to detect the pathogen by tissue blot
immunoassay (TBIA) (3). _L. xyli_ subsp. _xyli_ was detected in 26 of
384 samples (7 percent). At least one positive sample was found in 10
fields and 7 cultivars and in one case (sugarcane cv. D14146 at the
St Thomas Sugar Estate), all 6 stalks sampled in a field were positive.
The highest number of infected fields (6 of 10) occurred at Worthy
Park where cane yield in 2004 was 86.54 tons per ha compared with an
average of 68.04 tons per ha for major estates in Jamaica (1). This
latter result would indicate that where good-quality agronomic
practices are maintained, the effect of ratoon stunting might not be
substantial or that sugarcane cultivars grown at this location were
resistant to ratoon stunting.
Pathogen identification was confirmed using nested polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) with 3 samples from a TBIA-positive field of cv.
D14146. Primary primers were RSD 33 (CTGGCACCCTGTGTTGTTTTC) and RSD
297 (TTCGGTTCTCATCTCAGCGTC) and secondary, nested primers were RST60
(TCAACGCAGAGATTGTCCAG) and RST59 (CGTCTTGAAGACACAGCGATGAG). The
thermocycler parameters were denaturization at 94 deg C for 4 min, 31
cycles at 94 deg C for 30s, 55 deg C for 30 s, 65 deg C for 1 min,
and final extension at 65 deg C for 3 min. The nested-PCR product
(approximately 230 bp) of each sample was cloned and sequenced. It
showed 99-100 percent identity with the 16S-23S intergenic spacer
region of _L. xyli_ subsp. _xyli_, thus confirming occurrence of
ratoon stunting in Jamaica.
Since this study, the SIRI has installed a hot-water treatment plant
and will heat-treat cuttings before planting the nurseries with new
sugarcane clones selected for release to growers. The SIRI will also
conduct screening for ratoon stunting resistance to ensure that
susceptible clones are not released to the industry. Meanwhile, the
SIRI will do a more intense survey so that a more comprehensive
picture may be obtained of the presence of ratoon stunting in Jamaica.

[This is the first report of this bacterial pathogen in Jamaica, not
the disease. It is known to be a difficult pathogen to detect, and
tissue blot immunoassay was used in this study. Ratoon stunting is
considered by many to be the most important disease affecting
sugarcane production worldwide. It can cause a 5-15 percent loss in
crop yield without the grower even knowing his fields have been
infected. The disease is caused by a bacterium. RSD has no easily
recognized external symptoms, only stunting of growth, which may not
always be apparent in the field.
