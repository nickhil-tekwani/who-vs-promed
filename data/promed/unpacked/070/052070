Mine workers affected by an outbreak of "stomach flu"
-----------------------------------------------------
22 miners at the Cosmonaut's mine in the Rovenka district of Lugansk
oblast [province], were admitted to the infectious diseases hospital
as a result of rotavirus infection, often called "stomach flu."
According to one of the miners, the 1st symptoms were nausea and
vomiting followed later by diarrhea and fever.

Preliminary tests for microbial infection were negative, but a rapid
"cito" test for rotavirus infection gave positive results. Currently
all 22 miners are undergoing treatment. The management at the mine are
providing all necessary facilities for treatment and diagnosis. The
public health epidemiological surveillance service has initiated an
investigation, but no information is available as yet.

It is not the 1st outbreak of rotavirus infection in the area. Two
weeks ago an outbreak of rotavirus infection was registered in the
"Juravushka" kindergarten involving 5 children aged between 2 and 2.5
years of age. It is expected that these children will soon be
discharged from hospital.

Rotavirus can be transmitted through direct contact and water. The
diseases is more dangerous for children than for adults.
