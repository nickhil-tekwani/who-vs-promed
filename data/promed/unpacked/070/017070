Suspected anthrax on farm
-------------------------
The lethal disease anthrax has been detected on a farm near Varberg,
Halland. 13 cows have died since November 29 [2008], according to the home
page of Sweden's Ministry of Agriculture.

Anthrax can carry from animal to human, but it is not common. The bacteria
does not carry from human to human. The farm, now closed, has about 70
animals. The public has no access to the premises and nothing can be sold
from it. Since the disease can carry from animal to human the people who
have been in contact with the animals have received antibiotics.

"It's not a funny decease. It can be deadly for humans, says Bengt Larsson,
director of infectious diseases, Ministry of Agriculture to TT
(Tidningarnas Telegrambyr - Swedish news agency). The last anthrax outbreak
in Sweden was in 1981 in Uppland (region in central Sweden, north of
Stockholm).

[Our heartfelt thanks to Jesper.

OIE confirms the 1981 date for the last recorded outbreak of anthrax in
Sweden. Anthrax outbreaks in December should make one first consider
contaminated feed, especially as northern livestock are housed at this
time. On the other hand resurgences usually follow from earthworks that
unknowingly turn up an old anthrax cattle grave or when there is dredging
downstream of an old mill or tannery. Every now and again it turns out that
the disease had been quietly chuntering along in the background out of
sight or hidden by biased field diagnoses --- for example the recent
outbreak in SW Montana was in an area with no known cases since 1956 but
with a constant summer background of sporadic malignant catarrhal fever and
hemlock poisonings or so they thought. Obviously some were not. Which is
why one should always pay attention to unexpected sudden deaths, be they in
livestock or wildlife. As one can see from this outbreak the high numbers
(13) eventually forced the diagnosis. I am circulating this off-line to
Swedish colleagues for any further information.

For a map of Sweden, see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/sweden__rel96.jpg>. Varberg is on
the coast south of Goteberg
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/6/Varberg.html>, which makes me
suspect an imported feed component or feed itself. It should be noted that
Denmark has been free from anthrax since 1988, Norway since 1993, and the
Netherlands since 1994; the Baltic (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) states are
free; Finland had cattle outbreaks in 2004 and 2008 but on the same farm,
originally believed to be from contaminated silage; Poland still has
occasional human cases though the last reported bovine case was in 2001;
Germany's last case was in a bovine in August, 2000. A strange but possibly
indicative situation was of 4 horses affected in Iceland in 2004 when the
island had been free since 1965. Back in the early 1990s there was a
December outbreak in Tromso, Norway, above the Arctic circle in a dairy
herd, also very suggestive of contaminated imported feed. - Mod.MHJ]
