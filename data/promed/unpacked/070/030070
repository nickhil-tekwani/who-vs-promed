Avian influenza report week 4 [11(4)]
------------------------------
1. There were no new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).*

2. From 2010 to 2014, 32 to 62 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) were reported to WHO annually (according to onset date). In 2015 (as of 24 Jan 2015), there were no new cases so far.**

3. During this reporting period, one confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong was reported by the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health. This imported case is the 2nd case in Hong Kong this winter [2014-15] and the 12th case in Hong Kong. In addition, 11 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) (Guangdong (9), Shanghai (1) and Zhejiang (1)) were reported by the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province and other Mainland health authorities, while one human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) from British Columbia Province was reported by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Since March 2013 (as of 26 Jan 2015), there were a total of 513 cases reported.

* Since 21 Nov 2012, WHO only publishes information on human cases with avian influenza A(H5N1) infection on a monthly basis in "Influenza at human-animal interface: Monthly Risk Assessment Summary." Cases of human infection with H5N1 will only be reported in Disease Outbreak News for events that are unusual or associated with potential increased risks.

** According to date of disease onset

This week's highlights [as of 26 Jan 2015; Sources: WHO, National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), Mainland health authorities, Public Health Agency of Canada, CHP and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)] may be seen in Table 1-9 at the URL cited above.

Avian Influenza Report is a weekly report produced by the Respiratory Disease Office, Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health. This report highlights global avian influenza activity in humans and birds.

[This is the 5th day in a row that Guangdong province is reporting avian influenza cases. Little is coming out of other provinces either because of lack of cases or failure to report.

[3] China: Case update H7N9

See map of influenza A(H7N9) case detection, numbers and graphs, with likely province of acquisition, updated 27 Jan 2015 by Ian Mackay. The numbers are gathered from Ministries of Health for the provinces and municipalities of China, the World Health Organization and FluTrackers. The case numbers presented publicly, and used in these graphs, are expected to represent only a fraction of all the cases that have and are occurring.

Dr. Mackay also writes on the need for societal change in his blog http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/societal-change-and-h7n9.html.

The importance of societal change for controlling infectious disease outbreaks really cannot be overstated. For Ebola virus disease, it came down to stopping the tradition of direct contact with the bodies of those who have died and direct contact in general. For MERS, it seems that occasional camel contact triggers insertion of the MERS-CoV virus into hospitals, where lax infection prevention and control practices add to the case load.

For influenza A(H7N9) virus cases, it is the habit of obtaining live poultry from retail markets, where rare, virus-laden [chickens] are culled and handed over because of a desire to see, choose, and purchase the tastiest fresh chicken. There is a common thread among these stories about direct contact or inefficient droplet-transmitting virus infections: we can stop their spread. ... - more
