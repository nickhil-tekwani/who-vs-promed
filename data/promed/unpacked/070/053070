China intercepts fungus in Chilean blueberry shipment
------------------------------------------------------
Chile's protocol for blueberry exports to China has been adjusted to include quarantine procedures for stem canker (_Diaporthe australafricana_), after the fungus was found in a shipment from the South American country.

Chile's Agriculture and Livestock Service (SAG) said this meant that if symptoms [similar] to stem canker [are present], samples would need to be taken for lab analysis, leaving the lot in wait or rejected if the presence of the fungus is proven. If inspections find _Diaporthe australafricana_ twice, the property concerned will be banned from China-bound exports for the remainder of the season.

Andres France, Chilean Agricultural Research Institute (INIA), gave a list of recommendations to help identify and control the disease. He said the disease could be easily confused with _Phomopsis vaccinii_ [another stem canker pathogen -- see comment below]. France said the disease was associated with rain and a lack of sanitary pruning. Pruning was necessary for managing the disease [but] must be done prior to flowering.

[_Diaporthe_ species and strains are known to be associated with stem canker diseases in a range of crops, for example soybean and sunflower. They can cause high losses. _Diaporthe australafricana_, a new species described in 2005, is one of the stem canker pathogens affecting blueberry. Blueberry stem canker diseases can also be caused by fungal species in several other genera (including _Phomopsis_, as mentioned above). Symptoms may include leaf spots, twig blight, branch dieback, reduction of plant vigour and even death of the plant. In addition, the pathogens may also affect flowers and cause fruit rot.

The diseases are favoured by warm, humid conditions. The fungi overwinter on plant debris left in the field and can be spread with plant material, by mechanical means (wounds), via frost injuries and human activities. Disease management includes phytosanitation to remove inoculum, cultural methods and fungicide treatments especially during flowering. Resistant crop cultivars are available only for some of the pathogens.

In Chile, _D. australafricana_ was first reported in 2012 (see link below). The revised certification scheme described above will hopefully be applied to all exports, not just for trade with China. The story above emphasises again the importance of effective phytosanitary and biosecurity systems in international trade to protect national primary industries.
