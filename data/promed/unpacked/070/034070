From: Dr G Anthony Keen <gakeen@medmicro.uct.ac.za>

A 48 year old stock farmer from the Steinkopf area of the Northern Cape
Province of South Africa (approximately 500 km North of Cape Town) was
admitted to hospital in Cape Town on 26 Feb 1998 after a few days of
illness complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic liver disease.
After a stormy course in hospital he died on 4 March with bleeding
problems. A blood sample taken the day before his death showed antibodies
to Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus (IgG titre 256, IgM titre 512 by
immunofluorescence, National Institute for Virology, Johannesburg). A PCR
test for viral RNA was reported as negative but cell culture inoculation
was later reported to be positive for the same virus (NIV, Johannesburg).
Mouse inoculation results are awaited. No secondary cases have been
identified in the home area of the patient nor yet (after 8 days) in the
117 identified contacts being followed up in the Cape Town area following
the death of the patient.
Comment: CCHF virus is endemic (enzootic?) in animals in South Africa, with
a number of human cases having previously been reported from the Northern
Cape region (i.e., in the vicinity of the town of Kimberley). There was a
recent outbreak in humans in the town of Oudtshoorn associated with an
ostrich abattoir. As has occurred previously, this patient was admitted as
a surgical emergency patient with large gastrointestinal bleeding. CCHF was
only considered 3 to 4 days later. Isolation to minimise contacts was then
applied.

[Far be it from me to cave in to the voices of reason. Doesn't matter to
me that other Moderators are willing to use the term "epidemic" (Greek: epi
= among, upon + demos = people) when they should be using "epizootic".
Another Moderator uses "epidemic" for the human half of an epizoodemic and
"epizootic" for the nonhuman half; fair enough. Quite apart from this
interesting case report (ibid), the question arises as to whether to use
the term "endemic" or "enzootic". Perfect example of people digging
themselves into a hole and then asking for help getting out. C-CHF virus
certainly is not endemic (continuously present among humans in a certain
region, a la cholera in some places). That C-CHF is enzootic in certain
regions is a certainty, although it must be noted that C-CHF virus
ordinarily cycles in ticks and small vertebrates and once in a while spills
over to larger vertebrates (cattle, humans). Please don't send me any more
messages trying to convince me to get with the program and use "epidemic"
when "epizootic" is correct. I haven't yet accepted the designated hitter,
and likely won't. - Mod.CHC
