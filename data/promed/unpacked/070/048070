[1] India: vaccines approved
[A]
Date: Sat 2 Jan 2021

India has formally approved the emergency use of 2 coronavirus vaccines as it prepares for one of the world's biggest inoculation drives. The drugs regulatory authority gave the green light to the jabs developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University and by local firm Bharat Biotech.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called it "a decisive turning point". India plans to inoculate some 300 million people on a priority list this year [2021]. It has recorded the 2nd-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150 000 people have died. On Saturday [2 Jan 2021] India held nationwide drills to prepare more than 90 000 health care workers to administer vaccines across the country, which has a population of 1.3 billion people.

The Drugs Controller General of India said both manufacturers had submitted data showing their vaccines were safe to use. However, opposition politicians and some doctors have criticised a lack of transparency in the approval process.

Dr Swapneil Parikh, an infectious diseases researcher based in Mumbai, told the BBC doctors were in a difficult position. "I understand there is a need to go through the process quickly, remove regulatory hurdles," he said. "However... [governments and regulators] have a duty to be transparent about the data they have reviewed and the process involved in making the decision to authorise a vaccine, because if they don't do this, it can affect the public's faith in the process."

The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is being manufactured locally by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer. It says it is producing more than 50 million doses a month. Adar Poonawalla, the company's CEO, told the BBC in November [2020] that he aimed to ramp up production to 100 million doses a month after receiving regulatory approval.

The jab, which is known as Covishield in India, is administered in 2 doses given between 4 and 12 weeks apart. It can be safely stored at temperatures of 2 deg C to 8 deg C [35.6-46.4 deg F], about the same as a domestic fridge [and the same as vaccines used in routine childhood immunizations. - Mod.MPP], and can be delivered in existing healthcare settings such as doctors' surgeries.

This makes it easier to distribute than some of the other vaccines. The jab developed by Pfizer/BioNTech -- which is currently being administered in several countries -- must be stored at -70 C [-94 F] and can only be moved a limited number of times -- a particular challenge in India, where summer temperatures can reach 50 C [122 F].

The local vaccine, however, was approved despite the absence of data on how efficient it can be. It has yet to go through large-scale trials. The Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin was "safe and provides a robust immune response". Mr Somani said it had been approved "in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains."

India, which makes about 60% of vaccines globally, plans to immunise about 300 million people by July 2021. It will prioritise health care workers, the emergency services, and those who are clinically vulnerable because of age or pre-existing conditions.

India's existing vaccination programme already reaches about 55 million people a year, administering 390 million free jabs against a dozen diseases. It stocks and tracks the vaccines through a well-oiled electronic system.

Pfizer, whose vaccine has already been approved for use in jurisdictions including the UK, the US, and the EU, is also seeking emergency authorisation in India.

In all, some 30 vaccine candidates are being developed in India.

India on Sunday [3 Jan 2021] granted emergency approval to Bharat Biotech's Covaxin but faced questions after taking the step without publishing efficacy data for the homegrown coronavirus vaccine. The news, announced by the drugs controller general of India (DCGI) who did not take questions, was hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ministers as a success in India's self-reliance push.

The government also approved the use of a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University which will be the lead vaccine in India's immunisation programme until other shots are approved.

Covaxin was jointly developed with a government institute and means India joins a small list of countries to have approved its own coronavirus shot. Bharat has partnered with drug developer Ocugen Inc to co-develop it for the US market, and Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to buy the shot. The company has said it is in discussions with more than 10 countries about Covaxin. "While this vaccine addresses an unmet medical need during this pandemic, our goal is to provide global access to populations that need it the most," Bharat Biotech Chairman Krishna Ella said in a statement.

"Covaxin has generated excellent safety data with robust immune responses to multiple viral proteins that persist." Neither the company nor India's Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation would reveal its efficacy results. A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters news agency its effectiveness could be more than 60 percent with 2 doses.

China also did not publish detailed efficacy data for a vaccine it authorised on Thursday [31 Dec 2020] but its developer has shared interim data.

"On what basis was this approval given when Bharat Biotech has NOT shown enough data proving safety & efficacy?" transparency activist Saket Gokhale asked on Twitter. Gokhale has filed a request under India's right-to-information law, asking the government for safety and other data for the 2 vaccines approved on Sunday [3 Jan 2021].

'Premature'
-----------
Covaxin has been fast-tracked like no other vaccine in India. The company said in November [2020] it was likely to be launched in the 2nd quarter of 2021, while a government scientist had suggested it might be February or March [2021]. Opposition politicians and former ministers on Sunday [3 Jan 2021] questioned the lack of transparency in approving it. "Approval was premature and could be dangerous," said former minister Shashi Tharoor, asking Health Minister Harsh Vardhan for an explanation. "Its use should be avoided till full trials are over. India can start with the AstraZeneca vaccine in the meantime."

Vardhan urged Indians to trust that "stringent protocols" had been followed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the 2 approved vaccines. In the largest such trial in India, Bharat Biotech said it had recruited 23 000 volunteers out of a target of 26 000 for an ongoing phase III trial of Covaxin which began in November [2020].

[The production of the Serum Institute of India's version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine as the world's largest vaccine manufacturer bodes well for the global supply of vaccine, and availability of vaccines globally. The Serum Institute of India has a well established track record for vaccine production. That being said, data on the clinical trials of this vaccine as well as the other vaccine produced by Bharat Biotech would be calming for the scientific community, especially those concerned with the approval process.

The Covaxin produced by Bharat Biotech is a killed vaccine, using a strain of the virus identified in India. Phase 2 results were published (non-peer review) that shoed the vaccine to be safe without serious adverse events. They also "hypothesized" T-cell and B-cell immunity resulting from the vaccine would have an effective duration of at least 6-12 months after the 2nd dose (https://theprint.in/health/everything-you-need-to-know-about-covaxin-indias-controversial-covid-vaccine-candidate/578346/) Uncomfortable existing trial results released thus far. - Mod.MPP]

The spike in the coronavirus infections is showing no signs of slowing as Nigeria recorded 1074 new cases on New Year's Day [1 Jan 2021]. The figure, one of the highest so far since the virus began spreading in the country, indicated a slight increase from the 1031 reported on 31 Dec 2020.

The total infection toll in the country, according to the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), is now 88 587. Since early December 2020, there has been a spike in coronavirus cases in Nigeria with more deaths also recorded from the virus. The total death toll from COVID-19 in Nigeria rose to 1294 after 5 more people died on Friday [1 Jan 2021], the NCDC reported.

The spike in new cases is feeding through into fatalities. Hospitals and isolation centers are increasingly becoming overwhelmed. In the past 14 days, there have been 82 recorded deaths from the coronavirus.

The federal government warned that a significant increase in coronavirus infections in Nigeria appears imminent this January [2021] due to continued violation of safety protocols during the Yuletide period. Active cases in the country rose sharply from about 3000 some weeks ago to over 11 000 due to a rise in new infections.

[The ongoing coronavirus disease outbreak is on the increase with a report of 1074 confirmed cases on 1 Jan 2021. The 2nd wave of the infection started in early December 2020, and the figures have been on the increase nationwide. Experts opine the increased samples being sent to the accredited labs may be leading to overload and tests are not being run on time, thus leading to a backlog of samples being tested. - Mod.AA

https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2044503/one-more-covid-19-death-216-new-cases


One more death linked to COVID-19 and 216 new cases were reported on Saturday [2 Jan 2021], bringing the total to 7379 cases and 64 fatalities. Of the 216 new cases, 214 were local infections, according to the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA). The new death was a diabetic woman in Chon Buri [province] who had gone to a gambling den, it said.

Most of the new cases, or 154, are being investigated. Another 23 cases either went to risk areas, had at-risk professions or had a history of being contact with previous cases. Three of the new cases were linked to the Samut Sakhon [province] cluster, and one each was linked to the Rayong and Chon Buri clusters. Active case finding among migrant workers found another 32 cases while the remaining 2 cases were arrivals in quarantine.

The CCSA attributed the spike to 2 reasons. Infected people have failed to isolate themselves and continue to travel. Activities involving gatherings of people are still being held and some of which are illegal.

The disease has spread to 53 provinces, mainly in the Central Plains, since COVID-19 re-emerged in 6 provinces in mid-December [2020]. To contain the spread, the CCSA will step up control in the red zone (28 provinces), orange zone (11) and yellow zone (38) [see map at the source URL]. For the red zone, maximum control will be imposed in 2 phases as needed.

The 1st phase, from 4 Jan to 1 Feb 2021, involves restricting opening hours of places, closing establishments at risk of spreading the disease, cracking down on illegal assembling, minimising gatherings, seeking cooperation from people to not leave the provinces, closing schools and educational institutions or reintroducing online learning, and encouraging people to work from home. In addition, more measures will apply to people leaving the red area and active case finding will be conducted.

The 2nd phase, if necessary, involves imposing a curfew and intensifying the existing measures such as more restrictions on operating hours of establishments, more closures, a requirement for work from home and more active case finding, the CCSA said.

The red zone (under maximum control) covers Bangkok and 27 provinces: Tak, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Ayutthaya, Saraburi, Lop Buri, Sing Buri, Angthong, Nakhon Nayok, Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Ratchaburi, Suphan Buri, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Phetchaburi, Samut Songkhram, Samut Sakhon, Chachoengsao, Prachin Buri, Sa Kaeo, Samut Prakan, Chanthaburi, Chon Buri, Trat, Rayong, Chumphon, and Ranong.

The orange zone (under control) covers 11 provinces: Sukhothai, Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Uthai Thani, Chai Nat, Phetchabun, Chaiyaphum, Buri Ram, Nakhon Ratchasima, Surat Thani, and Phangnga.

The yellow zone (under close watch) covers the remaining 38 provinces.

[3] USA: Inflatable costume superspreading event
Date: Sun 3 Jan 2021
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/kaiser-san-jose-outbreak-air-powered-costume.html


An air-powered, inflatable costume, worn by a staff member on Christmas to spread holiday cheer, may be to blame for a coronavirus outbreak that infected dozens of workers in a hospital in San Jose, California, a hospital spokeswoman said. An employee wore the costume "briefly" in the emergency department at Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center, the spokeswoman, Irene Chavez, said in a statement. The hospital began an investigation after 44 staff members tested positive for the coronavirus between [27 Dec 2020] and Friday [1 Jan 2021], she said.

Inflatable costumes are usually powered by a battery-operated fan that sucks air into the suit, helping it keep its shape. T. rex and sumo wrestler models are among the more popular. Some costumes cover the wearer's face while others leave it exposed. Ms Chavez declined to say what kind of air-powered costume the hospital employee wore, but she described it as "holiday themed." As part of its response to the outbreak, she said, the hospital was looking into "whether the costume, which did have a fan, was a contributing factor." Air-powered costumes have been banned, she said.

It was unclear how long the employee had worn the costume in the emergency department. The hospital declined to say whether any patients had been infected. It was also unclear whether any of the infected staff members had received the 1st dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but experts have said that it takes at least a couple of weeks for the vaccine's protective effects to kick in. According to the hospital, 40 000 Kaiser employees in Northern California have received the 1st dose of the vaccine.

"Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely innocent, and quite accidental, as the individual had no COVID symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those around them during what is a very stressful time," Ms Chavez said of the costumed worker. The emergency department will be deep-cleaned, Ms Chavez said, and in addition to protocols that were already in place, employees will be offered free weekly testing.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the coronavirus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets and can "sometimes be spread by airborne transmission" of both larger droplets and smaller aerosols when people "cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe."

Dr Jose-Luis Jimenez, an aerosol expert and a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder, helped investigate the choir outbreak in Skagit County, in which at least 53 infections and 2 deaths were traced to a singing practice in Washington State. In an interview on Sunday [3 Jan 2021], he said that the outbreak among the staff at Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center was most likely the result of airborne transmission. "It's kind of like the choir case," Dr Jimenez said. "There is no way to infect 43 people when you're wearing a costume other than through airborne transmission, through aerosols, because you're inside a costume and cannot touch objects or get people infected through surfaces."

The hospital is in Santa Clara County, California, where there have been 73 493 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to a New York Times database. There have been 2 397 923 confirmed cases across California. More than 21 000 people were hospitalized in California on [1 Jan 2021], according to the Times database, a 26 percent increase from 2 weeks earlier.

[There was initially a debate rejecting the idea of airborne transmission in a droplet-based transmission pattern until there was a superspreading event involving a choir practice, and later on an outbreak cluster in a restaurant that followed the flow of air conditioning in the restaurant. Airborne transmission has been accepted as one route of transmission for this organism (see COVID-19 update (428): POC test, airborne trans, mitigation impact, WHO, global 20201007.7842239 and COVID-19 update (321): airborne transmission & air conditioning, WHO, global 20200718.7587301). One suspects that the use of a fan driven inflatable suit may have disseminated the virus in smaller particles. The fact that the individual was asymptomatic at the time of the event (and if s/he remained asymptomatic) is a reminder of the stealth nature of this virus. - Mod.MPP]

Today's (3 Jan 2021) reports reflect 2 parts of weekend reporting artifact during a holiday weekend. In some countries that had no or decreased reporting over the holiday, there is "catch up" reporting, in other countries they continue to not report over the weekend. Hence drawing any firm conclusions on interpretations will have to wait.

- The Americas region reported 64.6% of daily case numbers and 61.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 36.3 million cases. Countries not reporting include Costa Rica, Venezuela among others.

- The European region reported 22.4% of daily case numbers and 23.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 26.8 million. Countries not reporting cases include Spain, Belgium (3 cases), Romania, Switzerland, Sweden, Israel, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Greece, among others.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 2.8% of daily case numbers and 3.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.97 million cases. Countries not reporting any cases include Oman, Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen.

- The African region reported 5.6% of daily case numbers and 7.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.96 million cases. South Africa reported over 31 000 cases, Nigeria over 1600 cases, reports were elevated in Ethiopia, Botswana, Mauritania, Namibia and Zimbabwe. Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.97% of daily case numbers and 0.56% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.11 million cases.

- The South East Asia region reported 3.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 4.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 12.0 million cases. Thailand reported 216 cases.

A total of 44 countries (down from 61countries on 31 Dec 2020) reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 44 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 9.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 17.9% increase in daily reported cases and a 16.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 524 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 85 million cumulative reported cases with over 1.85 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even with reductions in daily case reports due to the period, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Sobering data is that even though there is still significant weekend holiday reporting artifact with reduced cases and deaths reported during this period, comparative 7 day averages are reflecting renewed significant increases of newly confirmed cases and deaths both globally and in the USA where transmission continues to be out of control. - Mod.MPP]
