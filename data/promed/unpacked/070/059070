BOVINE EPHEMERAL FEVER IN TAJIKISTAN
-------------------------------------
Information received on 14 Aug 2002 from Prof. Dr Mulozhon Amirbekov, Head
of the Main Board of Veterinary Medicine, Ministry of Agriculture, Dushanbe:
Report date: 23 Jul 2002.
5000 cases of bovine ephemeral fever were registered in cattle in Moskva,
Pyandzh and Parkhar districts, near the border with Afghanistan.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and epidemiological.
Control measures:
- strengthened surveillance of sick animals;
- control of the vectors of infection;
- disinfection of the premises;
- ban on the transport and gathering of animals;
- isolation of animals from haematophagous insects.

[Bovine Ephemeral fever (BEF, "3 days sickness") has been reported by the
Tajiki Veterinary Services to the OIE despite the fact that it is not
included in any of the disease lists (A, B, or C). This unusual step might
be due to the considerable size of the outbreak, and probably to severity
of recorded or expected economical implications. Indeed details on the
morbidity and mortality rates could be helpful.
BEF is a noncontagious epizootic arthropod-borne viral disease of cattle
and water buffaloes characterized by sudden onset of fever, depression,
stiffness, and lameness. The clinical severity of the disease is
inconsistent with the subsequent rapid recovery reported in most of the
affected animals.
The causative agent is the Ephemerovirus (genus) belonging to the
Rhabdoviridae family; although it has been recovered from some _Culicoides_
and mosquito species (anopheline and culicine) collected in the field, the
vectors during major epidemics have not been proven. This virus is
antigenically related to at least 3 other viruses not pathogenic for cattle
(Kimberley virus, Berrimah virus, and Adelaide River virus) and 2 that
produce an ephemeral fever-like disease in cattle: Kotonkan and Puchong
viruses in Africa and Malaysia, respectively.
BEF was first described in South Africa in 1906. The disease is now known
to exist in a broad belt of tropical, subtropical, and temperate countries
in Africa, Asia, and Australia and to be the same disease as bovine
epizootic fever of Japan. There has been no report of ephemeral fever from
Europe or North or South America.
The prevalence, extent, and severity of the disease vary from year to year,
and epidemics occur periodically. During epidemics, onset is rapid; many
animals are affected within days or 2-3 weeks. BEF is most prevalent in the
wet season in the tropics and in summer to early autumn in the subtropics
or temperate regions (when conditions favor multiplication of biting
arthropods); it disappears abruptly in winter. Morbidity may be as high as
80 percent; overall mortality is usually 1-2 percent, although it is higher
in well-conditioned cattle (10-20 percent).
Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, include biphasic or
polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal
discharge, drooling, dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness
and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may
become recumbent and paralyzed for 8 hours to one week and longer. Lesions
include polyserositis affecting joint, pleural, and peritoneal surfaces;
some lung edema; and atelectasis. After recovery, milk production often
fails to return to normal levels until the next lactation. Abortion, with
total loss of the season's lactation, occurs in about 5 percent of cows
pregnant for 8-9 months. Bulls, other heavy cattle, and heavily producing
dairy cows are the most severely affected, but spontaneous recovery still
usually occurs within a few days. More insidious losses may result from
decreased muscle mass and lowered fertility in bulls.
Diagnosis is based almost entirely on clinical signs in an epidemic.
Confirmation is by serology, rarely by virus isolation. All clinical cases
have a neutrophilia with band forms, although this is not pathognomonic.
Isolated viruses are identified by neutralization tests using specific
ephemeral fever virus antisera and by ELISA using specific monoclonal
antibodies. A 4-fold rise in antibodies confirms infection. The
neutralization test and the blocking ELISA are recommended and give similar
results.
In Australia, which has experienced seasonal outbreaks of BEF since 1936,
the disease is not subject to regulatory control, although virus activity
is monitored as part of the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program:
<http://www.brs.gov.au/usr-bin/aphb/ahsq?dip=BEF2>
The virus is endemic in northern Australia and spreads south when climatic
conditions are suitable for spread and survival of the vectors. Epidemics
tend to occur only every few years, as the level of immunity in the
population from previous epidemics declines, providing a susceptible
population. Australian and South African vaccines are commercially
available; the live-attenuated vaccines seem to be effective but should be
used only in endemic areas.
BEF has been reported to be increasingly active in several Middle-Eastern
countries since the early 1990's; in Israel, the mortality rate in 1990 was
3 percent and in 1999 almost 4 percent in affected dairy herds. The average
mortality or emergency-slaughter rates in such herds was 0.4 percent for
calves (up to one year old) and 4.4 percent for cows in production. Milk
production losses were estimated as 380 kg per milking cow in affected herds.

BEF deserves enhanced attention, having -- like other arthropod-borne viral
diseases -- the potential of spreading into virgin areas which seem
increasingly receptive. - Mod.AS]
