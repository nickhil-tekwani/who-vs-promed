Officials from Blue Pearl Veterinary Partners in Paramus are reassuring Bergen County pet owners that a disease that killed 3 and infected 2 dogs isn't as scary as it seems.

"It's just something people don't know about," [the practice manager] said of leptospirosis. "It's not something running rampant in human medicine, but it's common in veterinary medicine, and we see it often."

The 5 dogs were being treated by Blue Pearl for related signs when they were diagnosed, [she] said. They did not contract the illness from the facility.

Leptospirosis spreads from wildlife and can be transmitted through urine, not blood or saliva, [she] said.

"I wouldn't say it's more prevalent, but we've had a busy season," she added. "It's just something people don't know about."

Five dogs were confirmed to have contracted "lepto" over the past 6 months at Blue Pearl. There are vaccines to [prevent] it, though they are not required, [she] said.

"[Leptospirosis] is hard for dogs to contract unless they're big hiking dogs or are around water that's not stagnant, or around wooded areas," [she] said. "It's not something everyone has to vaccinate for."

[The practice manager] encourages pet owners to contact their veterinarians with questions or concerns.

[People who frequent dog parks should especially be aware of this disease. The urinary habit of dogs is to sniff or lick where another dog has urinated, thus transmitting the organism to the new dog.

Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease caused by _Leptospira_ spp., may not be common in this location in New Jersey, but many other areas have it. The organism is found in soil and water and is not limited to wooded areas.

The bacteria are just as likely to be found in a small dog from a dog park as in a hunting dog. Animals with exposure to rodents are also quite susceptible to the bacteria. Swimming in pounds, lakes, rivers, or even flooded areas puts pets at high risk of leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis can cause liver and/or kidney disease in your pet. Generally, the pet may have clinical signs similar to a person with the flu, including fever, chills, shakes, vomiting and diarrhea, loss of appetite, dehydration, and even yellowing of the skin or the tissues around the eyes.

While leptospriosis can be treated with supportive care and antibiotics, it can also be transferred to the human caretaker. It is a zoonotic disease. Owners whose pets are diagnosed with the disease should be cautious about cleaning urine or putting their hands in the animal's mouth. Gloves work well for these activities. It is also suggested that you follow your veterinarian's advice for treatment of your pet as well as safety for yourself.

While cats can acquire the disease, it is much rarer in cats.

The disease is preventable with a vaccination. While the leptospirosis vaccine can cause some reaction in some animals, it is not the norm. The vast majority of dogs have no reaction. The most common reaction is a slight swelling and itchiness at the injection site, which often resolves within 24 hours. The vaccine is a great way to protect your pet, which can also protect you. - Mod.TG
