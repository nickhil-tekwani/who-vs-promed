A Timaru [Canterbury region] raw milk supplier is being blamed for an outbreak of the bacterium, _Campylobacter_. A total of 7 cases have been confirmed in those who purchased milk from Timaru Village Milk, but South Canterbury Medical Officer of Health Dr Daniel Williams said that number could be just the "tip of the iceberg." Village Milk shut its doors on Wednesday, 26 Mar 2014, awaiting more test results, and its franchisees have apologised.

Stu and Andrea Weir said correct procedure was not followed. New cows were introduced to the herd prematurely when test results showed contaminants were present. The affected batch of milk was sold over 7 and 8 Mar 2014. "We let people down by not carrying out procedures properly; it's a bit disappointing," Mr Weir said.

Though the Weirs claim raw milk is a completely safe product when procedures are followed, the medical profession and Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) disagree. "Drinking raw milk is risky for your health," Dr Williams said. "It can contain disease-causing bacteria and other organisms which can lead to gastroenteritis and other illnesses, some of which can be life-threatening," he added.

Public Health Ministry for Primary Industries principal adviser Dr Craig Thornley said there was always a risk with raw milk, "even when stringent control measures are followed."

New Zealand legislation allows producers to sell up to 5 litres of raw milk daily at the farm gate to buyers who purchase it for themselves or their families. Ministry of Health data shows there were 5 disease outbreaks due to raw milk consumption between 2007 and 2009, as against 16 in 2010 to 2012. The amount of raw milk sold in New Zealand is unknown, but according to MPI, research suggests between 1 and 3 per cent of the population consume it.

[The following is from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) information sheet regarding unpasteurized milk (http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/consumers/ucm079516.htm):

"Milk and milk products provide a wealth of nutrition benefits. But raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious health risks to you and your family. According to an analysis by the CDC, between 1993 and 2006 more than 1500 people in the USA became sick from drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. In addition, CDC reported that unpasteurized milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness and results in 13 times more hospitalizations than illnesses involving pasteurized dairy products.

Raw milk is milk from cows, sheep, or goats that has not been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. This raw, unpasteurized milk can carry dangerous bacteria such as _Salmonella_, _E. coli_, and _Listeria_, which are responsible for causing numerous foodborne illnesses.

These harmful bacteria can seriously affect the health of anyone who drinks raw milk, or eats foods made from raw milk. However, the bacteria in raw milk can be especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems, older adults, pregnant women, and children. In fact, the CDC analysis found that foodborne illness from raw milk especially affected children and teenagers.

"Pasteurized milk" explained
----------------------------
Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time; 1st developed by Louis Pasteur in 1864, pasteurization kills harmful organisms responsible for such diseases as listeriosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and brucellosis.

Research shows no meaningful difference in the nutritional values of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurized milk contains low levels of the type of nonpathogenic bacteria that can cause food spoilage, so storing your pasteurized milk in the refrigerator is still important.

Raw milk and pasteurization: debunking milk myths
-------------------------------------------------
While pasteurization has helped provide safe, nutrient-rich milk and cheese for over 120 years, some people continue to believe that pasteurization harms milk and that raw milk is a safe, healthier alternative.

Here are some common myths and proven facts about milk and pasteurization:
- Pasteurizing milk DOES NOT cause lactose intolerance and allergic reactions. Both raw milk and pasteurized milk can cause allergic reactions in people sensitive to milk proteins.
- Raw milk DOES NOT kill dangerous pathogens by itself.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT reduce milk's nutritional value.
- Pasteurization DOES NOT mean that it is safe to leave milk out of the refrigerator for extended time, particularly after it has been opened.
- Pasteurization DOES kill harmful bacteria.
- Pasteurization DOES save lives." - Mod.LL
