According to the latest figures from the Morropon-Chulucanas Health Network, the number of cases of anthrax (or carbuncle) has increased to 54 in the province of Morropon, which has alarmed the population of the valley of Alto Piura. The head of the Office of Epidemiology of the Regional Department of Health (Diresa), Edward Pozo Suclupe, announced that among those infected with the deadly illness are 6 11-year-old-children. He said that the patients are receiving treatment.

In the hamlet of Sausal, in the Chulucanas district, a 20-month-old child was found to be infected with anthrax. The specialists from the Morropon-Chulucanas Health Network have found [human] cases in the hamlets of Nomala, Huapalas, and Huasimal. Health brigades continue the search for more cases in those places which gave away and sold infected meat. Newly reported cases are referred to the hospital in Chulucanas.

Meanwhile, the National Service of Agricultural Health (Senasa) continues to vaccinate cattle in the affected areas, which include La Encantada, El Sausal, Nomala, and Huapalas, where cases have been found. They also continue the work of monitoring, control, and prevention of the illness which affects cattle, goats, sheep, and humans who eat contaminated meat.

The director of Agricultural Health in Piura, Esmilda Arevalo, said that the Department of Animal Health has ordered the vaccination of all cattle in the affected areas. Public health authorities have also called for residents of the area of Alto Piura to report strange or unusual cattle deaths so they can then determine if the animal died due to anthrax or another disease dangerous to humans. The head of Epidemiology, Edward Pozo, stated that the cases of anthrax are due to the casualness with which beef is handled and marketed.

[With cattle affected, and probably sheep and goats as well, in 4 villages, I think we can presume that this has been an ongoing problem for a number of years in Piura but below the veterinary radar until the Public Health Service got involved. The possible good news is that they will now initiate a routine annual vaccination of the herds in this part of Piura and be alert for the possibility of cases elsewhere in this province. I don't think they will be disappointed. When you look, you find.

One of the more interesting aspects of livestock and wildlife anthrax is that it is environmentally determined, unless contaminated livestock feed is involved. This means that when you know which strains are affected in your area of interest, the spatial ecological factors can be used to predictively model and map where you can expect to find cases; see http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299709000612 and https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256102685_Ecological_Niche_Modeling_of_Bacillus_anthracis_on_Three_Continents_Evidence_for_Genetic-Ecological_Divergence

The state of Piura is on the northern border with Ecuador; for Morropon, see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Morropon.html, which is 74 km to the east of Piura city. According to Fallingrain (topographic maps) there are 5 towns named 'Sausal, varying in population size from 10 605 to 769 people; this Sausal clusters with the others http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Sausal.html near Chulucanas http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Chulucanas.html; Nomala http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Nomala.html; Huapalas http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/Huapalas.html; La Encantada http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/20/La_Encantada.html. All in all, a tight cluster of human and livestock cases.
