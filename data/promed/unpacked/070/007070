The United Nation System in The Gambia through the World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday [10 Jun 2014] presented an assortment of medical items and other supplies to the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare in Banjul in support of national Ebola virus disease [EVD] preparedness and response efforts.

The donation included more than 42 boxes with 400 sets of personal protective equipment, 2000 copies of posters on the prevention and control of EVD, 25 000 copies of leaflets on EVD, 2000 copies of fact sheets on EVD, 2000 copies of EVD guidelines for health workers, and 200 copies of a handbook on EVD and other haemorrhagic fevers. In addition, the United Nations is providing detergents and other sanitary supplies for infection control, as well as strengthening public awareness and social mobilization through the media, and at the community level.

Speaking at the presentation ceremony held at the local WHO office, Dr Chales Sagoe-Moses, the WHO representative in The Gambia, expressed delight on behalf of the UN System in presenting the items to the Minister of Health. He commended The Gambia government for its timely response to the EVD situation in neighbouring countries, as manifested by the number of preparatory measures already put in place. The purpose of Tuesday's [10 Jun 2014] presentation ceremony was to further consolidate the UN's support to the ongoing preparatory measures, he added.

The United Nations believes that an emergency of this nature poses far-reaching health, economic and social implications to individuals, families, the health system and the country at large, and that the country must be adequately prepared for this, Sagoe-Moses continued. This was why the UN deemed it fit to respond as a single entity to these challenges, rather than intervening within individual domains, he further stated, adding that WHO was tasked to coordinate this effort. The United Nations remains firmly committed to supporting The Gambia in all its efforts to prepare for the Ebola virus disease, he declared.

Health and Social Welfare minister Dr Omar Sey described the donation as "very timely". He stressed the importance of close collaboration between the UN System and Health ministry, and thanked UN for their support to the government of The Gambia.

[3] Gambia: Technical Advisory Committee

Gambian health authorities have been intensifying their sensitisation campaign against Ebola virus, aimed at preventing the highly contagious disease from entering the country.

The latest awareness creation took the officials to the metropolitan town of Brikama, West Coast Region [WCR], where 20 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) members, health workers, community development officers and security personnel gathered at the conference hall of the governor's office on Wednesday [11 Jun 2014] to discuss the dangers and preventive measures for the deadly ebolavirus.

Since its outbreak in Guinea a few months ago and recently in Sierra Leone, West African countries have been on their toes to prevent the highly contagious killer disease. Countries like The Gambia have strengthened national surveillances and adopted other preventive and response mechanisms with a view to meeting the challenge in case of any eventuality. Thus, this sensitisation is one of the mechanisms or strategies the health authorities are using to prevent the disease from hitting The Gambian borders.

The deputy governor of WCR, Bakary Jaiteh, underscored the importance of the sensitisation, and noted The Gambia government has placed high premium on health. "Ebola virus disease [EVD] is a killer disease and thus the sensitisation of the TAC members is important to raise the awareness level of the people," he noted. The regional public health officer, Sanjally Trawally, explained the existence of a surveillance unit at the Health ministry that monitors EVD. He noted that since the outbreak in the sub-region, the disease has killed many people.

[I have been informed that some of my comments on the Harvard reagents and those responsible for lab testing have been incorrect in detail, but it is correct that there have been discordant results between 2 different lab tests in use. I am trying to clarify the implications.

The Gambia is to be commended on its advance preparations, and WHO for supporting them. - Mod.JW
