Scarcity of onions attributed to 'Zazzalau' attack
---------------------------------------------------
The scarcity of onions in the country has been attributed to an
attack of the crop by a disease nicknamed "zazzalau" in Kebbi State.
"The sudden emergence wiped out the booming trade," Habibau
Abdullahi, Onion Farmers Association, said. "The farmers gave the
name to the moisture and heat that destroyed the onions."

He said the onion farmers had complained to the government about the
emergence of the disease but that there had been no response. A
workshop was recently organised in the state-owned university to
improve the production of onions in the area as an export commodity.

[Apparently, a disease or disorder with this name was also reported
from the area in 2003 (see link below). However, it seems a diagnosis
is still not available. We would be most grateful for any further
information on this problem of onion crops in Nigeria.
