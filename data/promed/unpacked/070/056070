The number of people diagnosed with dengue fever in all parts of Thailand has risen significantly this year [2012], with 52 deaths attributed to the mosquito-born disease, a senior health official said on Monday [5 Nov 2012].

Total confirmed infections were 55 485, or 86.82 per 100 000 people, as of [30 Oct 2012]. 52 of them had died, Dr Suwitch Dhammapalo, director of the Disease Control Office 12 in Songkhla, said.

The number of patients fell slightly in July and August [2012] but had risen significantly due to the southern rain season.

He said people in 7 provinces in the lower South -- Songkhla, Satun, Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, Phatthalung, and Trang -- were at risk of continuing outbreaks of dengue fever.

So far, 3633 dengue cases had been reported in the 7 provinces, including 4 deaths. 3 of the fatalities were reported in Songkhla.

Alarmed by the rise in dengue fever in the 1st 4 months of this year [2012], the Public Health Ministry's Disease Control Department launched a nationwide campaign in May to rid the country of as many mosquito breeding grounds as possible.

The Public Health Ministry recently instructed officials in every province to form medical teams with specialised knowledge of dengue fever to visit and bring local physicians up to date on the newest developments in dengue fever diagnosis.

"Dengue fever tends to rise in certain areas and people are encouraged to get rid of mosquito breeding areas around their homes, especially used materials that do not decompose readily, such as foam containers and plastic bags. This will deny mosquitoes areas in which to lay their eggs," Dr Suwitch said.

[According to the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bureau of Vector-borne Disease report on situation of dengue infection in Thailand, week 45 [ending 6 Nov 2012], available in Thai at http://dhf.ddc.moph.go.th/Status/2555/week45.pdf, a total of 59 011 cases and 58 deaths were reported nationwide. The attack rate was 92 per 100 000 population, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.10 per cent. The numbers of dengue cases have risen by 1.12 per cent, compared with the same period in 2011; 58 354 cases and 53 deaths, with a CFR of 0.09 per cent for the same period in 2011.
