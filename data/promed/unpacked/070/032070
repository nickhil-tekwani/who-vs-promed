State media report death of student in Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese student has died from the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the
country's 4th victim of avian influenza this year, state media reported on
Tue [7 Aug 2007]. The 15 year old victim's family had kept ducks at their
home in Thanh Hoa province, south of the capital Hanoi, the state-run
Vietnam News Agency reported. The death, which could not immediately be
verified with government officials, would bring to 46 the number of people
who have died of bird flu in Viet Nam since the killer virus broke out here
in late 2003.
Communist Viet Nam, once the nation worst hit by bird flu, contained
earlier outbreaks through mass vaccination campaigns, the culling of
millions of poultry, and public education initiatives. But the virus
resurfaced strongly earlier this year [2007], especially among waterfowl,
hitting scores of poultry farms in an outbreak that at its peak in May
spread to 18 of Viet Nam's 64 provinces and municipalities.
As of this week, only 3 provinces remained affected, and 160 million head
of poultry had received bird flu shots in the year's first round of
vaccinations which was ongoing or finished in all provinces, officials said.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recorded 319 cases of bird flu in
humans worldwide, 192 of which have been fatal. The Geneva-based body has
yet to confirm the latest death in Viet Nam with laboratory tests.
Experts fear the global death toll could rise sharply if the virus were to
mutate and become easily transmissible between humans, leading to a global
pandemic with the potential to kill millions. Last week [30 Jul - 3 Aug
2007] WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said global bird flu cases appeared to
have stabilised among humans but that several developing nations had not
been able to stem its spread among poultry and domesticated birds. "The
number of human cases of bird flu appears to be stable when compared to the
same period last year," Hartl said. "In the northern hemisphere, the number
of cases in summer has declined marginally from the winter. "Human to human
transmission are very rare. We think there have been 3 cases -- in Viet
Nam, Cambodia and Indonesia. And each time the person has had prolonged and
direct contact with an affected person," Hartl said.
World Bank vice president for East Asia and the Pacific James Adams,
speaking earlier on Tuesday [7 Aug 2007] during a visit to Hanoi, warned
that the bird flu threat remained. "The magnitude of the challenge in this
region is exceptional because this is a region where livestock lives in
close proximity to the human population," he told a Hanoi media briefing.
"We are trying to emphasize from the development side that the needs of the
veterinary systems and the health systems do need to be pushed and have to
be reinforced."

Bird flu has killed a teenager in northern Viet Nam, the 2nd death from the
poultry virus within a week, state-run Viet Nam Television (VTV) quoted
Health Ministry officials as saying on Tuesday [7 Aug 2007].
The 15 year old victim died last Saturday [4 Aug 2007] while on the way to
a Hanoi hospital from the northern province of Thanh Hoa, a VTV news
bulletin quoted health officials as saying without giving the name or
gender of the deceased.
Laboratory tests in Viet Nam have confirmed the patient had contracted the
H5N1 virus, bringing to 7 the number of human infections so far this year
[2007] and the South East Asian country's 4th death from bird flu in 2007.
The teenager developed a fever and received preliminary treatment in Thanh
Hoa province before being rushed to Hanoi. WHO has not confirmed the latest
[that is, a previous] infection from bird flu, which killed a 22 year old
pregnant woman from northern Viet Nam on 27 Jul 2007.
The poultry virus has killed 46 of the 100 confirmed cases in Viet Nam
since late 2003, including the latest death. Globally, the H5N1 virus has
killed 192 people out of 319 known cases, according to a WHO tally [as of
25 Jul 2007]. Hundreds of millions of birds have died or been slaughtered.
The H5N1 virus remains mainly a virus of birds, but experts fear it could
mutate into a form easily transmitted from person to person and sweep the
world, killing millions.

[There is an increasing discrepancy between the number of human cases
confirmed by the Vietnamese Health Ministry and the number listed by WHO.
According to the Vietnamese Health Ministry the death of the student
reported above raises the number of human cases since the beginning of 2007
to 7 with 4 fatalities, and the total number of cases since 2003 to 100
with 46 fatalities. As of 25 Jul 2007 WHO has confirmed only 95 cases and
42 deaths. Clarification of the situated would be welcomed.
