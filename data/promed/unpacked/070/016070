Health authorities in the northern province of Phu Tho, a 2-hour drive northeast of Hanoi, are investigating an HIV outbreak which they suspect is connected to unlicensed examinations offered by a private clinic.

Health officials last month [July 2018] took blood samples from 500 residents in the remote commune to carry out a quick HIV test after 2 people died of HIV/AIDS disease and 4 new HIV cases were spotted in the commune between February and June [2018]. The blood test results found 42 villagers infected with the HIV virus, but the source of infection is yet to be identified.

Among the HIV-infected people in Kim Thuong Commune was an 18-month-old baby girl whose family cannot understand how it happened.

The provincial health department is investigating the outbreak, and it could take several months to come to a final conclusion, some local reports say. However, local residents suspect that a local nurse had used the same needle for injecting several patients, and this could have caused the HIV outbreak. Initial investigation has found most of the infected people used to go to an unlicensed clinic he ran at home to get injections. He was not a doctor and had opened the clinic without permission. However, the man has denied that he is responsible for the outbreak. He has admitted that he opened a home clinic without permission, but has insisted that he did not use one needle for several patients.

Under the Penal Code, those who intentionally spread HIV to other persons can be sentenced to between 3 and 10 years in jail. The offender can face life imprisonment if the victim is a child.

As of last year [2017], Viet Nam had recorded 208 371 HIV-positive people and 83 000 AIDS patients. According to the Health Ministry, around 91 000 HIV-linked deaths have been reported so far.

Currently, only about 40-50 percent of HIV-positive people have health insurance, according to the Viet Nam Administration of HIV/AIDS Control (VAAC).

[Phu Tho, located in northern Viet Nam, is said to be one of Viet Nam's poorest provinces, with a population of over 1.3 million residents; its capital Viet Tri is about 80 km (50 mi) northwest of Hanoi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phú_Thọ_Province).

The news report above suspects that the HIV outbreak in this northern Vietnamese community was caused by an unlicensed person who injected people using the same non-sterilized injection equipment. HIV genotyping would help establish if this is a common source outbreak.

Reusing equipment for injection without adequate sterilization for multiple patients can lead to transmission of several bloodborne pathogens, the most common examples being HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The risk of transmission is greatest for HBV and least for HIV (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/pdfs/bbp/Exp_to_Blood.pdf).

HIV prevalence in Viet Nam among adults (15-49 years of age) is 0.4 percent, with an estimated 11 000 new HIV infections and 7800 AIDS-related deaths in 2016; injecting drug use is the main mode of HIV transmission in Viet Nam, but men who have sex with men and female sex workers and their sexual partners are also at increased risk; and people living with HIV are said to mainly live in large cities and the mountainous provinces (http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/vietnam). - Mod.ML
