Abstract
---------
Background: Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been thought to cause diseases only in animals. However, recent studies have shown that PRV can also cause illnesses in humans.

Methods: This was a case series study. The cases of 5 patients with clinical symptoms of acute encephalitis, which were confirmed to be caused by PRV infections, were reviewed.

Case presentation: The 5 patients all had jobs involving the handling of pigs. They had acute onset and rapid progression of clinical presentations, which were consistent with central nervous system infections. Four of them had respiratory failure, which required ventilator support. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal signals in the bilateral temporal lobes and insular cortex in all 5 patients, bilateral frontal lobes in one patient, and caudate nucleus in one patient. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis results were consistent with a viral infection. Next-generation sequencing of the cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the presence of PRV. All patients received human immunoglobulin, glucocorticoids, antiviral agents, and symptomatic supportive treatments. All patients survived until discharge but suffered from various sequelae. Pneumonia was the most common complication during the disease course.

Conclusions: PRV encephalitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with a clinical presentation of central nervous system infection, especially for those who have had recent contact with pigs.

[Pseudorabies is caused by _Suid herpesvirus 1_, a member of the _Alphaherpesvirinae_ subfamily. Although swine are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. Reports in humans are rare, but this report shows that it may be a risk of concern for people handling swine. - Mod.PMB

ProMED thanks Dr. Fagbo for sending this new article from ISID's own flagship journal, and Dr. Arnon Shimsonsky for background information.
Humans were not thought to be susceptible to PRV infection infections as recently as 2015, but more recent single human case reports and now this well-documented clinical series clearly demonstrate that humans can indeed become infected with PRV, with encephalitis as the dominant clinical picture (see discussion and references in the above article). Since PRV is a herpesvirus, it would be logical to use acyclovir or other nucleoside analogues to treat PRV infections, but there is little in vivo or clinical data regarding their efficacy against this virus. Intravenous human immunoglobulin was given also to all of these patients, presumably based on its putative non-specific anti-inflammatory effects, since the pooled human sera in IVIG is unlikely to contain significant titers of anti-PRV antibodies. Practically speaking, these and other reported Chinese patients were initially diagnosed with HSV or Japanese encephalitis, and the mainstays of treatment for encephalitis remain empiric antiviral drugs, IVIG and glucocorticoids to reduce infammation, and other supportive measures as necessary including mechanical ventilation. - Mod.LXL
