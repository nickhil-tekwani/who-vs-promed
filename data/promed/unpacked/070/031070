Sources say that over the last few weeks, there has been an outbreak
of possible avian influenza near Jiangsu's Haian and Dongtai
[counties]. Local chicken deaths are relatively serious. Egg
production has dropped sharply due to the outbreak. But because [the
outbreak] has not yet been confirmed by authorities, it is still
uncertain whether it is actually avian influenza. Area demand for
poultry feed has dropped under the impact of chicken deaths and
declining egg production.

Based on this correspondent's survey, similar outbreaks have not
occurred in Jiangsu's neighboring areas other than the above 2
places. It is hoped that poultry farmers will quickly take
precautionary measures.

Short-term breeding and feed market outlook
-------------------------------------------
Avian influenza-like outbreaks have occurred in Handan, southern
Hebei [province], as well as in Henan's [province] Shangqiu, and
Jiangsu's [province] Haian, Dongtai, and other places. This will have
a negative impact on the raising of layers and broilers.

[China's most recent reported HPAI (highly pathogenic avian
influenza) H5N1 outbreak was reported from Ya Shan, Jiang'men,
Guangdong. It involved ducks; no vaccination was allowed and the
outbreak was eradicated by the application of stamping out policy
(318 431 ducks destroyed). See the report, including map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7136>.

A useful time-series analysis of China's reported outbreaks since
2006 (where the number of outbreaks and cases are shown), is
available at

(select "China - people's republic of" for the country).

Results of the investigations into the suspected cases above will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS
