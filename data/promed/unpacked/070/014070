ProMED-mail received the following message from Eduardo Serrano on the ProMED-mail Facebook page:

"My grand daughter has been ill of what her pediatrician says is hand-foot-mouth disease. Since it is not a notifiable disease in Mexico there has not been any attempt to isolate the virus. She has had fever and blisters [on her] fingers, hands, and body. It seems there are several kids diseased in the daycare center. She has had 2 fever episodes separated by a week each. [She lives in Colonia Lindavista in Mexico City]."

[This is one of the 1st reports related to an outbreak that ProMED-mail has received on its social media Facebook page. Having reported on 2 prior outbreaks that were uncovered by media participation on Facebook pages (see prior ProMED-mail posts Hand, foot & mouth disease - USA (02): (NC) 20120508.1126671 and Legionellosis - USA: (CA) conference, susp. 20110214.0494), ProMED-mail is impressed with the reach of the social media and potential power as a source of information on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

While the report above mentions that as a non-notifiable disease, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) laboratory testing for type of virus involved was not available, ProMED-mail is reaching out to our subscribers for more information on this ongoing outbreak in Mexico City, especially for possible viral studies as well as epidemiologic investigations.

For the HealthMap/ProMED map of Mexico showing Mexico City, see http://healthmap.org/r/2lQ4. - Mod.MPP]

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) occurs globally. In developed countries HFMD is generally mild and in North America often associated with outbreaks of human Coxsackie A16 virus infection. In East Asian countries in recent years, the disease has been associated with outbreaks of other enteroviruses, and human enterovirus 71 infection in particular which has been associated with more severe outcomes, with a small proportion of children experiencing neurological complications.

Recently human Coxsackie A6 virus has been associated with HFMD in Alabama, USA, although not associated with any marked increase in severity of the disease.

Information on the identity of the virus circulating in Mexico in relation to severity of illness would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
