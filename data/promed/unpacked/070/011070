[This case is now the 2nd case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman in 2017. The previous case this year (2017) was reported to WHO on 30 Aug 2017, and reported by WHO on 12 Oct 2017 (see MERS-CoV (59): Oman, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20170913.5313874). With the addition of this case, it is now the 10th laboratory confirmed case from Oman, in addition to 2 cases from Oman that were confirmed and reported by Thailand.

More detailed information on this newly confirmed case would be greatly appreciated, including age, date of onset, date of laboratory confirmation, high risk exposure history and travel history in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and results of contact tracing/studies.

As of Sun 5 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
1735 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
700 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.3 percent],
1016 recoveries, and
19 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The MERS-CoV continues to circulate in the Middle East with 5 newly confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia in the past 6 days and 1 newly confirmed case reported by Oman.

The cases reported by Saudi Arabia involve 4 individuals from Riyadh region and 1 from Al Qasim region. The total number of laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia is now 1735 including 700 fatalities with a reported case fatality rate of 40.3%. Notably in the past 2 weeks (since 23 Oct 2017) there have been a total of 9 newly confirmed infections with MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia with 4 of these being reported in the 1st 5 days of November 2017.

While we do not wish to delve into political events internationally, an interesting tidbit of the current events ongoing in Saudi Arabia covered by the media is that the response to the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia is mentioned as one of the areas under investigation.
