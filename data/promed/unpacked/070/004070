The biggest outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] since 2014 just took place in Latvia, with a flock of 15 570 domestic pigs affected at a farm in Saldus, western Latvia.

The Food and Veterinary Service told the press that operations at the Druvas Unguri pig farm have been suspended and a zone of quarantine set across the perimeter.

Precise reasons of the outbreak are being investigated.

This is the 8th outbreak of the dangerous porcine disease in Latvia this year [2018], among domestic pigs. It is understood that all the pigs in the affected farm are to be culled, which is standard practice as the disease is highly contagious.

LETA [Latvian news agency] reports that Latvia's cabinet is to convene in an extraordinary meeting at 8.30 am, 3 Aug 2018, to discuss measures over preventing the disease from spreading further.

African swine fever has been detected in 666 wild boar this year [2018; see comment].

Latvia has been suffering the circulation of ASF, predominantly in wild boar, since June 2014. Its most recent 2018 update was presented during the meeting of EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (section Animal Health and Welfare), held in Brussels on 12 Jul 2018. According to the said presentation, since the start of 2018 and as of 10 Jul 2018, a total of 608 wild boars were found ASF-positive, out of 6193 tested animals. They included 5888 hunted animals (362 tested positive), and 305 found dead (246 tested positive). In view of the figure (total 666 as of 1 Aug 2018) presented in the media report above, it may be assumed that 58 additional cases have been added since 10 Jul 2018.

During the said period, 5 ASF outbreaks have been reported in domestic pigs (4 backyard holdings, one commercial farm with 165 animals), as of 10 Jul 2018. In all outbreaks, the EU-prescribed stamping out policy was applied.

Further details, including maps showing, separately, the locations of ASF cases in wild boar and the outbreaks in domestic pig holdings, are available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20180712_pres_asf_lva.pdf.

To view Latvia's ASF situation in the regional context, see ASF interactive map presenting new cases since the start of 2018, at https://tinyurl.com/y899xbvf (click on the Baltic cluster, zoom in). The entire absence of outbreaks on Lithuania's territory, on the map, does not necessarily reflect the factual current situation.

Russia has recently suffered 2 ASF outbreaks on similarly large commercial pig farms, namely in the oblasts of Belgorod and (Baltic region) Kaliningrad, leading to the culling of a very large (5 figure) number of pigs.
