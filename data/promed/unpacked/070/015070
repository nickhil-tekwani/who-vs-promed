According to several sources, malaria cases seen in the fever clinic in Edfu, eastern Aswan, Egypt were all _Plasmodium vivax_, all autochthonous infections, all in Al-Adwa village near Edfu, many in the same family.

Treatment was done with Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine); primaquine is supposed to be given in the immediate future. Blood samples taken from more than 1000 inhabitants in the region were negative for _Plasmodium vivax_. Studies on the anopheles vector are on the way.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Volker Klinnert for this important information. It seems that the cluster is geographically very close, and it is important to genotype the parasite to get an idea of whether this is just a single introduction into a new area.

It is especially important to distinguish between tropical and temperate _P. vivax_ by haplotyping the isolates. Temperate _P. vivax_ has an incubation period of 6 to 9 months, and if found here, investigations should be expanded to include a possible introduction within a much longer period.

ProMED-mail will be happy to post further news including information on the _Anopheles_ species found in the area. - Mod.EP
