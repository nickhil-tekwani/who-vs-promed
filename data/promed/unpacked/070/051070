On 2 Sep 2015, a 27-year-old male presented to outpatient department of the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital [Kathmandu], with a history of fever, body ache, and rash. The [vesicular] rash first appeared in face followed by shoulder, chest, and spread to the remaining parts of the body. He had a history of travel to Samsergunj, a town of Nepalgunj [Banke district], where he stayed at his elder brother's house. His nephews were infected with chickenpox. More than 300 children of his nephew's school have been infected with chickenpox since 17 Jul 2015. His symptoms appeared 10 days after his visit to Nepalgunj. He was treated with acyclovir and improved gradually.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Pun for this firsthand report.

In a 1991 report on seroepidemiology in Nepal (Kubo T, Rai SK, Nakanishi M, Yamano T: Seroepidemiological study of herpes viruses in Nepal. Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1991; 22(3): 323-5; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1667956), only 25 percent of children 1-4 years old showed antibodies to VZV (varicella-zoster virus), but the number of positives increased rapidly with age (82.9 percent in greater than 15 years age). This would suggest that most Nepali adolescents and adults (a cohort with higher risk of more severe illness from varicella) are likely to be immune, but overcrowding in shelters would enhance the likelihood of increased cases. - Mod.LL
