Bird flu outbreak occurs in Laos
--------------------------------
A bird flu outbreak has been confirmed in Donngeun village, Xayaboury
district of Xayaboury province of Laos, Lao newspaper Vientiane Times
reported on Tuesday [4 Nov 2008], citing Xayaboury district governor
Phompan Souththivohaneas saying.

The Xayaboury Provincial Avian Influenza Control Committee has declared a
red zone, which covers areas within one kilometre (0.62 mi) radius of the
outbreak. This area includes the 7 villages, said Phompan on Monday [3 Nov
2008].

All birds in these villages will be slaughtered to prevent the virus from
spreading and the movement, consumption and sale of birds throughout the
district has been banned until further notice. This ban also includes
products made with the blood of poultry.

A yellow zone will be established to include villages that are outside the
red zone, but within 5 km (3.1 mi) of the outbreak. Villagers in the yellow
zone will be advised to destroy birds at the 1st sign of illness, without
waiting to have them tested for the virus.

Phompan said the district public health office was cooperating with the
provincial public health department to monitor people's health,
particularly those living in the red zone.

Checkpoints have also been established throughout the district to prevent
the movement of poultry. These checkpoints will remain in place until 45
days after the last case of the virus is identified.

The National Animal Health Centre (NAHC) in Vientiane received a report on
28 Oct 2008 from the District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO) in
Sayabouli District, Sayabouli Province, regarding mortality in a small
backyard chicken farm. The mortality had started on 27 Oct 2008 with one
chicken dying and continued on 28 Oct 2008 with another 8 dead chickens. On
28 Oct 2008, one of the carcasses was sent by bus to the NAHC laboratory
and arrived on 29 Oct 2008.

On 29 Oct 2008, the carcass was tested positive for avian influenza A on
rapid antigen detection on pooled cloacal, tracheal, kidney, and spleen
swabs. The H5 rapid test was negative. Embryonated eggs were inoculated
from the samples collected and RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction] was conducted with positive results to H5N1.

National animal health staff from central level supported by FAO [UN Food
and Agriculture Organisation] is already in place and an additional team
with additional materials will proceed tomorrow morning [30 Oct 2008] to
Sayabouli District for further investigation and outbreak response monitoring.

From the human health side, WHO (World Health Organisation) informs that
1. provincial health staff have alerted the provincial hospital and ensured
sufficient PPE [personal protective equipment] supplies, tamiflu supplies,
and isolation rooms are ready for suspected cases;
2. district and provincial level health staff will investigate in the
morning, yet claim no reports of suspected cases thus far;
3. national staff to travel Saturday morning [1 Nov 2008] to facilitate
trainings and appropriate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).

The meeting on human health side was carried out this morning [29 Oct 2008]
at the NCLE [National Center for Laboratory and Epidemiology].

The provincial authorities in Sayabouli have been informed and the
declaration of the Governor is expected to be announced today [29 Oct 2008].
