[This report is from one of the main Arabic language newspapers in Sudan. The initial part of the report gives incidence figures that are somewhat lower than those from reports over the past 3 days (see ProMED-mail archives below), so will not be given here. New information follows. - Mod.TY]

Ahmed Ishaq Yaqoub, Minister of Health in West Darfur, pointed to the arrival of 35 mounted spray pump machines mounted [presumably on vehicles? Corr.SB] and a federal health and blood bank equipment worth over one million [Sudanese pounds; USD 225 000]. The Minister of Health in South Darfur, Ahmed Al-Tayeb, said that the disease is spreading to new areas of the state and new cases must be expected. He pointed out that intensive efforts are under way to combat and trap mosquitoes which transmit the disease. The good news is that a conference [was held?] in Nyala on Monday (Nyala had recorded 2 cases in southern and northern areas of the State) and a programme of education and Health is being undertaken to inform the public about the dangers of the disease.

Newspaper sources state that about 10 000 workers in the gold mines fled to Nyala after the spread of yellow fever in the mining areas of Jebel Amer. This has created concern and tension among the citizens in Nyala with the possibility of transferring the infection to the cities with the event of carriers of this disease. The sources added that the mining area had more than 60 cases. A prospector, with family, said some miners had come from the neighboring countries of Chad and the Central African Republic. The spread of the disease in South Darfur is a disaster and the epidemic requires organizations and the international community to address the disease and provide enough vaccines to vaccinate all citizens of the state, especially to [be provided to] the Nyala Teaching Hospital where many of the patients in critically ill condition are being treated. The referral hospital for the states of Central and Southern Darfur is in a deplorable state from the accumulation of hundreds of patients, some sleeping on the ground outside, lack of medical staff, and acute shortage of medical equipment.

Observers fear of the spread of the disease to the south side of South Darfur state with the nomadic movement that started from the north (of Darfur). It is important to provide vaccines that protect all the citizens of the state from this incurable disease.

[Re "...vaccinate all citizens of the state, especially to [be provided to] the Nyala Teaching Hospital where many of the patients in critically ill condition are being treated...": the medical and nursing staff at that hospital were reportedly vaccinated on Tue 20 Nov 2012, so will be protected by the end of the month. Vaccination cannot help inpatients.

Re "...some miners had come from the neighboring countries of Chad and the Central African Republic..." If there is already YF in the mining camps, miners fleeing back to those countries rather than to Nyala will pose a threat to those countries.

West Darfur
-----------
The death toll as a result of the yellow fever epidemic in West Darfur has risen to 47, while the total number of infections reached a number of 157, Radio Dabanga learned on Wednesday 21 Nov [2012].

Ahmed Ishaq Yaqoub, West Darfur's Health Minister, told Radio Dabanga that 2 people passed away on Wednesday [21 Nov 2012] as a result of the fever, thus bringing the death toll to 47. He added that the state of West Darfur did not experience any issues with the vaccines so far; however, he claimed that some of the centers remain empty due to the remote location.

The minister explained that the campaign will continue for 11 more days, which he considers to be sufficient for vaccinating all citizens in West Darfur's 4 localities. Yaqoub announced that all schools in the state have been visited and all pupils have been vaccinated in the meantime.

West Darfur's health minister added that he visited the localities of Foro Baranga and Habila on Wednesday [21 Nov 2012] to check the conditions of the hospitals and to ensure that all patients are received and vaccinated. [Vaccinating individuals who are ill with yellow fever virus infections is not effective treatment because the vaccination comes too late. If the statement means that well individuals are being vaccinated at the hospital, that is a preventive measure. - Mod.TY]

He appealed to the citizens in the affected localities to go to the vaccination centers.

North Darfur
------------
At the same time, Abu al-Abbas Abdullah al-Tayyeb, North Darfur's Health Minister, told Radio Dabanga that 250 000 doses of the vaccine have arrived in the state. He claims this is not sufficient to cover all the affected areas, adding in a press statement that the vaccines will be distributed to the localities adjacent to the regions where the disease is still spreading.

The minister announced that the vaccination campaign will start on Wednesday [21 Nov 2012] and will continue for 12 days in the localities of Sreif and Saraf Omra, he added to Radio Dabanga.

[The stated lack of sufficient YF vaccine, and the relatively brief time allocated for application (11-12 days), considering the large geographic area and scattered cases within it, are a cause for serious concern. Adequate surveillance to promptly detect new cases in new locations is also a significant challenge in the Darfur states. The reports above indicate that spraying is an additional measure to halt transmission. As noted in previous comments, this will provide only temporary mosquito vector control if not accompanied by elimination of breeding sites. - Mod.TY
