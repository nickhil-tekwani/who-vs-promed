Isolated avian flu outbreak in Cape 'cannot spread to humans'
-------------------------------------------------------------
Fears that a dangerous avian flu has hit the Western Cape are unfounded,
provincial veterinary services say.
What has occurred is an isolated outbreak of a strain of avian flu which
cannot spread to humans and which causes low death rates among poultry.
James Kitching, acting director for veterinary services in the Western
Cape, said yesterday there had been "rumours and a bit of panic" among some
members of the public who feared that the killer bird flu from Asia had
found its way to South Africa.
Kitching said: "This is not the case. What we have here is an isolated
instance of a low pathogenic strain of avian flu, which means it causes
very little damage among poultry. It cannot spread to humans. There has
been only one outbreak in the Western Cape, at 5 sites of one commercial
poultry setup in the Malmesbury/Klapmuts region.
"There are rumours that this is the same type of virus as the one in Asia,
but it is not. The virus that has broken out here is known as H6. We have
outbreaks from time to time of H6 all over the country.
"The Asian flu virus is H5 and this is the one that seems to affect humans.
We have never had H5 in this country and we hope never to have it."
Another strain, H7, occurred in Canada and the US and had also not occurred
in South Africa.
Kitching said the commercial outfit had notified the state vet in Pretoria
when the outbreak of H6 flu had been discovered. They in turn had notified
the Western Cape offices.
H6 was not a notifiable disease, he said.
"When it's a low pathogenic flu like this Pretoria notifies us in due
course, but if it is a high pathogenic flu they will hit the wires to us fast."

[A mild form of avian influenza has been diagnosed in poultry in the
Camperdown area of KwaZulu-Natal,South Africa, in July 2002. It caused mild
respiratory disease and a temporary drop in egg production (see reference).
As Dr Kitching rightly says, H6 influenza viruses -- in contrast with H5
and H7 -- are not related to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) nor
have they been found engaged in human infection.
It would be helpful if more information is provided about the
clinical observations in the currently 5 affected holdings.
In 1961, die-off of large numbers of terns was observed in South Africa;
it was reportedly caused by an H5N3 (A/tern/South Africa/61) AI
virus. See Becker, W.B., (1966). The isolation and classification of
tern virus: Influenza virus A/tern/South Africa/1961. Journal of Hygiene
64, 309-320. - Mod.AS]
