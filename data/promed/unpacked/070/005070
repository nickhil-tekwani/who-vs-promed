[2] WHO situation report 3 Jun 2015
Date: Wed 3 Jun 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://apps.who.int/ebola/en/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-3-june-2015


Since the week ending 10 May [2015], when a 10-month low of 9 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported from 2 prefectures of Guinea and one district of Sierra Leone, both the intensity and geographical area of EVD transmission have increased. In the week ending 31 May [2015, a total of 25 confirmed cases were reported from 4 prefectures of Guinea and 3 districts of Sierra Leone. Several cases in both Guinea and Sierra Leone arose from unknown sources of infection in areas that have not reported confirmed cases for several weeks, indicating that chains of transmission continue to go undetected. Rigorous contact tracing, active case finding, and infection prevention and control must be maintained at current intensive levels in order to uncover and break every chain of transmission. However, the onset of the rainy season will make field operations more difficult from now onwards.

A total of 13 cases were reported from 4 western prefectures of Guinea in the week to 31 May [2015]. Most cases (7) were reported from the prefecture of Forecariah, which borders Sierra Leone. Multiple chains of transmission gave rise to cases in 4 of Forecariah's 10 sub-prefectures, although all cases were either registered contacts of a previous case or had an established epidemiological link to one. The remaining cases were reported from the north western prefecture of Boke (1 case), which borders Guinea-Bissau; the west coast prefecture of Dubreka (4 cases), which borders the capital, Conakry; and the western inland prefecture of Fria (1 case).

Community engagement has proved challenging in all 4 affected prefectures of Guinea, with several reported incidents of violence directed at field staff during the past week. In addition, 4 of the 13 nationally reported cases were identified only after post-mortem testing of community deaths. Of those 4 community deaths, 2 were registered contacts, suggesting that even when contacts can be traced, regular monitoring to ensure they receive prompt testing and treatment as soon as symptoms arise remains a challenge.

Sierra Leone reported a total of 12 cases from 3 districts in the week to 31 May [2015]. The majority of cases (8) were reported from a densely populated area of the Kaffu Bullom chiefdom in the district of Port Loko, just north of the capital, Freetown. All but one of the cases were registered contacts of previous cases within quarantined houses in the chiefdom. The additional case is from the same neighbourhood but was not on a contact list and was living in a non-quarantined home at the time of symptom onset. The district of Kambia reported its 1st case for over 2 weeks on 31 May [2015]. The case was identified after a post-mortem test of a community death and was not a known contact of a previous case. The remaining 3 cases were reported from the capital, Freetown. At this time, none of those 3 cases can be linked to previous chains of transmission, although investigations are at an early stage.

As at 31 May [2015], a total of 1880 contacts associated with reported confirmed cases were under follow-up in 6 Guinean prefectures: Boke, Conakry, Dubreka, Forecariah, Fria, and Kindia.

A total of 461 contacts were under follow-up in 3 districts of Sierra Leone: Kambia, Port Loko, and Western Area Urban (the area that includes the capital, Freetown).

Two response teams from Guinea-Bissau have been deployed to the border with Guinea to assess several points of entry and sensitize communities.

The last health worker infections in Guinea and Sierra Leone were reported on 6 Apr and 14 May [2015], respectively. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths...

[3] Liberia: Ebola treatment unit workers protest
Date: Sat 30 May 2015
Source: Front Page Africa [edited]
http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/5366-ebola-treatment-unit-workers-protest-hazard-benefits


Ebola treatment unit workers have staged another protest in demand for hazard benefits from the Government of Liberia. After the Ebola crisis in Liberia, people involved in the fight against the deadly Ebola virus that killed more than 4000 Liberians have been protesting, demanding hazard benefits.

Holding placards in front of the president's office at the Foreign Ministry, the group through their spokesperson James Baysay said they are from different ETUs [Ebola treatment units] including ELWA, the Unity Conference Center, Island Clinic and Old Defense Ministry, and they gathered to remind President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of the alleged promise that she was going to call them after 3 days when they gathered close to her residence on 14 May [2015] to demand benefits.

"We went to her residence, and she told us that she was going to call us in 3 days' time, but since then, we have not received any call from her. The government should have given us our benefits. When we met the president last week on Thu [28 May 2015], she promised that she was going to call us, but up to now, we have not received any call from her yet, so we have come to remind her," Baysay said.

He recalled that during the turning over ceremony at ELWA, they were also present at that occasion, and they were able to put forth their demands but said they were advised to put their demands in writing, something, which according to him, was done. But still their demands have not been met ...

[This article also has the story of the stigma an individual is facing for working in an Ebola treatment center, not only from her landlord but also her family. This is an added burden on top of not receiving benefits for this difficult but important work. It is not clear what is preventing the workers from being paid. - Mod.LK]

[4] Sierra Leone: Ebola rages afresh in Kaffu Bullom
Date: Sun 1 Jun 2015
Source: Awareness Times Newspaper [edited]
http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200527697.shtml


Significant concerns were raised over the weekend ending 31 May 2015, when it emerged that Kaffu Bullom Chiefdom, which includes Lungi, is now a new hotspot for active transmission of the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone. Within the last week, Ebola has killed at least half a dozen in Kaffu Bullom with even more getting infected. This has caused quarantining of many persons in the chiefdom.

Reports are that an Ebola patient was sneaked into Kaffu Bullom chiefdom from Kambia district a few weeks back, and this is what has set off the chain reaction of Ebola infections in Kaffu Bullom. Meanwhile, an alert issued by Madam Zulaitu Cooper of the National Ebola Response Center has called on members of the public to be on a high alert for a family of 5 persons who fled quarantine in Kaffu Bullom. They are believed to have fled to hide in the Waterloo parts of Rural Western Area.

Awareness Times has now learnt that following their escape, and to prevent any repeat escapes, dozens of armed soldiers were deployed at entry and exit points in suspect parts of Kaffu Bullom. Food and medical supplies are allowed in, but no unauthorised movements in or out of those areas are now allowed.

Those who escaped quarantine [have been identified]. "The family is at the top chain of high risk contacts and needs to be apprehended. Your help is needed, please. We need to use the radio, TV, and all forms of media to locate them," the hardworking Cooper is appealing.

[Continuing violent protests against anti-Ebola controls in north Guinea have prompted the Red Cross to withdraw workers, undermining efforts to stop the spread of Ebola into neighboring Guinea-Bissau, with which Guinea shares a border.
