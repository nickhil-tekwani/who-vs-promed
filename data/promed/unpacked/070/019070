According to the state, Martha's Vineyard surpassed Nantucket in the
number of reported cases of Lyme disease in 2005, the most recent
year for which data is available.

According to Nantucket Doctor Tim Lepore: "A number of cases don't
get reported. Reporting can be fairly tiresome. You have to submit a
form, then the state sends you another form to fill out, and you have
to send that in. Not everyone has the time." Lepore said he expects
this tick season [2007] to be bad, if not record-setting, because of
a wet spring and the number of cases rising year after year. "It's
going to be a banner year," said Lepore, who could not mention Lyme
disease without stating his desire to bring back the winter deer hunt
aimed at thinning the heard and the disease-carrying the deer. There
are approximately 50 deer per square mile on the island right now,
compared to the statewide average of 10-15 deer per square mile, he said.

According to the state Department of Public Health, in 2005 there
were only 29 confirmed cases of Lyme disease on Nantucket, compared
to 90 on Martha's Vineyard. Extrapolating those numbers for cases per
100 000, Nantucket would have reported 285 cases compared to the
Vineyard's 577 cases. The state average was 36 cases per 100 000,
according to the Department of Public Health records.

Lepore said his office has already had 2 cases this year [2007],
which he said was early in the season, with cases normally being
reported deep into July and August.

According to the DPH, Lyme disease, named after the Connecticut town
where it was discovered, is a bacterial infection transmitted to
humans through the bite of a deer tick. Symptoms include a rash at
the site of the bite, flu-like symptoms and sore joints. The disease
is treatable with a regimen of antibiotics, but some have issues for
years following exposure to the bacteria.

Lyme disease is not the only disease carried by the ticks. Others
include ehrlichiosis, which is potentially paralytic and fatal. It
begins with a minor paralysis and gets worse. Babesiosis is
malaria-like in its manifestation and can cause a very high fever.
The disease can create an enlarged liver and spleen and an extremely
low red blood cell count.

Cases of people contracting Lyme disease have risen nearly every year
in the last 15 years. According to the DPH, in the early 1990s, cases
reported in all of Massachusetts hovered around 200 until shooting up
in the late 1990s from 400 in 1996 to almost 1200 in 2000. In 2001,
the number was slightly above the year before, rising to almost 2000
in 2002, dropping slightly the next 2 years, only to rise again in
2005 to 2200 reported cases.

Another reason Lepore said many cases of Lyme disease do not get
reported on Nantucket is the transient tourist population that is
here in the summer, when most, if not all, people contract the
bacterial disease. Lepore said people often get bitten here while on
vacation and return home before symptoms set in. "I get calls all the
time from places like British Columbia, France, Switzerland," said
Lepore. "Tick-borne diseases have an incubation period. People come
here for a week, get bitten and return home and then feel sick."

Deer ticks are usually no bigger than a poppy seed or a small freckle
on the body. If a deer tick bites a person and is engorged for more
than 24 hours, chances are at least 40 percent for contracting Lyme
disease. A person can obtain one, 2 or all 3 tick-borne diseases with
one bite. Deer ticks are most abundant along the edges of wooded
areas and also feed off birds, dogs, cats and occasionally humans.
The deer tick prefers the fringes of shrubby woodlands where deer are
plentiful, whether near marshes, on sand dunes or in upland fields.

[Lyme disease (due to _Borrelia burgdorferi_), human monocytic
ehrlichiosis (HME) (due to _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_), human
granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) (due to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_),
and babesiosis (due to _Babesia microti_) are all tick-borne
zoonoses. In the U.S., Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis
share a common vector, _Ixodes scapularis_, which along with small
mammals, especially the white-footed mouse, maintain the organisms in
nature, and as a result have a common geographic distribution in the
northeastern and upper Midwest U.S., where this tick is commonly
found. Patients with any one of the diseases that is transmitted by
_Ixodes scapularis_ may also be concurrently infected with the other
diseases transmitted by this vector. Approximately 20 percent of
patients with babesiosis are co-infected with Lyme disease, and 6-21
percent of patients with anaplasmosis have serologic evidence of Lyme
disease or babesiosis.

In Europe and Asia, the primary vectors of Lyme disease are _I.
ricinus_ and _I. persulcatus_, respectively, which also transmit
tick-borne encephalitis. In contrast, the usual insect vector of
ehrlichiosis is _Amblyomma americanum_, the Lone Star tick, which,
along with the white-tailed deer, maintains _Ehrlichiae_ in nature,
which, as a result, are mainly found in the southeastern and
south-central U.S., where the Lone Star tick is commonly found.
Because of different tick vectors, patients with ehrlichiosis are
unlikely to be co-infected with either Lyme disease or babesiosis.

The risk of developing these infections depends upon the density of
ticks and the animal hosts in a particular geographic location, the
season of the year, and, most importantly, how long the tick has
attached to the skin. _B. burgdorferi_ is infrequently transmitted
before the tick is engorged with blood after having been attached for
24-48 hours. Only a small percent of cases recall a tick bite,
because of the small size of the nymphal tick, the primary vector.
Attached nymphal ticks might not be noticed and, therefore, not
removed before disease transmission occurs.

Deer are important for maintaining the life cycle of _I. scapularis_.
Deer supply the adult tick with a place to mate and provide a good
blood meal for the female adult tick, which is necessary for
successful egg production. Reducing the deer population in island or
peninsular communities has been shown to reduce the tick densities to
very low levels; see
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=AbxtractPlus&list_uids=15311475>.

Surveillance systems based on case report forms likely substantially
under-represent the true burden of these tick-borne diseases in the
United States due to poor physician recognition and reporting.
Surveillance case definitions also may capture only those patients
with the specified clinical findings; patients with less severe
disease, for example, may be excluded. These tick-borne diseases may
also be under-reported in tourist areas, such as Nantucket or
Martha's Vineyard, because although the disease was acquired in these
localities, patients develop symptoms several weeks later when they
have returned home. For example, rates of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis
and ehrlichiosis are significantly higher in Manhattan than in the
other New York City (NYC) boroughs. This has been attributed to
socioeconomic factors and prevalence of travel to vacation areas
where the particular tick vector is prevalent. The majority of Lyme
disease (91 percent), HME, and HGA cases (85 percent) reported a
history of travel, compared to fewer than 50 percent of Rocky
Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) cases in NYC. These data support tick
surveillance findings and suggest that RMSF can be acquired locally,
while Lyme, HME and HGE are likely acquired during travel to endemic
areas outside of NYC. The vector for RMSF, _Dermacentor variabilis_
(the American dog tick), has been detected in great abundance in all
boroughs of NYC; see
<http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/zoo/07vet06>.

Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis can cause
non-specific systemic symptoms of chills and fever during the summer.
_B. microti_ is an intraerythrocytic parasite that results in
hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and atypical lymphocyte
formation; intraerythrocytic parasites (ring forms with a central
pallor) and, rarely, pathognomonic tetrads of budding trophozoites,
the so-called Maltese cross, may be seen in Wright- or Giemsa-stained
peripheral blood smears. Leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated
serum transaminases occur in HME and HGA. Intracellular organisms can
be visualized within neutrophils in 20 to 80 percent of patients with
HGA, unlike the rarity of visualizing organisms within circulating
mononuclear cells in HME. Serology and PCR testing are also available
for diagnosis. For a more detailed description of these diseases, please see

Diseases, 6th edition, from which portions of this comment were extracted.
