On Wednesday the European Union veterinary chiefs rejected tighter controls
on cattle parts most at risk of carrying BSE in what this story calls a
move which threatens a transatlantic trade row by default. The EU's
Standing Veterinary Committee voted down a European Commission proposal to
increase consumer protection by excluding from the food chain by law the
so-called Specified Risk Materials (SRMs) such as the spinal cords, brains
and eyes of cattle.
The vote -- not one country supported it -- is another blow for the
Commission, which has been trying to get EU legislation through on this
matter for two years. Each time member states, worried over extra financial
costs, have thwarted it.
Wednesday's vote now leaves in place even wider-ranging rules due to come
into force by default on January 1, under which an already proposed SRM ban
would be extended to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, many of which contain
cattle derivatives such as tallow. This legislation provoked an angry
reaction from the United States, which said it threatened billions of
dollars' worth of trade. Since then, the Commission has proposed various
amendments to work round the problem -- the latest proposal gave a complete
derogation to pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

[Apparently, the German government view was as they didn't have BSE why go
to all this extra expense. Presumably the others felt more or less the
same. - Mod.MHJ]
