The Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced today test results
for West Nile Virus Surveillance. Eighteen birds that died between 19-23
Aug 2000 were found to be infected with West Nile Virus (WNV). One group of
_Culex_ species mosquitoes collected on 20 Aug 2000 from the Jamaica Plain
area of Boston was found positive for WNV. Of the 18 birds, there were 16
American crows, 1 sparrow and 1 bluebird. The total number of WNV-infected
birds to date in Massachusetts is now 54. Six crows, 1 sparrow and 1
bluebird were found in Brookline, 2 crows in the Jamaica Plain section of
Boston, and 1 crow in each of the following cities or towns: Cambridge,
Framingham, Holliston, Medford, Middleborough, Peabody, Seekonk and
Waltham. The findings for Cambridge, Framingham, Medford, Peabody, Seekonk
and Waltham were the first WNV-infected birds found this year in those
locations. The total number of WNV-infected mosquito pools to date is 2,
one in Brookline and 1 in Jamaica Plain.
The total number of WNV birds by location to date is Brookline (21); Boston
(14) which includes 10 from Jamaica Plain, and 1 each from Brighton, West

To date, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 19 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. In addition to
the one positive result, tests for 5 individuals have been negative and the
other test results are pending. These individuals either had symptoms
and/or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or exhibited
most of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows with the virus
have been discovered.
To date, 496 birds (495 crows and a cockatiel) found in 10 counties have
tested positive for the presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in
Bergen (122), Essex (63), Hudson (48), Mercer (1), Middlesex (114),
Monmouth (54), Morris (6), Passaic (36), Somerset (2) and Union (50)
Counties. A total of 1 077 crows have been accepted for testing this year.
A total of 5 mosquito pools collected in Bergen County have tested positive
for the presence of WNV. More than 1 400 mosquito pools from all 21
counties have been collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control
Unit and tested by the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21
counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture have all
been negative for the presence of WNV to date. And blood samples of 1 115
house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex Counties and tested
by the CDC also did not detect WNV.

First confirmed West Nile virus-infected crow in New Hampshire
--------------------------------------------------------------
MANCHESTER: New Hampshire's first confirmed case of West Nile virus was
detected in a dead crow in Manchester, state and city officials announced
on Wednesday [30 Aug 2000. It is the first confirmation of the virus in
northern New England, although cases have cropped up in Massachusetts
[birds, horse and Connecticut [birds.
The crow was collected by the city's health officers 21 Aug 2000 and
submitted for testing at the state Department of Health and Human Services
Public Health Laboratories.
[West Nile virus likely exists in other parts of the state, said Jesse
Greenblatt, state epidemiologist with the state Department of Health and
Human Services' Office of Community and Public Health. The arrival of the
virus was only a matter of time and it could be here to stay, health
experts said during a news conference at Manchester City Hall to disclose
the findings. "West Nile virus is [both a short-term challenge and a
long-term challenge," Greenblatt said. "The virus will be present until
first frost here in northern New England, and then it may be here to stay
[if it is able to over-winter".
Additional birds are being collected and tested. Manchester and state
officials are continuing to trap and test mosquitoes for the virus, and are
considering spraying in at least a two-mile radius of where the dead crow
was located. Greenblatt said more than 40 birds have been collected
[already for testing. He said the presence of a single dead bird is not a
good measure of how the virus is affecting New Hampshire or the region. The
decision to spray for mosquito control is a local decision, town by town.
Greenblatt said no other towns in New Hampshire are now conducting spraying
specifically for the West Nile virus. There are only 9 mosquito spraying
programs in New Hampshire, most located in the Seacoast where wetlands and
marshes are widespread. While the Seacoast has one of the state's greatest
populations of mosquitoes due to the preponderance of wetlands, West Nile
virus is not associated with the quicker breeding saltmarsh mosquitoes. The
virus is documented in the mosquito species known as _Culex pipiens_, which
is more likely to be in urban and wet areas, such as catch basins.
The Department of Health and Human Services has a 7-day, 24-hour toll-free
West Nile virus informational hot line to help residents with concerns or
questions, or to report dead birds. The free number is (866) 273-6453.

Maine State to initiate testing of dead birds for West Nile virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Scientists at Maine's Health Laboratory have issued a public appeal for
dead birds from around the state so they can test them for the West Nile
virus, which has plagued New York and moved as far north as New Hampshire.
State health officials have established a 24-hour, toll-free hot line,
(888) 697-5846, to accept reports of dead birds, particularly crows.
Fortunately, temperatures in Maine will drop soon and mosquito activity
will all but cease, so even a positive finding would hold little threat for
humans.

West Nile Virus-infected bird found close to U.S.-Canadian border
-----------------------------------------------------------------
BROCKVILLE: Health officials in upper New York State have confirmed a case
of the deadly West Nile Virus in a dead bird found in St. Lawrence County,
about 45 kilometres south of the Canada-U.S. border. A dead bird found in
the town of Parishville, N.Y., tested positive for the virus, the St.
Lawrence County Public Health Department said yesterday in a press release.
The bird was brought to authorities for testing about 2 weeks ago.
Evidence [? of the virus that killed 7 people and sickened 62 more during
an outbreak last summer in New York City was found last month in Tonawanda,
N.Y., just east of Niagara Falls. Over the past month, residents in the
Niagara region have responded to the health unit's request that they be on
the lookout for dead crows, blue jays, ravens and other birds. More than 50
of the birds that were collected were shipped off to the University of
Guelph for testing, but none were infected with the virus. The health unit
said it would continue to pick up dead birds for testing until the mosquito
season ends in the fall. There is as yet no evidence that the virus has
crossed into Canada.

West Nile Virus Surveillance in Canada: a comment
-------------------------------------------------
A recent posting on West Nile surveillance in Canada mentioned our dead
bird surveillance, but focused on our sentinel chicken program. It is
interesting to note that there has been a particular fascination by the
press about our sentinel chickens. We decided to use sentinel chickens due
to the fact that this system has been very successful in Canada for the
early detection of western equine encephalitis virus activity and due to
reports of West Nile virus antibodies in chickens in New York last year
following the outbreak. This program will be continued for the rest of the
year but will be seriously reevaluated at year's end.
I think it is important to stress that we have also been undertaking dead
bird surveillance since Jun [2000 which has proven to be a very effective
early warning system. The lead for this surveillance has been taken by the
Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre, a virtual centre comprised of
our 4 Canadian veterinary colleges in Saskatoon, Guelph, St Hyacinthe and
Charlottetown. Some additional testing is being done by selected provincial
veterinarians. This is not a casual undertaking waiting for the occasional
dead bird to be reported but has been widely publicized in order to solicit
public support in reporting dead birds. There are no guarantees that there
cannot be a human case or two in Canada without previous evidence in dead
birds but the current experience in the United States provides us some
reassurance that we are on the right track in our surveillance efforts.

Sentinel chickens: some questions
---------------------------------
No substantive details are available about how sentinel chickens are being
used in the West Nile virus-active zone. Any surveillance method for a
mosquito-borne pathogen will fail if (1) it is inappropriate for the local
vector-pathogen cycle, (2) if it is inadequately implemented, or (3) if it
is applied to an inappropriate surveillance goal.
We deserve to be hearing more than unsubstantiated claims that "sentinels
are not working." Would anyone along the upper east coast USA care to
inform us (a) when sentinel chickens were first placed in field sites in
their area, (b) whether serum samples are obtained weekly, (c) whether
bleeding is by venipuncture or comb stick, (d) the specific serologic tests
performed, or (e) numbers of chickens or flocks deployed locally? Did
anyone have sentinels in the field in May or Jun [2000?
