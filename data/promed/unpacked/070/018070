Victoria Ramirez, provincial deputy of the Santa Fe [province], is
requesting that the Ministry of Health adopt all necessary measures to
prevent the spread of leishmaniasis, a disease that is present in the
departments of the north of Santa Fe province and which threatens to become
an epidemic.

Her arguments are, "Canine visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease
transmitted through the bite of [an infected] mosquito. The disease,
typical of tropical countries, is present in the north of the [Santa Fe]
province. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt urgent measures to prevent
its spread, which could lead to an epidemic.

"The Ministry of Health recently warned that, in addition to the provinces
of Misiones and Corrientes where the focus of infection is important, the
provinces of Chaco, Entre Rios, and Santa Fe are also vulnerable to the
disease.

"Both the cutaneous and visceral forms of leishmaniasis are treatable, but
they can be fatal if not detected promptly and treated adequately. [The
disease is transmitted when a mosquito bites an infected dog, becomes
infected, and bites a human]. Therefore, it is important to avoid the
presence of the vector through insecticides and repellents to prevent
mosquito bites.

"In our province, cases have been detected in animals that should have been
culled, but fortunately the disease hasn't been transmitted to humans. At
the rural level, other warm blooded animals, such as horses, pigs, and
rats, are also potential transmitters of the disease.

"The veterinary colleges of the south of Santa Fe province warned that
during the next summer season [2009], we will be exposed to the risks of
spread of this chronic disease. Therefore, it is essential to adopt
preventive measures," concluded Ramirez.

[A total of 4 autochthonous cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) were
reported in La Banda, Santiago del Estero, from June 2007 to May 2008
(Salomon OD, et al. Lutzomyia migonei as putative vector of visceral
leishmaniasis in La Banda, Argentina. Acta Trop 2009 Aug 28. [Epub ahead of
print]
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19716797?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=2>).

Argentina reported 14 human leishmaniasis cases with visceral involvement
from 1925 to 1989. However, the risk of VL transmission changed when
Paraguay reported an autochthonous human case during 2000 in Asuncion, just
across the border with Clorinda city, Formosa, Argentina. From 2000 until
2006, the Program of Leishmaniasis of Paraguay recorded 126 cases of human
VL (66 only in 2006), 90.1 per cent from Asuncion and the nearest
Department of Central and also reported a high proportion of VL-infected
dogs in the same departments of the human cases (Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz
2008; 103: 109-11 <http://www.scielo.br/pdf/mioc/v103n1/97.pdf>).

A recent study found that Clorinda is still at high risk of becoming an
intense focus of VL transmission and a source of dispersion to the south
along the highly trafficked roads; however, after 3 years the vector has
not colonized the closest villages. The VL canine prevalence is not a good
space-time indicator of parasite circulation or transmission intensity in
these early VL scenarios close to borders with active VL transmission
(Salomon OD, et al. Visceral leishmaniasis in border areas: clustered
distribution of phlebotomine sand flies in Clorinda, Argentina. Mem Inst
Oswaldo Cruz 2009; 104: 801-4
(<http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf&pid=S0074-02762009000500024&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en>)).

In the Iguazu Falls area, on the border between Brazil and Paraguay, the
incidence of human American cutaneous Llishmaniasis (ACL) has risen since
2004. Most of the 36 cases of human ACL reported until 2005 have been males
over 15 years old (75 per cent) infected during deforestation to establish
individual farms (Salomon OD, et al. Epidemiological aspects of cutaneous
leishmaniasis in the Iguazu falls area of Argentina. Acta Trop 2009; 109:
5-11
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18983809?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&ordinalpos=4>).
