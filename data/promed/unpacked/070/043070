The first case of a highly contagious flu among birds known as avian influenza has been confirmed in Allegan County. An eagle in Allegan county was tested and confirmed positive for a variant of bird flu on [17 May 2022] according to the Allegan County Health Department (ACHD).

It is the first confirmed case in the county, although 3 dead geese have also been tested for the disease. Results from those geese are expected to take a week before they're in.

The Allegan County Health Department (ACHD) said it is notifying people who own or work with birds within the county to take recommended precautions.

In the state of Michigan, the bird flu has been identified in both backyard domestic birds and wild birds.

The same highly contagious bird flu was found in a non-commercial backyard flock of about 20 birds of various species in Branch County on [30 Apr 2022], just 10 days after the Department of Natural Resources advised Michigan residents to remove bird feeders to slow down the spread of the disease.

The public health risk associated with this bird flu remains low, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease is reported to spread easily among birds and in rare cases can infect humans.

Bird flu in birds is also considered to not be a food safety concern if poultry and eggs are cooked correctly.

Four snow geese tested positive for avian influenza also known as 'bird flu.'

A Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife biologist and a Moses Lake veterinarian tested the snow geese.

The Grant County Health District says these detections don't change the risk to the public.

A mass die-off of wild vultures, some of which tested positive for avian influenza, was recently found in Charleston County.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control is urging the public to make sure their pets and domestic animals avoid contact with dead or sick vultures, other birds, and wild animals. DHEC also recommends that residents avoid areas where dead birds have been found.

While the risk of bird flu transmission to people or pets and tame animals is thought to be low, the risk is also not well known and is best avoided by not having contact with dead birds, the DHEC states. The virus causing the bird flu can be spread through feathers and fecal material or areas and items contaminated by infected birds.

Handling dead birds without recommended protective measures increases the risk of transmission. DHEC says the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources will continue monitoring and surveillance and encourages members of the public to report unusual bird mortality events.

If you come into contact with a dead vulture or other dead bird in the area, please seek medical attention if you become ill with symptoms of fevers, cough, fatigue, body aches, etc., and report your potential exposure to your health care provider and local health department. DHEC recommends monitoring for symptoms for 10 days after the last exposure to a bird with avian flu.

The Yukon is the latest place to be hit with avian flu cases as an outbreak continues to spread across the country. Officials from the department of environment said in a press release on [Fri 27 May 2022] that 2 waterfowl carcasses in southern Yukon tested positive for the H5N1 virus strand.

Avian flu is a highly contagious disease, spread by migratory wild birds, that causes severe illness and death in birds. In rare cases, the virus can spread to humans and other mammals like pigs, cats, and dogs. The disease has already made its way through flocks in the provinces, killing hundreds in its wake.

"Livestock farmers and Yukoners who own domestic birds need to protect their birds from this virus," the department said in the news release, adding that includes backyard hens and pet poultry, as well as commercial poultry farms.

Kristenn Magnusson, Yukon's acting program veterinarian, said this is the first time the avian flu has ever made its way to the territory. "I mean, it's something that we're always aware of," Magnusson said. "It's something that's always circulating, just like human flu is always circulating."

Yukoners can look for a few signs and symptoms in their birds to see whether they are infected, Magnusson said, like decreased egg production for chickens, a lack of energy, and swelling around the neck or eyes.

Influenza has a near 100% death rate for an entire flock of birds once it's detected, Magnusson said.

There are a few advantages, she continued, to how spread out the territory's poultry farms are. "We are a vast territory so we don't have super high-density production like what happens in some major centres," Magnusson said.

Cathy Stannard, the co-owner of Mandalay Farms outside Whitehorse, said she isn't surprised to see that cases have made their way to the territory. She said if a bird in her flock were to contract the virus, it would be a struggle to replace them. "It's not as if we could pick up the phone and say, 'do you have any birds for us?'" she said. "It doesn't work like that."

Stannard said she's been keeping her chickens inside, instead of letting them roam free, since hearing the news. So far, her flock is healthy so it shouldn't affect their local egg sales.

The Yukon government is asking residents to report sightings of sick or dead birds to their TIPP line at 1-800-661-0525.

The government said in the press release that if influenza does spread, compensation would be available for the birds that pass away.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January 2022 in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation.

Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. This is the case for birds of prey and scavengers, which are exposed to the virus when feeding on other infected birds. - Mod.PMB
