Bluetongue cases almost doubled
-------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of bluetongue in East Anglia have
almost doubled since the weekend [29-30 Sep 2007]. The total has now
risen to 20 confirmed cases, from just 11 on Saturday [29 Sep 2007].
This includes 11 cases of the midge-borne virus on farms in Suffolk
to date, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU).
Of those cases, 10 are of the same strain found on farms close to
Baylham House Rare Breeds Farm, near Ipswich, the source of the 1st infection.
Richard Storer, who runs Baylham House has had to put down 2 of his
rare-breed cattle.
We are working for a long-term approach because bluetongue is here
for a long time Brian Finnerty, National Farmers' Union., "Of the
animals tested by government vets last Saturday only one billy goat
has proved positive," he said. "Physically he has nothing wrong with
him so we will keep an eye on him and if there are any signs of
illness we will have to put him down."
Mr Storer's farm is due to reopen to the public on Saturday [6 Oct 2007].
"This is a disease we are going to have to live with for some time so
the sooner we get a vaccine the better," he added.
Brian Finnerty, NFU regional spokesman for the East of England, said:
"We are still urging farmers to be vigilant and to keep a close eye
on livestock and to let the authorities know straight away if they
suspect infection. We are working for a long-term approach because
bluetongue is here for a long time."
Bluetongue control-and-protect zones were put in place on Sunday [30
Sep 2007] following confirmation of the 11 infection cases. The new
zone comprises parts of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire.
The zone also includes London and parts of Lincolnshire,
Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Kent,
Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Surrey and Sussex.
There have been "unconfirmed cases" in Norfolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire.
Animals with the disease experience discomfort, with flu-like
symptoms, and swelling and haemorrhaging in and around the mouth and
nose. They can also go lame and have difficulty eating.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[We can expect the number of cases to ramp up very quickly if the
shape of the epidemic curve demonstrated on the continent this summer
holds true to for this outbreak and there is no reason to expect any
change, unfortunately.
Since clinical signs are mentioned in the article, those wanting to
see symptoms can find some excellent pictures at IAH website:
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/bluetongue/BT_clinical.pdf>.
Another good source, Iowa State University Center for Food Security
and Public Health summarizes the clinical picture as:
The incubation period for bluetongue is 5-20 days. In sheep, the
clinical signs may include fever, excessive salivation, depression,
dyspnea and panting. The muzzle, lips and ears are hyperemic and the
lips and tongue may be very swollen. The head and ears may also be
edematous. Initially, animals have a clear nasal discharge; later,
the discharge becomes mucopurulent and dries to a crust around the
nostrils. Pregnant ewes infected during the first trimester may
reabsorb the fetus, abort, or give birth to 'dummy' lambs. See:
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/ppt/Bluetongue.ppt>.
A map of the Bluetongue control areas can be seen at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/map-fmdriskareas011007.pdf>.
It is instructive to compare the size of the bluetongue control areas
and those pertaining to Foot and Mouth Disease. - Mod.PC]
