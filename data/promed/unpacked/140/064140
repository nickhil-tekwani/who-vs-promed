Coral collapse in Caribbean
----------------------------
Belize is host to the Northern Hemisphere's largest barrier reef. Soaring
ocean temperatures in the Caribbean have caused the first mass die-off of
coral in the region for 3,000 years. Scientists suspect the record
temperature of 31.5 degrees Celsius (88 F degrees), recorded in 1998 off
Belize, was the result of global warming and the El Nino climate
phenomenon. The raised heat level lasted for several months and caused
virtually all the Belize coral colonies to bleach and die. Serious coral
bleaching has been previously reported in both the Pacific and Indian
oceans, but this is the first such occurrence in the Caribbean.
"There is growing concern global climate change is degrading coral reef
ecosystems, with coral mortality increasing as a result of bleaching and
emergent diseases: our results from Belize appear to justify this concern,"
said Richard Aronson of the Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory in Alabama, US.
Scientists believe high temperatures cause the little organisms living in
coral reefs to expel the microscopic algae sharing their home. This weakens
the colony and further stress leads to the death of the reef. The loss of
the algae also robs the reef of its color, which is why it is called
bleaching. Australia's Great Barrier Reef has experienced bleaching for the
past 20 years and severe bleaching occurred there in 1998. But Dr Aronson
and his colleagues said there was no record of mass bleaching along the
Belizean barrier reef before an episode in 1995 when most coral colonies
recovered. But in 1998 sea temperatures in the central section of the reef,
which rarely exceed 29 C were greater than 30 C for months. Surveys done in
1999 and 2000 showed the most abundant coral on the reef, _Agaricia
tenuifolia_, was killed and other species were also damaged.
The researchers then used radiocarbon dating on 12 coral cores to determine
historical events on the reefs. This showed no similar bleaching had
happened for more than 3,000 years.
The research is published in the journal Nature.
