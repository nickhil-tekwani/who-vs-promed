The number of people suffering from acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis
-- known locally as pink eye disease -- in the southern city of
Chiayi, the area of Taiwan worst-hit by the outbreak, is declining,
Chiayi City Director of Health Sun Shu-jung said yesterday [Tue 23
Oct 2007]. A total of 157 elementary and junior high school students
in the city were reported to be infected as of Tuesday. The number
marks a significant drop in comparison with the peak of the outbreak,
recorded on 5 Oct 2007, with 477 cases, Sun said.

Thanks to the drop in the number of new patients, Sun added, a
Department of Health order to submit daily reports on the outbreak
has been lifted from the city. In addition to Chiayi City, other
affected areas include Taipei city and county as well as Yunlin and
Chiayi counties.

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is characterized by sudden onset of
painful, swollen, red eyes, with conjunctival hemorrhaging and
excessive tear [formation].
