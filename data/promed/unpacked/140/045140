Everyone that served in Vietnam (RVN) was very congnizant of TCP,
"Tropical Canine Pancytopenia". Until Dr. David Huxoll and Dr. Paul
Hildebrandt and their team of researchers really pinpointed the
cause, Ehrlichia, it was a major loss of military working dogs in RVN.
In fact, because of erhlichiosis, no military working dog was
allowed to return to the United States. Most were not allowed to
leave RVN; however, a few did return to the Military working dog
center in Japan. We eventually learned that tetracyclains could be
used prophylactically but no one understood the pathogenesis or
etiology. The British first came up with the terminology TCP from
the condition in their dogs with the military forces in Malaysia.
Everyone is now familiar with canine erhlichiosis and it is
interesting to see these terms such as TCP come popping up from the
past.
The disease was first called Idopathic Hemorrhagic Syndrome (IHS) and
later TCP. Originally dogs from Vietnam were returned to Okinawa to
be retained with new handlers when their original handlers rotated
out of Vietnam. On 15 Oct 68 a shipment of dogs arrived from Vietnam
for retraining with new handlers. By 15 Nov 68, 2 of the dogs were
dead and by January there were nine deaths and ten suspects. Then on
11 Jan 69, Major Paul Hildebrandt arrived in Okinawa from WRAIR
(Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) and started an
investigation. The disease remained a mystery for a while until
Major Hildebrandt and Major David Huxoll and other researchers at
WRAIR found that the inoculation of fresh whole blood from TCP cases
consistently produced the disease in experimental dogs. Examination
of blood smears and stained lung impressions disclosed monocytes with
intracyutoplasmic inclusion bodies similar to those which had been
described for Ehrlichia canis. U.S. Military in Vietnam lost
approximately 300 military working dogs before research provided a
method of treatment and control. After tetracyclines were used as a
preventative and treatment, TCP ceased to be a major operational
problem.
I'm sure this is more information than you every wanted to know about
TCP, but it sure stimulated my memory. COL William H.H. Clark is the
author of "The History of the United States Army Veterinary Corps in
Vietnam, 1962-1973" and that is where I obtain some of the facts and
figures mentioned above as well as from remembering my own
experiences in RVN. If anyone would be interested in obtaining a
copy of this book, they could write Bill Clark at Box 8, Ringgold, GA
30736.
