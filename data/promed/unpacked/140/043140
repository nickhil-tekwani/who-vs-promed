Health officials are investigating a state-wide outbreak of mumps. The contagious infection has showed up in at least 7 Oklahoma counties. Even if you've had your MMR vaccine, that's Measles, Mumps, and Rubella --turns out you're not in the clear-- in fact you could be infected and not even know it. So far, 324 people have been diagnosed in Canadian, McClain, Osage, Tulsa, Woods, Kay, and Garfield counties. Nearly 300 of those cases have been reported in Garfield County alone, with the 1st one reported in July [2016].

And the most unsettling part of the outbreak? Most of the patients had gotten the MMR vaccine, but its only 88 percent effective in preventing mumps. And while those numbers are concerning, Epidemiologist Megan Holderness with the Oklahoma City County Health Department said Oklahoma isn't alone. "In the whole U.S. there's about 3600 and that's the highest numbers in a decade," said Holderness.

She said if you're showing symptoms like fever, headache, body aches and muscle pains, and in some cases, extreme swelling of the jaw or throat, go to the doctor and then stay home. "Stay out of the school settings and crowded environments 5 days after that swelling begins," continued Holderness.

Health officials say it's important to diagnose people with mumps, that way they can go to those locations and find out where the outbreak started. Then, they can start treatment in that area.

The number of confirmed and probable mumps cases at the University of Missouri has grown to 228. The University of Missouri released the latest numbers [Wed 14 Dec 2016] as students take finals before heading home for winter break.

Health officials say they plan to continue monitoring cases over the break and through January [2017]. The school also is recommending that students receive a 3rd dose of a vaccine that protects against mumps, as well as measles and rubella [MMR].

The school says most of the sickened students have recovered, with at least 190 of them no longer infectious. Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks. The university is among several across the nation that has grappled with outbreaks this year.

Health Advisory: Mumps Outbreaks - University Settings, Winter Break: Mumps Diagnosis, Testing and Reporting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
Cases of mumps have been identified in increasing numbers on college campuses in New York and across the United States. As students return home for winter break there is the potential that exposed students will develop mumps and present to local healthcare providers for evaluation.

Currently, the State Universities of New York (SUNY) at New Paltz and Geneseo are experiencing mumps outbreaks. Up to 61 individuals who have been diagnosed with mumps are epidemiologically linked to the SUNY New Paltz Campus outbreak and 16 cases of mumps have been diagnosed that are associated with SUNY Geneseo. Suspect cases are under investigation at both institutions. More cases are expected to occur.

All students at both SUNY New Paltz and SUNY Geneseo who have not received any mumps-containing vaccine are considered susceptible and have been excluded from campus at this time. Those students who have received only 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine have been advised to receive a 2nd dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to complete the recommended 2-dose series.

The vast majority of cases have been immunized with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. The median age of case patients is 20 years. Symptoms include swelling of the salivary glands (parotid, sub-mandibular or sub-lingual), malaise, headache, myalgia, fever, anorexia and jaw pain. Patients have also reported sore throat, earache and upper respiratory symptoms prior to onset of parotitis.

NYSDOH is requesting that all medical providers consider and test for mumps in patients with symptoms that are clinically consistent with mumps without an alternative diagnosis, regardless of a patient's vaccination status. Please refer to the NYSDOH Vaccine Preventable Disease Control Guidelines for more information at:
http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/providers/outbreak_control_guidelines.htm

In response to the outbreak of mumps at SUNY New Paltz, the NYSDOH, Ulster County Department of Health, and SUNY New Paltz have recommended that all SUNY New Paltz students receive a 3rd dose of MMR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided guidance for use of a 3rd dose of MMR as a control measure to consider during mumps outbreaks in settings where people are in close contact with one another and when traditional control measures, including high 2-dose coverage have failed to slow the spread of disease. There is evidence suggesting that a 3rd dose of the MMR vaccine may boost immunity among students and help prevent further spread of mumps on campus. MMR vaccination clinics were held on campus 13 and 14 Dec [2016] for all students to provide a 3rd dose of vaccine, or 2nd dose for those who had not yet completed the recommended 2-dose series. Students from SUNY New Paltz who did not receive a 3rd dose of MMR during these vaccination clinics may choose to discuss the recommendation for a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine with their healthcare provider during winter break. A 3rd dose is not currently being recommended for students attending other colleges or universities in New York State, nor for the general public. [...-more]
