Scotland: gastroenteritis outbreak closes hospital wards in Paisley
----------------------------------------------
2 wards at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) have been closed after a new
outbreak of gastroenteritis, which is affecting patients and staff. An
infection which causes vomiting and diarrhea is spreading throughout the
Paisley hospital, and has, so far, affected 43 people. Now, children have
been banned from visiting any of the wards affected. A total of 37 patients
-- many of whom are elderly -- have been affected, and 6 members of the
staff have all fallen ill as a result of the virus.
The virus infection means that National Health Service (NHS) managers have
had to shut wards 4 and 7 -- both of which are care of the elderly wards --
to new admissions. Patients in another elderly ward at the hospital -- ward
3 -- have also fallen ill, while patients in wards 11 and 14 -- medical
wards -- have also been affected.
It's the 2nd time in just a few months that RAH managers have had to deal
with such an outbreak. A similar virus infection swept through the
hospital, in March and April 2004, with more than 100 people being affected
at that time. Furthermore, 4 of the wards that were affected at that time
have also been hit by the virus again. Patients in wards 3, 4, 7, and 14
were all struck down by the virus, which usually affects people for 2 to 3
days. [Presumed to be an outbreak of norovirus infection, but not confirmed
in this report. - Mod.CP]
Hospital chiefs have set up a special control-of-infection team to deal
with the outbreak, which began more than a week ago [2nd week July 2004].
Mary Morgan, the service general manager, explained that a series of
measures had been brought in to try to stop the infection from spreading
further. Youngsters under the age of 12 have been barred from visiting
family and friends in the 5 affected wards, and people who have been ill in
the last week are also being urged not to visit. Ms. Morgan said,
"infection-control precautions are in place, and we suggest that anyone who
has experienced symptoms of diarrhea or vomiting within the last 7 days
should not visit the hospital. Within the affected ward areas, we can only
permit 2 visitors per bed, and no children under the age of 12 should
visit." She added, "the hospital's control-of-infection team is monitoring
the outbreak daily. The wards will be re-opened once we are sure that the
infection is clear, or at least 48 hours after the last patient showed any
symptoms.

Scotland: gastroenteritis outbreak in Paisley hospital still spreading
--------------------------------------------
Infection control measures stayed in place at Paisley's Royal Alexandra
Hospital (RAH) yesterday [Mon 19 Jul 2004], after the number of people
suffering from a suspected norovirus infection continued to rise. The virus
infection, which causes vomiting and diarrhea, first hit staff and patients
at the hospital more than a week ago [2nd week July 2004]. Yesterday [Mon
19 Jul 2004], managers at the RAH said 3 more patients, and another member
of the staff, were hit by the stomach complaint over the weekend. The new
figure means that more than 50 people -- 43 patients and 8 staff -- have
now fallen ill with the infection, which usually affects its victims for 2
to 3 days.
Ward 7 -- one of the hospital's care of the elderly wards -- remains closed
to new admissions as a result of the outbreak. And, a special
control-of-infection team has brought in a series of measures to try to
tackle the infection. Within the affected ward areas, only 2 visitors per
bed are being permitted, and no children under the age of 12 are being
allowed to visit. A hospital spokesperson said, "our control-of-infection
team is monitoring the outbreak on a daily basis.

Wales: gastroenteritis outbreak closes hospital wards in Cardiff
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of gastroenteritis has forced the isolation of 2 wards at the
University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. The wards have been shut to new
patients following an outbreak of diarrhea and vomiting among those already
being treated.
Hospital officials decided to close off the 2 wards yesterday [Sun 18 Jul
2004], which meant that no new patients would be admitted to the areas. A
hospital spokesman said that "we have cases of diarrhea and vomiting, and 2
wards have been affected. Normal precautions are being taken to combat the
outbreak."
He said that no patients were being transferred to other hospitals, and,
denied reports the virus infection had been brought into the wards via a
patient admitted with a contagious virus after returning from abroad. [As
in the report from Paisley, Scotland, the gastroenteritis outbreak in the
Cardiff hospital is presumed to be caused by norovirus infection. - Mod.CP]

England: gastroenteritis close wards in hospitals in Yeovil and Bristol
-----------------------------------------------
Wards have been closed at Yeovil District Hospital, and Bristol Royal
Infirmary (BRI), after an outbreak of a viral gastroenteritis. 2 wards at

to reopen on Thu 15 Jul 2004, and the other on the following Monday.
3 wards at the BRI were also closed after an outbreak of a similar illness.
