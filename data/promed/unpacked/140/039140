Health officials are still trying to track down the source of an _E. coli_ outbreak that killed a 21-month-old child and sickened 2 others.

Sites in several states are now under investigation. Health officials said they have been able to rule out the petting zoo at Audubon. Rumors had circulated that the child was exposed to _E. coli_ at the zoo, but doctors said they were able to rule that out.

Officials said the 21-month-old died from complications from the [bacterial infection] at the end of May 2012. Dr Takeisha Davis, of the state Officer of Public Health, said the same strain of _E. coli_ sickened 2 other children in the New Orleans area and is linked to a multi-state outbreak.

"Several southern states are involved and we are all working together with CDC to confirm the common source to make sure we're protecting the citizens," Davis said.

Experts said this particular strain of the bacterium is more dangerous than others. It sickened 3 people in 2010 and 3 others in 2011.

Doctors said this strain of _E. coli_ infection usually results from consuming contaminated food or water, or from contact with infected animals or people.

Officials advised people to avoid eating undercooked beef and unpasteurized milk products. People should also thoroughly wash vegetables before eating and always wash their hands.

This particular type of _E. coli_ infection can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and vomiting. Healthy adults can usually recover within a week, but young children and older adults can develop a life-threatening form of kidney failure.

The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals says it is working with federal officials to determine where the _E. coli_ came from that killed a baby girl and sickened at least 2 other people in the New Orleans area.

Authorities say it appears to be part of a cluster of cases reported in the South in May 2012. The dead New Orleans area child was reportedly 21 months old.

Officials at the Audubon Zoo say rumors that the deadly _E. coli_ was linked to the petting zoo are unfounded. The Zoo issued a news release quoting Dr Gary Balsamo, State Public Health Veterinarian and Assistant State Epidemiologist in the Office of Public Health, Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.

Balsamo says, "3 cases of toxigenic _E. coli_ were reported to DHH [Department of Health and Hospitals] in May 2012 in the Greater New Orleans area. These cases all have the same 'DNA fingerprints'. They are part of a CDC cluster of cases coming from several southern states. The CDC investigation has not yet identified the common source. Rumors that the strain are coming from petting zoos appear to be unfounded."
