Bug wiping out cassava plants
-----------------------------
Uganda's hope of extracting industrial ethanol and biodiesel from
locally grown cassava is being threatened by the emergence of a
destructive cassava disease which has attacked the country. Crop
scientists have identified the disease as the _Cassava brown streak
virus_ which causes the stem, roots and leaves of the plant to rot.

Scientists at the National Crop Resources Research Institute (NCRRI)
and Makerere University had embarked on a research project to enhance
the energy content in cassava tubers so that they can produce
sufficient fuel material. The 'super varieties' would also have high
nutrition values for large scale livestock keepers. Now Dr Titus
Alicai, a researcher with the National Cassava Research Programme,
says the virus has forced them to temporarily put the project on hold.

The disease has affected up to 100 percent of crops in some gardens
around the country. Kayunga, Mukono, Wakiso and Mpigi districts
[Central Region] are the hardest hit, but scientists have also
received complaints from the Eastern and Northern Regions. "This is a
serious setback for us. After fighting the cassava mosaic disease
which almost wiped out cassava production in the country in the
1990s, our hopes were now on commercial use of the tubers," Dr Alicai
said. He said the brown streak virus attacks "all the varieties
ranging from NASE1-12 [varieties developed at NCRRI]." Only NASE3
cassava variety has shown some resistance to it.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease (CBSD) is caused by
_Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of
genus_Ipomovirus_). It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-
Saharan Africa where the crop is a major factor in food security.
Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown,
corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may
appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop
losses of 20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual
root weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible
cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and
is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease
management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants,
use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but
these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries.
Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local
requirements and are the best option for CBSV control in the long
term.

Outbreaks of CBSD were reported from Uganda in 2008 and 2007 (see
posts listed below), and from the report above it appears that the
disease is widespread in the country. Despite its potential impact on
biofuel production, the most serious effect of the virus is the
threat to food security.

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by several virus species and
strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which are spread by whitefly
vectors (for more information see ProMED-mail post no. 20081119.3647
