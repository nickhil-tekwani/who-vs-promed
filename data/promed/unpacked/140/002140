First Report of Koch's Postulates Completion of Sudden Death Syndrome of
Soybean in Argentina.

Foliage symptoms on soybean resembling those of sudden death syndrome (SDS)
were detected in Argentina during 1991 and 1992 in the Pampas Region and
during 1992 and 1993 in the Northwest Region. Isolations were made in 1999,
2000, and 2001 from soybean plants (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.) showing these
symptoms.
5 fungal isolates obtained from taproot tissue and blue sporulation on
taproot exteriors were selected for further evaluation. These isolates were
plated on potato dextrose agar supplemented with streptomycin (PDAS). Based
on spore morphology, colony growth rate, morphology and pigmentation on
PDAS, and lack of microconidia (1) 5 isolates were identified as _Fusarium
solani_ f. sp. _glycines_ (Fsg).
In pathogenicity tests, soybean cvs. Ripley, Spencer, Pioneer 9492RR, and
A6445 RG were inoculated in greenhouse tests with each of the isolates
using toothpick and soil infestation methods for a total of 6 experiments.
Isolate 171 provided by J. Rupe (University of Arkansas, Fayetteville) was
tested as a positive control.
Foliar symptoms typical of SDS and similar to those in the field were
observed 14 and 25 days, respectively, after inoculation.
Lesions produced on leaves averaged 3.6 for all 5 isolates and 4 for the
reference strain using a disease severity scale where: 1 = no symptoms; 2 =
slight symptom development with mottling and mosaic on leaves (1 to 20
percent foliage affected); 3 = moderate symptom development with
interveinal chlorosis and necrosis on foliage (21 to 50 percent foliage
affected); 4 = heavy symptom development with interveinal chlorosis and
necrosis (51 to 80 percent foliage affected); and 5 = severe interveinal
chlorosis and necrosis (81 to 100 percent foliage affected). Noninoculated
controls were symptomless.
Differences in virulence were observed among the isolates. Based on disease
symptoms in the greenhouse and cultural morphology on PDAS, the isolates
were classified as Fsg.
Isolates recovered from symptomatic plants resembled Fsg on PDAS and
peptone/p-chloro-nitrobenzene agar amended with streptomycin, confirming
Koch's postulates. Fsg was recovered from 60 percent of inoculated plants.

[This appears to be the first report of SDS outside the USA. Have any of
our readers observed SDS in their jurisdictions? In a twist of fate, SDS is
more common in well-managed fields. The disease is more likely to be
widespread during wet and cool weather. SDS can reduce yields from 5 to 80
percent, mainly because of pod abortion, poor pod fill, and low seed
weight. Unfortunately, SDS-infested fields remain infective for several
years. Disease management involves selection of appropriate cultivars and
use of cultural practices (crop rotation for 2-3 years, early planting
dates, and soil drainage). - Mod.DH]
