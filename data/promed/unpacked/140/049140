A Statement from Dr. Chris Whittier of the MGVP
-----------------------------------------------
[On Thu 14 Jul 2005, ProMED-mail reproduced a report from the New
Scientist, online news service, under the heading "Respiratory infections,
fatal, gorillas - Africa" (archive no. 20050715.2019), which featured the
work of the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project (MGVP) in Rwanda. This post
was followed by some useful discussion of transmission of respiratory
infections under different circumstances. - Mod.CP]
Please note that the New Scientist magazine has updated its website as
follows to now include our edited response to their misleading and
factually incorrect news article; see:
<http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=mg18725074.500>.
"I am writing on behalf of the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Project (MGVP)
to clarify some misstatements made in the article "Gorilla deaths show
tourists should keep their distance" (New Scientist print edition, 9 Jul
2005). Our study makes clear that poaching is not the biggest killer of
mountain gorillas as your article states. Most gorillas in this dataset did
die from trauma, but only part of that was attributed to poaching. Also, we
have no evidence that any wild mountain gorillas have ever died from
influenza, or parainfluenza viruses. We do know that the gorillas have been
exposed to these, or other closely-related viruses, but they have never
been documented as a cause of death. Moreover, the fact that gorillas have
antibodies to these disease-causing agents does not prove they have been
transmitted from humans. It is possible that these viruses are circulating
in the gorilla population, have been transmitted from native wildlife, or
have been transmitted from animals around the park. This is an area of
ongoing research.
Finally, the headline for the article is very misleading. MGVP is in no way
recommending that people do not visit, study, monitor or protect gorillas.
Tourism is critical in creating the economic incentive that allows for
gorilla protection, and nothing in our study implies that tourism poses any
additional health risk to gorillas. All of these human activities with
gorillas need to continue to be very strictly controlled, as they currently
are, but their prohibition would surely spell the extinction of mountain
gorillas in their natural habitats."

Additional Comment from Dr. Whittier
-------------------------------------------
We think our reply, in conjunction with the links to our original report
that Dr. Nutter has already provided, and Dr. Homsy's response, will help
clarify most of the questions that have arisen on ProMED-mail regarding the
inaccurate media portrayal of our abstract.
I would only like to add one further thought on the discussion of the
"Seven Meter Rule." Aside from the potential ill effects of disease
transmission between humans and gorillas, we must also remember that, like
most beings, gorillas have a sense of personal space, especially when
interacting with another species known to hunt and kill them. Visits are
intended to not intrude on gorilla's daily lives. Though perceived as the
gentle giants they almost always are, these are large, potentially
dangerous wild animals who protect themselves and each other. Proximity
rules are there not only to protect gorillas from disease and intrusion,
but also to protect visitors, both from disease and physical encounters. We
shouldn't forget that.

[Since the precise identities of the respiratory viruses infecting mountain
gorillas remain conjectural -- determination of which being the reason for
the initiation of this thread -- it is time to cut the thread and thank all
contributors for their participation. - Mod.CP]
