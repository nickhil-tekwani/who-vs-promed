FDA approves a new vaccine to help protect adults against pertussis
--------------------------------------------------
The FDA today, 10 Jun 2005, approved a new vaccine for a single booster
immunization against pertussis (whooping cough), in combination with
tetanus and diphtheria, for adolescents and adults 11-64 years of age. The
vaccine will be marketed as Adacel by Aventis Pasteur Limited located in
Toronto, Canada. It is the 1st vaccine approved as a pertussis booster for
adults. Vaccines for prevention of tetanus and diphtheria (Td vaccine) in
adolescents and adults have been available for many years.
The vaccine is a Tetanus Toxoid (T), Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid (d) and
Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (ap), Adsorbed. It contains the same components
as DTaP vaccine indicated for infants and children, but the diphtheria
toxoid and one of the pertussis components are in reduced quantities.
Recently, FDA approved a similar vaccine called Boostrix, manufactured by
GlaxoSmithKline, for use in adolescents 10-18 years of age.
Pertussis is a highly communicable and potentially serious illness in
adolescents and adults, and can cause prolonged cough and missed days at
school and work. In young infants, pertussis is more frequently severe and
can be fatal, particularly in those too young to be fully vaccinated. Since
1980, the rates of reported pertussis cases have been increasing in
adolescents and adults, as well as in young infants. Adolescents and
adults have been implicated as the source of pertussis infection for
susceptible young infants, and other family members.
The ability of this vaccine to protect against pertussis was assessed by
comparing the antibody responses of adolescents and adults who received it
with the antibody responses of infants who had received the pediatric
vaccine in a clinical trial. The antibody responses of the adolescents and
adults who received a single dose of this vaccine were at least as good as
those observed in the infants following 3 doses of the pediatric vaccine.
For diphtheria and tetanus, the antibody responses following this vaccine
were comparable to those following immunization with a USA-licensed Td vaccine.
In clinical trials, the safety of this vaccine was compared to a
USA-licensed Td vaccine. Among adolescent recipients of this vaccine,
injection site pain and low-grade fever were observed more frequently than
among those who received Td vaccine. Rates of adverse reactions were
similar in adults receiving this vaccine or receiving Td vaccine.

Whooping cough worries
----------------------
With 8 cases of whooping cough diagnosed in Oneida County [NY] schools,
parents are learning 1st-hand that immunizations against the disease may
not be enough to prevent onset of the illness. Concerned parents are
likely to hear a troubling message about immunization: officials emphasize
that vaccines given according to recommended guidelines are the most
effective line of defense against contracting communicable illnesses. But
officials caution that the vaccine against whooping cough, also known as
pertussis, may not be 100 percent effective because its effectiveness
declines with [the vaccinee's] age.
"The current vaccine is effective and does protect for a certain amount of
time, up to the age of 7," said Patrice Bogan, director of clinical
services for the Oneida County Health Department. "But we know it wears off
and the situation here proves this."
According to the state Health Department, there have been 241 cases of
whooping cough in Upstate New York in 2005. Whooping cough, an infectious
disease that causes coughing in rapid succession, has affected 14 Oneida
County residents, including 8 students, jarring many parents who already
had their children immunized against the illness.
Bogan points to future vaccines as offering more assurance: Boostrix for
adolescents, and Adacel for age 11-64, currently are being developed and
should be available within a month. Bogan is excited about targeting middle
school students with the new medicine.
"We are eagerly awaiting the new vaccines," she said.

Wisconsin led nation in whooping cough cases in 2004
---------------------------------------------------
Public health officials say better monitoring of whooping cough could be
why Wisconsin had the most reports of whooping cough in 2004. The state
had 4048 whooping cough cases in 2004, according to the CDC. New York was
2nd with 2059. Many states had just single- or double-digit figures.
Dan Hopfensperger, director of the Madison-based Wisconsin Immunization
Program, said the state is examining the way it identifies and investigates
cases and is comparing notes with other states. He suspects other states
aren't as aggressive about diagnosing whooping cough, which would skew
statistics.
"As far as discrepancies in the numbers, I don't know that our population
is any more susceptible than the rest of the country. I think it's a lot to
do with case identification and case follow-up," he said. "If you look at
our immunization levels as a whole in the state, we compare very favorably
with the rest of the country."
Hopfensperger also said whooping cough is a cyclical disease, meaning [case
numbers increase and decrease] every 2 to 3 years.
Dr. Matt Hall, a Marshfield Clinic infectious disease specialist,
attributed the state's influx of cases to new testing and more
testing. Wisconsin introduced a new molecular test in the last few years
that "probably doubles the number of cases you can find," Hall said. Other
states may not have the test yet, he said.

[With this approval, we may see a clear difference in the number of cases
of pertussis once boosters in adolescents and adults come into use. How
long the booster in adults will protect for remains unclear. Only time
will tell whether the standard every-10-year booster in adults will be a
Tdap vaccine. - Mod.LL]
