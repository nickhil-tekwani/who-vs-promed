Fox That Bit Three Had Rabies
-------------------------------
A gray fox bit 3 people in their back yards this week has tested positive
for rabies, Health Department officials said Thursday. It is the 10th
confirmed case in Virginia Beach this year; surpassing last year's 7 cases.
The number reinforces a concern the disease, on the rise in the region for
about a decade, might be here to stay. In Virginia Beach, 8 of the rabid
animals caught this year have been raccoons. One was a family cat.
The 3 residents attacked by the fox this week are undergoing preventative
rabies treatment.
