This evening [9 Aug], a 3 km radius Temporary Control Zone has been put
around one premises in Surrey outside of the existing Surveillance Zone.
This precautionary measure follows an inconclusive assessment of clinical
symptoms by Animal Health veterinary staff. The national movement ban
remains in place. In addition, in the Temporary Control Zone, general
licenses will not apply for the movement of animals to slaughter and
collection of dead animals from farms.
Debby Reynolds, chief veterinary officer, said: "This is a developing
disease situation. The containment and eradication of FMD remains our
priority. This is why we have moved swiftly to put in place a Temporary
Control Zone while we investigate this development. At this stage, disease
has not been confirmed; laboratory results will follow. In the meantime, as
I have done from the start of this outbreak, I reiterate my message to
animal keepers to practice the highest standards of biosecurity, remain
vigilant for disease and report any suspicions quickly."
With effect from Fri 10 Aug 2007, to prevent acute welfare problems in the
specific area of the Protection and Surveillance Zones, the decision has
also been taken to issue a general license permitting the movement of feed
and fodder within a farm and the direct delivery to a farm of feed and
fodder from outside the zones.
In addition, burial of animals on the farm where they died will be
permitted within the Protection and Surveillance Zones from Fri 10 Aug 2007.

New foot-and-mouth case suspected
---------------------------------
There is a "clinical suspicion" of a new foot and mouth [disease] outbreak
in Surrey - outside the existing surveillance zone, it has been announced.
Chief veterinary officer Debby Reynolds told a news conference a new 3 km
(1.8 mile) temporary control zone had been put around a farm near Dorking.
A confirmed outbreak at the site would be the first outside the existing
10km (6.2 miles) surveillance zone. That is around two Guildford farms
where the disease has been confirmed.
Ms Reynolds said the new control zone at a farm to the west of Dorking -
not far from the two confirmed cases of the disease near Guildford - had
been set up after an "inconclusive assessment" of symptoms in cattle. She
said the disease had not been confirmed and that laboratory results would
follow.
"This is a developing disease situation," she added. "The containment and
eradication of foot-and-mouth disease remains our priority. This is why we
have moved swiftly to put in place a temporary control zone while we
investigate this development."
The first cases of foot and mouth were found in cattle at Woolford Farm,
near Guildford, last Friday and a second outbreak was confirmed at a
neighbouring farm on Monday. Cattle in both cases have been culled.
A 3 km (1.8 mile) protection zone was set up around the original affected
farms as well as a wider 10 km (6.2 miles) surveillance zone. Some 362
animals have been culled at a third farm within that surveillance zone, on
suspicion that the disease could be developing there. Results of tests at
that farm have yet to be announced.
Speaking after Ms Reynolds' latest announcement, Hugh Broom, of the Surrey
branch of the National Farmers' Union, said the new 3km control zone was "a
worrying development. It will be worrying for our members here and for
farmers elsewhere in the country," he told BBC News. "But, thankfully at
the moment, we're not talking about an outbreak outside Surrey."
Lib Dem environment spokesman Chris Huhne urged the government to consider
vaccinations to stop the disease spreading. "If it's a confirmed outbreak
then I do think the government is going to have to look at other options
than the culling option that it's been looking at so far," he told BBC
News. "It does seem to be spreading outside the surveillance zone and the
last thing we want is another 2001 spreading throughout the countryside."
Restrictions on taking animals to abattoirs have been lifted but many
movements of livestock - such as sending animals to market - are still
banned. Some restrictions had already been lifted in Scotland and Wales.

[The BBC posted an article
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6939467.stm> describing a
relaxation of restrictions imposed in response to the Surrey foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) outbreak shortly before the suspect animal outside the
surveillance zone was reported. Animals who were being sent from farms
directly to slaughterhouses were again to be able to cross the border
between Scotland and England. It remains to be seen how long this decision
will be maintained. - Mod.TG
The appearance of a new case outside the surveillance zone, a week after
the confirmation of the 1st outbreak (and at least 10 days after its start)
is alarming, since this may be a secondary outbreak.
