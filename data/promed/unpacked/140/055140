Foot and mouth disease in Iksal
-------------------------------
1. On 9 Jan 2014, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was reportedly suspected in a dairy sheep/goat farm situated at the southern entrance to the village Iksal [HaZafon District], about 2 km [1.2 miles] south of Upper Nazareth.

2. The flock includes about 1300 sheep (about 800 adults, about 500 lambs), 520 goats (about 350 adults, about 170 kids) [and breeding rams/bucks]. All [adult] animals have reportedly been vaccinated and earmarked [see comment]. Clinical examinations revealed lameness in a small number of lambs. During the weekend [10-12 Jan 2014], 27 lambs, up to 14 days old, died; no tongue, gum, or foot lesions have been detected.

3. Samples [see comment] submitted to the FMD laboratory, Virology department, Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan, have been found infected by FMDV serotype O (isolated).

4. A zone of 10 km [6.2 miles] radius around Iksal has been declared infected, with consequent quarantine measures applied. A map of the zone is attached (in Hebrew; available at http://tinyurl.com/p6c5gpr).

5. All permits for animal movements within, into or from the Zone, issued before the declaration, are hereby annulled.

6. Car-wheel disinfecting pools at the entrance to all villages within the Zone should be put into operation immediately.

[Additional instructions/conditions for the issuance of specific animal movement permits (for slaughter purposes, etc.) in the Zone and in other parts of northern Israel are included in the original Hebrew text.]

[Iksal is situated within an agricultural area in northern Israel, within 10-30 km (about 6-19 miles) of numerous animal (large and small ruminants) farms; see map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Iksal.html. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/382g.

The affected flock had been last vaccinated in May 2013. According to the prescribed FMD policy, periodic vaccinations involve animals older than 2 months; earmarking by official tags is applied in female sheep and goats older than 6 months. Their vaccination, about 7 months ago, may explain the absence of clinical signs in the adult animals, while their recently born offspring seem to be susceptible (low or absent maternal immunity). Commendably, in spite of the absence of foot and mouth lesions and lameness in the ewes and does, hearts from 3 dead lambs have been sampled and submitted to the laboratory. Acute heart arrest in young lambs/kids, due to FMD infection, is a known phenomenon. Information on pathological cardiac changes, possibly observed, would be welcomed.

An outbreak of FMD, serotype O, was reported in beef cattle in Majdal Shams, on the Syrian-Lebanese border, on 19 Nov 2013. Another FMDV-O outbreak was detected at the same time in a sheep flock in Jericho (Palestinian Authority), about 150 km (about 93 miles) distant from Majdal Shams. The appearance of the current outbreak, rather far from the said 2 foci, may be indicative of wider virus circulation; genotyping results are anticipated. For details of the genotyping of the previous outbreaks and relevant commentary, particularly addressing the recorded seasonality of FMD in Israel and the need to check the possible involvement of wild boars, please refer to 20140109.2161860.

In view of the central location of Iksal, severe quarantine measures, ring vaccination and revaccinations are required to try to prevent further spread in farmed animals in Israel and in the adjacent West Bank (Palestinian Autonomous Territories).

Israel has already duly notified the OIE about this outbreak; see the immediate notification of 13 Jan 2014, with an interactive map, at http://tinyurl.com/qcyyrnq.

Enhanced surveillance and reports from other counties in the region deserve to be encouraged. - Mod.AS]
