New banana disease spreading throughout Africa
----------------------------------------------
The destructive strain of banana wilt disease, which was discovered on Cavendish bananas in Mozambique earlier in 2013, has begun to spread to other African nations. It is widely known as TR4 form of Panama disease.

The African outbreak was discovered on a commercial farm in northern Mozambique. The Ministry of Agriculture in Mozambique has announced this outbreak via the IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) portal.

Government officials have visited the farm and have introduced measures to contain and prevent spread to other parts of the country. Meetings [will be held] in neighbouring countries to put in place an emergency response plan. A consortium of partners is being mobilised to address the outbreak, monitor plantations, and raise awareness in Mozambique, the region and continent.

Shocked by the outbreak, Nigerian farmers are concerned it will spread [and] are bracing up to prevent and combat the possible attack of the nation's plantain-banana producers by the scourge.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below), which include most of the commercial eating bananas, are attacked by temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510).

Previously, Cavendish-affecting strains appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania, but recently the 1st report outside that region was reported in the Middle East (Jordan; ProMED-mail post 20131107.2044265). TR4 is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia and is of great concern worldwide.
