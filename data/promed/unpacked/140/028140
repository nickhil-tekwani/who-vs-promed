Kurdistan health official report 8 dead and dozens of people ill due
to an outbreak of cholera in 2 northern Iraqi provinces. "There are
47 cholera cases in Kirkuk and 35 in Sulaimaniyah. This is in
addition to 2250 people suffering from diarrhea in Sulaimaniyah and
2000 similar cases in Kirkuk," regional Health Minister Zeryan Othman
told reporters.
The WHO said the UN has established the monitoring systems. They will
set up a surveillance system for water quality control, food
inspection, and case findings and management while the United Nations
Children's Fund will support with oral re-hydration therapy.
Iraq's infrastructure collapse due to years of war on one hand and
lack of clean drinking water in many Iraqi towns and villages because
of the malfunction of the sewage system on the other, are the primary
causes of these tribulations.
Since the 2003 US invasion, insurgents have targeted the country's
infrastructure such as water and electricity stations.

The death toll from an outbreak of cholera in the eastern Indian
state of Orissa has risen to 115, officials say. In the past 2 days,
35 people have died of the disease in 3 tribal districts, they added.
The outbreak has affected Rayagada, Koraput, and Kalahandi districts
where more than 2000 people have been admitted to hospitals,
officials say. Unofficial sources say the death toll could be higher than 200.
The cholera epidemic started from Kashipur, in Rayagada district,
nearly 310 miles (500 km) from the state capital, Bhubaneswar. A
senior health official in the district said at least 64 people had died there.
Orissa's disease surveillance unit says cholera-related deaths have
been reported from outside the 3 tribal districts. The disease was
confirmed to be cholera by the microbiology department of MKCG
Hospital in Berhampur and Regional Research Laboratory in Bhubaneswar.
Health officials said microbiological tests conducted on 43 samples
collected from patients in the affected villages had revealed the
presence of the cholera bacterium in at least 31 cases.
The areas affected by the cholera outbreak are in the
Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput region, some of the most economically
backward districts in the country. Most of the victims are believed
to be tribespeople, say officials.

A cholera outbreak has killed 165 people in recent weeks, mostly from
tribal communities in the eastern state of Orissa following monsoon floods.
More than 6000 people had been undergoing treatment over the last
month and health officials fear the death toll may rise as the
epidemic has spread to 2 neighboring states.
Orissa director of health, Dr Usha Pattnaik, said the department was
carrying out extensive health surveillance in disease prone areas in
the wake of the outbreak. "Most of the victims got cholera from
drinking contaminated water from the mountain streams."

At least 800 more people have been infected with cholera over the
last week, bringing the total number of reported cases to 2500 since
January 2007. [According to the Guinean Ministry of Health, 90 of the
2500 cases have been fatal.]
"The number of people infected by the disease in Conakry has
considerably increased since July 2007," said Sergio Martin Esteso,
program head for Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Guinea, in a
statement. "Of the 1260 patients treated in the 3 centers where MSF
works, more than 1000 have been in the past 3 weeks."
"Once again, health facilities weren't well enough prepared to cope
with this emergency," Esteso said.
Since the arrival of rains in late May 2007, cholera cases recorded
by the Guinean Ministry of Health have multiplied exponentially with
each passing week. From 13 to 19 Aug 2007, the Ministry recorded 723
cases. The capital city Conakry has borne the brunt of the outbreak,
accounting for 1260 of the 2496 total cases recorded to date.
