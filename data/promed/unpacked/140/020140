According to ProMED-mail, Nepal, the Northern Himalayan Kingdom neighbour
of India, has been reporting sporadic outbreaks of Japanese Encephalitis.
However, it is surprising that in spite of regular traffic between these
countries, not even a point epidemic has been reported on Indian side of
the border! Now there has been a report of bacterial encephalitis
(unconfirmed and in media) in districts of Gorakhpur in E.UP. What to make
of it? Now this report of Japanese encephalitis has come from Nalgonda
district of Andhra Pradesh. We can see that the most acute problem is of
lack of a surveillance and reporting system.
I should add that "mandals" are political clusters of 5-10 villages and
that the rice cultivation season is nearing completion.
