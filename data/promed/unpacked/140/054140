New outbreak looming
--------------------
Singapore is on the verge of a hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)
outbreak, health officials revealed yesterday [Mon 25 Aug 2008]. Last
week, 553 people came down with the normally mild childhood disease
that usually causes fever and rashes on the hands, feet and buttocks.
That is just 12 fewer than the Health Ministry's official 'epidemic level.'

The tally last week was up from 415 over the previous 7 days, and
health officials warn the numbers are likely to rise between now and
October, traditionally a peak period for HFMD. This peak, though,
usually affects fewer people than the 1st one from March to May, said
Dr. Lyn James, director of the Health Ministry's communicable
diseases division. The reasons for the peaks are not known.

Still, the latest surge has already proven deadly. On 6 Aug 2008,
Singapore registered its 1st death from HFMD [see: Hand, foot & mouth
disease - Asia (23): Singapore 20080808.2447] since a severe
outbreak from 2000 to 2001 killed 7 children. Like most of those
victims, the 3-year-old child died from a severe form of HFMD caused by
a virus called EV71 [human enterovirus 71]. This virus has been of
particular concern to countries in Asia, which have been battling
outbreaks of HFMD in recent years. This year, it has killed 44 in
China, 10 in Taiwan and 11 in Viet Nam.

The Health Ministry and the Regional Emerging Disease Intervention
(Redi) Centre organised a 2-day regional forum on HFMD, which was
attended by more than 80 scientists and public health officers from
12 countries. At the forum's last day yesterday [25 Aug 2008], local
vaccine company SingVax, Chinese vaccine company Sinovac Biotech and
Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control gave updates on their progress
in developing the world's first HFMD vaccine. Both SingVax and
Taiwan's CDC said they have seen good results in the laboratories and
hope to start clinical trials next year [2009].

In the absence of a vaccine, parents should ensure their children
wash their hands, because the disease is often spread through saliva
and faecal matter. They should also take their children to the doctor
at the 1st sign of symptoms, and keep them away from schools and
crowded places, Dr. James said.

Meanwhile, the school that the deceased child attended, Elias
Kindergarten in Woodlands, reopened earlier this week after a 10-day
closure to clean up. When The Straits Times visited yesterday, about
20 to 30 children were in a queue waiting to have their teachers
check their temperatures as well as hands and mouths to look for signs
of HFMD.

[As elsewhere in Asia the current outbreak of HFMD is predominantly a
consequence of enterovirus 71 infection. The preceding report from
Singapore suggested that the small HFMD outbreak in the country was
waning, but that inference may be premature.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) was initially identified in Calfornia in 1969
and outbreaks of EV71 infection have been recorded throughout the
world since then. EV71 has been associated with acute febrile
illness, myocarditis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis,
and encephalitis as well as with HFMD. Children under 5 years of age
are particulalry susceptible to these conditions and may develop
permanent neurological damage or, rarely, may succumb to these
disorders. The largest EV71 epidemic to date occurred in Taiwan in
1998 with nearly 130 000 cases. Since then there have been recurrent
HFMD epidemics of varying severity and intensity throughout the
Asia-Pacific region. This year (2008) until recently Singapore has
escaped the worst effects of the current outbreak, but this pattern
may be changing. Whether this is due to environmental factors or to a
change in virulence of the virus is an open question.
