Neurotropic velogenic Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus-1)
consistently affects the cerebellum and spinal cord of cormorants with
neuronophagia of Purkinje cells and large neurons in the spinal cord as
well as gliosis (Meteyer, Docherty, et al. Diagnostic Findings in 1992
Epornitic of Neurotropic Velogenic Newcastle Disease in Double-crested
Cormorants from the Upper Midwestern United States. Avian Diseases
41:171-180, 1997). The virus isolated from the cormorants will cause
similar lesions in poultry. Similar lesions are also seen in pigeons
infected with paramyxovirus-1 of pigeons. Dr. David Swayne (USDA-ARS,
SPRL, Georgia) can give you information regarding similar lesions in
poultry infected with certain strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

This is to try and answer our excellent Moderator CHC's question as to
which other
infectious diseases (besides Nipah virus encephalitis) can affect the
cerebellum. In children --mostly toddlers-- acute cerebellar ataxia is a
rather rare but well-known disease. It is attributed to several
enteroviruses (coxsackieviruses A4, A7, A9, B3, B4, and echoviruses 6, 9,
and 16). The same condition also occurs as a complication of chickenpox
(varicella-zoster virus [VZV) and Epstein-Barr virus infections.
As I guess have most paediatricians, I have seen quite some cases. The
disease
usually and characteristically starts very abruptly. Recovery is mostly
complete, but I have known some children with permanent sequellae (mild
ataxia and even moderate mental retardation).
As far as I know, the condition never has been described in epidemic form.
There must be studies of acute cerebellar ataxia cases with modern medical
imaging techniques, but I haven't looked these up. Yet, to quote my not too
recent Harrison's (12th edition, ) "In some instances of VZV infection,
the cerebellar lesions are of the parainfectious, demyelinating type."

Good question... Neurosyphilis comes to mind for me also (a form of tabes
dorsalis); as well as opportunistic fungal infections with toxoplasma or
cryptococcus in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with the
HIV-AIDS related complex... perhaps campylobacter also? Infectious causes
of cerebellar ataxia with cerebellar lesions is a rare bird as far as I know.
