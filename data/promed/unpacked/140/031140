Japan's 10th case of mad cow confirmed in Kanagawa
--------------------------------------------------
A dairy cow from Kanagawa Prefecture was confirmed Sunday as being infected
with mad cow disease, Japan's 10th case, the health ministry said.
A test by a national institute showed the Holstein, which was one month shy
of 12 years old when slaughtered [a different -- younger -- age has
been reported in another news-item, see item 3], almost certainly had the
usual form of the illness.
The cow born in Kanagawa Prefecture had recently been purchased by a farm
in Hiratsuka in that prefecture, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare
Ministry.
It was slaughtered Friday at a meat center in Atsugi, Kanagawa Prefecture.
A primary test at a prefectural institute found the cow was possibly
infected, and a sample was sent to the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases.
The secondary test, involving the more precise western blot method, by the
national institute confirmed the infection.
The cow started showing symptoms of joint dislocation and difficulty in
standing about a week ago.

Cow almost certain to have mad cow disease, 10th in Japan
---------------------------------------------------
A test by the national institute Saturday showed a dairy cow from Kanagawa
Prefecture is almost certain to have been infected with mad cow disease,
health ministry officials said.
Final confirmation is expected Sunday after another test is conducted and
the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare seeks some expert opinions. The
ministry, however, is not expected to call a formal conference of experts
as the infection appears certain, according to the officials.
If confirmed, it would be the 1st such case since a cow was found in
Hiroshima Prefecture in early November 2003 and raise the number of cows
infected with the disease in Japan to 10. Japan reported the first mad cow
case in September 2001.
The cow was slaughtered on Friday at a meat center in Atsugi, Kanagawa
Prefecture, west of Tokyo. A primary test the same day at a prefectural
institute found the cow was possibly infected and a sample from it was then
sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in Tokyo.
The secondary test, by way of the more precise western blot method, by the
national institute confirmed the infection with mad cow disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), they said.
The meat from the cow is stored at the slaughterhouse and will not be put
on the market, according to the officials.
The cow, 7 years and 11 months old, was born in Kanagawa Prefecture, and
was just recently purchased by a dairy farm in Hiratsuka in the same
prefecture. This will be the 2nd case of mad cow found in that prefecture.
About one week ago, the cow started showing symptoms of joint dislocation
and difficulty in standing. She was showing no other typical symptoms of
the disease.
The dairy farm has around 60 cows. Since the primary test showed a
possibility of infection, the prefectural government has requested that the
livestock not be moved from the farm.
6 of the 9 previous cows that tested positive were born sometime between 10
Feb 1996 and 4 April 1996. The birth date of the cow in the latest case, 17
Mar 1996, also falls into that time frame. The other infected cow in
Kanagawa was born in December 1995.
According to the final report produced in September 2003 by a study team of
the agricultural ministry, the source of infection for the 6 cows was
meat-and-bone meal [MBM] manufactured from carcasses of cows infected with
the disease before Japan imposed the ban on [MBM] production in November 2001.
The team said it was made from carcasses of cows that came in the 1980s
from Britain or MBM from Italy imported before 1990.
The team estimated there are about 30 potentially infected cattle in Japan.
Officials at the farm and health ministries say the latest discovery was
within what they expected based on that estimate.
The 2 other infected cows were markedly younger when they were tested
positive, at 23 months and 21 months old [respectively]. Researchers
suspect other sources of infection.
The latest case was found in the process of a government initiative,
undertaken since the first mad cow case was reported in Japan, to test all
cows for human consumption for the disease.
At an international symposium on BSE held in Tokyo on Saturday, a Japanese
researcher stressed the need for such comprehensive testing and criticized
the U.S. argument that testing only so-called downer cows with walking
difficulty for the disease should suffice.
Noting that only 2 of the 9 infected cows in Japan had downer symptoms,
Yoshio Yamakawa from the NIID said, "The United States says it can find BSE
only by checking downer cows, but that is utterly groundless."
The Japanese government is calling on the U.S. to conduct blanket cattle
testing for the disease if it wants Japan to lift the beef import ban, but
the U.S. has rejected the suggestion as unscientific.

[4] USA - voluntary testing

USA: US beef producer aims to test all its cattle for BSE
--------------------------------------------------
US beef producer Creekstone Farms has volunteered to start testing every
animal it slaughters for mad cow disease, in a bid to relaunch exports to
foreign customers.
John Stewart, chief executive of Creekstone Farms, said the company has
received assurances from its Asian customers that they would accept its
beef products if every carcass is tested for BSE, reported the Associated
Press.
"We believe it is the right thing to do: to test every animal to give the
American public and consumers a comfort level that every animal coming from
our facility, all the meat coming from our facility, has been BSE-tested
and is BSE-safe," Stewart said.
The Kentucky-based company has submitted a request to the US Department of
Agriculture for the voluntary testing. If the USDA does not approve the
testing within the next 2 months, the company said it will be forced to lay
off workers due to lower demand. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service is the only agency authorised to test for BSE in the US,
the Associated Press reported.
Several countries have banned imports of US beef following the discovery of
a case of BSE in Washington state in December 2003. Japan, one of the
largest buyers of US beef, has said it will not resume imports unless the
US commences 100 percent testing for BSE.
