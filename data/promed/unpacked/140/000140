Deer test positive for chronic wasting disease in West Virginia
---------------------------------------------------------------
The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR) announced today that
3 more free-ranging white-tailed deer in Hampshire County, WV tested
positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). This brings the total number of
CWD-positive deer found in Hampshire County to 13.
These most recent samples were collected from a total of 101 adult deer
taken in March and April [2007] by DNR personnel as part of an ongoing and
intensive CWD surveillance effort. The 3 CWD positive deer were collected
within the CWD Containment Area located north of US Route 50 in Hampshire
County. The CWD laboratory testing was conducted by the Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, which is located at the University of
Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine in Athens, GA.
When CWD was first confirmed in Hampshire County in September 2005, the DNR
immediately implemented its CWD Incident Response Plan. As part of that
plan, the DNR has been engaged in intensive CWD surveillance efforts
designed to determine the distribution and prevalence of the disease.
These surveillance efforts have included carefully planned and coordinated
deer collections within Hampshire County by CWD deer collection teams
comprised of wildlife biologists, wildlife managers and conservation
officers within the DNR.
"These deer collection teams have continued their efforts to gather
appropriate samples within the surveillance area to accurately determine
the prevalence and distribution of CWD," said DNR director, Frank Jezioro.
"Our initial CWD surveillance data suggests the disease is located within a
relatively small geographic area located near Slanesville, WV," noted
Jezioro. This is encouraging news from a wildlife disease management
perspective. "Based upon these findings, we have implemented appropriate
management actions designed to control the spread of this disease, prevent
further introduction of the disease and possibly eliminate the disease from
the state," Jezioro added.
The following disease management strategies have been implemented by the
DNR within the affected area of Hampshire County:
continue CWD surveillance efforts designed to determine the prevalence and
distribution of the disease;
lower deer population levels to reduce the risk of spreading the disease
from deer to deer by implementing appropriate antlerless deer hunting
regulations designed to increase hunter opportunity to harvest female deer;
establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate deer carcass transport
restrictions designed to lower the risk of moving the disease to other
locations; and
establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate regulations relating to
the feeding and baiting of deer within the affected area to reduce the risk
of spreading the disease from deer to deer.
"Landowner cooperation throughout this entire surveillance effort in
Hampshire County continues to be fantastic," Jezioro said. "As we strive to
meet this wildlife disease challenge and implement appropriate management
strategies, the support and involvement of landowners, hunters and other
interested members of the public will continue to be essential."
CWD is a neurological disease found in deer and elk, and it belongs to a
family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The
disease is thought to be caused by abnormal, proteinaceous particles called
prions that slowly attack the brain of infected deer and elk, causing the
animals to progressively become emaciated, display abnormal behavior and
invariably results in the death of the infected animal. There is no known
treatment for CWD, and it is fatal for the infected deer or elk. It is
important to note that currently there is no evidence to suggest CWD poses
a risk for humans or domestic animals.
CWD was first recognized in 1967 in Colorado, and has been found
subsequently in captive herds in 10 states and 2 Canadian provinces and in
free-ranging deer or elk in 11 states and 2 provinces. The source of
infection for wild and captive deer and elk in new geographical areas is
unknown in many instances. While it is not known exactly how CWD is
transmitted, lateral spread from animal to animal through shedding of the
infectious agent from the digestive tract appears to be important, and
indirect transmission through environmental contamination with infective
material is likely.
"Our well-trained and professional staff of wildlife biologists, wildlife
managers and conservation officers is working diligently to fully implement
the DNR's CWD Incident Response Plan which is designed to effectively
address this wildlife disease threat," Jezioro said. "We have some of the
best wildlife biologists and veterinarians in the world, including those
stationed at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens,
GA, working collaboratively on this situation."

and the CWD Alliance website .
