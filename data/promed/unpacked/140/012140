MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND HUMAN HERPES 6 VIRUS
===========================================
Date: Sat, 15 Mar 1997 12:20:17 +0100
From: Pierre Malfait <Pierre_malfait@unicall.be>
Two researchers, Vande Gaer and Van Den Driessche from the Multiple Sclerosis
[MS] clinic in Overpelt, Belgium, demonstrated antibodies against HHV-6
[human herpes 6 virus] in cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients. This
antibodies couldn't been found in healthy controls. HHV-6 is the etiologic
agent of exanthema subitum (Sixth disease, roseola infantum). Their findings
are accepted for publication in The American Journal of Neurology.

[I would have assumed that many people without MS have antibody to HHV-6.
The quality of the "negative" controls would be of utmost significance in
such a study. Something seems to be missing here. I guess we will have to
await the appearance of the publication. -- Mod CHC]
