The epidemic in Haiti could easily get worse despite efforts to control it,
say the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and [Pan
American] Health Organization (PAHO).

Dr Scott Dowell, infectious disease specialist, said "with regard to the
eradication of cholera in Haiti, we have little hope at this point, we
believe that Haiti will have to treat cholera for several years." Recalling
that "the treatment is simple, fast, and can save many lives and it is on
this aspect that health authorities focus."

The NGO Terre des Hommes (TDH) is stepping up briefings and prevention of
cholera in the departments, West and South of Haiti, where the Swiss
organization Save the Children supports some 50 000 earthquake victims.

Professor Michel Roulet, of TDH, which has conducted numerous missions in
Haiti, warns "I have personally witnessed 4 outbreaks of cholera in various
parts of the world but I never saw the spread stopped, whatever the
hardness of the measures taken. We must prepare ourselves to deal with long
weeks of illness until the peak of the epidemic. Then it will take weeks
before it is reduced, knowing there will be new outbreaks in subsequent years."

The latest assessment (cumulative) dated Fri 19 Nov 2010 and published
today [22 Nov 2010] by the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP)
reported 23 377 hospitalizations since the beginning of the epidemic, 2510
additional cases since the last official assessment of 17 Nov 2010 (+12.02
per cent) and 1344 deaths, 94 new additional deaths (+7.52 per cent).

In Port-au-Prince and metropolitan area, (Port-au-Prince: Carrefour, Cite
Soleil, Delmas, Kenscoff, Petion-Ville, Port-au-Prince, Tabarre, and Croix
des Bouquets) 1618 hospitalizations have been reported since the 1st
reported case in this area, that is, 161 additional cases since the last
assessment (187 Nov 2010) (+11.05 per cent) and 77 deaths, 13 new
additional deaths (+20,31 per cent).

The victims in isolated communities are little or not reported. Mortality
rates in the north east (14 per cent), south (9.5 per cent) and south east
(18.2 per cent) were the highest in the country (mortality including deaths
in hospital and community)

[2] Dominican Republic: update

Local media in the Dominican Republic inform that the country's Public
Health Ministry is investigating over 10 suspected cases of cholera. The
Ministry stressed that it does not necessarily mean the people with
symptoms have the disease. One Haitian man, age 30, who had cholera-like
symptoms, was found not to have the infection after lab tests, said Doctor
Bautista Rojas Gomez, minister of health.

A confirmed case involving a resident of Higuey, age 32, has made a full
recovery and has been discharged from hospital, authorities report. He was
the 1st confirmed case of cholera in the Dominican Republic. [The infection
was acquired in Haiti. - Mod.LL]

Officials also report that a 3 month old baby girl who came into hospital
with cholera-like symptoms is stable and doing well. Her grandmother, who
is at home, is being tested. Dominican Republic health authorities are
asking the media not to get carried away when reporting the number of
suspected cases, for them to rely on confirmed figures rather than wild
speculations and rumor as it is crucial that the population is not alarmed
unnecessarily, they added.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the cholera epidemic will
inevitably make its way into the Dominican Republic. However, WHO is sure
any outbreak will be nowhere as fast spreading as the Haitian one. The
Dominican Republic has more resources and is better equipped to deal with a
cholera outbreak, said Christian Lindmeier, a WHO spokesperson. However,
people infected with cholera could have crossed the border before the onset
of symptoms.

[3] Dominican Republic: update

Several suspected cases of cholera are currently under investigation in the
country, including a 3 year old child and a woman who have been admitted to
the San Lorenzo de Los Mina hospital, and a 30 year old Haitian who has
been admitted in a hospital in the El Almirante sector after arriving in
the country from Chile, via Panama.

The public health minister, Bautista Rojas Gomez, said that between 13 and
14 different cultures of patients with suspicious signs are currently under
investigation in the National Laboratory.

The child tested positive by a rapid test, but is awaiting lab results. The
Haitian man with suspected cholera arrived from Chile via Panama, with
symptoms of the disease. He was detected by the system upon arrival at the
airport and admitted in the care center at El Almirante, in North Santo
Domingo, where he is isolated. The hospital director, Aracelis Cruz Jaquez,
said that the patient was transferred to the center at 2:30 in the morning
and at noon yesterday [16 Nov 2010] he was stable and hydrated.

She explained that the patient has been living for 2 years in the country,
had visited Haiti in October 2010, and then traveled to Chile where he has
relatives, but there fell ill and was returned to the country via Panama.
He was met by a committee of public health epidemiologists, who took him to
the clinic.

The Ministry of Public Health is conducting active surveillance for
diarrhea in the whole country, with visits to each house. When a case is
found it will be recorded in the system and closely monitored.

[4] Potential use of cholera vaccine
Date: Thu 18 Nov 2010
Source: SciDevNet [edited]
<http://www.scidev.net/en/news/expert-calls-for-cholera-vaccine-roll-out-in-haiti.html>


A leading cholera expert has called on WHO to mobilize a new vaccine so it
can be used in Haiti's cholera epidemic. Stephen Calderwood, chief of the
infectious diseases division at the Massachusetts General Hospital, USA,
said the vaccine -- ShanChol -- is cheap and effective and should be rolled
out with minimum delay.

ShanChol is already on sale in India and Viet Nam but is awaiting
"prequalification" by WHO's Prequalification of Medicines Program, which
ensures the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines -- essential before
they can be distributed internationally by the UN and US agencies.

The vaccine was first developed in 1997 and has been used in Viet Nam since
1998, where it is licensed as ORC-Vax. It was then adapted in 2004 by
scientists at the International Vaccine Institute, South Korea, to meet WHO
production guidelines. More recently, ShanChol passed phase III clinical
trials in India, where it reduced cholera incidence by two thirds among 70
000 people, in 2009.

"I think there is already adequate data for the use of the vaccine in the
epidemic -- [the WHO] should be buying vaccine right now and getting it to
Haiti," said Calderwood. "For some reason ShanChol has not yet been
prequalified. I communicated with the WHO recently and I think they are
going to move ahead and prequalify it," he said.

[5] Haiti: possible alternative source of cholera
Date: Mon 22 Nov 2010
Source: The Guardian, SciDevNet report [edited]
<http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/22/haiti-cholera-un-weather>


Weather conditions, not UN soldiers, may have triggered Haiti's cholera
epidemic, which has killed more than 1000 people in less than a month, 3
leading researchers have told SciDevNet.

A coincidence of catastrophic events, from climatic changes caused by the
ocean-atmosphere phenomenon La Nina, to the plunge in water and sanitation
quality following Haiti's disastrous January [2010] earthquake, provide the
most likely explanation for the outbreak.

The outbreak suddenly appeared in small communities along the Artibonite
River, 60 miles [96.5 km] north of the capital Port-au-Prince, on 21 Oct
2010. Its origin has not been determined with certainty but the popular
belief is that the disease arrived with infected UN soldiers from Nepal.
They were stationed in a rural base near the river where the outbreak first
started. Cholera is endemic in Nepal whereas Haiti has not had a recorded
cholera case in the last 50 years.

CDC said in a press release earlier this month [November 2010] that genetic
analysis of the cholera strain that hit Haiti reveals that it most closely
matches South Asian strains, which further fuelled the suspicion.

But scientists SciDevNet talked to all rejected the idea that cholera was
imported from Nepal. "_Vibrio cholerae_, the bacterium responsible for
cholera, may have been dormant in water until weather-related conditions
caused it to multiply enough to constitute an infective dose if ingested by
humans," said David Sack, a cholera specialist at Johns Hopkins University
Bloomberg School of Public Health in the USA.

Rita Colwell, a professor at the University of Maryland, also in the USA,
agreed that the aquatic environment conditions produced by a strong La Nina
this year [2010] may have made cholera flare up in Haiti for the 1st time
in 50 years.

Colwell's research aims to predict cholera outbreaks by correlating disease
occurrence with weather patterns, water surface temperatures, and algal
blooms (on which plankton that house the bacteria feed). She has found that
the annual patterns of higher sea temperatures along the coast correlate
with patterns of cholera cases in both Bangladesh and Peru, based on data
from 1992-1995 and 1997-2000, respectively.

Weather conditions do not have to be present together with poor sanitation
and lack of clean water for an epidemic to occur, she said, but the latter
increase chances of an outbreak. Cholera spreads when faeces from infected
humans, who may not present any cholera symptoms, get into drinking water
that other people consume.

Afsar Ali, an associate professor of environmental and global health at the
University of Florida, USA, agrees that climatic factors promoted the
bacteria's multiplication in the Artibonite area. He told SciDevNet that
when he visited Haiti in August 2010, refugees from the earthquake were
using water directly from the river and ocean.

[Cholera is found, albeit rarely, along the Gulf coast of the USA, along
with other pathogenic vibrios such as _V. vulnificus_ and _V.
parahaemolyticus_. Certainly the weather conditions can increase
replication of vibrios during warmer weather together with the lack of
clean water and adequate sewage disposal. The strain, however, was a South
Asian one suggesting introduction from that area either from a person or
from bilge water from a ship from that area. Establishing "blame" here does
not help in the outbreak, however, as the pale horse is out of the barn. -
