Staph blamed for foodborne illness outbreak among Coachella bus drivers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials have determined that _Staphylococcal aureus_ enterotoxin is the source behind more than 100 foodborne illnesses among bus drivers who shuttled crowds to and from the Coachella Festival in California.

The festival was on [15-17 and 22-24 Apr 2022] and officials immediately began investigating reports of illnesses after the 2nd weekend of the event. At least 45 bus drivers went to hospitals with symptoms in Riverside County, with others reporting illnesses but not seeking medical attention. Public health officials in Riverside County, where the festival was held, have said dozens more illnesses were likely reported outside its jurisdiction.

On [13 May 2022], Riverside County announced that catered food served to the bus drivers had tested positive for _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterotoxin.

"Tests conducted on food collected after dozens of employees of a shuttle bus company became ill last month [April 2022] detected a bacterial toxin that can cause the symptoms described by those who became sick," according to a statement from the county public health department. "A state health department laboratory reported this week that _Staphylococcus aureus_ enterotoxin was detected in the food sample collected by a Los Angeles County resident who became ill shortly after eating a dinner catered for employees of a shuttle bus company on [24 Apr 2022]."

The public health statement did not identify a specific food or caterer. But, local media reported that the meals in question included fettuccine, meatballs, premixed salad, and bread, and carne asada burritos, chicken, and rice, according to a report from News Channel 3 in Coachella Valley.

"Officials with the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health confirmed to News Channel 3 that the 2 facilities are Sacher Enterprises, a commissary kitchen, and Croux & Co., a local catering company," according to the local news report.

"Through collaboration with Environmental Health and the vendor, we have been able to interview hundreds of people who attended the dinner with the idea of determining the circumstances around the meal," Kim Saruwatari, director of the Riverside County Public Health Department said in an outbreak update on [13 May 2022]. "The goal was to identify the specific food or item that caused so many to become ill."

"According to the CDC, staphylococcal food poisoning results from eating food contaminated with toxins produced by this bacteria. The toxin can cause of a variety of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and diarrhea," states the update from the county. "The best way to avoid food poisoning by _Staphylococcus aureus_ is to prevent perishable food from being held at room temperature for more than 2 hours."

[Staphylococcal enterotoxin food poisoning presents classically as a short incubation (2-6 hours) illness manifesting primarily as nausea and vomiting without fever.

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analysis of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 micrograms in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LL
