Toxic red tide spreads off China
--------------------------------
A toxic red tide has blanketed the equivalent of more than 1.3 million
soccer fields of sea, off eastern China, threatening marine and human life,
state media say [the area of an association football (soccer) pitch may
vary, but it is about three quarters of a hectare (ha; 10 000 square
metres). Thus the red tide is said to cover 975 000 ha (about 2.4 million
acres). - Mod.SH]. The tide is caused by plankton reproducing itself in
large quantities through nutrients provided in part by sewage and
industrial waste.

As was reported in the Sat 15 May China Daily, the vice-minister at the
State Environmental Protection Administration, Pan Yue, warned people about
eating fish from the area off Zhoushan in Zhejiang province. "It might
cause damage to humans, because the red tide contains paralyzing toxins,"
he said. "The phenomenon, though colorful in appearance, is very dangerous,
because it can lead to the death of aquatic life, and, therefore, cause
damage to the fishing industry."

The red tide 1st appeared at the beginning of May. "Due to the fact that
the current environment in the sea areas is good for the organisms to
survive, the tide will continue for a period of time," the newspaper said.

[Numerous algal organisms can produce the toxic phenomenon known as red
tide. The algae most often affect seafood that is consumed by people, and
its effects are reported as paralytic shellfish poisoning. Red tides may
produce respiratory irritation in swimmers and beach goers. - Mod.TG]
