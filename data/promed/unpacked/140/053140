[Anna Papa, Associate Professor of Microbiology in the Medical School
of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, and Head of the
Molecular Diagnostics and Special Pathogens Lab in the Department of
Microbiology has sent the following information concerning the
phylogenetic relationship of the CCHF virus recently isolated from a
human patient in Greece. - Mod.CP]


We have done the laboratory diagnosis for the recent fatal
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case in Greece. [For details
see ProMED archive listed below. - Mod.CP].

Samples were positive in RT-nested PCR [reverse transcriptase nested
polymerase chain reaction test, which detects virus in the sample. -
Mod.JW], while a quantitive Real Time RT-PCR showed that the woman was
carrying a high viral load. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
showed that the new Greek CCHF strain clusters within the
European/Turkish clade, differing by 1-2 percent from strains from
Turkey, Bulgaria, Kosovo and Albania. The analysis was performed with
respective sequences currently available in the GenBank DataBase.

The present strain is not at all related to the old AP92 Greek CCHF
virus strain, which is little or not at all pathogenic to humans. This
is the 1st CCHF case in Greece. No secondary cases are reported.
Surveillance studies on humans, animals and ticks are planned.
