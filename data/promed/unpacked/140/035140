Last year [2021] it emerged that the number of registered gonorrhea cases rose by 5 percent from 2019 to 2020 [https://cphpost.dk/?p=130294]. But apparently, it's not the only sexually transmitted disease (STD) making inroads in Denmark. New figures from the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) show that syphilis is also on the march.

Following a decline from 2015-to 2018, the number of registered cases is starting to rise from 326 cases in 2018 to 365 in 2019 and then to 446 in 2020. That's a 36 percent increase in just 2 years and a trend that SSI says continued into 2021. It is particularly homosexual men who are driving the surge as they accounted for 72 percent of cases in 2019 and 70 percent of cases in 2020. Most were infected in Denmark.

There were only 39 cases in 2019 and 37 cases in 2020 involving women.

"Usually, more people are infected abroad, but that wasn't possible due to travel restrictions," said Susan Cowan, a SSI section head. "But the fewer travel-related cases have not curbed the overall number of cases -- on the contrary. So despite the travel and other restrictions here, people have been infected in Denmark anyways."

Despite the COVID-19 epidemic, restrictions, and fewer trips abroad, the number of syphilis cases in Denmark increased in both 2019 and 2020, according to new data from the Statens Serum Institut (SSI). After the number of syphilis cases decreased in Denmark in the years 2015-2018, they have now started to increase again.

In 2018, 326 cases of syphilis were reported to the Reporting System for Infectious Diseases (MIS). In 2019, the number rose to 365 cases and in 2020 to 446 cases. This corresponds to an increase of 36% in 2 years, and the rising trend has continued into 2021. Men having sex with men (MSM) accounted for 72% of the reported cases in 2019 and 70% in 2020. The syphilis annual statement also shows that the vast majority of those who became infected with syphilis in 2019 and 2020 have been infected in Denmark.

"Normally, there are more people who become infected with syphilis when traveling abroad, but they could not in 2020 due to travel restrictions. However, the fewer travel-related cases have not caused the total number of reported cases to fall -- on the contrary. So despite travel restrictions and restrictions here at home, people have still been infected in Denmark." - Susan Cowan, Section Leader, SSI

In addition to syphilis, SSI recently reported gonorrhea has also increased in recent years.

Looking at the age distribution, syphilis most often occurred among the 40-49-year-olds in both 2019 and 2020. For men, the median age was 40 years in both years, while for women it was 32 years and 34 years, respectively. In 2019, 7 of the 39 reported cases of syphilis among women were found in pregnant women, while in 2020 it was 9 out of 37 cases. "It could indicate that there is an undiagnosed group among women and probably also among heterosexual men," Susan Cowan said.

[Unlike the situation in the USA, where the incidence of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in women has increased every year since 2012 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/congenital-syphilis.htm), the news reports above say that in Denmark, the incidence of syphilis in women did not change in 2019 and 2020. In the USA and several other countries (such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan), the increase incidence of P&S syphilis in women was accompanied by increases in congenital syphilis.

Similar to Denmark, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported in 2019 that in the EU/EEA the increase in incidence in syphilis in the years 2007-2017 was occurring mainly in men having sex with men (MSM); increases were not seen in women, although the EU/EEA report said that syphilis rates increased in women in "some western EU/EEA countries, without specifying these countries by name (see ProMED post Syphilis - Europe: ECDC, MSM, 2010-2017 20190715.6568104). Consistent with decreasing rates in women in the EU/EEA, congenital syphilis rates in the EU/EEA were reported to have been also decreasing since 2005.

The reasons for the increases in incidence of syphilis are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for syphilis could contribute to some extent to the increased incidence in some groups, such as MSM. Some of the factors that could promote unprotected (condomless) sex include lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers and young adults; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive "party drugs"; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/index.html). - Mod.ML
