Horse feed dealers are the key to identifying whether there is a
potential problem with recently purchased Purina feed, according to
Land O'Lakes spokesperson Lydia Botham.

Land O'Lakes Purina Feed LLC recently announced a recall of certain
horse feed products manufactured at 3 East Coast facilities. The
products might contain an ingredient with an unacceptably high level
of aflatoxin.

Aflatoxins are a form of mycotoxin and are secondary metabolites
produced by _Aspergillus_ spp. fungi. According to Gary Osweiler,
DVM, PhD, professor of veterinary toxicology at Iowa State
University, effects of aflatoxins can be progressive as well as
cumulative. At levels greater than 50 ppb (parts per billion),
aflatoxins can cause signs such as feed refusal, fever, weight loss,
sluggishness, liver damage, jaundice, bloody diarrhea, kidney damage,
birth defects, tumors, and suppressed immune function.

Botham said there have not been any confirmed health complaints due
to aflatoxins related to the current recall of feed.

Feed Recall:

The recalled feed was produced at:
- Purina's Statesville, N.C., plant between 3 Nov 2007 and 8 Feb 2008;
- Harrisburg, P.A., 1 Jan 2008 and 8 Feb 2008; and
- Guilderland, N.Y., 1 Jan 2008, and 10 Mar 2008.
Dealers in the following states might have sold affected product:
- Connecticut,
- Delaware,
- Georgia,
- Maine,
- Maryland,
- Massachusetts,
- New Hampshire,
- New Jersey,
- New York,
- North Carolina,
- Pennsylvania,
- Rhode Island,
- South Carolina,
- Tennessee,
- Vermont,
- Virginia, and
- West Virginia.

The recall is voluntary and precautionary, Botham stressed.

Dealers were notified of the recall in March 2008. Botham said the
aflatoxin was discovered through routine product testing performed by
a state regulatory agency, with results confirmed by company testing.

The potentially affected feed products were manufactured at 3
facilities and sold in 17 states (see sidebar). Horse owners in these
states should call their feed dealer to see whether they received
affected product.

"Different dealers got different products, so the best thing (horse
owners) can do is go to their dealer," Botham said. "The dealer is
really the hub; they're the ones who will know if anyone in their
area may have received this product."

The feed in question was manufactured between November 2007 and March
2008, depending on the manufacturing plant from which it originated.

Hank Yohe, warehouse manager and equine specialist at Global Ag
Associates in York, P.A., a Purina feed dealer, said he heard about
the recall about 3 weeks ago.

"As soon as I found out about it, all the customers that I could
identify I contacted immediately," Yohe said. "But I knew I didn't
have any feed of that vintage in my warehouse. We turn our feed
around about every 2 weeks. So the feed that was in question I knew
had already gone out, was already sold, and probably was already
fed." Yohe said he has not received any questions from customers nor
complaints about the products.

According to a statement released by Purina, the concern stems from a
single ingredient, which originated with a specific supplier.

"The product had the presence of aflatoxin above the level of what we
would consider acceptable," Botham said.

Purina is no longer using this supplier. However, it was noted in the
statement that other feed companies that utilize this supplier might
also be affected.

"I'm not aware of any aflatoxin contamination issues affecting Triple
Crown Nutrition's equine formulas," said Rob Daugherty, CEO of Triple
Crown Nutrition, Inc. "Triple Crown Nutrition offers fixed feed
formulas utilizing ingredients that are typically not affected by
aflatoxins like those sometimes found in corn screenings and/or peanut hulls."

Some other feeds companies are working to find out the identity of
the supplier to ensure their products do not contain the affected ingredient.

[Although aflatoxin can be cumulative, there is a difference in
species specificities. Since dose determines the toxin, a small dose
is likely not to result in all the clinical signs listed. There are
also guidelines, and then there are regulatory actions, which may not
take into account the toxic dose. The dose is very important.

The horse is not that sensitive to aflatoxin. Consequently, a 50 part
per billion dose may not necessarily be a toxic dose. Aflatoxin is
not homogenous throughout a feed sample. Consequently, one portion of
a bag of feed may be hot (high level of aflatoxin, which in this case
is still very low, 50 ppb), and the next bag or several bags may have
none at all.

When sampling, it is difficult to test all the feed. If all the feed
were tested, there would be no product to feed the animals.
Consequently, one sample from a given bag may have aflatoxin in it,
and the next may not. It is not homogeneous in grain samples.

Also, I seem to recall most horses seem to show clinical signs around
the 800 ppb level. - Mod.TG]
