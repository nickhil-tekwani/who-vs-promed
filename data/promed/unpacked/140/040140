China (Hong Kong SAR): Health alert after oysters leave 46 ill
--------------------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong has issued a health alert after 46 people who ate oysters in
recent weeks fell sick, the government said in the city's latest food
scare. The southern Chinese territory's Centre for Health Protection stated
on Thursday [19 Oct 2006] the victims had all suffered abdominal pain,
diarrhoea, vomiting and fever after eating raw oysters sold in five
different food premises between 22 Sep and 11 Oct this year [2006].
"Raw oysters are considered a high-risk food," the alert stated. "As such,
people should pay special attention to such health risks." It said patients
had been infected by norovirus, hepatitis A, or harmful bacteria like
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.
The latest scare follows a warning last week concerning freshwater fish
imported from China that were contaminated with a cancer-causing industrial
dye. Locally caught seafood is also considered at high risk of
contamination from heavy metals and other poisons lurking in the city's
polluted waters.
Hong Kong is subject to frequent food scares as unlicensed goods smuggled
from China -- where quality control checks are lax -- find their way into
public markets and restaurants.

[It is not clear from this report whether specific diagnoses have been
made. The three agents cited have been associated frequently with illness
resulting from consumption of raw or partially cooked filter-feeding
shell-fish such as oysters. _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of
seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, is associated typically with
the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm water estuaries, but the
_V. parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not
imply sewage contamination. The presence of enteric viruses, such as
hepatitis A virus (family _Picornaviridae_ and noroviruses (family
_Caliciviridae_), are an indication of water pollution which appears to
have been a factor in this outbreak of disease. The noroviruses and
hepatitis A virus are recognized as frequent cause of gastroenteritis, with
their main means of transmission being by the oralï¿½faecal route. The
noroviruses are diverse and infection results in short-lived immunity,
There is no protective vaccine. Hepatitis A virus infection provides
long-lived immunity, and a reliable and safe protective vaccine is
available. - Mod.CP]
