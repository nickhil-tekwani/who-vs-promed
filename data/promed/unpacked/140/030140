Cholera deaths soar, new cases continue to pour in
-----------------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic in Guinea-Bissau has now killed 64 people, the
Health Ministry said, almost triple the number of deaths just 3 weeks
ago. In its latest bulletin, published on Mon 1 Aug 2005, the
ministry said the number of cases of cholera had more than doubled
over the same timeframe, with 4331 cases now recorded since the
epidemic began in this small West African nation in mid-June 2005.
More than 3/4ths of those people suffering with cholera are to be
found in the capital, Bissau, a city of 300 000 built on low-lying
land on the banks of a muddy river estuary. The health ministry said
officials were still registering between 50 and 75 new cholera cases
every day in Bissau, where 26 people have already died from the
water-borne disease.
"We are very worried about how this epidemic is developing in the
country. As you can see, the numbers are still going up," Tome Ca,
the health ministry official overseeing the crisis, told IRIN.
The disease has struck all but 2 regions of the country, Bafata and
Gabou in the east.
8 Portuguese staff from the international aid agency Medecins du
Monde, have been dispatched to the central region of Biombo, which is
the worst affected after the capital. The government has urged people
to boil all drinking water and wash their hands before eating and
after going to the toilet.

Cholera outbreaks in northeastern Uganda
-----------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of cholera in Kotido district in
northeastern Uganda, according to a report from Radio Uganda on Sun
24 Jul 2005. The area member of parliament, Rex Achilla, told
government radio that the most hit sub-county is Panyangira, where 3
people have already died.
Rex Achilla said the number of patients being admitted has
overwhelmed health centers. He appealed to the Minister of Health,
Jim Muhwezi, to intervene by sending more medical equipment and
medicine to the district. The MP also advised local people to avoid
drinking un-boiled water.
Last week [3rd week July 2005], the WHO sent health experts to study
the cholera outbreak in Uganda's northwestern district of Arua, where
over 20 people had been killed by the water-borne disease since 16
Jun 2005. In a similar development, over 10 people have been killed
since June 2005 in the Katanga slum, a suburb of Kampala.

Cholera Hits Sudan Camp
---------------------------
After a week of calm, the cholera epidemic has resurged in Arua
district, with new cases reported from a Sudanese refugee settlement
in the upper areas of Madi-Okollo county. A man has been killed, and
5 others are said to have contracted the disease mid last week [3rd
week July 2005].
Subsequently, an 8-member team of Arua district officials, led by the
Deputy Resident District Commissioner, Mr. Henry Ringakech, on Sat 23
Jul 2005, closed 4 primary and secondary schools and a market in the
camp.
Meanwhile, 2 new infections have also been confirmed in the outlying
Offaka sub-county, which borders with Nebbi town council, where 2
cholera cases were reportedly admitted within the last 24 hours.
According to medical sources, sporadic outbreaks of cholera have been
reported in Nebbi town council and Wadelai landing site in the past 2
weeks, raising fears that fishmongers from Arua, who frequent the
bay, could contract and spread the disease further in the district.

Outbreak of cholera in Iran reported
---------------------------------------
At least 3 people have been killed and several others hospitalized
following an outbreak of cholera in the city of Qom, a government-run
website reported on Tue 2 Aug 2005.
The website Baztab, citing unofficial reports, said that, on Mon 1
Aug 2005, authorities quickly moved to close all the sources of water
in various locations throughout Qom.
Officials from the Health Ministry and several health experts had
surmised that the main cause for the new outbreak of the cholera
disease was contaminated water reservoirs. The authorities in Qom
have now warned residents of the threats posed to them.
The last reported outbreak of cholera in Iran was in 1996.

Afghanistan: fears of cholera outbreak after 20 deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Fears are growing of a major cholera outbreak in the northern
provinces of Afghanistan, after the deaths of 20 people in 5 villages
in the Shahr-e Bozorg District of the Badakhshan Province. The
Iranian radio station, Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran, quotes
the head of the health department in the province, Dr. Abdol Momem
Jalali, as saying that the outbreak was caused by the hot weather and
lack of access to safe drinking water.
Most of those who died were children. Mawlawi Faizollah, an official
from the Shahr-e Bozorg District, said there is no health clinic in
the area. Instead, it is left to foreign organizations to provide
healthcare, and this wasn't enough, he said, as they had not
administered any medicine to the cholera patients, who later died.
Dr. Jalali said one health organization, Merlin, which was working in
the area, had not had any report of a cholera outbreak, but he added
that a health team had been sent to the area to help.
There have also been reports of cholera outbreaks in some districts
of the Konduz and Baghlan provinces.
