The Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System (CAHSS) has reported a new case of strangles in the township of North Grenville, Ontario.

An 8-year-old Quarter Horse mare unvaccinated for strangles presented with clinical signs of coughing, lethargy, and pyrexia on 27 Sep 2018. Samples were taken for strangles PCR, and results were received on 3 Oct 2018. The mare tested positive for _Streptococcus equi_ (strangles) and has been kept in a quarantined paddock since the identification of clinical signs. Treatment with anti-inflammatories and antibiotics was initiated, and she is recovering well.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated B-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. _S. equi_ is the most common cause of brain abscess in horses, albeit rare.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3%-5%) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and to improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease. Tracheotomy may be required in horses with retropharyngeal abscessation and pharyngeal compression.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but it ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (24 hours or less from onset of fever) will usually arrest abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, IM, bid) is the antibiotic of choice. Untreated guttural pouch infections can result in persistent guttural pouch empyema with or without chondroid formation.

Post-exposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses, and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of strangles is reduced by 50% in horses vaccinated with IM products that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive (inactivated by core body temperature) like the intranasal influenza vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at subsequent IM injection sites (live bacteria on hands of administrator), submandibular lymphadenopathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.

Most horses continue to shed _S. equi_ for around one month after recovery. Three negative nasopharyngeal swabs at intervals of 4-7 days should be obtained before release from quarantine, and the minimal isolation period should be one month. Prolonged bacterial shedding (as long as 18 months) has been identified in a small number of horses. Guttural pouch empyema is the source of infection in most prolonged carrier states. Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal swab and/or guttural pouch lavage is used to identify persistent carriers.

This disease can be wearing on the horse as well as the owner. Prevention is the best route to take, especially if your horse is showing, racing, rodeoing, or an athlete, or just a pretty pet at a petting fair.
