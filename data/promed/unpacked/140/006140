Survivors of the 1995 sarin gas attack by the Aum Supreme Truth cult on the
Tokyo subway system urged the government Friday to ensure that treatment
for continuing effects on their health is paid for from public funds.
Representatives of a group, comprising 150 survivors and bereaved family
members, said that many survivors continue to suffer physical aftereffects
such as headaches, vision defects and psychological disorders. Saturday
marked the fourth anniversary of the attack.
The group also requested that the government organize checks of victims'
medical conditions, that a system of regular medical check-ups be
established, and that they be provided with ongoing professional medical
care at public expense, the representatives said.
They also requested close monitoring of the future activities of Aum, whose
members carried out the gas attack that killed 12 people and injured more
than 5,000.
The group representatives complained that cult followers had continued in
their day-to-day activities as they did before the attack, suggesting that
they had reflected little on the dire results of Aum's criminal actions.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said that it may be wise to revise
the Antisubversive Activities Law in reaction to Aum Supreme Truth's
renewed activities, following the rejection of a request by the public
security authorities to apply the draconian law to the cult in 1997. "I'm
tempted to ask why the law exists when I stop to think of the growing
concerns held by residents in many areas where Aum members are increasingly
active today," the top government spokesman said during a press conference.
Nonaka added, "The (security authorities') request was dismissed in the
belief that the cult would never come back in strength."

[This helps to put the results of the attack in perspective. 12 people
died, 5,000 people were seen at emergency departments (although 4,000 of
those had not been in the subway, but were worried about possible contact
with those who had), 1,247 responded to a 1998 Tokyo Metropolitan Police
Department survey, of whom more than 70 percent said they still suffer from
some psychological aftereffects, and here are 150 people who say they
continue to suffer physical aftereffects.
Thus, while not at all discounting the heinous nature of the crime, the
actual physical effect of the attack was an order of magnitude smaller than
the terror effect; on the other hand, the effect on the public & private
purse may be quite large. - Mod.JW
