Hepatitis E still spreading in Kitgum
-------------------------------------
At least 53 new cases of hepatitis E have been recorded among
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the northern district of
Kitgum at the start of the current rainy season, officials said. Most
were reported in the village health centres of Lukung, Amida, Padibe,
Layamu, and Kitgum town, according to Sylvester Opira, chairman of
the hepatitis E control taskforce in Kitgum.

"New cases of infection are being received at health centres, with
women and children ranking high," Opira told IRIN in Kitgum. Poor
sanitation in areas of return for IDPs and the rains had contributed
to the spread of the disease. Few people, Opira said, had latrines in
their homes while some were drinking water from unprotected sources,
which could be contaminated. "People with no latrines in their homes
will be arrested and forced to sink latrines," he added.

Up to 156 people have so far died of hepatitis E in Kitgum since 2007
when the disease was first reported. Another 9912 people have been
infected. Tony Toolit, the Kitgum district secretary for health, told
IRIN the main problem was lack of clean water for people returning to
villages. "In some places, people are drinking water from ponds and
streams, [thus] spreading the infection," he said. Toolit said safe
water and latrine coverage in Kitgum was only about 40 percent. There
was, therefore, a need to scale up prevention messages, provide clean
water and assist IDPs with latrine construction materials.

Hepatitis E is a viral disease spread [via] the faecal-oral route.
Outbreaks tend to be linked to contaminated water or food supplies.
Mortality rates are generally low, ranging from 0.5 to 4.0 percent.
But among pregnant women in their 3rd trimester this rate can rise to
20 percent.

[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until
1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus, a
non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus. Although
man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to HEV or
closely related viruses have been detected in primates and several
other animal species. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the
faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a waterborne disease, and
contaminated water or food supplies have been implicated in major
outbreaks. There is a possibility also of zoonotic spread of the
virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows, sheep, goats,
and rodents are susceptible to infection. The risk factors for
hepatitis E virus infection are related to poor sanitation in large
areas of the world, and shedding of the virus in faeces.
Person-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for
sexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest
rates of infection occur in regions where low standards of sanitation
promote the transmission of the virus. However, sporadic cases of
hepatitis E have also been reported elsewhere and serological surveys
suggest a global distribution of strains of hepatitis E of low
pathogenicity. Further information can be accessed at
