Leaf spot disease in Dong Nai cornfields
----------------------------------------
Leaf spot disease blights the leaves of field corn crops and can
decrease crop yield significantly in Dong Nai province, because corn
leaf diseases generally cause greatest yield losses when infection
occurs early in the growth stages of the plant.

Nearly 800 hectares [1977 acres] of corn in this year's [2011] crop in
the province have been struck by the disease so far, according to the
Provincial Plant Protection Department [PPPD]. The 3 hardest hit areas
were Xuan Loc and Cam My districts and Long Khanh town.

High moisture content from heavy rains in recent months has created
conditions conducive to disease outbreaks on corn. The PPPD has urged
local farmers to spray chemicals on affected corn plants to prevent
the spreading of the disease.

[A large number of fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens are known to
cause leaf spot or leaf blight symptoms on maize. Reliable diagnosis
of the pathogen(s) causing the problem described above is needed so
effective disease management strategies can be designed.
