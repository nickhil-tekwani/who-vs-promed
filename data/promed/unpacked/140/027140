Costa Rica: reappearance of dengue type 1
------------------------------------------
The Department of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Ministry of Health
reports that so far this year [2002] there have been about 4435 cases of
dengue, including 11 cases of DHF.
According to studies by the Costa Rican Institute of Research & Training in
Nutrition & Health (INCIENSA), Costa Ricans are now exposed to 2 serotypes
of dengue. Type 1 has been absent from the country since the year 2000, but
has reappeared.
Minister of Health Maria del Rocio Saenz explained that when a person has
been infected by one serotype of dengue, they remain immune for life; but
if such a person catches a different strain, then the chances of suffering
from DHF are increased.
