Two new cases of rat lungworm disease were confirmed on the Big Island Wednesday [13 Feb 2019]. According to the Department of Health, 2 adults have contracted the disease; one is a visitor who was on vacation last year [2018].

The visitor became sick in late December [2018] and was diagnosed and hospitalized after returning home. That person has since recovered. The 2nd case was an East Hawaii resident who became ill in January [2019] and then was hospitalized in early February [2019].

The Department of Health is conducting an investigation into the possible sources of infection. The disease is spread by ingesting a snail or slug infected with the parasite. The Department of Health recommends avoiding handling snails or slugs without gloves and washing all fruits and vegetables thoroughly before eating.
