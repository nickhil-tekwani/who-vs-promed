A herd of 138 cows will be slaughtered in Seine-Maritime [Department, France] after a new case of bovine tuberculosis [bTB] (a disease that can be transmitted from livestock to humans) was discovered in a farm.

Tests were carried out at the end of June [2014], following the discovery of suspicious lesions on a cow from a breeding farm in Seine-Maritime. The services of the departmental management for the protection of populations (DDPP) are certain of it: in this farm, at least one cow was infected by this disease and the whole unit (138 cows) will have to be slaughtered before the end of summer.

This new case of bTB constitutes "a true economic risk" for agriculture in Seine-Maritime. France, which managed to eradicate the disease after several epidemics, is now among the countries that gained the trust of meat buyers. But if the bovine tuberculosis spreads, beyond a certain rate of infection, mistrust could be detrimental to the export of French livestock products.

In order to avoid the transmission, the DDPP must act quickly: its agents will check the livestock and assess the cost of the slaughter for the farmer. The state will have to compensate this farmer in Seine-Maritime. It will take some time during which expert assessment and 2nd opinion will be carried out. Then the cows will be slaughtered. The carcasses of bTB-free cattle will be sold and enter the food chain, and the suspicious carcasses will be eliminated. Then, based on these results, the history of the cattle will have to be examined.

"The bacterium that contaminated this livestock is not the one that was present in the forest of Brotonne. It comes from another region and we need to track the travels of the infected animals to find out where the animal that transmitted the disease comes from. We will also need to know if some infected animals could have been sold by the breeder and we will need to find them," the director of the DDPP of Seine-Maritime explained.

Bovine TB is not new in Seine Maritime. In August 2013, the veterinary services discovered an infected cow at the slaughterhouse. 30 percent of the bovines of this herd were found infected. "It is usually around 1 to 2 percent. Beyond, it is worrisome", the director said.

Other cases had been reported in the said area since early 2000. And it is especially for this reason that the herds are under close surveillance.

"We had a very particular strain. In this area of Seine-Maritime, we had the 1st case of bovine tuberculosis in wild animals. We prohibited screening, to ensure that the animals have very little contact between them. The number of infected animals, the prevalence, had increased. We had to kill many deer and decrease the population of wild boar," the expert explained.

[France maintains -- since December 2000 -- the status of a country "officially bTB free" according to OIE's international criteria ("at least 99.8 percent of the herds free"). Herd surveillance has been applied in areas with historical background and in herds with high potential for spread (such as raw milk dairy farms).

Three potential wild bTB reservoirs are suspected in France -- wild boar, red deer, and badger. - Mod.AS
