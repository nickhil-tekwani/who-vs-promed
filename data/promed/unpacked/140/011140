This is an updated report on malaria situation in Bavaro, Dominican
Republic. A previous report was delivered on 15 Dec 1999.
As it was reported, an outbreak of malaria was detected from week 31 (1999)
in the section of El Salado, Bavaro included, in the province of la
Altagracia in Dominican Republic, linked to building construction
activities. On 13 Dec 1999 national authorities of health delivered an
international alert for travelers coming to Bavaro to use chemoprophylaxis
until a new official report. From this date, a special reinforced strategy
of control was set in this area.
Basically, new measures were the incorporation of a responsible of health
[official in any construction and also an auxiliary for any 300 workers
in every construction. These personnel are under training and supervision
of the national malaria program and are charged to give presumptive malaria
treatment to any new worker coming to the area and also to any of them when
detected with fever. All these patients are reported on a daily base to
malaria program in order to take laboratory samples and to complete radical
treatment if positive. A strong enforcement has been set in order to assure
[compliance.
Other measures for control, as usual in the country, have been the use of
biolarvicides (_B. thuringiensis_), thermal fogs with malathion and
application of phenitrotion in houses. Epidemiological surveillance and lab
facilities were reinforced in the area.
An updated epidemiological report dated 4 Feb 2000, concluded that this
outbreak is finished. In the locality of Bavaro, [the outbreak ended on
week 51, in other localities of section El Salado the outbreak ended on
week 52, 1999 or week 1, 2000. For the last weeks the number of cases
reported is lower than previous years in the same places. They are imported
from other areas and there is not evidence of local transmission. Total
cases detected in this outbreak from week 31, 1999 to week 1, 2000, were
359. A 76.6% of them were construction workers, 6.5% employees and 16.9%
were residents of the area. A 40.0% were Dominicans and 60.0% were
migrants. A 96.0% were males and 93.0% were adults. No dead were reported.
All cases were _Plasmodium falciparum_ and no evidence of resistance to 4
and 8 aminoquinolines was detected. [The vector was _Aedes albimanus_ and
no evidence of resistance to malathion, phenitrotion and _Bacillus
thuringiensis_ (biolarvicide) were detected.
It is relevant to note that the risk for travelers was very low. More than
1.5 million of tourists were lodged in Bavaro and surrounding areas in
1999, and only about 24 cases in travelers were reported by formal or
informal means.
Considering the current epidemiological situation in Bavaro and other
localities of El Salado in province of La Altagracia, national authorities
of health have delivered a new updating of recommendations for travelers to
this area. According to this updated report there are no technical reasons
for travelers coming to Bavaro to be recommended to use chemoprophylaxis of
malaria. It is now a voluntary choice. Recommendations for travelers to
this area are now similar to traditional WHO recommendations for travelers
to Dominican Republic countrywide, that is to use chemoprophylaxis only if
traveling to rural areas, especially near to the border of Haiti.
National authorities are also recommending to travelers to ask for medical
care if having fever [while in [the Dominican Republic or in the next 15
days after leaving the country. They are also recommended to use insect
repellent in the skin if traveling to rural areas out of hotel facilities,
especially in the night.
A total of 3390 cases of malaria were reported countrywide in Dominican
Republic in 1999. A total of 453 442 blood smears were processed for active
and passive surveillance. A 48.3% of them were Dominicans and 51.3% were
migrants from Haiti and 0.4% from other countries. All cases were
_Plasmodium falciparum_ and no resistance to 4 and 8 aminoquinolines has
been detected.
