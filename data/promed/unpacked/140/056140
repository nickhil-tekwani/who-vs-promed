9-month period of 1999. "Public Health and Environment" Bulletin, Issue
#11, November 1999, p.29

In Russia 80% of all food poisoning cases are due to botulism. In 1998, 374
outbreaks of botulism were registered; 501 people were sick and 41 died.
In the period January-September 1999, 168 outbreaks were registered, 242
people were sick, including 23 children; 21 died, including 1 child under 1
year old.
In 1999, 169 infected people were in urban and 72 in rural areas. People of
30-50 years old were most affected. The majority of botulism cases are the
result of eating fish (34%), mushrooms (33,8%) and canned vegetables
(25,8%). In lab investigations the type of botulinum toxin isolated from
mushrooms and meat is most often type B, from fish type E, and from
vegetables type A.
