Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) announced that 3 imported
cases of chikungunya [virus infection] had been confirmed this year
[2010]. The age of the cases ranged from 5-27 years; 2 were male.
Their disease onsets were between 2 and 22 Feb [2010]. All cases were
found through fever screen when they landed at the airport. The cases
came from Jakarta, Sumatra, and Surabaya, Indonesia. During the same
period in 2008 and 2009, only one case each from Indonesia and
Malaysia were reported.

Since chikungunya [disease] became a category 2 notifiable disease on
15 Oct 2007, by the end of 2009, a total of 20 cases were confirmed.
All were imported. Of these, 18 were found through fever screening,
one found through routine testing by the TCDC reference laboratory,
and one was reported by a hospital. The majority of the cases came
from Indonesia (9 cases) and Malaysia (5 cases).

[Since Taiwan has _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, competent vectors of
chikungunya virus, these importations are of concern. Taiwan has
experienced dengue virus transmission, so local transmission of
chikungunya virus is a real possibility if incoming travelers
infected with chikungunya virus are viremic on arrival. This is yet
another example of the risk of introduction of an exotic pathogen
through rapid commercial air travel.
