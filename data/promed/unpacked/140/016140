Epidemiological analysis of mosquito-borne Pogosta disease in Finland, 2009
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Rapid communications: Sane J, Guedes S, Kurkela S, et al]

[A summary of the full article follows. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
Pogosta disease is a viral disease caused by a mosquito-borne
alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), and large human outbreaks of SINV
infection have emerged in Finland every 7 years. After a major
outbreak in 2002 an epidemic was expected to take place in 2009. Data
from the National Infectious Disease Registry showed a small outbreak
in humans in 2009 with a total of 105 reported cases but the 7-year
cycle did not recur as anticipated.

Introduction
------------
Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus (of the family
Togaviridae), present in Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania. Antibodies to
SINV are detected in humans in various geographical areas but clinical
infections caused by SINV are reported mostly from Finland where SINV
is associated with fever, rash, and arthritis, known as Pogosta
disease. The treatment is symptomatic. Clinically similar diseases are
found in Sweden (Ockelbo disease) and in Russia (Karelian fever). The
majority of clinical cases occur in Finland during August and
September when the primary vectors, the ornitophilic late summer
mosquito species _Culex_ and _Culiseta_, are abundant. The incidence
of Pogosta disease has been highest in the eastern parts of Finland in
recent decades.

Remarkably, outbreaks of Pogosta disease have thus far emerged every 7
years since the 1st outbreak was noted in 1974, and the cause for this
phenomenon is yet to be discovered. Tetraonid birds such as grouse,
might contribute to this pattern. Grouse have previously shown
population cycles with population "crashes" coinciding with SINV
outbreaks. Antibodies to SINV have been detected in grouse and
migratory birds.

The last major epidemic in Finland took place in 2002 with almost 600
reported cases and it was anticipated that an outbreak would occur
again in 2009.

Discussion
----------
A major Pogosta disease outbreak has occurred every 7 years in Finland
since 1974, with hundreds or even thousands of patients. Following
this pattern, another outbreak was expected for 2009. However, the
number of cases was substantially lower than in previous epidemics in
1995 and 2002 when 1301 and 597 cases were reported respectively. The
105 cases reported in 2009 exceed the average number of cases (n=57)
in the non-epidemic years during 1995-2009. However, in some
intermediate years, 1997-1998, 2000, and 2003, the number of cases
exceeded the number reported in 2009. In comparison, 5 SINV infections
were reported in Sweden in 2009 (Sirkka Vene, personal communication,
1 Dec 2009).

[In the ProMED-mail post of 22 Sep 2005 (archive no. 19950922.0870),
in addressing these "Sindbis-like" viruses, Dr Charles Calisher
pointed out that Karelian fever, Ockelbo, and Pogosta viruses are
sufficiently different to give them different names, and that the
diseases that they produce are more severe than that caused by
prototype Sindbis virus.
