Rhino project may be reviewed
-----------------------
Deputy Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Zainal
Dahalan said today the ministry expected to get a full report next
week on the deaths of 5 rhinoceroses at the centre. In a report in
the NST today, a source said laboratory results revealed that the 5
rhinoceroses died of colisepticaemia, a disease caused by a
pathogenic strain of _Escherichia coli_ or _E. coli_.
"The ministry will get experts from the Wildlife (and National Parks)
Department to discuss the future of the rhino breeding programme
should we decide to get more rhinoceroses from Sumatra later," Zainal
said.
On whether the centre would be closed permanently, he said this would
be decided only after the ministry received all the facts. He also
said they may consider options such as breeding other animals at the
centre or relocating the rhino breeding programme.
Asked if the Government would call in experts from the Cincinnati Zoo
in the United States who have been helping the Malaysian Rhino
Foundation in managing the centre for the Wildlife Department, he
said: "If the need arises." He said the centre had been trying to
breed a rhinoceros in captivity for the past 16 years.
Meanwhile, the ministry's Conservation and Environmental Management
Division deputy director, Goh Siok Eng, said policymakers should look
at the bigger picture. "We should ask ourselves whether the breeding
programme really helps," she said.
Only one other Sumatran rhinoceros has been born in captivity since a
1889 birth in Kolkatta, India. It was at the Cincinnati Zoo in 2001,
and the mother is pregnant again.
