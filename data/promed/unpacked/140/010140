After flood hit, the farmers of Bongaigaon district [Assam] are facing a new disaster. This time an unknown disease of rice plants has destroyed a huge amount of rice fields. A farmer said that since last few days they have faced this new disease of rice plants. "The new leaves get affected and turn into reddish colour. After the newborn leaves, the whole plant dies."

The villagers claimed that the district agricultural department has been silent in this regard. "Agriculture department should find out a solution for this disease immediately before our rice fields are completely destroyed," another farmer added.

[A range of pathogens including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Reddening of leaves followed by death of the plant, as described above, may also be due to environmental factors. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
