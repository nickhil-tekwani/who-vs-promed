Goat pox has killing at least 102 serows or wild goat-antelopes in Mizoram state from May 2015 till August 2016, revealed records of the state environment, forests and climate change department.

A source in the department said goat pox, caused by Capripoxvirus, hit Mizoram early last year [2015]: the 1st death was reported in May 2015.

All 9 territorial forest divisions and 4 national parks, including Dampa Tiger Reserve in the Mizoram-Tripura-Bangladesh border areas, are under its grip.

Aizawl [Mizoram] forest division is the worst hit with 25 serow deaths, followed by Lunglei division reporting 19 deaths. Kawrthah and Khawzawl forest divisions reported only one death each.

Goat pox is the cause behind the deaths. Serow is Mizoram's state animal and is a schedule-1 protected species under India's Wildlife Protection Act.

Veterinary experts have warned that serows in Mizoram are under the threat of extinction and the disease is zoonotic in nature, which means it can be transmitted to humans as well.

The capripoxvirus can be found in potential hosts such as goats, sheep, and cows. Although climactic and geographical conditions of India are suitable for the rapid spreading of the virus, there have been no recorded cases of goat pox outbreak in Mizoram earlier.

Forest officials had initially suspected that the deaths were due to sarcoptic mange, a skin disease caused by a particular kind of mite. Further investigations revealed that a large number of serows had been found dead or too weak.

[The Himalayan serow (_Capricornis thar_) is a solitary mammal in the sub-family Caprinae, family Bovidae. Serows are herbivores, feeding on grasses, shoots and leaves. In India, their habitat stretches from Indian Kashmir in the foothills of the Himalayas to Assam in Western India. This species is classified as "near threatened" by IUCN [International Union for Conservation of Nature]. For a picture of a Himalayan serow go to http://www.indianaturewatch.net/images/album/photo/16601404114f42354a2ebb6.jpg.

Capripox virus causes sheep pox, or lumpy skin disease in cattle, a malignant cutaneous disease. Capripox virus infections in sheep, goats and cattle (all in the Bovidae family) cause major economic losses. - Mod.PMB
