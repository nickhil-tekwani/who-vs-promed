Vaccination against lumpy skin disease in North Bulgaria will begin next week. Total of 350 000 doses of vaccine will be delivered and the amount will be used to cover the whole herds of cattle in the country. Vaccinated animals will acquire immunity within 28 days after vaccination.

This was announced by the press office of the Bulgarian Agency for Food Safety. Animals in south Bulgaria have already been vaccinated. The Bulgarian Agency for Food Safety [BFSA] urged farmers to comply with the measures taken and with the restrictions. Free movement of cattle across the country is forbidden. The aim is to prevent the spread of infection.

Lumpy skin disease is not dangerous to humans, but causes serious economic losses and has lethal consequences for cattle.

[According to earlier information (see commentary in 20160609.4273545 - item 1), the BFSA obtained the additional 350 000 doses of the lumpy skin disease [LSD] vaccine from the Onderstepoort Biological Products, South Africa.

This refers to a freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) vaccine. The producers' information and instructions are available at

It will be interesting to note if a similar general vaccination policy will be applied in other LSD-infected EU-member countries. The issue has been discussed during the recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCPAFF), Section Animal Health & Welfare, held in Brussels from 1 to 2 Jun 2016.(posting 20160609.4273545, commentary). - Mod.AS
