Measles was considered to have been eradicated long ago. But the
number of cases is increasing again, and infection is widespread in
Berlin. Since the beginning of April 2011, 52 cases have been
diagnosed.

A general [campaign of] vaccination is not being undertaken. However,
the Robert Koch Institute strongly recommends implementation of an
enhanced vaccination program. This should include vaccinations against
whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox and meningococcal
disease. Adults who have lived through these diseases in childhood
should have immunity against the most common bacterial and viral
diseases, but infants and young people require protection by
vaccination.

The Health Department is investigating a possible outbreak of measles
in the Caudal area [Asturias, Spain]. A teenager was diagnosed
yesterday [17 May 2011], and today there will be an investigation to
see whether this is related to 2 others. None had been vaccinated.

The Caudal health area has now identified 4 cases in Asturias in
recent days. The last previous case of indigenous measles in the
principality dates back to 1999, and the last outbreak was in 1990.
The 4th case was found in the area of Gijon. This case is a foreign
citizen aged 41 years, and it is possible the disease was contracted
outside of Spain, but it may have been contracted in the capital of
the Costa Verde during Holy Week.

All 4 affected are out of danger. None of them had been vaccinated
against measles, because their parents did not approve of
vaccination.

The Head of the Public Health Agency says that the situation should
not cause alarm, since the protective efficacy of the vaccine is high,
and it is considered that the percentage of un-immunised people in
Asturias is very low. "However, the minority always creates risks,"
said Amelia Gonzalez.

By some estimates, the rate of vaccination against the disease in
Asturias is 99 percent, much higher coverage than the 82 percent in
Switzerland in the 1990s, the 90 percent in Britain between 1999 and
2006, or the 70 percent in Germany in infants born between 1996 and
2003.

Only one of 4 new cases of measles diagnosed these days is identified
by the Ministry of Health as "imported." The remaining 3 cases have
been labeled as "indigenous."

The last indigenous case was diagnosed in Asturias in 1999, and the
previous last outbreak in 1990 accounted for 1721 cases. However, a
case was detected in the principality in 2006: that of a girl from
Romania at a time when a major outbreak of the disease was occurring
in that country. In the principality, the latest death from infection
occurred in 1985.

Health authorities in the region note that "there are already many
pediatricians who have never seen a child with measles." This lack of
experience leads to a certain amount of "false positives," since to
some doctors, rash (red spots) signifies the presence of measles, but
the reality is different.

Since December 2010, 445 cases of measles have been reported in 19
cantons, including 113 cases recorded in March and 187 in April
[2011]. By comparison, there were 59 cases recorded during the 1st 11
months of 2010.

The most severely affected cantons are Basel (62 cases), Geneva (173)
and Vaud (93), where the epidemic has not yet been brought under
control, according to the Federal Office of Public Health. In the
Suisse Romande (French-speaking western Switzerland), measles has
mostly been imported from France, where outbreaks are rampant at the
present time. In eastern Switzerland, there has been a similar
increase in case numbers since April 2011. In Outre-Sarine [central
region], the proportion rose from 10 percent in March to 34 percent in
April 2011.

Parents are being urged to check that their children are up to date
with their vaccinations before travelling to Europe after a spate of
measles cases. In the last 2 months, there have been 3 confirmed cases
in Coventry and 9 in neighbouring Warwickshire. There are also a
further 22 suspected cases in the area.

This has prompted anyone taking children to Europe in the coming
weeks to check that they are fully immunised. Outbreaks of measles are
currently being reported in 24 European countries, including Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia,
Spain and Turkey.

Youngsters should have 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to protect them
from measles, mumps and rubella. Bronwen Spraggett, immunisation lead
for NHS Warwickshire, said: "With the levels of measles we are seeing
at the moment, there is no need to panic, but we are keen to ensure
that children and young people are protected from the disease."

http://allafrica.com/stories/201105180615.html


More than 3000 cases of measles have been recorded in the past 3
months in 2 districts of Maniema Province, in the eastern part of the
Democratic Republic of Congo [Congo DR]. Provincial statistics seen by
IPS [Inter Press Service] for the districts of Kibombo and Kindu show
that since mid-April 2011, a measles epidemic has caused more than 15
deaths at health facilities, and 3 or 4 times as many have died at
home, in cases where families did not take stricken children to
medical centres. "The villages further upstream along the Congo River
are the worst affected by measles," says Dr Theo Katako, interim head
of the Provincial Inspectorate of the Ministry of Public Health.

"Meanwhile, the province was only able to organize a vaccination
campaign against polio, for lack of resources to take on these 2
epidemics at once. The total number dying of measles at home in April
2011 could have been more than 60 for lack of a way for these families
to bring these patients to the hospital because of the distance to
health facilities," says Germain Musombo, a member of civil society in
Maniema. "The fear is even greater because the measles vaccination
campaign, planned for last week, did not take place for reasons no one
has explained," Musombo said.

Julie Bibi Bin Kito is a small trader and mother of a 6-year-old who
died of measles last week. She told IPS it would take more than 4
hours to walk to the nearest hospital to her home. She has no access
to a car, and that hospital requires patients to pay to open a medical
file before they can receive care. Neither she nor her husband had any
money on the evening their child died.

"The question of poverty is critical throughout the province of
Maniema," says Musombo.

"A large majority of the population lives on rice and cassava leaves
grown in small gardens near the family home. There is also the fact
that the province is landlocked and doesn't benefit from commerce with
the rest of the country. The province is generally underdeveloped,
with few people enjoying access to clean drinking water and just 52
000 of the provinces' estimated population of 2 million having access
to electricity. With the population living under these conditions,
there is cause for concern," says Martin Bila Omari, who is
responsible for epidemiology at the provincial inspectorate of the
health ministry.

"The provincial authorities have outlined a plan to end the epidemic
and prevent new cases," says Bila Omari, "which will cost USD 180 000.
But there is an acute shortage of financial resources to carry it out.
The modest provincial budget will not allow for an urgent response."

[Maniema is a province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Its

The seriousness of this situation is compounded by the fact that the
funds available for vaccination have been diverted to contain an

The Ministry of Health said on Tuesday [17 May 2011] that a teenager
has been diagnosed with the 1st case of measles to be reported in the
country in 16 years. Officials said the teenager recently arrived back
in Panama from a trip to Europe, where there have been outbreaks of
the disease.

Health official Itza Mosca said the teenager has been hospitalized
and that vaccines have been distributed to students at her school. "We
are taking all measures of control and prevention," Mosca said, adding
that vaccines have also been recommended for the teenager's relatives
and friends.

Panama's last case of measles was in 1995. "This is a case of measles
that was acquired outside the country, but the incubation period
started here," Mosca said. The health official said that anyone who
experiences a high fever and rashes on the face or body should go
immediately to the nearest clinic or hospital. The government provides
vaccines for measles free of charge.

The Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health announced
on Wednesday [18 May 2011] that it has detected 2 more cases of
measles. That brings the number of cases to 3, Panama's 1st outbreak
of the disease in 16 years. Those infected had all been on a trip to
Europe that recently concluded. The victims are all teenagers. The
teenagers arrived in Panama on 12 May 2011. Health official Itza de
Mosca said that 10 other cases are suspected.

Officials have started a mass vaccination of students attending the
schools which had students on the trip. Relatives of the students are
also being vaccinated.

The Pan-American Health Organization has recommended that people who
are going to leave the country be immunized at least 15 days before
leaving.

The last cases of measles were reported in Panama in 1995, when there
were 48 cases of the disease.

2 cases of measles have been reported in Trois-Riviere by the Health
and Social Services Agency [CSSS] of Mauricie and Centre-du-Quebec.
These 2 cases are in addition to 117 others reported by the Health and
Social Services Agency of Drummondville, Arthabaska and l'Erable.

Health Agency records show that the disease continues to spread in
the area served by the Drummondville CSSS. Because measles is highly
contagious among unvaccinated people, 2 approaches have been adopted
to prevent the outbreak spreading. The 1st is to ask the school boards
and health centers to work together to increase immunization coverage
in schools. The same approach will be followed in childcare facilities
by sending reminders and making appointments at health centers.
Similarly, people are being requested to stay at home if they think
they are suffering from measles. "These 2 measures can help to contain
the outbreak, said Dr Lynda Milette of Public Health."

http://www.healthnews.com/Categories/Alerts-Updates/US-Part-of-Growing-Spread-of-Global-Measles-Outbreak


Following large outbreaks of measles in Europe as well as in a
growing number of countries around the world, cases are now appearing
across the United States. Over the past year, a dramatic increase has
been seen in the number of measles cases in such countries as France,
Germany, Belgium, Romania, and the UK, and now several American states
are reporting an increase in the number of cases as well.

Normally, only about 50 cases of measles occur within the U.S. each
year. However, since the beginning of 2011, a total of 98 cases have
been reported, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). The majority of cases reported have been caused by
unvaccinated people traveling to countries where large outbreaks
exist.

Among states in the U.S. experiencing an increase in the number of
measles cases, Florida has reported 5 cases that were linked to an
international helicopter trade show held in Orlando in April 2011,
while 3 additional cases reported in the Gainesville area were traced
to a person who had travelled to India. Also in April 2011, Utah
reported 9 cases that were linked to a traveller infected while in
Poland.

In California, although only 13 cases have been confirmed this year
2011, a higher number of cases were reported in April than in March
2011; as well, an increase in cases was noted in March over February
2011. Among the total, 4 cases required hospitalization.

Minnesota reported a total of 21 cases in February 2011 that were
traced back to a child from the Minneapolis area who fell ill after
returning home from a trip to Kenya, while in New York, an adult
traveler from out of the country sought medical attention in early May
2011 at Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola (Long Island). In
addition, 5 new cases were recently reported in Massachusetts.

Outside the U.S., the spread of measles is affecting many parts of
Asia and Africa. In 2010, large outbreaks were reported in Zimbabwe,
Zambia, South Africa, Nigeria, Malawi, Lesotho, Ethiopia, and Angola.
More than 2000 cases have also been reported in the Philippines so far
this year [2011].

In Europe, an outbreak has spread through 30 countries, with 6500
people infected thus far in 2011, but France has been hit the worst
with over 5000 confirmed cases of measles that almost equal the 5090
cases reported for the entire year of 2010. In addition, the UK has
reported a total number of 275 from January to April of this year
[2011].

Although measles once claimed the lives of approximately 500
Americans each year, the disease was declared to be virtually
eliminated in the year 2000. But those who do not get vaccinated for
the disease are resurrecting the threat to the world's population, as
about 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles
fall ill. The disease is transmitted through respiratory particles,
especially when people sneeze or cough. In addition, the virus can
survive for up to 2 hours on dry surfaces.

Once infected, symptoms will begin to appear in about one to 2 weeks
and include high fever, a cough, runny nose and watery eyes. In the
mouth, white spots with a blue center will appear, followed in 3 to 5
days by the onset of a rash that begins on the face and works its way
down the body. An infected person can be contagious for up to 4 days
before and 4 days after onset of the rash.

Measles can affect anyone at any age but is particularly dangerous in
very young children and young adults, and while about one in 15 people
suffer complications, as many as 3 in 1000 may die of it in developed
countries. Complications can include ear infections, deafness, severe
diarrhea, pneumonia, corneal ulcerations that can lead to corneal
scarring, acute encephalitis, brain damage and death.

There is no cure or even treatment for measles. The disease simply
has to run its course, although doctors can help to treat
complications resulting from measles. However, just 2 doses of the MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine can protect against the disease
and save countless lives.

The U.S. normally experiences only about 50 cases of measles in a
year, thanks to modern vaccines and health care improvements. But in
2011, nearly 100 cases have been reported thus far. Most outbreaks are
attributed to people traveling from other countries. According to a
recent AP [Associated Press] report, there have been several outbreaks
spanning the U.S. from east to west this year [2011].

In Florida, 5 cases were linked to an international helicopter trade
show held in Orlando last month [April 2011], and another 3 cases in
an outbreak in the Gainesville area were traced to a traveller who had
been to India.

9 cases in Utah reported last month [April 2011] were linked to
someone reportedly infected in Poland.

21 cases in Minnesota 1st reported in February 2011 were traced to a
Minneapolis-area child who developed symptoms after returning from a
trip to Kenya.

6 cases in Pennsylvania were 1st reported in January 2011 with origin
unknown.

The most recent state to report an outbreak is California, reporting
13 measles cases thus far, 7 reported in April 2011 alone; 4 patients
have been hospitalized, reports the L.A. Times.

San Luis Obispo County Public Health officials confirmed a case of
measles in a San Luis Obispo county resident who had recently returned
from France. Officials say this is the 1st case of measles in the
county in about 20 years and that there have only been 13 cases of the
virus in California this year [2011]. On the flip side, health
officials say measles has been seen in epidemic levels in France over
the past 2 years.

Public health officials say the local patient returned to the county
in a private car and had not visited any local businesses or public
places, other than a local hospital.

Symptoms of measles include a blotchy, pink or red rash. Patients
with measles can also have a fever, cough, runny nose, red or swollen
watery eyes and white spots in the mouth. Public health officials say,
generally, anyone born before 1957 is immune to measles. Those born
after 1957 and who have received 2 doses of the measles vaccine are
also considered immune.

Health authorities on Saturday [21 May 2011] said passengers on a
recent airline flight into San Diego may have been exposed to measles.
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency said one person
on the 17 May 2011 trip, Continental Airlines flight 1689, was
hospitalized with an illness confirmed on Friday [20 May 2011] to be
measles.

Officials are contacting passengers with local addresses to warn them
of the exposure and find out whether they have been vaccinated. Those
from outside the region are also being tracked down.

"Measles is highly contagious and is easily spread by coughing,
sneezing or coming in close contact with an infected person," Eric
McDonald, a county deputy public health officer, said in a prepared
statement. "Anyone on the flight should watch for symptoms and contact
their healthcare provider if they show any signs of the disease."
Those concerned about exposure can contact county officials at (858)

New York state health officials confirm a Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute [RPI] student in Troy has measles and may have exposed the
public to the disease. Measles, a highly contagious disease, is spread
by contact with nasal or throat secretions -- like coughing or
sneezing -- of infected people. Germs can stay in the air for 2 hours,
the New York State Department of Health said.

State and local health departments are advising people who may have
been exposed and who have symptoms consistent with measles to call
their healthcare providers or a local emergency room before going for
care to help prevent others in a healthcare setting from being exposed
to the disease.

RPI officials say 10 students have not been immunized for measles,
including the student who currently has measles. Preventive treatment
for measles must be given within 6 days of the exposure to be
effective.

Measles exposure may have occurred at the RPI campus from 8-16 May
2011; a health food store and drug store on 12 May 2011; Troy's
Samaritan Hospital emergency room on 12-13 May 2011, and Albany

The Salt Lake Valley Health Department (SLVHD) in Utah says the
recent measles outbreak has ended, with a total of 9 confirmed cases
that cost approximately USD 130 000. Health officials say the county's
more than 97 percent measles vaccination rate for students in grades
K-12 helped curtail the spread of the disease, but they point out that
17 300 students, along with infants and individuals with compromised
immune systems, remain unvaccinated. The department says 7 confirmed
cases were tied to 2 schools where 22.7 percent of unvaccinated
students became sick, compared to 0.1 percent of vaccinated students.
SLVHD medical officer Dr. Dagmar Vitek emphasizes the importance of
both children and adults ensuring that their vaccination status is
up-to-date, especially as measles and other vaccine-preventable
diseases continue to circulate. He says vaccination enables
individuals to protect themselves as well as those who cannot be
vaccinated.
