From: Hunter, Paul <PHUNTER@nw.phls.nhs.uk>

With regard to the above ProMED-mail listing, I would like to correct one
inaccuracy. We have NOT advised people to boil water throughout the region.
In a recent smaller outbreak in Clitheroe, Lancashire, UK earlier this year
we advised some 15 000 people to boil water. This was because we had
evidence of continuing presence of high counts of oocysts in water, even
after re-zoning.
Indeed, in the UK, at present we are reconsidering the value of boil water
advice. Many people ignore them and they can have negative public health
consequences such as causing stress and increasing risks of scalds.
