[In 2012 Cambodia reported to the OIE only one case of HPAI, and in 2013 the country reported 7 cases. The number of cases of HPAI in poultry is likely to be under-reported given the number of human cases reported and the large number of poultry (primarily backyard poultry) that are raised in the country (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation).

In Cambodia there is no compensation for the destruction of affected poultry. There is much debate on whether compensation would help with any efforts to control the disease. See http://www.cambodiadaily.com/archives/compensation-for-culled-poultry-is-a-catch-22-52485/.
However, compensation should be considered as a tool that could help with control efforts. Effective educational outreach campaigns, basic biosecurity, and compensation are all good tools which together will help control this disease. - Mod.CRD
