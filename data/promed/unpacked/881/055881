Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 1 Dec 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 27 Jan 2015
Report date: 30 Jan 2015
Date event resolved: 27 Jan 2015
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1955
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical disease
Causal agent: _Burkholderia mallei_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1(15-408-00002): Bippen, Osnabruck, Niedersachsen [Lower Saxony]
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Dec 2014
Outbreak status: Resolved (27 Jan 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 31 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: The affected horse was born in May 2008 and kept in the holding concerned since November 2014. On 26 Nov 2014 a blood sample has been taken for export purposes to a 3rd country with respect to glanders. The horse showed no clinical signs and has been kept separately from other horses during the pre-export quarantine. The complement fixation test showed a positive result (Land laboratory); the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) (National Reference Laboratory for Glanders) confirmed the result and revealed also a positive result with the immunoblot method. A 2nd blood sample was taken and the results of this investigation confirmed the 1st results. As there was no epidemiological evidence for the infection, the affected horse has been culled for diagnostic purposes on 13 Dec 2014. The bacteriological investigations of the organs showed negative results for _Burkholderia mallei_. The investigation of skin samples with immunohistological methods showed doubtful results. Further investigation of scabs of skin samples (fixed in formalin) with PCR showed positive results. The infection with _Burkholderia mallei_ was confirmed on 27 Jan 2015.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 3.23 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 3.23 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The affected holding has been put immediately under restriction following the 1st serological positive test (1 Dec 2014). All other equines of the affected holding have been investigated 3 times every 2 weeks with negative results. The affected equine has been culled for diagnostic purposes. Cleansing and disinfection of the affected holding has been carried out and finished on 27 Jan 2015. The infection with _B. mallei_ has been resolved from 27 Jan 2015. Epidemiological investigations have started with the help of Friedrich-Loeffler Institute. It is known that the affected animal had never been moved outside of Germany. There might have been indirect contacts to South America. The source of infection is still unknown.

Control measures
Measures applied: Screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Equidae / western blot / 10 Dec 2014 / Positive
Equidae / complement fixation test (CFT) / 10 Dec 2014 / Positive
Equidae / real-time PCR / 23 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Glanders is a bacterial disease of perissodactyls or odd-toed ungulates. It has zoonotic potential and has been known since ancient times. It is caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. It is a serious contagious disease in equids, and outbreaks may also occur in felids living in the wild or in zoological gardens. Susceptibility to glanders has been proved in camels, bears, wolves and dogs. Carnivores may become infected by eating infected meat, but cattle and pigs are resistant. Small ruminants may be infected if kept in close contact with glanderous horses.

Glanders generally takes an acute form in donkeys and mules with high fever and respiratory signs (swollen nostrils, dyspnoea, and pneumonia), and death occurs within a few days. In horses, glanders generally takes a more chronic course, and horses may survive for several years. Chronic and subclinical 'occult' cases are dangerous sources of infection due to the permanent or intermittent shedding of bacteria.

In horses, inflammatory pustules and ulcers develop in the nasal conchae and nasal septae, which give rise to a sticky yellow discharge, accompanied by enlarged firm submaxillary lymph nodes. Stellate scarring follows upon healing of the ulcers. The formation of reddish nodular abscesses with a central grey necrotic zone in the lungs is accompanied by progressive debility, febrile episodes, coughing and dyspnoea. Diarrhoea and polyuria can also occur. In the skin form ('farcy'), the lymphatics are enlarged and 0.5-2.5 cm sized nodular abscesses ('buds') develop, which ulcerate and discharge yellow oily pus. Dry ulcers may also develop. Pyogranulomatous nodules are sometimes found in the liver and spleen. Discharges from the respiratory tract and skin are infective, and transmission between animals, which is facilitated by close contact, inhalation, ingestion of contaminated material (e.g., from infected feed and water troughs), or by inoculation (e.g., via a harness) is common. The incubation period can range from a few days to many months.

Glanders is transmissible to humans by direct contact with diseased animals or with infected/contaminated material. In the untreated acute disease, the mortality rate can reach 95 percent within 3 weeks. However, survival is possible if the infected person is treated early and aggressively with multiple systemic antibiotic therapies. A chronic form with abscessation can occur. When handling suspect or known infected animals or fomites, stringent precautions must be taken to prevent self-infection or transmission of the bacterium. Laboratory samples must be securely packaged, kept cool (not frozen) and shipped, as outlined in Chapter 1.1.2 "Transport of specimens of animal origin" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/1.01.02_TRANSPORT%20.pdf. All manipulations with potentially infected/contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis (see Chapter 1.1.3 "Biosafety and biosecurity in the veterinary microbiology laboratory and animal facilities" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/1.01.03_BIOSAFETY.pdf).

Glanders has been eradicated from many countries by statutory testing, culling of infected animals, and import restrictions. It persists in numerous Asian, African and South American countries and can be considered a reemerging disease. Glanders can be introduced into glanders-free areas by pet or racing equids.
