[It should not be unexpected that bluetongue (BT) has now been reported in Macedonia. In 2014, the disease has been reported in Greece and Bulgaria (see ProMED reports 20140726.2637334 and 20140716.2614894).

This outbreak is located close to the border with Bulgaria. Although the serotype was not identified, given the occurrence of serotype 4 in the area, this outbreak is likely to be associated with this serotype.
