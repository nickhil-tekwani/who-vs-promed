[Bulgaria has reported 233 new outbreaks in a follow-up report dated 8 Sep 2014; see, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15933.

The disease continues its massive spread in Romania, approaching the border with Moldova (northeast; see map at the source URL). The accumulated statistics since the reported start of the epizootic in Romania on 14 Aug 2014 (4 weeks ago) are the following:

Outbreak summary, Romania: Total outbreaks = 229 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1512 / 236 / 5 / 0 / 1
Sheep / 14 561 / 273 / 19 / 0 / 0
Goats / 363 / 6 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats / 4946 / 66 / 0 / 0 / 1

In Romania, the cattle morbidity on affected holdings (15.6 percent) is significantly higher than in sheep (1.9 percent). This, in difference with the situation in other affected countries in the region (Greece, Bulgaria, FYR Macedonia, Serbia and the European part of Turkey), where morbidity in sheep is much higher than in cattle (statistics in the commentary of 20140903.2743608). This is rather puzzling in view of the apparent similarity of the causative agent (BTV-4). Explanation for the exceptionally high morbidity rate in Romanian cattle is yet to be found.

An updated map showing all BTV-4 outbreaks in southeast Europe during 2014 is available at http://tinyurl.com/o9hon45 (click on the Balkan cluster; zoom in).

In the absence of vaccination, losses -- primarily in sheep -- must be heavy. Turkey is the only country which has applied vaccination, in the affected region, in response to the recent BTV-4 outbreak. - Mod.AS
