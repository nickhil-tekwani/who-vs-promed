Avian influenza situation in Egypt - WHO Update 49
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has announced 4 new confirmed cases
of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus.

The 1st case is a one-year-old male from Behaira Governorate. He
developed symptoms on 14 Feb 2011 and was hospitalized on 16 Feb 2011.
He recovered and was discharged on 22 Feb 2011.

The 2nd case is a 3-year-old female from Behaira Governorate. She
developed symptoms on 10 Mar 2011 and was hospitalized on 12 Mar 2011.
She recovered and was discharged on 18 Mar 2011. The previous 2 cases
are from the same district but different villages, and they are not
relatives.

The 3rd case is a 34-year-old female from Alexandria Governorate. She
developed symptoms on 9 Mar 2011 and was hospitalized on 15 Mar 2011.
She is still under treatment in a stable condition.

She developed symptoms on 7 Mar 2011 and was hospitalized on 15 Mar
2011. She recovered and was discharged on 27 Mar 2011.

Investigations into the source of infection indicate that all cases
had exposure to sick and/or dead poultry suspected to have avian
influenza.

The cases were confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network. Of the 137 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 45
have been fatal.
