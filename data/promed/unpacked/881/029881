WEST NILE VIRUS SURVEILLANCE: INTERACTIVE MAPS
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 1 Aug 2000
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

Tha National Atlas of the United States & CDC have combined to produce a
set of interactive maps, with detail down to county level, to be updated
weekly, showing WNV activity: <http://www.nationalatlas.gov/virusmap.html>
You may select among:
Surveillance Area
Human Cases
Veterinary Cases
Wild Bird Cases
Sentinel Flock Surveillance
Mosquito Surveillance
There is a useful city/town locator. Note that the no. of cases is shown in
the center of each county -- the actual localities where positive birds or
mosquitoes were collected are not shown.
The site was last updated 28 July 2000. Tonight, 1 Aug 2000, information is
current as of 27 July.
This is a very welcome addition to the online information system on WNV,
which will aid in tracking the spread of the epizootic.
