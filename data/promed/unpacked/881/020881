Wheat farmers in Lalmonirhat [district] are grappling with an outbreak of blast and rust fungi as the fungicides applied in their fields have turned out ineffective. The Department of Agriculture Extension said that the use of sub-standard seeds and comparatively high temperature during the milky stage were responsible for the outbreak. The outbreak of rust fungi is severer than that of blast fungi.

Farmers said that the leaves of wheat plants with blast disease had turned yellow. The rust disease shows the same symptoms. They also said that when they entered a wheat field under the attack of rust fungi, their cloths turned reddish. Other farmers said that all of their plots were infested with either blast or rust fungi; some said that the leaves of the wheat plants at the bottom turned yellow as though the crop had matured for harvesting.

[Wheat blast
------------
Both wheat and rice blast are caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a genetically distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice. Over 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related fungal strains, each of which generally appears to affect only a limited number of host species. Further work is needed regarding genotypic differentiation related to host range, including differences between the wheat and rice pathovars. Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide. Wheat blast is now considered an emerging disease and a threat to global food security.

Blast symptoms on wheat (and barley) may be confused with fusarium head blight (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) and include bleaching of ears, shriveled kernels, and no seed production at all for severe infections. Yield losses seem to average 40-50%, but cases of 100% losses have also been reported. Wheat production in some affected areas has ceased.

Humid and warm conditions favour disease development, but the life cycle of the fungus is still unknown. Spread of the rice pathogen occurs with infected plant material (including seed), mechanical means (including human and insect activity), water, and wind. It is likely that the wheat pathogen is spread in similar ways. Disease management of rice blast may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. Available wheat cultivars lack resistance to wheat blast, and only limited tolerance can be found. Resistance breeding is difficult because the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Wheat blast was identified in 1985 in southern Brazil and spread in the region. Initially, wheat blast was thought to be caused by a fungal strain that crossed from rice to wheat, but it has now been shown to likely originate from local wild grasses. In Asia, the disease was found for the 1st time in 2016 in Bangladesh (ProMED-mail post 20160411.4150953) and subsequently reported in India (ProMED-mail post 20170306.4883233). Wheat blast strains in Bangladesh were found to be highly similar to strains from Brazil (ProMED-mail post 20160502.4196134 and see link below), which suggests an introduction of the fungus to Bangladesh with grain from that region.

Wheat rusts
------------
There are 3 known rusts that can affect wheat: stripe rust (also called yellow rust), caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_; stem rust (also called black rust; _P. graminis_); and leaf rust (also called brown rust; _P. recondita_). For more information on the pathogens, see previous ProMED-posts in the archives (e.g., 20170206.4820305, 20161117.4637042). Stripe rust is currently rife in the region (e.g., ProMED-post 20200318.7104946), but it is not clear which rust/rusts is/are involved in the problems reported above.
