An emergency fishing ban has been put in place on a river near Plymouth after an outbreak of disease. The Environment Agency has banned fishing for salmon on the River Dart after wild salmon were hit by ulcerative dermal necrosis (UDN).

Rod-and-line fishermen voluntarily stopped catching the species after a warning last month [July 2015] and now the 3 remaining netting operations must also stand down. The EA said reports of dead or dying fish have continued through May and June [2015].

Spokesman Paul Gainey added: "Since the end of April 2015, we have received many reports from members of the public and anglers relating to salmon and trout in the River Dart with fungal infections. The River Dart salmon rod catches in 2013 and 2014 were low with the catch in 2014 being the lowest ever recorded. Juvenile fisheries surveys from 2014 also confirm that juvenile salmon stocks were lower than in previous years. "Given the current state of the salmon stock, and the additional impact of disease this year, it is considered essential to protect any remaining salmon so that as many as possible survive to spawn."

[Ulcerative dermal necrosis (UDN) is predominantly a condition of the head skin of salmonid fish native to the waters of the British Isles. It has, however, also occurred in the Baltic, north west France and possibly elsewhere. It has never been reported in farmed fish. It was initially reported in the 19th century.

The disease largely disappeared until the mid-1960s when it 1st occurred in south west Ireland and then gradually spread to almost all rivers of the British Isles and subsequently to neighbouring areas. It had disappeared again by the mid-1970s.

Salmon (_Salmo salar_) and sea trout (_Salmo trutta_) are susceptible (for a picture of an affected sea trout, go to http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/images/localworld/ugc-images/276351/Article/images/27569447/10678633-large.jpg). The disease is characteristically found in adult wild fish as they congregate at sea prior to entering fresh water and during their upstream river migration.

The lesion is a progressive cytolytic necrosis of epidermal Malpighian cells, of the pemphigoid type which is restricted to specific sites on the head. On entry to fresh water, these rapidly ulcerate and may become infected with a number of opportunistic pathogens, principal of which is the oomycete _Saprolegnia diclina_. Once this occurs the lesion is extended by fungal activity, death being due either to secondary bacterial infection of the ulcer or, more often, circulatory failure resulting from the osmotic hemodilution induced by the large area of ulceration. The condition is primarily found in the colder months of the year and usually persists at high levels for 3 or 4 years in a river system after which it gradually disappears.

Attempts to isolate a specific viral or bacterial agent from the lesions, or from other organs, have failed, and the evidence that UDN is an infectious disease is very limited. Investigation into other more complex possible aetiologies have been equally unsuccessful.

However, the characteristic early lesion, the pemphigoid bulla, has also been induced by photosensitization and this may represent a further possibility for its investigation. Currently the disease is in a period of remission and no outbreaks had been reported for some years. It may be no coincidence that the incidence of outbreaks has appeared always to coincide with very high wild salmonid stock levels.

Recent studies suggest that the pathophysiological mechanism of UDN impact is connected with a decrease in the most important antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) and total antioxidant activity of muscles, liver, and heart (Bulletin of the Veterinary Institute in Pu≈Çawy 53: 813-818).
