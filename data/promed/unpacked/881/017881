On 21 Mar 2012, information was received about suspected cases of FMD in a bedouin flock near the "Dudaim site" [one of Israel's largest waste sites], about 7 km south of the township Rahat. The flock involved has about 200 Awassi [a local breed] ewes and 20 ewe-lambs. Most of the animals are officially ear-tagged and reportedly vaccinated. Clinical examination revealed adult ewes and ewe-lambs with typical oral and podal FMD lesions. Two lambs died.

From samples submitted to the national FMD laboratory at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, an FMD virus has been isolated, serotyped as FMDV O.

A declaration of a 10-km infected zone has been published and all other required control measures applied.

[FMD has been known for decades to have a seasonal pattern in Israel, mostly peaking in April-May. In contrast to initial FMD foci in most years, the 2012 FMD season has not started on the northern frontier, namely in "Hatzafon" (North) district, but in the south ("Hadarom" district), not far from the Gaza strip (on the west) and the West bank/Palestinian Autonomy (on the east). The location of the new disease focus is about 7 km south of the 1st one, diagnosed earlier in March 2012 in Rahat. For the location of Rahat, please go to the interactive map at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11787.

Genotyping of these 2 isolates is essential for the determination of their origin as well as for the investigation of the apparent failure of vaccination (this issue requires further clarification).

Stram et al. (reference below) have sequenced the complete viral VPI genes of representative viruses isolated during the major outbreaks in Israel from 1989 to 2007. The resulting phylogenetic analysis showed that each outbreak was initiated by introduction of a new virus lineage and not by endemic and resident viruses. The differences between the nucleotide sequences of the viruses from the various outbreaks were too big to fit a model of outbreaks caused by endemic virus. Based on this approach, it was revealed that a 2002 outbreak originated with viruses that circulated in the Arabian peninsula in 1997-1978.
