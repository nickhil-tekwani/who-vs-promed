An official responsible for prevention of parasitic and vector borne
diseases in the region has informed the news agency that there was
2.8-fold increase in the incidence of hydatid disease over the past 7
months.

He also reported that there are cases among children, and these cases
have a particularly severe course. The frequent routes of infection
are contacts with wild carnivores during hunting and consumption of
contaminated water, berries and greens in the wild.

Any organ can be affected, but the most frequent are the liver (in
43.2 percent of cases), the lungs (in 42.3 percent of cases) and the
brain (in 14.5 percent of cases).

The recommended prophylaxis is to avoid close contact with dogs, limit
garden activities, wash berries and greens properly before
consumption, and boil water.

[In background information provided in our 2007 posting (see below),
3-6 percent of the population in Kazakhstan are _Echinococcus_
seropositive. A recent purgation study from Kazakhstan found that 13
percent of dogs in the community were infected with _Echinococcus
granulosus_ and 5 percent with _E. multilocularis_. The study
concluded that there is significant transmission of _E. granulosus_ to
humans in this community, which may be may associated with poverty.
There is little evidence of _E. multilocularis_ transmission to humans
(Torgerson PR et. Al. Trop Med Int Health. 2009;14:341-8). Thus it
seems that a main transmission route to humans is exposure to eggs
from dog feces.

Lifecycles and pictures of _Echinococcus_ can be found at
