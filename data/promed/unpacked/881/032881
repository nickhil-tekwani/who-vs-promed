The Colorado Department of Agriculture's State Veterinarian's Office has been notified that another horse in Colorado has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). This is the 3rd confirmed case of EIA in Colorado horses this year [2018].

The investigation is ongoing but appears to be unrelated to the prior 2 cases of EIA in Colorado this year [2018]. After initial test results were received, confirmatory testing was completed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, in Ames, Iowa, on [Fri 2 Nov 2018].

The CDA said the horse was tested at a veterinary clinic in Weld County as part of a pre-purchase examination under the buyer's name. This horse allegedly participated in unsanctioned horse races. The investigation into the current location of the horse is ongoing.

"The current risk to the general equine population is low at this time, given that we are nearing the end of vector season in Colorado," said state veterinarian Keith Roehr, DVM. "This disease occurrence also highlights the importance of disease-prevention practices, such as not sharing needles, syringes, tack, and equipment, along with routine testing for EIA."

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA. Proof of a negative Coggins test is required for horses to cross state lines in the USA. It also is recommended that all equestrian shows, rodeos, fairs, and other equine events consider requiring a negative Coggins for entry, even if the horses haven't crossed state lines. Coggins tests are also recommended as an important component of pre-purchase exams.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease attacking horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit progressive condition loss, muscle weakness, poor stamina, fever, depression, and anemia.

There is no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with EIA dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards [183 m]) away from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

[As the article accurately pointed out, there is no treatment and no cure, and also there is presently no vaccine for this nasty disease. We need some researchers to look into this disease and provide equine owners with a prevention to this disease.

Also, as this disease is transmitted by horseflies (tabanids), hopefully some cold weather will kill these flies and other blood-meal insects. - Mod.TG
