Authorities in Peru say at least 9 people have died from food poisoning following a funeral ceremony. Health officials said [on Tue 7 Aug 2018] that another 20 people were hospitalized with stomach pains and vomiting after a wake the previous day in the Ayacucho region of south-central Peru.

Regional health director Jhon Tinco tells a local radio station that the victims reported eating a meat dish and consuming a drink of fermented corn called chicha.

Tinco says health officials continue to investigate to determine what could have led to the deaths. He says the victims were taken to a local hospital where they died.

At least nine people have died and dozens became ill after eating contaminated food at a funeral in the Peruvian Andes, authorities said on Tuesday. The food appeared to have contained organophosphates, a family of chemicals used in pesticides, Health minister Silvia Pessah said on local broadcaster RPP. Public prosecutors have taken samples of food and beverages served at the funeral for testing, the attorney general's office said in a statement.

Out of the 50 people sickened at the funeral in the village of San Jose de Ushua on Monday, nine have died and several were in a critical condition, Peru's civil defence agency Indeci said on its website. Earlier, Indeci tweeted that 10 had died, but the tweet appeared to have been removed.

Indeci said that patients were being evacuated from a rural hospital in Ayacucho, a southern Andean region that is home to indigenous Quechua-speaking farmers. Pessah said there have been two incidents of organophosphate poisoning in the same region in recent months.

[Chicha is a drink frequently made with corn, and it may be fermented or unfermented. In many countries in South America it is known to be combination of corn, pink peppercorns from the _Schinus molle_ and the fruit of the _Prosopis_ sp plant. The mesquite tree is an example of a _Prosopis_ sp, but it is not known which local species of _Prosopis_ sp may have been used.

The fermented version of chicha is known as chicha de jora starts with the same corn, but instead of boiling it, the corn is chewed up and spit and then fermented into a kind of beer.

The non-fermented version of chicha is known as chicha morada. It is made with the same corn, usually purple Peruvian corn, but it is a non-alcoholic drink and as such, there is no spit involved, but it usually includes pineapple and cinnamon.

While some forms of chicha may be made with fermented barley, like beer, there are areas in Peru where the spit version still exists. One wonders if the spit version was the source of the issue as hepatitis B could potentially be transmitted.

However, this article leads us to consider toxins as it appears to be more rapidly affecting the victims than hepatitis B might.

The meat may have been spoiled with bacteria or an endotoxin produced by the bacteria. Sodium nitrite has caused deaths when it was used as salt instead of sodium chloride (table salt).

If the meat was a fish, this could be scombroid toxicity.

Scombroid is an illness manifesting as an allergy-like illness due to the ingestion of fish containing high levels of histamine from poor temperature control in storage of the fish. Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), thought to be the most commonly reported natural marine toxin related illness globally, is caused by the ingestion of finfish containing the toxins, ciguatoxins, which are produced by dinoflagellates of the genus _Gambierdiscus_. The toxins are tasteless, colorless, odorless and heat and acid stable and are not prevented by any particular storage, preparation, or cooking methods. Typical ciguatoxic fish can be barracuda, grouper, and snapper.

CFP causes gastrointestinal symptoms that usually begin within 6-12 hours of ingestion and subsequent neurologic symptoms including numbness and tingling, muscle aches, dizziness and the characteristic cold allodynia (hot/cold reversal where touching cold surfaces produces a burning sensation). The neurological symptoms may be delayed for a day or so but cardiac symptoms and signs generally occur early including low blood pressure and slow heart rate which can lead to death. CFP is a distinct possibility here.

A good review of CFP is Friedman MA, Fernandez M, Backer LC, et al: An updated review of ciguatera fish poisoning: clinical, epidemiological, environmental, and public health management. Mar Drugs 2017; 15:72; doi:10.3390/md15030072; available at http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/15/3/72.

While this is a sad situation for all involved we look forward to knowing the cause of death in these individuals. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding these cases. - Mod.TG
