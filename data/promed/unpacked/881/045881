The deadly brain-eating amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_ has claimed yet another victim in Karachi, bringing the death toll from the fatal infection this year [2017] in the city to 6.

Health officials confirmed the death of a resident of North Karachi, who was brought to a private hospital earlier this week with symptoms of the infection. "He was brought to Liaquat National Hospital with severe headache, high grade fever, and other complications on [Mon 23 Oct 2017]," Dr Zafar Mehdi, Sindh health department's focal person on _N. fowleri_ told The News on [Fri 27 Oct 2017].

Mehdi added that [the man] was diagnosed with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), the infection caused by the pathogen, and passed away on [Wed 25 Oct 2017]. He was the 6th Karachi resident to die from the deadly bug this year. The last death of a 20-year-old resident of Dalmia from the infection was reported in August [2017].

Dubbed the "brain-eating amoeba", _N. fowleri_ lives in fresh water and enters the body if the water is ingested through the nose while performing ablution or swimming. Once inside, it attacks the cells of the brain and its lining and is almost always fatal.

Millions of Karachi residents remain most at risk from the bug since the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) has been supplying unchlorinated water in several localities of the city, according to experts.

Moreover, a recent research by infectious disease experts at Aga Khan University Hospital revealed that large colonies of _N. fowleri_ are present in the thick layers of mud accumulated in the overhead and underground tanks of the apartment buildings, homes and mosques in the city, spelling a major potential public health hazard.

Similarly, other experts have claimed that environmental pollution in Keenjhar Lake and the Hub Dam -- where most of Karachi's water comes from -- has also increased the presence of _N. fowleri_ in fresh water. But, the city's water utility has taken no steps to chlorinate the water before it is supplied, which is the most effective way of killing microorganisms.

To prevent an infection, Mehdi, the health department's focal person on _N. fowleri_, advised residents to clean their overhead and underground water tanks regularly to avoid the build-up of sediments that can harbour such bugs and that they should also add chlorine to their tanks to kill any microorganisms lurking there.

[The capacity for laboratory diagnosis of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is limited to a few institutions, thereby possibly resulting in lower number of confirmed cases, even if the infection rates are quite low, with only 0-8 cases reported annually from the United States (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100007/pdf/nihms-824416.pdf).

A review of cases reported in the United States through 2008 showed that PAM primarily occurs in previously healthy young males exposed to warm, recreational waters, predominantly in lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, in southern-tier states during the summer months (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5100007/pdf/nihms-824416.pdf). As a thermophilic organism, it has been postulated that changes in the occurrence of _N. fowleri_ and the epidemiology of PAM might be an indicator of climate change.

In Pakistan, the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi has confirmed a noticeable number of fatal cases due to PAM (approximately 20 per year) (Shakoor S, Beg MA, Mahmood SF, et al. (2011)
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis caused by _Naegleria fowleri_, Karachi, Pakistan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2011; 17(2): 258-61; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/2/10-0442_article].

When investigating the possible risk factors (typically swimming in fresh waters), ablution for cleansing (wuddu) prior to the religious ritual of prayers was identified as a key common factor. There is a need for awareness to take measures to make water safer for ritual nasal rinsing. Using sterile water boiled for at least one minute and left to cool, water filtered to remove small organisms, or water disinfected appropriately using recommended concentrations of chlorine together with careful ablution (not pushing water inside nostrils vehemently) can help minimize the risk of contracting PAM infection (http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003017). - Mod.UBA
