Vaccination
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 91 286 persons have been vaccinated [see URL for number of vaccinees in each location].

SPECIAL COMMUNICATION FROM THE MINISTER OF HEALTH
This Sun 24 Mar 2019, the Ebola outbreak in the provinces of North Kivu has exceeded the threshold of 1000 cases.

Before being a public health emergency, an Ebola epidemic is above all a human and social tragedy. Behind these numbers are several hundred Congolese families directly affected by the virus and hundreds of orphans.

To date, 629 people have died. For the 321 healed people who had the chance to overcome this painful ordeal, returning home is not always easy. Already forced to live with the legacy of the disease, these Ebola winners also face stigma within their community.

The response, led under the leadership of the Ministry of Health and in collaboration with its partners, has limited the geographical spread of the epidemic for more than 8 months. To date, the epidemic has not spread in the other provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo or in neighboring countries, although the risk remains.

The many scientific innovations included in the response strategy have greatly contributed to these results. Targeted vaccination has helped protect more than 91 000 people, including nearly 23 000 high-risk contacts who have been in direct contact with confirmed Ebola patients. Improving the quality of supportive care and the use of therapeutic compounds have increased the average survival rate in Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs) to more than 60%. Thus, more than 6 in 10 people who are admitted to CTE survive.

However, beyond medical advances, only community ownership of the Ebola response can lead to the ultimate end of the most deadly Ebola outbreak in our country's history. In all health zones where the Ebola response has been appropriate, such as Beni, Mabalako and Tchomia, transmission of the virus has been halted.

The community has a collective and individual responsibility to stop the spread of the virus and protect its members by not giving in to calls for violence, rumors and fake experts. Every member of the community has a role to play in stopping the spread of the virus.

Thus, the 1st link in the Ebola response is not at the level of health workers in health facilities but in the community. The response begins at the level of the mother who brings her sick child to the health center and accepts that a sample is taken for the laboratory. It is also based on the head of the family, who accepts that all family members are vaccinated after one of them has been infected with Ebola.

If a reluctant ill person is enough to spread the epidemic into a new health zone, it is also enough for a person committed and responsible to protect an entire family, or an entire neighborhood, against Ebola.

Since the beginning of the epidemic, the response teams have been reaching out to the community through regular community dialogues. The installation of local riposte committees led by district or village chiefs brings the citizens' action center closer together.

We invite those who have the privilege of being thought leaders to engage positively by sharing messages that support community buy-in to health measures.

Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga
Health Minister

[What is also important is that this individual response is not hidden but shared as a model. As in the Vox article on measles [ProMED-mail Measles update (20) 20190323.6382433 report [18] communicated by Nelly Hugh-Jones and also Mary Marshall] and a recent report from the DRC, when one member of a trusted group that does not believe in vaccination breaks away and is willing to communicate with their members, the message and the community response can change positively and significantly - Rapp.Mary Marshall]

[There likely are many such positive stories, which give us hope, but the negative ones nonetheless weigh heavily on us. See the Spiegel report below about Dr. Jean-Christophe Shako, the director of Ebola operations in Butembo, an epidemiologist with many years' experience. ProMED-mail Ebola update (28): Congo DR (NK,IT) cases, law, research 20190314.6366412 reported on how he turned a reluctant and angry community around to accept the vaccine and follow-up, but in the report below, he was confronted with violence in another situation. Two steps forward, one step back. - Mod.LK]

[Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell):
So indeed, the case count in the North Kivu #Ebola outbreak now stands at 1009 cases (+10 today) & 629 (+4) deaths. Most of the new cases are in the Katwa-Butembo-Vuhovi area. Sad to see another case at Beni.

2. DRC's health minister @OlyIlunga made a statement about the outbreak in today's @MinSanteRDC report. He urged the community to become more involved in stopping the spread of #Ebola.

3. @OlyIlunga also revealed that the survival rate among #Ebola patients receiving experimental drugs in the treatment centers is ca. 60%, which is substantially higher than the outbreak in general. Use of the drugs has been halted in Butembo-Katwa because of the recent violence.

4. The health minister also noted that among the 91 286 people who have been given the experimental #Ebola vaccine are nearly 23 000 people who had high risk contacts with Ebola patients.

5. One last thing: @WHO calculates weekly counts using a Monday to Sunday week, I think. If so, I think the North Kivu #Ebola outbreak just had its worst week ever at 58 cases.

WHO reaffirms commitment to Democratic Republic of the Congo as Ebola outbreak nears 1000 cases amid increased violence. WHO calls on international community to join urgent push to end outbreak.

As the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) approaches 1000 cases amid increased violence, WHO reaffirmed its commitment both to ending the outbreak and working with the government and communities to build resilient health systems.

"We use words like cases and containment to be scientific, but behind every number is a person, a family and a community that is suffering," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "This outbreak has gone on far too long. We owe it to the people of North Kivu to work with them in solidarity not only to end this outbreak as soon as possible, but to build the health systems that address the many other health threats they face on a daily basis."

Despite the challenges, most communities accept response interventions. More than 90% of those eligible for vaccination accept it and agree to post-vaccination follow-up visits. Independent analysis of vaccination data indicate that the vaccine is protecting at least 95% of those who receive it in a timely manner. More than 80% of people also accept safe and dignified burials, a key to preventing onward transmission.

"Despite the increased frequency of attacks by armed groups, WHO will stay the course and will work with communities to end this outbreak together with the Ministry of Health and partners," said Dr Tedros. "We need redoubled support from the international community, and a commitment to push together to bring this outbreak to an end."

For the next 6 months, the combined financial need for all response partners is at least USD 148 million. As of 19 Mar 2019, USD 74 million has been received.

Alert and response operation
-----------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces has recently shown an increase in the number of cases reported by week, after many weeks of overall decline (Figure 1). This rise is not unexpected and, in part, likely a result of the increased security challenges, including the recent direct attacks on treatment centers, and pockets of community mistrust, which slowed some response activities in affected areas for a few days.

Katwa, Butembo, Masereka and Mandima account for over 80% of all cases in the last 21 days. A total of 97 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 38 of the 130 health areas affected to date (Table 1, Figure 2). This week, EVD was confirmed in an infant who died in Bunia Health Zone, but whose parents are in good health. This is the 1st confirmed case from this health zone; a previous case was identified from neighbouring Rwampara Health Zone in early February 2019. While investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the infection, teams in place have rapidly implemented response activities including contact tracing, vaccination and heightened surveillance. Given the geographical spread of the epidemic and the high mobility in this region, the risk of Ebola spreading to unaffected areas or being reintroduced to previously affected areas remains high.

Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak-affected areas. There are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the ongoing challenges of insecurity caused by armed groups. Over 90% of people eligible for vaccination have accepted to do so, and over 90% of these individuals having participated in follow-up visits. Vaccination teams are continuing to follow-up on the rings where some families have not yet accepted the intervention.

Field laboratories have sustained similar testing rates as previous weeks. On average, 1300 samples are tested weekly, and more than 23 000 samples have been tested to date with a turnaround time of less than 48 hours. Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) and Transit Centres continue to operate, and the Katwa Transit Centre is being scaled up by ALIMA to increase capacity to respond to the outbreak in that area. To date, 335 patients have received 1 of the 4 investigational therapeutics under the MEURI protocol (compassionate use), and 80 patients under the RCT protocol.

In Butembo, Katwa, and Vuhovi health zones, response teams have continued to engage communities through various community dialogue platforms. Five community dialogue platforms have been organised in 3 health areas in Katwa, one health area in Butembo and one health area in Vuhovi. This initiative allows community members to participate and lead in decisions regarding Ebola response interventions in their localities. In other EVD-affected areas, ongoing activities include systematic collection of community feedback and responding to community concerns through adjustments of activities in consultation with community leaders and influencers. Community outreach activities are carried out in faith-based settings, market places, and schools with the collaboration of faith-based leaders and civil society groups (including women and youth). Civil society groups and community health volunteers also assist in the door-to-door community outreach activities on a regular basis.

- Tue 19 Mar 2019. Ebola DR Congo 8 more infected. 4 are in Masereka, site of family cluster
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/eight-more-sickened-drcs-ebola-outbreak

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

An uptick in the rate of newly confirmed Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo's outbreak continued today [19 Mar 2019], with the country's health ministry reporting 8 illnesses in 4 locations.

In other outbreak developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office in a weekly report today [19 Mar 2019] noted 2 more infections in health workers, and, though Katwa is still the hot spot, 7 health zones that have reported recent cases are points of concern.

New cases, more community deaths
-----------------------------------
Of the 8 new cases the DRC health ministry reported today [19 Mar 2019], 4 are in Masereka -- the site of a recent family cluster -- and 2 are in Katwa. Also, Kayina and Mandima each have 1 new case.

Three more people died from Ebola, including 2 in community settings, one in Katwa and one in Mandima. The other fatality occurred at Butembo's Ebola treatment center. The developments increase the overall number of deaths to 606.

Concerns about 7 health zones
------------------------
In its weekly diseases and health emergencies update, the WHO's African regional office said though Katwa health zone is still the main epicenter, responsible for 44% of cases over the past 3 weeks, 7 health zones have reported new confirmed cases over the past 3 days and remain a concern. Besides Katwa they include Masereka, Vuhovi, Butembo, Kyondo, Mandima, and Kayina.

According to the report, 2 more infections have been reported in healthcare workers, bringing the total to 77, of which 26 were fatal.

In other recent developments, outbreak responders have established a unit to coordinate monitoring and analysis of lost contacts in Bunia in Ituri province.

Also, the report had more details about recent violence in Biena in North Kivu province, where health workers trying to obtain blood samples from a deceased man with suspected Ebola were attacked, prompting a police response. The WHO report says a transit center in Mambowa, where suspected patients await test results, was attacked.

In summarizing the latest trends, the WHO said the outbreak continues with moderate intensity and though the absolute numbers appear to be declining, reappearance of the virus in areas where transmission seemed to have stopped is a serious concern. It added that frequent disruptions from community resistance and loss of contacts to follow-up are driving transmission, but the result of proven and innovative health measures in many areas is promising.

"Response efforts need to continue, and funding gaps need to be filled by the global donor community," the WHO said.

Building trust is essential to combat the Ebola outbreak
------------------------
Researchers can do more to contain the escalating public-health crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A disaster is quietly unfolding in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Ebola has infected nearly 1000 people and killed more than 600. It is the 2nd-largest outbreak of the disease, and epidemiologists worry that it will continue to grow because the virus could be spreading undetected. New cases are being diagnosed late, which means that the virus has ample time to spread.

Central to this problem is a lack of trust. Many people in the hard-hit northeastern province of North Kivu are not seeking care because they don't think that those responding to the disaster will help to protect them. Responders and clinics are receiving death threats, assaults and attacks, and rumours are rife. When anthropologists conducted surveys in North Kivu between November 2018 and February 2019, many community members told them that they saw Ebola as a government scheme to marginalize people; that it was a business that profits aid workers, researchers and government officials; or that the government's health system was unable to help.

Researchers should consider the reasons for such skepticism, so that they can help to reduce it, because without trust, the tools they've developed to fight the disease will not contain this emergency.

Mistrust means that some people refuse the vaccine and that many show up at clinics too late to be saved by drugs.

Further research is crucial in the current outbreak, but members of the international research community can do more. They can help to sound the alarm, and can highlight the broader problems to colleagues, health officials and world leaders.

Researchers can also play a part in strengthening the DRC's biomedical and health institutions, helping to build communities' trust in the nation's health system. For now, many people seek help elsewhere, visiting private clinics or traditional healers, for example.

The DRC outbreak could continue for another year. In that time, the virus could spread through porous borders into fragile nations such as Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. The opportunity to act is now.

Ebola in DRC: Violence And Instability In A Hot Zone
- Thu 21 Mar 2019
[Eurasia Review Op Ed, Geopolitical Monitor, abridged, edited]
http://www.eurasiareview.com/21032019-ebola-in-drc-violence-and-instability-in-a-hot-zone-oped/
[Byline: Paolo Zucconi]


The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) could be one of the richest countries in the world, but its recent history only consists of internal conflict and poverty. Governed by the Kabila dynasty from 1997-2018 and affected by decades of civil wars and humanitarian crisis, the country is a huge source of rare minerals and raw materials. Coltan, for example, is a key material used in various high-tech industries, including aerospace. Extracted by thousands of slaves, the mineral has been illegally extracted and sold via Burundi since 1995. Over the years, many armed groups emerged to seize control of the mines, employing large-scale violence to make profits from the illicit trade.

About 13 million people today depend on foreign aid in Congo. About 4.1 million are refugees - more than in Syria. The new president, Felix Tshisekedi, won in disputed elections last year [2018] and has called for national reconciliation.

Whereas eastern Congo is no longer affected by heavy military clashes with its neighbors, in the last two years, smaller scale cross-border dynamics have intensified and armed resistance increased. There are about 100 militias fighting government forces. However, civil wars and internal conflict is not the only problem. The latest Ebola crisis is also spreading, and the worst-hit areas are already heavily affected by violence and poverty.

According to Doctors Without Borders, the Ebola epidemic in Congo is out of control. The current crisis is considered the second worst in the history of Congo and it is spreading fast for several reasons:

First of all, widespread instability and armed conflict is impacting the epidemic response. There are high risks for personnel working in the hot zone, who risk being kidnapped or killed. Doctors Without Borders had to suspend its activity in those areas because of a critical situation.

New medicines and experimental vaccines continue to arrive, but distribution is extremely difficult. Katwa, near the Uganda-border, is the most critical area. Several cases are also in Butembo and the outbreak could spread into other villages and cities, where there are not any properly equipped medical facilities nor trained personnel for containment, and where there are more migration flows to Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda.

Long-term tensions and clashes between the government and rebel groups aren't helping in the fight to contain the Ebola outbreak. The Kivu conflict is one example. Between 2004 and 2008, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) and the Hutu group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) fought over control of rare minerals and natural resources in the region. There are still clashes ongoing, which impedes effective anti-Ebola strategies from being implemented.

However, this is not the only problem. According to Joanne Liu, President of Doctors Without Borders, local police coerce people to go to Ebola treatment centers to comply with health measures against Ebola. But this is leading to further alienation among the community, and is counterproductive to controlling the epidemic. Not all the people who are being forced to move are infected. There is a communication issue. Due to coercive measures, locals do not perceive these centers as a solution, choosing instead to hide in their own communities. As a result, over 40% of fatal cases pass away in the community and not at a health clinic.

The increasing militarization of this crisis risks negative effects, especially with regards to trust, an important commodity given the DRC's sectarian conflicts. The key challenge concerns community mistrust, especially in Katwa. Community members are not proactive in reporting suspected cases and refuse to cooperate with operators in the treatment centers. A major role should be played by the government in strengthening community-based prevention policies. Local police are necessary to endorse cooperation between foreign operators and the local population, as well as to provide a local security presence to reassure locals. However, local police should not exercise discretionary power on reporting suspected cases and/or act as coercive authority. Otherwise, there's a risk of alienating the people whose cooperation is crucial in containing the outbreak.

[This article is essential reading in full to understand the underlying challenges to gaining control over Ebola in this outbreak. The deep mistrust of the health care workers is exacerbated by violence impeding control efforts. It had seemed the vaccine and 4 new therapeutics would be a game changer, but not if people who are sick avoid health care centers or come when the disease is too far advanced, and not if they cannot be distributed. Such severe social challenges impeding control need innovative approaches, social scientists, and respected community leaders to address it.

According to the WHO report above, WHO has more than 700 people in DRC and is working hard with partners to listen to the affected communities and address their concerns and give them greater ownership of the response, particularly in the current outbreak hotspots of Katwa and Butembo. - Mod.LK]

An Epidemic and Its Victims: Doctors Face 2 Enemies in Fight Against Ebola
--------------------------
The 2nd largest outbreak of Ebola in history is ravaging the Democratic Republic of Congo. But as humanitarian organizations and the Congolese government struggle to fight the virus, they find themselves thwarted by the very people they are trying to help.

Dr. Jean-Christophe Shako, the director of Ebola operations in Butembo, was dismayed. The expression on his face conveyed a mixture of anger and fatigue. Two deep wrinkles had formed on his brow. He spoke quietly. "People here just don't want to accept that this disease exists," he said. "They think that we're killing them with this vaccine, that our clinics are places of death, that the government wants to eradicate their tribe, the Nande."

In the night, around 30 men had stormed out of the bush and attacked the MSF clinic with machetes and bows and arrows. The patients were evacuated. The attackers left behind leaflets that read, "We have more surprises."

The clinic was about the size of a football pitch. Shako gazed out at the devastation from the night before. Now it was littered with singed wooden skeletons, destroyed generators and a burned-out car. Three days later, Shako received a WhatsApp message saying it was time for him to die.

Shako is one of the Democratic Republic of Congo's most respected epidemiologists. He has been fighting the Ebola virus in the province of North Kivu on behalf of the Health Ministry since 18 Aug 2018 as head of operations in Butembo, the current epicenter of the outbreak.

[Recommended reading. Even with all we have read about the violence and distrust in the DRC, this report is heartbreaking. Here is an individual who has dedicated himself to helping stop Ebola from killing community members and as if it is not enough that they don't trust him to follow his advice and receive his help, they attack him! What is the solution? The communities are apparently so traumatized they cannot recognize sincere offers of help. Dr. Shako and so many others are true heroes. - Mod.LK]

[Byline; Joan Salmon]

In Summary
Revolutionary. After failing to get funding from the government in 2013, Dr Misaki Wayengera, a researcher attached to the Department of Pathology at Makerere University's College of Health Sciences, won a USD 100 000 grant from Grand Challenges Canada to create the Pan-Filovirus Rapid Diagnostic Test, a paper-strip test used in detecting Ebola and Marburg viruses. Dr Wayengera spoke to Sunday Monitor's Joan Salmon about the journey and the fight against Ebola.

"We realised that while the tests were working well with artificial or recombinant Ebola proteins, they were not working with the live samples. It is clear to us now that this happened because targets were masked with extra protein, glycans and folding which needed to be removed before testing," says Dr Wayengera. However, with funds running out they were stuck.

"As a scientist, this is the one point when one gets frustrated to the core; failing to deliver a solution. Unlike academic research, R&D is a resource-intensive endeavour riddled with many failures, re-strategising and repletion of experiments. This is the stage when one needs an open cheque," he says.

Excerpt:
It was not until June 2018 that they got additional funds from the European Union through the European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP).

"Throughout this, we continue working with our key established partners, namely Astel Diagnostics (U) LTD and the BSL_IV Laboratory at the NICD, SA. I want to specifically thank the Office of the Sierra Leonean Ethics and Scientific Research Review Committee, Ministry of Health, for allowing us to use the samples of the patients of the EVD outbreak," he says.

Shortly after this award, the EDCTP announced another round of emergency response grants to respond to the on-going outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu, DR Congo, to which Dr Wayengera applied and in September 2018, got communication that they had been awarded the grant.

"This is supposed to help in developing a buffer to remove the protein off the virus in the blood to aid rapid diagnostic testing," he says.

The project involves researchers from 4 European countries -- Poland, Sweden, Greece, and Netherlands -- alongside South Africa, with the team in Uganda heading and coordinating its implementation.

The ball continues to roll for this scientist because in November 2018, when WHO called out for Africans with solutions through WHO Innovation Challenge, the team applied, and they were shortlisted.

"They were looking for solutions that were almost ready to go to the market, and out of the over 2400 people who applied, only 30 made it to the finals, and I am one of them," he says.

Where detector can be used:
Outbreak scenario: Initial screening for cases and triage at the point of care. The Pan-Filo-V RTD presents the ideal solution for remote equatorial village settings because it is affordable, requires minimal expertise, does not need electricity or a laboratory.

Clinical suspicion and exposure-prevention: Given that many tropical infectious disease present similarly to the early symptom of viral haemorrhagic fevers, any patient presenting with fever and unexplained bleeding should be screened. This can help prevent primary exposure by health-workers and other contacts.

Community, border and or port control: The Pan filo-V RDT is designed to increase border and port screening for persons potentially exposed to filovirus disease, as would be necessary for travellers coming from an active epidemic-zone.

Bioterror attack: Although the prospects for a bio-terror attack involving filoviruses is minimised by need for a living carrier or vector, the same is possible. Filoviruses are classified as Class A pathogens, with potential for bioterroristic weaponisation.

Vaccine B cell response studies: Given that many trail vaccines are based on a live-attenuated vector carrying the GP protein, qualitative studies of antibody responses are possible using the Pan-filo-V RDT.

Population exposure studies: Many persons within equatorial Africa (including long-staying visitors) may have unknowingly been exposed to floviruses in the past.

In order to recruit these subjects, one needs to confirm their previous exposure by presence of IgG antibody.

[This is a notable achievement to have reached this stage. It took hard work, dedication, and persistence. It is wonderful to see a Ugandan scientist taking the lead. A pan-filovirus rapid diagnostic test would be a significant improvement in the field. - Mod.LK
