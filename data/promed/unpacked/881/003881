Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Detected in Panamanian Capital
------------------------------------------------------
SAN JOSE (Costa Rica): Yesterday (2 Aug 2001) Carlos Rodriguez, the medical
director of the Metropolitan Region of Health, stated that: "The
northeastern periphery of the Panamanian capital, where some 200 000
persons live, the majority of whom are children, is threatened with an
epidemic of dengue hemorrhagic fever. We are [alarmed because in the last
24 hours we have discovered more than 200 cases of classical dengue fever
and at the same time detected the [presence of dengue virus serotype 2,
which is more [virulent than serotype 1, which is transmitted by the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_."
The Ministry of Health official stated that in the last 2 weeks there had
been an increase in classical dengue fever cases in Tocumen, a densely
populated zone to the northeastern periphery of the capital. Specimens
recovered from breeding sites in this area [had been identified as dengue
virus serotype 2, the more [virulent and dangerous [serotype.

[The report is ambiguous in that it is unclear whether dengue virus
serotype 2 alone has been detected. If 2 different serotypes of dengue
virus are circulating in the same area, the risk of the hemorrhagic form of
dengue fever is likely to be increased. Further information would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP
