The source in Pagina Siete of Mon 22 Apr 2019 apparently nowhere specifies whether we have to deal again with a condensed [concentrated or clustered] hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) outbreak or not, since major (lung) symptoms are not given.

Condensed HCPS outbreaks are much more exceptional than are "Old World" hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) outbreaks, which were often noted during military operations in open field. For instance, the 1st serologically confirmed and geographically restricted outbreak of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in Germany was noted when 16 soldiers of a 177-member USA military unit developed HFRS a few days after camping for winter NATO-manoeuvres in a vole-infested area near Ulm, S.-Germany in February 1990, whereas the local civilian population suffered no cases (Clement J, Underwood P, Ward D, Pilaski J, LeDuc J. Hantavirus outbreak during military manoeuvres in Germany. Lancet 1996; 347: 336). In fact, western medicine discovered for the 1st time hantavirus and hantavirus outbreaks amongst UN troops in open field during the Koran War 1950-53.

This report is remarkable in so far as no clear prior or "causative" military open field activities or exercises are mentioned, but rather buildings (e.g. Bolivian Condors School (ESCONBOL), and the fact that "in the camp, an epidemiological action was carried out that consists of a cleanup, fumigation, and the elimination of the long-tail mice." In contrast, the same authors state: "The disease is contracted in rural areas such as forests, fields, among others, where rodents that carry the virus can be encountered."

If it is confirmed that acute lung edema was not the predominant presenting symptom but rather unspecific flu-like symptoms followed by signs of renal involvement (elevated S. creatinine levels, proteinuria and microhematuria), then the unusual hypothesis of an HFRS outbreak in the New World becomes plausible. The sole agent of HFRS present in the New World is Seoul virus (SEOV), transmitted by wild brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), the only cosmopolitan hantavirus reservoir, present also in the New World, infected with SEOV nearly everywhere when looked for. SEOV-HFRS was only recently re-appreciated as a potential problem in the West, with the 2017 discovery of SEOV-infected pet rats in the USA. However, the clinical presentation of SEOV-HFRS can be atypical and chameleon-like, in contrast to the often dramatic HCPS clinical presentation (Clement J, LeDuc JW, McElhinney LM, Reynes JM, Van Ranst M, Calisher Ch. Clinical Characteristics of ratborne Seoul Hantavirus Disease. Emerg Inf Dis 2019; 25:387-388; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/2/18-1643_article.

Moreover, and as the ProMED-mail moderator indicated, the need to be able to differentiate SEOV as causative agent is hampered by the fact that most current commercial ELISA or WB formats do not contain (anymore) a SEOV antigen, so that a preliminary presumption of a hantavirus infection can even be missed in non-research laboratories (ibidem, and: Reynes J-M, Carli D, Bour J-B, Boudjeltia S, Dewilde A, Gerbier G, et al. Seoul virus infection in humans, France, 2014-2016. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23:973-7; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/6/16-0927_article.

[Dr. Clement is thanked for his comments.

Dr. Clement identified a major problem that these types of reports in the popular press have: a lack of clinical and often epidemiological details that are important in understanding which etiological agent is involved and how individuals acquired their infection. From the limited information published, there is no clinical description or an indication of how the soldiers might have acquired their infection. As an Army training facility, it is conceivable that both indoor instruction and outdoor field exercises took place. It would be useful to know which hantavirus is involved in these cases in Tarija department as well as other cases in that department and others. This knowledge is important for clinical management of severe cases and for knowing which rodent hosts are involved for their control (brown rat control is different from native pygmy rice rats, for example).

As Dr. Clement points out, a battery of hantavirus diagnostic agents, including SEOV antigens, is required to reach a definitive diagnosis. Ideally, every national reference diagnostic laboratory in the Americas where hantavirus infections occur should have these reagents and personnel trained in their use. Perhaps the Pan American Health Organization could coordinate such an initiative. - Mod.TY
