Strange Illness Breaks Out in Jigawa
-------------------
A strange illness has broken out in 3 villages of Gagarawa Local
Government Area of Jigawa State, leaving several children dead. The
illness usually begins as a rash and leads to severe anal bleeding,
according to health officials in the area.
After 3 women initially reported the case at the village clinic, the
illness spread to other areas, spreading fear among local parents.
The health officer in charge of the local government council, Alhaji
Abubakar Lawal Kwalarn, provided assurance of efforts to prevent
further spread of the strange illness, as health workers have been
deployed to the area and the council has provided adequate resources
to curtail the illness.
He called on the state government to assist in curtailing the spread
of the illness to other areas of the state, through the deployment of
health personnel to assist the council.

[More information on these cases would be appreciated. Using the
Global Infectious Disease Network (GIDEON) software
(), I searched for a seriously ill/fatal
infection in a child residing in Nigeria associated with hematochezia
(blood in stools) and a diffuse or multifocal rash. My search
resulted in a differential diagnosis that is led by the hemorrhagic
fevers such as Ebola, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and
yellow fever. In the absence of reports of similar illness among
adults in the same geographic areas, one does question the likelihood
of the hemorrhagic fevers as the diagnosis for this outbreak. Dengue
hemorrhagic fever is also a possibility, as dengue has been reported
in Nigeria. Rather than continue to postulate, it would be safest at
this point to state that more information on this outbreak would be
very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
