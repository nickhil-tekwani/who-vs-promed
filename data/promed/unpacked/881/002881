Britain's agriculture agency does not believe the 1st cases of West Nile Disease in horses recorded in France in 9 years signal any additional risk to British horses. However, while taking the view that the cases did not increase the risk of a UK incursion, it did caution that horse owners needed to be aware of the risk when travelling in affected areas in southern Europe, in the Mediterranean basin.

The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in a preliminary outbreak assessment published [in September 2015], that the cases of the mosquito-borne disease occurred in the Bouches du Rhone region, in the south of France. In 1 of the first cases, a 3-year-old Lusitano horse showed neurological signs and was euthanised. In another, an Anglo-Arabian mare also showed clinical signs and was similarly put down. Both occurred in August 2015. In the following days, a further 5 outbreaks were then reported. Movement restrictions and insect controls were put in place.

West Nile Virus (WNV), which causes brain inflammation, is hosted among birds, and can be passed by blood-feeding mosquitoes to mammals, including horses and humans. Defra said in its report: "Horses are dead-end hosts for WNV and therefore the trade in horses is not considered a risk of further transmission within the UK. These cases in France and other parts of southern EU in the Mediterranean basin do not increase the risk to the UK for incursion of WNV. Nevertheless, horse owners should be aware of the risk to horses travelling in these areas, the options for preventive vaccination and the clinical signs of neurological disease in horses".

The president of the British Equine Veterinary Association, Mark Bowen, said the cases in France served as a reminder of the importance of exotic disease awareness among vets. "Although the risk to the native UK horse population remains low, targeted vaccination of competition horses travelling to southern Europe should be considered".
