Central Viet Nam's province of Thanh Hoa and central highlands province of Kon Tum have reported [avian influenza] outbreaks in poultry, local media reported Tuesday [11 Feb 2014]

Viet Nam's state-run radio Voice of Vietnam (VOV) said on Tuesday [11 Feb 2014] that 186 chickens died on 8 Feb 2014 with positive test results of H5N1 bird flu from samples collected on a farm in Tinh Gia district, Viet Nam's central Thanh Hoa province.

Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of Thanh Hoa province have asked the district to cull [kill] and safely dispose of all chickens in the infected farm and neighboring families to prevent the disease from spreading.

Viet Nam's state-run news agency VNA reported Tuesday [11 Feb 2014] that another outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in chickens has been announced in the country's central highlands province of Kon Tum. About 600 chickens in Kon Tum province showed symptoms of suspected avian flu and 470 died on 8 Feb 2014. Some 130 chickens [that were] left have been culled on Tuesday [11 Feb 2014] after the official conclusion was reached that they were positive for avian influenza or H5N1 virus.

According to VNA, [a veterinarian] was reported to be hospitalized with symptoms of fever, fatigue and loss of appetite after contact with the above-mentioned outbreak in Kon Tum province. The patient was now quarantined for follow-up treatment for the suspected H5N1 bird flu, said VNA.

Earlier on 28 Jan 2014, another avian influenza outbreak was reported with nearly 1000 chickens sick and dead in Kon Tum province, according to VNA.

These outbreaks raise the alarm over the spread of H5N1 virus in Viet Nam among both local people and international communities.

In a related development, the United States Agency for International Development [USAID] announced on Tuesday [11 Feb 2014] a project worth USD 800 000 for preventing bird flu in Viet Nam. The project aims at helping reduce risks to community health caused by bird flu, epidemic and other emerging infectious diseases in Viet Nam from now till September 2015, VNA reported.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.
