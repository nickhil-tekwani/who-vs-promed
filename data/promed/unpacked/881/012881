Ituri province, in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has notified an upsurge of plague cases in the health zone of Rethy. From [11 Jun to 9 Aug 2020], a total of 73 cases with 10 deaths (CFR 13.6%) were notified in 5 out of 22 health areas of Rethy health zone.

Plague is endemic in Ituri province. Since the beginning of 2020 to date [Tue 20 Oct 2020], Ituri Province has reported a total of 124 cases and 17 deaths (CFR 18.7%) in 5 health zones, namely Aungba, Linga, Rethy, Aru, Logo and Kambala. In 2019, from week 1 to 52, a total of 48 cases of bubonic plague including 8 deaths have been reported in the country.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly rats but other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and, in China, marmots. Fleas typically serve as the vector for plague. People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation and in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person.

_Yersinia pestis_ is treatable with antimicrobials if started early enough.

There are 3 forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. - Mod.LL
