Consumers who purchased or were given "home-canned" soup or other
canned products from the Schumacher's Inn in Austin, Potter County,
should not open the jars due to the risk of botulism contamination,
Health Secretary Dr Calvin B. Johnson said today [3 Jan 2008].
The state became involved after a 43-year-old Potter County woman,
and some of the chicken soup she said she purchased from the
restaurant, tested positive for botulism.
The Department of Agriculture, which oversees food safety, has
quarantined the product and ordered the restaurant not to sell or
give away any canned product. Any soup or other products canned by
this restaurant should be submitted to the state for testing.

[No information is available regarding the diagnosis of botulism in
the affected woman, such as how the diagnosis was made and which
serotype of botulinum toxin was involved.
There are 7 toxins produced by different _C. botulinum_ types which
are immunologically distinct but produce a clinically similar and
highly recognizable syndrome by similar pharmacological mechanisms.
The molecular site of action and some clinical features, however,
differ.
All the toxins are translated as single polypeptide chains of similar
structure that are nicked by proteases. The protease nick yields a
light chain of approximately 50kD containing a catalytic subunit (a
zinc-dependent metallo-endopeptidase) responsible for the toxic
effects and a heavy chain of about 100kD that binds the target
tissue. Both clostridial proteolytic enzymes and human digestive
enzymes such as trypsin can activate the toxin.
All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the
presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine
transmission across the neuromuscular junction. Toxins types A and E
enzymatically cleave a specific presynaptic membrane-associated
protein; toxin types B, D, F, and G cleave a synaptic
vesicle-associated protein. Type C toxin cleaves both the
membrane-associated protein targeted by types A and E and an
additional protein associated with exocytosis. The effect in all
cases is neuromuscular blockade resulting in flaccid paralysis. The
toxins also affect the adrenergic system but apparently with
insignificant consequences.
Toxin type A causes most cases of foodborne and wound botulism in the
United States. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe,
with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of
patients requiring mechanical ventilation.
Potter County, Pennsylvania is located in the north central part of
the state as can be found on a map at
