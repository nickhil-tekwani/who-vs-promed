Date: 3 Nov 2001
From: Kathryn Bernard <Kathy_Bernard@hc-sc.gc.ca>

Once in a while, during this latest crisis, I sit back and reflect how many
more deaths would have occurred or very ill people be in hospital, if our
colleagues at the CDC had NOT received targeted funding from the Clinton
administration in the past 5 to 6 years and began the creation of a BT
response nationally. If CDC staff in the past 6 plus weeks were not working
around the clock processing clinical and environmental specimens or
providing factual information to the international scientific community in
nearly daily bulletins? I reflect on had the CDC NOT been able to create a
national response plan, had not trained Levels A through D staff on
procedures and duties, had not facilitated with the upgrading of state labs
which previously lacked a CL3 facility, but now have one, what would the
mortality have been in November 2001? I hope everyone will reflect on that
before possibly slinging any arrows of criticism.
