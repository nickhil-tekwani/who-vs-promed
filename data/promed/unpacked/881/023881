CDC to help with mumps outbreak
-------------------------------
More than 100 cases of mumps have been reported on the island, and new
cases are being reported daily, the Department of Public Health and Social
Services announced yesterday [Thu 22 Apr 2010]. A team from the United
States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is on the island
to assist Guam's public health agency in responding to the outbreak.

Mumps is a viral illness that can cause fever, headache, muscle aches,
tiredness and painful swelling of the salivary glands under the ears. In
some cases, the contagious disease can lead to more serious complications.

Guam normally reports one or 2 cases of mumps each year, the public health
department has said. Late last month [March 2010], the agency confirmed the
island's 5th mumps case and was monitoring 10 suspected cases. Of those 5
confirmed cases, 4 were students in Guam's public schools.

The public health department is asking residents to report any illnesses
with facial swelling to the agency. Those who are sick with this symptom
should stay home from school or work for 5 days from the start of the swelling.

[The number of cases of mumps on the island of Guam has increased to more
than a hundred from the 5 cases reported on 25 Mar 2010. Whereas the
original cases were mostly schoolchildren, the age range of the new cases
is not stated. Since Guam law requires all students entering school to
submit proof of immunization that includes 2 doses of the measles, mumps
and rubella (MMR) vaccine, it may be that the new cases are adults where
the consequences of mumps virus infection are more serious. Clarification
would be welcomed.

Guam is located in the western north Pacific Ocean, and is the largest and
southernmost island in the Mariana Islands archipelago. A map of Guam can
