Medical workers in the South Sulawesi [Sulawesi Selatan] town of Gowa
have put 11 people under special care for suspected anthrax
infection. Head of the disease prevention unit at the regional health
agency Ahmad Yaman said on Wednesday [10 Jun 2009] the Moncongleo
villagers were owners of 19 cattle that were killed by anthrax last week.

Ahmad said the people displayed symptoms of the disease, including
fever and nausea. The villagers are being treated at their respective
homes under supervision of the health agency and have received
antibiotics since Saturday [6 Jun 2009]. "Right now, their condition
is improving, but we keep monitoring them while waiting for the
results of a laboratory test on their blood samples," Ahmad said.

The local community health center has distributed antibiotics to 349
residents of the village to prevent an outbreak from occurring. The
center has now opened 24 hours a day to provide free medical care to
the local people in the wake of the anthrax infection cases.

The local husbandry agency has also required examination and
vaccination of outbound cattle to prevent the spread of anthrax to
neighboring villages.

Gowa is an anthrax-endemic region outside the provincial capital of Makassar.

[The Post has a link to a 2006 outbreak in Gowa involving 3 villages:
<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/10/10/anthrax-outbreak-spreads-gowa-cattle.html>;
see 20061011.2909 and 20061012.2919.

The 2006 news reports indicated severe veterinary infrastructure
problems in South Sulawesi. If the authorities are only vaccinating
"outward bound" animals, leaving the affected village of Moncongleo,
and not the resident stock, which were clearly susceptible to have 19
head affected, it is no wonder that Gowa is seeing repeated
outbreaks. This is a pity. If ever there was a need for annual
compulsory vaccination, it is here. - Mod MHJ]
