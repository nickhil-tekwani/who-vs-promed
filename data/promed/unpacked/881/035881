[Although most mammals are susceptible to infections with pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine seem to represent the main host reservoir. Due to increased control efforts and the strict implementation of eradication programs, which have included large-scale vaccination and using the strategy of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals, Aujesky's disease has virtually disappeared from domestic pigs in several parts of Europe.

Reports on PRV-infections of wild boar in Europe are scarce. Serosurveys revealed the occurrence of PRV infections in wild boar in at least 14 European countries, including Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the former Yugoslavia, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland, with the average seroprevalence ranging between 0.3% and 66%. - Mod.PMB]
