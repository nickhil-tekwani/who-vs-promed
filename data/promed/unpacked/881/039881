An 18-month-old baby has become the eighth child to die in a wave of dengue
fever that has swept French Polynesia since late May [2001, health
authorities said. A total of 32 000 people, about 16% of the population,
have been affected by the outbreak in the Pacific territory, they said. The
epidemic first gripped Bora Bora and then spread to other islands of the
archipelago, including Tahiti. Some 300 patients have already been treated,
including 45 who had to be hospitalized with the mosquito-borne disease.

Health officials in Bicol have expressed alarm over the increase in the
number of dengue fever cases during the past few weeks. Since January
[2001, dengue cases have already reached 698, or double last year's figure.
Statistics at the Department of Health showed that of the 698 cases, 432
were reported in Camarines Sur, the highest among the 6 Bicol provinces and
7 cities. Gerardo Bayugo, DOH regional head, said an outbreak occurred in
Sorsogon, but no death has so far been reported.
