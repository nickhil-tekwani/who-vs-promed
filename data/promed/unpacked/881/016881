A 100-mile [161 km] long bloom of red tide algae is lurking off the coast of Southwest Florida.

Scientists say the outbreak compares to the 2006 bloom that choked beachgoers and left fish belly-up on beaches for months.

Sun and surf worshipers as far north as Pinellas County and as far south as Charlotte Harbor may be feeling the airborne effects of the toxins -- watery eyes, irritated noses, and scratchy throats -- as they stroll along the shoreline.

"A lot of dead fish, a slew of them," said Barbara Dumont, manager of Flounders Restaurant and Tiki Bar on Englewood Beach, across the street from the Gulf of Mexico. "But as the tide comes in and out, it's decreasing."

"Two days ago," she said on Wednesday afternoon [10 Oct 2012], "it was bed of white. Everywhere. All dead fish in the entire canal."

The effects of the algae -- the coughing and wheezing -- aren't so bad, she said, although at least one Flounders employee with allergies is having a difficult time.

The toxins given off by the algae can be unpleasant to those nearby and often cause people to go through coughing fits but can be dangerous for people with asthma or other respiratory maladies.

Nadine Slimak, a spokeswoman for Mote Marine Laboratory, said the algae also affect animals other than fish and humans. Mote researchers monitor 25 beaches along the Gulf coast and posts online updates twice a day on the red tide presence at http://www.mote.org/beaches.

Birds that eat the fish that have succumbed to the toxins also may get sick, she said. Manatees and sea turtles, which do their breathing just inches from the water's surface, also can become ill, she said. Dogs on the beach may weather the airborne toxins, but if they eat a dead fish, they, too, may become ill.

"Generally speaking, southern Sarasota County is where people have been reporting dead fish and respiratory irritations," she said. The bloom appears to be concentrated in a huge blob west of Charlotte County.

"It's pretty much out there, stretching from Pinellas south to Lee County," she said, "but it appears to be real patchy in areas and is not one long blanket of algae."

This outbreak seems to be more intense than the most recent bothersome bloom 5 years ago, which lasted for 6 months, she said, "but is it the worst we've ever felt? That's impossible to say." The worst bloom came in 2005 and hung around for 13 months.

Red tide algae blooms offshore every year, "and if the winds and water currents are right, people don't notice it on the beaches," she said. "When red tide is a problem is when it affects humans."

The algae's toxins already are taking a toll on marine life. Jason Lenes, research associate with the University of South Florida's Center for Prediction of Red Tides, said dead fish are littering beaches from Sarasota south.

"Manasota Key is going to get the worst of it," he said, and fish kills appear to be more pronounced farther out into the Gulf. "I've seen reports of a lot of dead fish offshore," he said. "It's worse than along the coast right now."

Winds from the northeast should blow the bloom away from the coast over the next days, Lenes said, but where the algae will go after that is dependent on the winds and current.

"Right now, we have a bloom that's pretty substantial in size," he said, "with the concentration as far north as Pinellas, but mostly it's off the coast from Sarasota to Charlotte Harbor."

He compared this year's [2012] version to the 2006 bloom. The red tide in 2005 was record setting, lasting from January that year to February the following year [2006].

Red tide can make it into Tampa Bay, but that usually does not happen because of tidal flow and currents at the mouth of the Bay, he said.

Scientists are unsure about the causes of red tide, scientifically known as _Karenia brevis_. They know that blooms begin 30 to 40 miles [48-64 km] offshore as a natural occurrence. Typically, they stay there, unless winds and currents drive them toward shore.

Biologists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Research Institute also are keeping an eye on the bloom that was detected this past week. The concentrations ranged from trace to medium, with the highest concentrations found at Cabbage Key in the Pine Island Sound area of Lee County.

A 10-year study completed last year [2011] found that red tide algae contains at least 12 different toxins that can be harmful to people. It also discovered an antitoxin in red tide that currently is being used to develop a drug to fight cystic fibrosis.

[Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities, because under certain circumstances these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals, such as clams, oysters, mussels, in which the toxins bioaccumulate. _Karenia brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters, and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning.

People should avoid consuming marine animals that accumulate the toxins, such as hard-shell clams, soft-shell clams, oysters, mussels, and scallops.
