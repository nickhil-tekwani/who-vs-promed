Two Moscow region residents have been hospitalized; 12 of their relatives are on ambulant treatment after coming into contact with a rabid moose, the Life News tabloid website reported on Monday [13 Feb 2012]. A 50 year old forester and a game specialist found a moose in distress near a road in Odintsovo district, the news agency reported. They decided the animal was injured and brought it home.

The family members of the 2 men helped them carry the animal's corpse. However, no injuries were found, and the hunters sought the assistance of the local sanitary control service. After examining the animal's corpse, the service said that the moose had died as a result of rabies virus infection.

Both men were hospitalized; their relatives were vaccinated, and the corpse of the moose was burned.

Rabies is a fatal infectious disease of warm-blooded animals caused by a virus that causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. It can be prevented in humans by a vaccine.

[It is unclear from this report how the diagnosis of rabies was established. Further information is awaited concerning the condition of the 14 exposed Russians.

All mammals are susceptible to rabies. There are many strains of the rabies virus; each strain is maintained in particular reservoir host(s). Important maintenance hosts include members of the Canidae (dogs, jackals, coyotes, wolves, foxes, and raccoon dogs), Mustelidae (skunks, martens, weasels, and stoats), Viverridae (mongooses and meerkats), and Procyonidae (raccoons), and the order Chiroptera (bats). Cat-adapted rabies variants have not been seen, although cats are often infected with rabies viruses from other hosts, and they can readily transmit the virus.

The important reservoir hosts vary with the area. In North America, maintenance hosts for rabies virus include insectivorous bats, striped skunks (_Mephitis mephitis_), raccoons (_Procyon lotor_) coyotes (_Canis latrans_) and various species of foxes. Red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_), insectivorous bats, wolves, and raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) appear to be important hosts in Europe. The canine rabies variant is well controlled in the United States, Canada, and Europe, and it may no longer be circulating or circulates only at low levels in some areas.

However, this virus has apparently become established in some wildlife populations, such as gray foxes (_Urocyon cinereoargenteus_) in Texas and Arizona, and it could be re-established in dogs from these reservoirs.

Canine rabies continues to be a significant problem in areas of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Wildlife hosts may also be present. Both insectivorous and vampire bats are hosts for rabies virus in Mexico, Central, and South America. Vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) are sometimes responsible for outbreaks among cattle in South America. Rabies has also been reported in various other wildlife species, including wolves, coyotes, skunks, and foxes in Central and South America. Red foxes and golden jackals (_Canis aureus_) are often involved in wildlife rabies in the Middle East. Red and arctic foxes, raccoon dogs, mongooses, and jackals are hosts for the virus in parts of Asia. Mongooses are also important in the Caribbean. In Africa, there is evidence that the virus may be maintained in jackals, foxes, mongooses, genets, and other species (Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Publications_%26_Documentation/docs/pdf/rabies.pdf).

Moose is absent from this list, although there is at least one anecdotal record of a rabies-infected animal. There is no reason to suppose that moose would be resistant to rabies virus infection, although unlikely to be a reservoir host. - Mod.CP
