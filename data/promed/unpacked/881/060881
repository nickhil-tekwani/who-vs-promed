CHEYENNE, Wyo. - An outbreak of canine distemper in raccoons has prompted
Wyoming Game and Fish Department officials to urge people to make sure
their dogs are vaccinated against the disease.
The virus usually causes severely matted eyes and runny noses. It can also
cause skin crusting and brain damage. Infected raccoons become disoriented
and appear during the day. They are often oblivious to humans, but
officials warn people not to approach the animals. Although canine
distemper is not transmissible to humans, infected raccoons are unable to
flee because of their impaired vision and poor health and have been known
to bite.
The first disoriented raccoons in Cheyenne were reported on FE Warren Air
Force Base uring the week of 3 Mar 2001. In West Cheyenne 3 more sick
raccoons were reported from 11 to 13 Mar 2002. The disease is spread by
direct contact between animals and most carnivores are susceptible. Game
and Fish officials think skunks are also at risk during this outbreak
because they share habitat with the infected raccoons. The disease is
usually fatal.
