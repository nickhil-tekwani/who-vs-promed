RABIES EXPOSURE, REFUSAL OF TREATMENT AND DISCUSSION There seems to be
little reason to belabor this subject further since the patient has refused
treatment for a probable exposure that happened some time ago (the skunk
bit the dog and subject and then the dog died?). If he was infected, he is
now well into the incubation and ascending invasion (via peripheral nerves
to CNS) phase. The virus is thought to be protected from immune assault
while inside nerve trunks. If he had a bite with possible infection by
rabies virus, his actual chances of getting the disease and death are
between 0-60% depending on many factors. We do not know the extent and
time of his injury but he is probably by now either doomed or safe. As far
as a risk to others is concerned, should he develop rabies, it is very
small indeed. I know of only one very likely report of human to human
transmission (see M. Fekadu et al: Ethipian Med J 1996: 34: 123-127).
There have, however, been corneal transplant cases reported and I hope that
if this man dies of a neurological disease his corneas are not used (or any
other organs). How does this case then differ from a person who refused
treatment for an operable breast, lung or other cancer or severe diabetes?
I doubt that any judge would order confining this man or forcing him to
undergo vaccination if he does not want it.

While human-to-human transmission of rabies may be theoretically possible,
to my knowledge, this has never been documented. If you know of any such
case, please educate me! Consequently, I think the public health risk in
this case is minimal to non-existent: quarantine sounds like gross overkill
to me.
If I was faced with this problem I would be concerned about two things. 1.
Does the patient fully understand the risk and the consequences of refusing
vaccination, and the risk and benefit of accepting vaccination, and 2. Have
you adequately protected yourself legally. If this patient continued to
refuse treatment, I would try to obtain a court order to treat him -- let
the judge decide if he has the right to refuse or not.

RABIES EXPOSURE, TREATMENT REFUSED: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
I would be interested in further information on the reason for this fellows
refusal. Some time ago we had to advise a resident of a southwestern US
state that the bat that had bitten him tested positive for rabies. He
refused treatment because we were "government" and therefore not to be
trusted. After visiting him on three separate occasions over a week and
spending many hours chatting about the weather and cattle prices he
eventually changed his mind. Not exactly sure why he refused or why he
changed his mind but I think it had more to do with chatting about the
weather than reciting rabies mortality statistics.

Here's an interesting trivial sideline: In Connecticut within the past
couple of days, a man looked out in his yard to see an obviously sick
raccoon--staggering, foaming at the mouth. The man, using his 22 rifle,
shot and killed the raccoon (later found to be rabid). A 12-year-old
neighbor girl, home from school, saw the incident and called the police.
The man who killed the raccoon was arrested, and now must face charges of
illegal discharge of a firearm--although he killed a rabid raccoon!

[My understanding is that human rabies is a horrific death, although I have
not seen it. For me, the copious saliva, spasms, contractions,
convulsions, behavioral changes, such as barking and extreme agitation and
terror are enough reasons to keep the person off the street and restrict
movement at some time during the clinical course of the disease. Since the
individual who refused post exposure prophylaxis will probably not request
treatment, we must intervene at some point. It seems to me that it is
better to intervene at the post exposure prophylaxis stage than when the
individual becomes clinical. However, as this thread has made clear there
is a valuable and time-honored tradition of not forcing medical treatment
on individuals when they pose no threat to others.
Although some would disagree with any infringement on individual rights, I
would push for quarantine of the clinical period with some reasonable
prodomal time frame. Then I would let the jurists, medical ethicists and
the larger society weigh in on this complex issue. After all, policy of
this sort should not be decided by scientist, public health and other types
of technically trained people alone.
I think some of the most valuable comments were those who suggested that
before getting the courts involved one should try to figure why this
individual refuses treatment and sketch out for her/him what the practical
consequences are likely to be in terms of not just symptoms but disruptions
to the social fabric of their own life. At this point a film, if it
exists, of a human rabies case would be useful. If after all this effort,
the individual still refused, then I would push for the quarantine to
protect potential exposed individuals.
One final note, Oscar Wilde indicates with 30 bites daily there has never
been a refusal for post exposure prophylaxis in Thailand, even among slum
dwellers. Here in the US, with relatively few exposures, we have accounts
of a refusal and a near refusal (if not for the chat about the weather).
What drives someone to refuse to listen to good, sound, uncontroversial
medical advice? Please don't answer that question with emails and because
discretion is the better part of valor, neither of which I possess in
abundance, I'll cut the thread here. - Mod. pc
