Cholera in 1997, Summary
The year was marked by a dramatic cholera epidemic affecting the countries
in the Horn of Africa. At the end of December almost all countries in this
region were affected or threatened by severe cholera outbreaks. Countries
affected by major outbreaks were Djibouti, Kenya, Mozambique, Somalia,
Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Case-fatality rates (CFR) in
some countries were as high as 20%. Most of the cholera outbreaks followed
heavy rainfalls, which in some countries resulted in huge floods. The El
Nino phenomenon is considered to be related to the heavy rainfalls and
floods in the Horn of Africa and has destroyed land and displaced
populations in several countries, e.g. Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia,
Sudan.
All regions of the world have continued to report cholera caused by _V.
cholerae_ O1 biotype El Tor since 1961 when it first appeared in Indonesia
(Map 1). A total of 147,425 cases and 6,274 deaths (CFR 4.3%) were reported
in 1997 to WHO... With a total of 118,349 cases, Africa accounted for 80%
of the global total. The total number of cases and deaths are similar to
the previous year when 143,349 cases and 6,689 deaths were reported with a
CFR of 4.7%. Cholera cases were notified from 65 countries in 1997 which is
a decrease of 9% compared to 1996 (71 countries). Although the number of
countries and the total global number of cases have been decreasing every
year since 1992, the CFR is not decreasing and is of major concern.
In the Americas, the total number of cases declined by 15.5% from 1996 to
1997. However, by the end of the year, and probably related to the extreme
weather changes associated with the El Nino phenomenon, many countries in
the region reported unexpected cholera outbreaks.
Cholera and the International Health Regulations
Cholera is one of the 3 diseases reportable under the International Health
Regulations (IHR). Official notification by the countries affected is
therefore mandatory according to the present legislation. Reporting of the
3 diseases is far from complete, in part due to surveillance difficulties,
but also - and this is particularly important for cholera - because
countries fear the economic and social cost of reporting these diseases.
The economic and political impact of cholera on a society, including
reduction of labor availability, food export and tourism restrictions, can
be significant. In Peru, during the cholera outbreak which started in 1991,
the losses were estimated to be several hundred million dollars in only 1
year.
The World Health Assembly in 1995 called for the revision of the IHR to
make them more applicable to the control of communicable diseases in the
21st century. The revised IHR will stress reporting of clinical syndromes
of potential worldwide importance, and will include public health
guidelines for countries to follow. The new IHR will help to demystify
cholera and avoid inappropriate measures against countries affected by
cholera.
