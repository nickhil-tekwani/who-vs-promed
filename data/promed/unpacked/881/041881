La Mayotte (France). 12 Jun 2019. Probably autochthonous (i.e., by local infection) dengue cases have recently been identified in Mayotte while no one has been infected locally since 2016, the Indian Ocean Regional Health Agency (ARS) told AFP on Wednesday [12 Jun 2019]. [On 31 Mar 2019], 9 cases of dengue have been reported in the 101st French department, including 3 people who were probably locally infected (indigenous cases) and 6 recently traveled to a circulation area of the virus (Reunion Island and Africa). Additional analyses are in progress, but the appearance of indigenous cases in Mayotte "may reflect an early circulation of the virus on the island," the organization said. "The last epidemic episode of dengue in Mayotte dates back to 2014, with 514 cases reported, the vast majority (91%) was of indigenous origin," said ARS. The epidemic had raged from March to July 2014, and since then only a few "sporadic" cases had been recorded and no indigenous cases had been reported since 2016. Mayotte is close to the Comoros, where a recrudescence of malaria is observed, and its French neighbor, Reunion, where the dengue virus circulates in an "active and uninterrupted" way since the beginning of the year 2018. This "(confirms) the importance of maintaining a very high level of vigilance on these diseases," concluded the ARS.

Queensland. 3 Jul 2019. Of all Australian states, Queensland has the most to lose from the 4 deg C of global warming expected within 80 years if the planet stays on its current path, according to an Ernst and Young report. But health experts and politicians say the impact won't just be economic -- there will be major impacts on human health, ranging from cyclones to snakebite to dengue to jellyfish stings to vector-borne disease. Northern Queensland experienced a series of record-breaking heatwaves last summer, with the November [2018] heatwave killing almost one-third of all spectacled fruit bats. Cairns public health researcher Dr. Lea Merone told newsGP that the bat deaths could have potentially wide-reaching public health impacts. "You get increased exposure to bats, which has risks of communicable diseases like Australian bat lyssavirus," she said. "If you have increased contact with bats, there will be increased requirements for vaccines and immunoglobulin." In short, the state has a decentralised population, almost 7000 km (4350 mi) of coastline, and tropical to sub-tropical climates, meaning it is exposed to extreme weather, heat, and tropical diseases. Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles told newsGP climate change is the "single most important issue of our time." Minister Miles cited heat-related illness, vector-borne diseases, and respiratory diseases as key climate health risks.
