Foot-and-mouth disease cases reported in central Taiwan
-------------------------------------------------------
Taiwan will not be eligible to apply for listing as a
foot-and-mouth-disease (FMD)-free country until the latter half of
2011 at the earliest after sporadic FMD cases were reported in 2
counties in central Taiwan earlier this month [February 2009], an
official said Wednesday [18 Feb 2009].

Huang Kuo-ching, deputy director of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of
Agriculture (COA), told an evening news conference that 15 pigs in a
small ranch in [Yun-Lin] County were found on 4 Feb 2009 to have
developed blisters in their mouths and feet, suspected of falling
victim to FMD infection. "All of the 68 hogs in the farm have been
culled," Huang said.

On 9 Feb 2009, 23 pigs in a large-scale farm in neighboring
[Chang-Hua] County were also detected to have similar symptoms, Huang
said, adding that all 609 pigs under the same roof have been culled
and the remaining 5503 hogs raised in the farm have received anti-FMD
shots [meaning "FMD vaccine" - Mod.AS] to prevent spread of the
highly contagious viral disease that mainly affects cloven-hoofed
animals, including pigs, cattle, and sheep.

Citing laboratory results released 17 Feb 2009, Huang said the
viruses detected in the 2 hog farms were same as the O-type virus
that originated in pigs smuggled from China in 1997, causing an
outbreak in Taiwan in March the same year.

"The viruses found in the Yun-Lin and Chang-Hua ranches were not new
strains and unlikely to infect humans," Huang said, adding that
locally produced pork remains safe to eat.

According to Huang, all of the infected pigs had not received
anti-FMD injections for some time in line with the country's plan to
apply to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) for an FMD-free status.

"We were originally scheduled to come up with the application next
year [2009], but the plan has to be postponed to the 2nd half of 2011
at the earliest because of the latest cases in Yun-Lin and Chang-Hua
counties," Huang said.

After the 1st FMD case broke out in Taiwan on 20 Mar 1997, Huang
said, Taiwan has been trying to stamp out the disease as quickly as
possible. All pig farms and slaughterhouses around Taiwan have
continuously conducted disinfections to prevent the spread of viruses.

At the same time, the percentage of pigs at nationwide hog farms
receiving anti-FMD vaccine injections has dropped from 50 percent
last November [2008] to the current level of less than 10 percent on
average, moving toward a zero injection rate to meet the OIE's
requirements, Huang said.

According to the OIE's regulations, a country is entitled to apply
for an FMD-free status if no fresh suspicious FMD cases are reported
within one year after suspension of anti-FMD vaccination.

[FMD, a disease notifiable in Taiwan, has not been recorded there since 2001.

Taiwan (named in OIE's current terminology as "Chinese Taipei")
submitted to the OIE an "immediate notification" concerning this new
outbreak, on Wed 18 Feb 2009; a map showing the locations of the 2
outbreaks is included. For the notification, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7802>.

The said notification includes the following "Epidemiological comments":

"In order to ensure the eradication of FMD virus, Chinese Taipei used
non-vaccinated pigs as sentinel animals on every farm. The number of
non-vaccinated pigs has gradually increased since August 2008. The
virus was detected in these 2 farms with non-vaccinated sentinel pigs.

The 8 cases in Yun-Lin were immediately destroyed on 4 Feb 2009 and
the other 60 susceptible pigs were destroyed on 5 Feb 2009.
The 23 cases in Chang-Hua were immediately destroyed on 9 Feb 2009
and the other 586 susceptible pigs were completely destroyed on 18 Feb 2009.

The surveillance in the 3-km (2-mi) radius of these 2 index farms is
completed. All the 75 farms found near these 2 areas have been
disinfected. No other infected farm has been found."

OIE's policy of recognising countries as free of FMD and the involved
procedures are laid-out on OIE's website, under the title "Official
country disease status." It includes the relevant questionnaire,
disease distribution map, the "list of FMD free members," and
"loss/reinstatement of status of countries and zone." See at
