The World Health Organization has confirmed that an Indonesian teenager who
died last week was infected with bird flu, a health ministry official said
on Tuesday, taking the country's confirmed bird flu deaths to 39. The head
of Indonesia's bird flu information centre, Runizar Ruesin, said the
14-year-old boy was from south of Jakarta, but did not give details.
Samples of the boy's lung fluid were sent to a WHO laboratory in Hong Kong
for confirmation after he tested positive for bird flu locally. Local tests
are not considered definitive.
Indonesia has seen a steady rise in human bird flu infections and deaths
since its first known outbreak of H5N1 in poultry in late 2003. The country
of 220 million has an estimated 1.2 billion chickens, some 30 percent of
them in the yards of homes in both rural and urban areas. Avian influenza
virus is endemic in poultry in nearly all of the 33 provinces in Indonesia,
a country of 17 000 islands sprawling across some 5000 kilometres (3100
miles).
The head of Indonesia's bird flu task force, in the Ministry of
Agriculture, said on Tuesday she hoped Indonesia would be free of the virus
in 2008. "In 2008, Indonesia will be free from bird flu," said Delima
Ashari, speaking on Elshinta news radio. But he also said: "I realise that
the immense size of Indonesia makes it not easy to handle and socialise
strategies and change people's behaviour on bird flu handling and how to
live healthily with fowl."
Despite climbing deaths, the government has resisted mass culling of birds,
citing the expense and impracticality in a country dotted with backyard
farms. Vaccination has been preferred to culling, which has been done only
sporadically at selective farms and their immediate surroundings. Bird flu
remains essentially an animal disease but climbing human deaths have put
many countries around the world on alert for fear it may mutate into one
that could pass easily among people and trigger a pandemic, killing millions.
Indonesia drew international attention in May 2006 when the virus killed as
many as 7 members of a single family in North Sumatra. Experts said there
could have been limited human-to-human transmission in this cluster case.
But they stressed genetic analyses of the virus has not shown all of the
traits that are known so far to allow it to spread easily among people.

[Confirmation of the death of this teenager brings the number human cases
of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in Indonesia so far to 51, making
the fatality rate 76.5 percent. A total of 28 of the 54 fatal cases of
avian influenza virus infection recorded in the world so far this year has
occurred in Indonesia.
The prediction of the Ministry of Agriculture spokesperson that Indonesia
will be free of the virus by 2008 does not appear to be based on any form
of factual analysis. Until avian influenza in domestic poultry is brought
under control and eliminated, there seems little prospect of elimination of
cases of avian influenza in humans in Indonesia. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: Avian Influenza situation - WHO Update 20
----------------------------------------------------
As of 20 Jun 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed the
country's 51st case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case, which was fatal, occurred in a 13-year-old boy from South
Jakarta. He developed symptoms on 9 Jun 2006 one week after helping his
grandfather slaughter diseased chickens at the family home. The boy was
hospitalized on 13 Jun 2006 and died on 14 Jun 2006. The grandfather
remains healthy. Contact tracing and monitoring are under way to ensure no
further cases arise from this exposure setting. Of the 51 cases confirmed
to date in Indonesia, 39 have been fatal.
WHO, FAO, and the Indonesian ministries of health and agriculture are
jointly convening an expert consultation in Jakarta from 21 to 23 Jun 2006.
The consultation is being held, at the request of the government's national
commission on avian influenza and pandemic influenza, to assess the avian
influenza situation in poultry and humans. The consultation, which will be
attended by more than 40 national and international experts, will review
measures for addressing the widespread presence of the virus in poultry and
offer advice on strategies for reducing the number of human cases.
The experts will also examine epidemiological and virological data
collected during a month-long investigation of a cluster of cases among
family members in the Kubu Simbelang village of North Sumatra. More than 3
weeks (2 times the maximum incubation period) have passed since the last
case in the cluster died on 22 May 2005. Daily house-to-house monitoring
for influenza-like illness was conducted throughout the village and in
health care facilities where patients were treated, and no further cases
were detected. While these findings indicate no significant changes in the
epidemiology of the disease, results from investigation of the cluster will
be reviewed as they may yield lessons useful in the investigation and
interpretation of other large clusters where human-to-human transmission is
suspected.
Several viruses have been isolated from the 7 confirmed cases in the
cluster and these have been fully sequenced at WHO reference laboratories
in Hong Kong and the USA. Experts from these laboratories will be
presenting their findings for review during the consultation.
