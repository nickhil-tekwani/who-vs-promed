Congo students diagnosed with swine flu
---------------------------------------
The Republic of the Congo confirmed its fist cases of swine flu
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] on [Wed 28 Oct 2009]
after health authorities said 5 school students had been diagnosed
with the virus. "The 5 students have been quarantined [isolated] to
prevent infecting the other children," Alexis Elira Dokekias, the
country's director of public health, told reporters.

Congolese authorities say plans are in place to stop the spread of the
[pandemic] (H1N1) virus and a media campaign has been launched to
inform the public on how to prevent contamination.

[The Republic of the Congo recently confirmed the 1st cases of
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection in 5 schools located in
the capital city, Brazzaville. This trend is similar to what has been
observed in other countries where cases were initially confirmed in
the urban centres before wider geographical spread occurred within the
country. There is therefore need to intensify surveillance and public
health education in both the affected areas in the City as well as the
other areas especially the schools in the country.

Brazzaville, the capital city, is located on the Congo River and can

Swine flu confirmed in Muhanga District
---------------------------------------
Since 7 Nov [2009], 3 people have tested positive for swine flu
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] in Nyamabuye sector,
Muhanga District [Southern province] authorities said yesterday [8 Nov
2009], warning that more were likely to be infected. The District
executive secretary, Celse Gasana, said the infections were identified
among 3 American citizens, who had been attending a workshop and
staying in Ruvumera.

"We believe that their workers are infected and there is a possibility
that the disease is already spreading within the residents." By press
time, district official had called for TRAC Plus experts to do initial
screenings. "The Americans are currently being treated at King Faisal
Hospital, while 3 Rwandans, who showed symptoms, are currently under
treatment at Kabgayi Hospital," Dr Patrick Hategikimana of Kabgayi
Hospital said. Residents who spoke to The New Times expressed fear
that the disease could rapidly spread.

The Ministry of Health, through TRAC Plus, the National Reference
Laboratory, and other institutions, continue to monitor the situation
closely while improving the capacity of emergency preparedness and
surveillance. Residents have been advised to take precautionary
measures including covering their mouth and nose while coughing or
sneezing and washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water on a
regular basis. They have also been advised to seek medical attention
if they develop any slight symptom of swine flu. Health experts said
that the situation was under control and being monitored.

[The outbreak of pandemic H1N1 continues to spread to new districts in
Rwanda with the current cases being confirmed in foreign nationals
attending a workshop in Muhanga district. International travel has
been a major factor in the spread of the current pandemic to new
areas. In the current report, it's likely that the cases confirmed
among the foreign nationals passed on the infection to the locals,
hence contributing to the spread of the pandemic to Muhanga district.
As of 9 Nov 2009, Rwanda had notified a total of 186 lab confirmed
cases of pandemic H1N1 to the WHO.

29 countries in the AFRO region have reported a total of 14 868 lab
confirmed cases including 103 deaths to WHO
