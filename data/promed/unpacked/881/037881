[1] USA: Transmission dynamics by age-group in hotspot counties
Date: Fri 9 Oct 2020

ref: Oster AM, Caruso E, DeVies J, et al. Transmission dynamics by age group in COVID-19 hotspot counties -- United States, April-September 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. Epub 9 Oct 2020. http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6941e1

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) works with other federal agencies to identify counties with increasing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence (hotspots) and offers support to state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). Understanding whether increasing incidence in hotspot counties is predominantly occurring in specific age-groups is important for identifying opportunities to prevent or reduce transmission. The percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results (percent positivity) is an important indicator of community transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/calculating-percent-positivity.html; https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/). CDC analyzed temporal trends in percent positivity by age-group in COVID-19 hotspot counties before and after their identification as hotspots. Among 767 hotspot counties identified during June and July 2020, early increases in the percent positivity among persons aged 24 years or younger were followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity in persons aged 25 years or older. Addressing transmission among young adults is an urgent public health priority.

Hotspot counties were identified by applying previously described standardized criteria to detect counties that had more than 100 cases during the past 7 days and experienced increases in cases in the preceding 3-7 days (1). Counties identified as hotspots during 1 Jun 2020 through 31 Jul 2020 that had not met hotspot criteria in the previous 21 days were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results were obtained from data submitted by state health departments and laboratories.* Percent positivity was calculated by dividing the number of positive test results by the sum of positive and negative test results for each age-group (0-17, 18-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+ years) for the 45 days before and 45 days after hotspot detection (spanning April-September 2020) based on specimen collection or test order date. Data were presented using a 7-day moving average. Results were aggregated across all hotspot counties and stratified by age-group. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.6.0; The R Foundation).

The 767 hotspot counties detected 1 Jun 2020 through 31 Jul 2020 represented 24% of all US counties and 63% of the US population. Percent positivity among persons aged 0-17 and 18-24 years began increasing 31 days before hotspot identification. Increases in percent positivity among older age-groups began after the increases in younger age-groups: among adults aged 25-44 years, 45-64 years, and 65+ years, increases began 28 days, 23 days, and 20 days, respectively, before hotspot identification (Figure 1). At the time of hotspot detection, the highest percent positivity was among persons aged 18-24 years (14%), followed by those aged 0-17 years (11%), 25-44 years (10%), 45-64 years (8%), and 65+ years (6%). Percent positivity among persons aged 18-24 years was near its peak of 15% by the date of hotspot detection; however, among other age-groups, percent positivity continued to increase for 21-33 days after hotspot detection, peaking at 10%-14%, and the decline for other age-groups was slower than that for persons aged 18-24 years.

Important differences were identified when analyzing percent positivity by US Census region (https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf; Figure 2). Trends by age for hotspot counties in the South (488 counties) and West (98 counties) aligned with national trends, although percent positivity was higher in the South than in the West for all age-groups. In hotspot counties in the Midwest (134 counties), percent positivity among persons aged 18-24 years peaked before hotspot detection, and percent positivity increased minimally in other age-groups. In hotspot counties in the Northeast (47 counties), there was a small increase in percent positivity among persons aged 18-24 years but minimal or no increases in other age-groups.

In hotspot counties, particularly those in the South and West, percent positivity increased earliest in younger persons, followed by several weeks of increasing percent positivity among older age-groups. An increase in the percentage of positive test results in older age-groups is likely to result in more hospitalizations, severe illnesses, and deaths (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html). These findings corroborate regional patterns in the southern USA, where increased percent positivity among adults aged 20-39 years preceded increases among those aged 60 years and older (2); provide evidence that among young adults, those aged 18-24 years demonstrate the earliest increases in percent positivity; and underscore the importance of reducing transmission from younger populations to those at highest risk for severe illness or death. There is an urgent need to address transmission among young adult populations, especially given recent increases in COVID-19 incidence among young adults (3). These data also demonstrate the urgency of healthcare preparedness in hotspot counties,** which are likely to experience increases in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations among older populations in the weeks after meeting hotspot criteria.

*SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing data were obtained from COVID-19 electronic laboratory reporting data submitted by state health departments for 37 states and from data submitted directly by a subset of public health, commercial, and reference laboratories (representing approximately 50% of all tests) for 13 states and the District of Columbia. The data might not include results from all testing sites within a jurisdiction (e.g., point-of-care test sites) and therefore reflect the majority, but not all, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests in the USA. The data represent laboratory test totals (not individual persons) and exclude antibody and antigen tests.

**CDC and other federal agencies that monitor trends in COVID-19 are collaborating to refine approaches to define and track hotspots. As a result, terminology or definitions used in future reports might differ from the terminology used in this report.

[These analyses confirm the observations that have been made during the increasing hotspots in the USA and in other countries: The younger age-groups have been affected earlier on, many of whom have mild or no disease, and several weeks later there is the increase in hospitalizations and severe disease presentations to the hospitals. While the study shows an approximate 8-day interval before increases in cases between the younger age-group and older age-group, add an additional 10-14 days before the severe symptoms manifest themselves; thus, there is an apparent lag of approximately 3 weeks between the start of the "hotspot" and the recognition through increased hospitalizations and severe diseases, and add another 10-14 days before the increase in deaths is reported. This would explain somewhat how during the 1st waves in European countries and in New York City and Washington State, when the increase in hospitalizations was noted, the number of infected individuals and community transmission had "skyrocketed", overwhelming the health infrastructures.

The sobering statistic is that the increase in cases (transmission) among the 0-17 and 18-24 year age-groups began an average of 31 days before the hotspot was identified/recognized. We are now a few weeks into the reopening of schools, including universities, thereby gathering 0-17 and 18-24 year-olds...it is not surprising that transmission increases have been noticed with new hotspots cropping up around the country, especially with a significant amount of community transmission ongoing in the background. Can these be identified earlier with implementation of "cluster busting" strategies to prevent the 2nd waves being as devastating as the 1st waves? (see COVID-19 update (422): obesity & severity, cluster busting, WHO, global 20201002.7830244 for a discussion on cluster busting strategy). - Mod.MPP]

The Ministry of Public Health reported on Thursday [8 Oct 2020] that out of 372 samples, 68 cases have turned positive in the last 24 hours. At least 113 392 people have so far been tested in the governmental labs, and there still are 5088 known active cases in the country. According to the ministry, within 24 hours, 13 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and one individual is reported dead.

[The new cases recorded are in Kabul (16), Herat (50), Logar (1), and Kandahar (1).]

The total number of cases in Afghanistan is 39 616, total deaths are 1470, and the total recoveries are recorded 33 058.

Bangladesh has registered 20 new fatalities from the novel coronavirus infection [COVID-19] in a daily count, taking the death toll to 5460. The caseload jumped to 374 592 after 1441 people tested positive for COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8 am [Thu 8 Oct 2020], the government said.

The number of recoveries outpaced active cases in the same period as another 1685 patients recovered from COVID-19 through treatment at home and in hospital care. It brings the total to 288 316.

A total of 12 605 samples were tested at 109 authorised labs across the country in the last 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 11.43%, according to data released by the health directorate. The official figures put the recovery rate at 76.97%, while the mortality rate stands at 1.46%.

In line with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendation, almost all states and UTs [Union Territories] in India are testing more than 140 samples "per day per million population", the health ministry said, underlining higher testing on a sustained basis has aided in bringing down the positivity rate.

The national cumulative positivity rate declined over the last 11 days to 8.2%. Currently, 6 states and one UT have a less than 5% positivity rate, whereas 22 are below the national average, indicating the rate of infection spread is being contained in many parts. The national average of tests per day per million population stands at 865.

India has conducted 60 323 tests per million population so far, whereas US has done 344 858 and Brazil -- which has the 3rd highest number of total COVID-19 cases reported so far -- has performed 84 051 tests per million population.

Bihar, Mizoram, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, and Himachal Pradesh have cumulative positivity rates of below 5%. India has stepped up its testing capacity over the last 6 months with over 1900 laboratories under the ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research] network including government and private labs.

The country's testing capacities have multiplied manifold and more than 15 lakh [1.5 million] samples can be tested every day now. With 1 194 321 tests on Wednesday [7 Oct 2020], the cumulative tests in India have now crossed 8.34 crore [83.4 million]. Higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes or facilities and in hospitals for the severe cases, the ministry said.

These measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate, it added. Helped by more recoveries and fewer new cases, the active case load remained below 10 lakh [1 million] for the 17th day on Wednesday [7 Oct 2020]. A total of 78 524 new confirmed cases were reported during Wednesday [7 Oct 2020], whereas 83 011 people were discharged on recovery.

[India, the USA, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (73 196), followed by the USA (60 715) and Brazil (27 651) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 5786 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (8-9 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include India, USA, Brazil, France (20 339), Argentina (15 099), UK (13 864), Russia (12 126), Czech Republic (8617), Colombia (8121), Spain (5986), Netherlands (5971), Ukraine (5804), Belgium (5728), Italy (5372), and Mexico (5263). A total of 41 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 19 of the 41 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 8 were from the Americas region, and 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 10.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.94%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages have increased with reports from the past 72 hours. There is still an apparent though lesser decline in reports from India and Brazil. The USA has an increase of 13.1% in 7-day averages of newly confirmed cases and a decrease of 0.79% in 7-day averages of reported deaths. A common observation is while there are increases in reported cases, the decrease in reported deaths is stabilizing, but keeping the transmission dynamics, it would not be surprising to see an increase in deaths in 3-4 weeks following the increase in cases (see section [1] above). - Mod.MPP]
