The Union County Health Department has confirmed that a horse in
Raiford contracted both Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and West
Nile Virus (WNV).
-----------------------------------------------
This is the 1st confirmed case in the state this year [2005]. On 22
Mar 2005, lab testing confirmed the 3-year-old horse had both EEE and
WNV. An unnamed veterinarian brought the case to the attention of
health department officials. Because of the findings, the horse was
euthanized.
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta,
Georgia, EEE is transmitted to humans and horses through the bite of
an infected mosquito. EEE's main transmission cycle is between
mosquitoes and birds. If infected, both humans and horses can die
from the disease.
EEE attacks the central nervous system of horses. The onset of the
disease is sudden, and nearly all cases are fatal. Early symptoms of
EEE in horses model that of rabies or WNV. Other symptoms include
unsteadiness, erratic behavior and a loss of coordination.
EEE can infect people of all ages. Effects of the disease in humans
can be mild, serious or even fatal. Most people infected with EEE do
not become ill. If they do, symptoms mirror those of influenza.
Fever, headache and sore throat can also be associated with the
disease.
It is rare for a human's central nervous system to be affected. If a
person's central nervous system is affected, sudden fever, muscle
pains and a headache of increasing severity, often followed by
seizures and coma, are the result.
According to the CDC, approximately 50 percent all these cases are
fatal. Approximately 35 percent of those who do survive the disease
are left with permanent brain damage. Young children and the elderly
are at most risk from this form of the disease. Symptoms in humans
usually occur from 4 to 10 days after being bitten by an infected
mosquito.
There is no licensed vaccine for human use, which makes controlling
the disease difficult. Once infected, there are no known effective
therapeutic drugs to cure humans. Limited financial support as well
as not knowing the cycle of the disease in the winter time has made
the disease difficult for the CDC to control.
Currently, the CDC's priority is to develop and evaluate vaccines for
the disease. They are attempting to develop and evaluate therapeutic
drugs, improve diagnostic and virus detection tests and improve
predictive capabilities as well.
CDC keeps tabs on cases of EEE through the National Notifiable
Diseases Surveillance System. In 2003, it began testing a system
known as Arbonet. It is a national, electronic surveillance system
established by CDC to assist states in tracking WNV and other
mosquito-borne virus such as EEE.
Since 1964, the CDC has confirmed 200 cases of EEE in humans. States
with the largest number of cases are Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts
and New Jersey. The center averages approximately 4 cases per year,
but has seen as many as 14 cases in one year. According to the CDC,
more cases do not occur because the primary transmission cycle takes
place in swamp areas where populations tend to be limited.
The Florida Department of Agriculture Commissioner Charles H. Bronson
is urging horse owners to have their animals vaccinated against
mosquito-borne illness. "Horse owners have done a good job in getting
their animals properly vaccinated over the past few years, and we
have seen a significant drop in the number of equine WNV cases," said
Bronson. "But it is critical that we don't become complacent.
Mosquito season is upon us, and the chances of contracting these
disease have, of course, increased. Horse owners are reminded that
their animals' vaccinations must be up to date, including the
necessary booster shots."
In 2004, 48 cases of EEE in horses were confirmed. 6 cases of WNV
were confirmed in that same year. In 2002, just less than 500 cases
of WNV were reported. Vaccinations for WNV became available in 2001,
while the EEE vaccine has been around for years.

[In the last few years, EEE had dramatically increased in horses
along the Eastern US seaboard. It was speculated that the focus on
WNV allowed a lapse in recommendation for EEE vaccination.
Clearly, horses may have more than one kind of encephalitis. There
are vaccines available for WNV, EEE, Western EE and Venezuelan EE.
These vaccines may be found in various combinations, including WNV,
EEE, WEE, VEE and tetanus. Horses may also be vaccinated for rabies.
Rabies is a separate vaccine and is not found in combination with
other virus vaccines.
It seems very early in the year for EEE. Typically, we think of EEE
as most often occurring a bit later in the year. - Mod.TG]
