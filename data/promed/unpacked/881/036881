Disease-carrying vaccine destroyed
----------------------------------
The Animal Quarantine Center at the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport
[Jakarta, Indonesia] burned on Friday some vaccines and substances suspected
of carrying animal diseases that had been illegally imported from China
and the USA.
Officials burned 300 250-milliliter bottles of Avian Influenza (bird
flu) vaccines smuggled from China, a pallet of substances classified
as Infectious Substances Affecting Humans, from China, and 35
kilograms of beef from the USA.
Budi Tri Akoso of the Ministry of Agriculture said the bird flu vaccine was
smuggled in April [2004]from China into the country in a box. The delivery
document described the contents as "vitamins". "Officers were suspicious
because an import recommendation from the ministry's Directorate General for
Poultry Production Supervision was not attached to the box, and the bottles
were not labeled," he said. The vaccine samples were examined at the Bogor
Institute of Agriculture Laboratory and were found to contain the Avian
Influenza virus.
Budi said the outbreak of bird flu in Indonesia late in 2003 was
caused by, among other things, the illegal import of animal vaccines
by individuals and companies.
The officers also burned [some items designated] Infectious
Substances Affecting Humans, as they contained _Leptospira
interrogans_ serotype _canicola_ and _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_
bacteria [the latter is not regarded as pathogenic for humans. -
Mod.AS]. Government Regulation No. 82/2000 on animal quarantine and No.
78/1992 on animal medicine stipulate certain procedures to import
such substances.
The officers also destroyed the beef, as the shipment did not have valid
documents. "Beef imported from China has been banned because the World
Animal Health Body [OIE] says China is still not free from contagious animal
diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and bird flu." [This does not make
sense. It says in paragraph 2 of this report that the beef was from the USA,
which does not have foot-and-mouth disease, and bird flu is not carried by
beef. - Mod.JW]
However, none of the illegal importers were detained, although the
center announced they had violated Animal Quarantine Law No. 16/1992,
which carries a maximum sentence of 3 years imprisonment and Rp 150
million (USD 15 957) in fines. "Our officers had to let the importers walk
free because we don't have the authority to detain them" Budi asserted.
The center has foiled 8 smuggling attempts from China and Hong Kong
through the airport since December 2003. All of the smuggled vaccines
were destroyed.

[China and Indonesia are the only Eastern-Asian countries that have
officially approved the use of avian influenza (AI) vaccines in their
respective territories.
The possible interaction between vaccinations and disease cannot be
overlooked, particularly if batches of vaccine are distributed
without the application of adequate state control during all phases
of manufacture, distribution and application.
Reportedly, there are currently at least 9 AI vaccine manufacturing plants in
China (see 20040323.0815), while unofficial sources gave a higher figure. As
mentioned in previous ProMED-mail postings, it would be helpful if a
competent Chinese state authority would provid the list of approved vaccine
manufacturing plants, the vaccines applied during recent years, and the ones
still in use. In particular, the possible manufacture and use of live-
attenuated vaccines, either in the past or at present, deserves to be either
ruled out or clarified.
Further details on the vaccine batch detained in Indonesia, including the
producer and the type (killed/live attenuated), would be helpful. As
indicated in the International Terrestrial Animal Health Code (see
20040614.1602), any vaccine used should comply with the standards
described in OIE's Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00035.htm>. - Mod.AS]
