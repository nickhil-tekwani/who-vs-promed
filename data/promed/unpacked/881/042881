More than 30 000 people in Zimbabwe have been diagnosed with cholera,
the World Health Organization (WHO) said Thursday [1 Jan 2009], as the
number of those contracting the deadly disease continues to mount. As
many as 31 656 suspected cases were diagnosed to date with 1/3rd of
them in the capital, Harare, the WHO said. The organisation last
reported some 29 131 suspected cases on Monday [29 Dec 2008] and 1564
deaths from the water-borne disease.

The Red Cross announced on Wednesday [31 Dec 2008] that it would send
7 international emergency response teams to the impoverished southern
African country to help fight the spread [of the disease.]

[2] Cholera - South Africa (Western Cape Province) NOT ex Zimbabwe

The City of Cape Town's health department says only one case of
cholera, in Khayelitsha, has been confirmed and 2 adults are being
monitored for suspected cholera, allaying fears that Zimbabwe's
cholera outbreak may have spread to the city. Virginia Azevedo of the
city's health department said laboratory tests had confirmed that the
strain of cholera identified in the Khayelitsha patient was different
from the strain responsible for the cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe.

Azevedo said the cholera case in Khayelitsha, a woman in her mid-20s,
was an isolated instance that should not be seen as a "flare-up." The
patient had been admitted to the GF Jooste Hospital with cholera.
Another 2 adults, neighbors of the cholera patient, were being
monitored. None of the 3 had traveled to Zimbabwe, she said.

Executive director of city health Ivan Bromfield said health
officials had visited the home to assess hygiene and contain the
spread of the disease.

Azevedo said a 10-year-old child had gone to Karl Bremer with
suspected cholera, but cholera was not confirmed.

[3] Cholera - Zambia (Southern Province)
Date: Thu 1 Jan 2009

report [edited]

A total of 13 cholera patients have since been discharged from Ndeke
Cholera Centre in Mazabuka District of Southern Province. Health
staff at the centre told ZANIS in Mazabuka today [1 Jan 2009] that
only 2 patients are still admitted at the centre while no new cholera
cases have been recorded in the last 24 hours.

Mazabuka district commissioner, Tyson Hamaamba, told ZANIS that he is
happy to note that no patient died of cholera since the disease broke
out in the district. Cholera broke out in Mazabuka a week ago and a
total of 64 cases have since been attended to by health experts.

Meanwhile, some residents of Ndeke Township in Mazabuka are
reportedly drinking illicit beer called "Kachasu" to protect
themselves from cholera. Mazabuka town clerk, Ekan Chingangu, who
disclosed this to ZANIS in Mazabuka today [1 Jan 2009] urged
residents to desist from imbibing Kachasu as the illicit beer is not
a protection against cholera.

[For those readers who are interested, the 2004 WHO publication
Global Status Report on Alcohol 2004 has a discussion on traditional
alcoholic beverages in Zimbabwe
(<http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/en/zimbabwe.pdf>).

Although the posting above refers to kachasu as a beer, the report
states, "Some traditional fermented beverages produced at household
level in Zimbabwe include alcoholic beverages made from sorghum or
millet malt (doroluthwala and chikokivana) and distilled spirits such
as kachasu... there is a strong enough market for kachasu, a name
given to home-distilled products with 10 percent to 70 percent
alcohol, to make it a major problem.

relationship to Zimbabwe can be seen at

[4] Diarrhea - Swaziland (Shiselweni Province)

The Ministry of Health has allayed fears of an outbreak of cholera in
Matsanjeni area following reports that residents were recently
attacked by bouts of diarrhea. Masitsela Mhlanga, who is in charge of
the ministry's Emergency Preparedness and Response Unit, said they
were on the alert for cholera.

"It's true that there were cases of diarrhea amongst the population
of Matsanjeni and Lavumisa areas but it had nothing to do with
cholera. Our investigations established that these may have been a
result of food poisoning," Mhlanga said.
