[The rest of the human cases have yet to be confirmed as anthrax, though there has been a steady stream of local news reports on the human cases. It seems that the owner of the sick goats got his friend, a butcher, to help him slaughter and butcher the 2 sick goats so that they could make jerky from the meat. Somehow, this butcher is said to have cut himself with a "bone" and thus got infected. Some butcher. Some bone. Probably nicked himself with his knife. - Mod.MHJ
