I am somewhat familiar with the literature about environmental risks for NHL
[non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma].
The first point to make to your patient and his coworkers is that the best
estimates of minimum latency period for NHL are around 5 years, so it's
extremely unlikely any exposure over the past year caused his disease. The
latency period for NHL has not been definitively established. The little
evidence available is based on the experience of atomic bomb survivors,
Hodgkins disease patients treated with chemo- or radiotherapy, and on
extrapolation from studies of leukemia caused by chronic, low-dose exposure
to benzene. From these data, the latency of NHL caused by short-term,
high-dose exposures is estimated at 5-6 years, and that of NHL caused by
long-term, low-dose exposures is estimated at 15-20 years.
Second, NHL has been increasing around the world for the past 50 years or so
and
is actually more common in countries with higher socioeconomic standards,
such as
the US, so there's no ecologic evidence to support the "unsanitary
conditions" idea.
I don't know the statistics for China, but you could get them off the WHO
Cancer
database website (only as reliable as the reporting, of course).
Several ideas have been suggested for the increase, including exposure to
sun (almost definitely not), pesticides (phenoxy herbicides, esp. 2,4-D,
have been definitely
associated with NHL), changes in diet, etc. Establishing factors that cause
NHL is complicated by the fact that there are about 20-25 different
subgroups of NHL which may share some risk factors but not others. Each
case of NHL -- like other cancers -- is probably due to multiple cumulative
(additive or multiplicative) exposures to different factors. NHL
consistently occurs more frequently in men than women.
Third, there are some infections known to increase the risk of (some types
of) NHL
-- for example, HIV (high-grade B-cell -- AIDS-defining), Epstein-Barr
(Burkitt's), HTLV-I (T-cell lymphoma), and H. pylori (mucosal-associated
lymphoid tissue lymphoma = MALToma). Relationships between other viral
(human herpesvirus 6, hepatitis C virus) and bacterial (TB) and parasitic
(malaria, schisto [I have only seen one report suggesting the NHL/schisto
relationship -- does anyone have more information about it?]) infections
have been posited. In the case of viruses that don't integrate into host
DNA or of bacteria and parasites, the mechanism is likely to be chronic
stimulation of B cells; an initial polyclonal B-cell expansion may evolve
into a monoclonal proliferation, and a mutation in the B-cell line could
lead to malignancy. I don't recall seeing anything in the literature
investigating a relationship between mold/mildew and NHL.
For a good overview (a little dated), you might refer to:
The emerging epidemic of non-Hodgkins lymphoma: current knowledge regarding
etiological factors. Cancer Research (suppl), 1992; 52(19)
Also, a good text is Lymphomas, Ian McGrath, 1997
