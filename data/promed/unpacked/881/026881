I suspect one needs to look at the veterinary literature and pursue,
in the differential diagnosis, tick paralysis. This condition has
been known for 100 years in dogs and, although a similar syndrome
appears in Lyme disease, it isn't Lyme disease and it is caused by a
neurotoxin in the salivary glands of the tick.
This paralysis takes many forms, and one is the type described here
for humans, although rare in the dog. I submit that the antibiotic
therapeutic response may be a "red herring" since tick removal,
including the head, results in reversal of signs and symptoms. If
the head of the tick is not removed and is not expelled within 48
hours, the neurotoxin is still secreted into the subcutaneous tissue,
and the condition remains for that long. There does seem to be a
variant appearing in dogs that lasts clinically for 48 to 72 hours
before the animal is able to function fairly normally. It is worth
considering.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Stevens for his comments. Tick paralysis in
humans tends to be a progressive ascending paralysis that may
continue to worsen transiently after the tick is removed, prior to
improvement (1). Cerebellar ataxia may also be a presenting feature
(2). From the description of the symptoms, the length of the illness
seems too long to be tick paralysis, and there are no descriptions of
retained ticks and no frank paresis.
