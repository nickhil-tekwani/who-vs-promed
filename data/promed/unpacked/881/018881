[Re: ProMED-mail Leishmaniasis, visceral - South Sudan (02) 20151028.3749052]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Old data on leishmaniasis in South Sudan published as recent.

There was an error in [ProMED-mail post referenced above] on kala-azar in South Sudan (copied below). The email includes information on kala-azar in Lankien that was presented as having been current to Wed 28 Oct 2015] -- when in fact the data was a year old, published on [13 Oct 2014]. Dated MSF medical data was referenced in the email which is not accurate as a result.

"Meanwhile, the medical charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it continued to provide medical assistance to clinics treating kala-azar patients in Lankien [Jonglei], where most of the deaths occurred. Last week [week of 19 Oct 2015], 300 people affected by kala-azar were reportedly admitted in its clinic in Lankien while 800 others receive treatment daily."

MSF is not currently treating this high number of kala-azar patients in its project in Lankien, and does not want to raise undue concern among ProMED readers on this particular medical issue at the moment -- although there are many other pressing medical concerns which MSF is responding to in South Sudan presently.
