Macau authorities say 3 more children in the Chinese gambling enclave
have developed kidney stones that may be linked to Chinese milk
contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine.

A government statement says the 3 girls aged from 4 to 8 are in
stable condition and do not require hospitalization.

The Monday [10 Nov 2008] statement says the children attend schools
where authorities provide students with free milk produced by Yili
Industrial Group Co.

Yili is one of several Chinese dairies implicated in a scandal on the
mainland in which melamine-laced dairy products have killed 4 infants
and sickened more than 50 000.

Melamine is used to make plastics and fertilizer.

Samples of the Chinese milk impounded in Dar es Salaam and sent to
South Africa in October [2008] for tests have been found to be
contaminated with the killer chemical, melamine.

A confidential report seen by The Citizen indicates that the chemical
was found in 3 of the 9 samples the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority
(TFDA) provided during the investigation.

The authority had seized 34 tonnes in its crackdown on milk imports
following the Chinese scare, but the sample tested and found to
contain melamine, was taken from 7 tonnes, which a single trader had imported.

The news confirms the fears that Tanzania might have narrowly escaped
disaster, with traders having imported contaminated milk from China,
where baby milk laced with melamine caused the deaths of 4 children
last July [2008], and had by September [2008] infected 94 000 other
people across several continents.

Yesterday [11 Nov 2008], the TFDA director-general, Dr Singonda
Ndomondo, confirmed receiving a report from South Africa, indicating
that the Chinese milk was contaminated.

The news will shock many consumers and might jolt the market,
considering that about 70 per cent of the milk and milk products
consumed in Tanzania are imported. With a population of more than 4
million, Dar es Salaam needs at least a million litres (approx. 264
000 gal) of milk a day, but the local processors are able to supply
less than 60 000 litres (approx. 16 000 gal) a day.

"Yes, it is true that some of the samples we sent to South Africa
have tested positive with melamine chemicals, but everything will be
made public on Thursday [13 Nov 2008]," Dr Ndomondo said by
telephone, when contacted for comment.

She said the authority, whose responsibility is to ensure the safety
of drugs and food sold to millions of consumers every day, would
issue the full report on the Chinese milk saga at a press briefing in
Dar es Salaam.

Dr Ndomondo declined to discuss what steps TFDA was taking to
mitigate the consequences of the findings until the full report was
tabled before the authorities.

However, The Citizen independently established that the TFDA planned
to destroy the 7 tonnes of the contaminated Chinese milk impounded.

A total of 34 tonnes of imported powdered milk was seized from
several traders in September [2008], after the board banned imports
of Chinese milk.

Local tests didn't yield anything, hence the decision to send the
samples to South Africa, which has more sophisticated laboratories.

A source told The Citizen that the Dar es Salaam trader who brought
in the contaminated milk cargo had been informed about the findings.

He said: "A condemnation certificate has been issued to him. Among
other things, he will be required to pay for the cost of destruction
of the tainted milk." However, The Citizen couldn't establish when
this will be done.

Tanzania reacted quickly to an alert issued by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) at the height of the Chinese milk saga.

TFDA also suspended the issuing of import licenses for milk products
until the investigation is concluded.

Senegal, Liberia, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Gabon, Ivory Coast, and Togo also slapped bans on
Chinese milk imports after investigations in China found in milk
traces of melamine, a chemical used to make plastics.

The Chinese milk scandal involved milk and infant formula, and other
food materials and components, which had been adulterated.

The scandal broke on [16 Jul 2008], after 16 babies who had been fed
on milk powder produced by Shijiazhuang-based Sanlu Group were
diagnosed with kidney stones.

With China's wide range of export food products, the scandal has
affected countries on all the continents.

According to scientific journals, melamine is a hard synthetic
substance better known for its flame retardant properties. The
nitrogen-rich molecule is sometimes illegally added to food products
in order to increase their apparent protein content. It has also been
employed as a non-protein nitrogen, appearing in soy meal, corn
gluten meal, and cottonseed meal used in cattle feed.

Melamine is known to cause renal and urinary problems in humans and
animals when it reacts with cyanuric acid inside the body, sometimes
present in drinking water and in animal feed, so its use in food
production is universally banned.

Melamine adulteration of food products made headlines when pet food
was recalled in Europe and the United States in 2007.

A number of arrests were made following the scandal in China. The
head of Sanlu, 7 local government officials, as well as the director
of the administration of quality supervision, inspection, and
quarantine were sacked or forced to resign over the scandal.

The WHO described Chinese milk saga as one of the largest food safety
concerns it has had to deal with in recent years.

In late October [2008], it was discovered that the problem had spread
to eggs and possibly other food categories.
