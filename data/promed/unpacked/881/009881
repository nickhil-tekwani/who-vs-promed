An outbreak of mumps among students at The University of Richmond is growing. There are currently 15 confirmed cases of mumps among students, and there are an additional 38 suspected cases on the university's campus. The number of cases has risen from just one week ago [up from 5 on 13 Mar 2013 - Mod.CP], when the university 1st notified students about multiple laboratory-confirmed cases.

While the virus has not spread to the community, the Virginia Health Department said it's concerned the virus could spread outside of the university.

Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea. School officials are asking anyone who feels sick to contact the student heath centre. The virus can spread when someone coughs or sneezes.

[The number of confirmed and suspected cases of mumps at the University of Richmond has risen in the course of the past week from around 20 to the current total of 58. The University of Richmond is by no means alone in this respect, Earlier this month [March 2013], ProMED-mail reported a similar ongoing outbreak of mumps virus infection at Baltimore's Loyola University.

Outbreaks of mumps occur occasionally in universities and similar educational institutions where young adults from diverse backgrounds congregate. Although the current mumps virus vaccine strains included in the triple MMR vaccine induce sufficient immunity to protect virtually all young children from mumps virus infection, the level of immunity maintained in older children and young adults may be less than adequate to provide protection under all circumstances.

Richmond is the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The population within the city limits was 208 834 in 2012, with an estimated population of 1 282 509 for the Richmond Metropolitan Area.
