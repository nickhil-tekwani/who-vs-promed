Tibet reported an outbreak of the highly contagious older strain of the bird flu virus among chickens, the Ministry of Agriculture announced today.

Thirty-five chickens at a farm in a village in Mainling County of Nyingchi Prefecture showed symptoms of avian flu and died last Tuesday [7 May 2013], according to the ministry.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory today [13 May 2013] confirmed that the virus was H5N1, after testing samples collected at the farm.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilised the infected area, where a total of 372 chickens have been culled and safely disposed of in order to prevent the disease from spreading, the MOA said.
