Authorities in Kozhikode district in Kerala went into high alert mode after a boy was found infected with the contagious _Shigella_ bacterium. Health Minister K.K. Shailaja has called upon the people to observe caution. Shailaja, however, maintained that the situation was under control and that the Health Department was geared up to face any eventuality.

The 1.5-year-old child was admitted to a private hospital in Kozhikode following complaints of acute stomach pain and diarrhea. Doctors confirmed on Thursday [24 Dec 2020] morning that the boy was infected with _Shigella_ bacteria that leads to intestinal disease shigellosis.

Kozhikode and other parts of the district were under observation after some cases of [shigellosis] were detected there. The district was in the news earlier due to Nipah virus cases. Kozhikode District Medical Officer Dr. V. Jayasree, however, said that there was no need to panic and that the Health Department had taken measures to contain the disease. She though called upon the people to remain vigilant and seek medical attention in case of diarrhea, which was one of the main symptoms of the disease.

Kozhikode district has in the recent past reported 26 cases of diarrhea. As per reports, a total of 8 people have been diagnosed with the disease, as of Thursday [24 Dec 2020]. Till now, the presence of _Shigella_ bacteria has been detected from Mundikkalthazham, Kottaparambu and Wayanad areas. The disease usually spreads from contaminated food and water.

[_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given the relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
