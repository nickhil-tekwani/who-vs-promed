Abstract
--------
We used data on age and sex for 136 laboratory confirmed human A(H7N9) cases reported as of 11 Aug 2013 to compare age-specific and sex-specific patterns of morbidity and mortality from the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus with those of the avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. Human A(H7N9) cases exhibit high degrees of age and sex bias: mortality is heavily biased toward males older than 50 years, no deaths have been reported among individuals younger than 25 years old, and relatively few cases documented among children or adolescents. The proportion of fatal cases (PFC) for human A(H7N9) cases as of 11 Aug 2013 was 32 percent, compared to a cumulative PFC for A(H5N1) of 83 percent in Indonesia and 36 percent in Egypt. Approximately 75 percent of cases of all A(H7N9) cases occurred among individuals older than 45 years old.

Morbidity and mortality from A(H7N9) are lowest among individuals between 10 and 29 years, the age group which exhibits the highest cumulative morbidity and case fatality rates from A(H5N1). Although individuals younger than 20 years old comprise nearly 50 percent of all human A(H5N1) cases, only 7 percent of all reported A(H7N9) cases and no deaths have been reported among individuals in this age group. Only 4 percent of A(H7N9) cases occurred among children younger than 5 years old, and only one case from the 10 to 20 year age group.

Age- and sex-related differences in morbidity and mortality from emerging zoonotic diseases can provide insights into ecological, economic, and cultural factors that may contribute to the emergence and proliferation of novel zoonotic diseases in human populations.

[This new analysis of age and sex-specific morbidity and mortality in human patients reveals interesting common features of the A/(H5N1) and A/(H7N9) avian influenza virus infections.

Human infections with avian A/(H5N1) have occurred over a period of 10 years and have been reported in 15 countries from Turkey in the West to China in the East. In contrast, so far, avian influenza A/(H7N9) human infections has been restricted to China (and a single case in Taiwan) during the current influenza season. Fortunately so far neither of these 2 avian influenza viruses has developed potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. But it cannot be assumed the this situation will continue. - Mod.CP]
