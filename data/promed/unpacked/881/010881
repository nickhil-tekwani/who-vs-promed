Further comment
---------------
Prior vaccination is usually the key to preventing these outbreaks so
let's not forget that we still have much work to be done. But it
would be useful to learn whether any of the individuals who acquired
hepatitis B, and especially those who died, had received a verifiable
series of the HBsAg vaccine. Without knowing the denominator of those
infected, the true infection-to-mortality rate remains unknown, but
from what data is available, the high mortality rate in this outbreak
is unusual (in the US, approximately 1 percent among icteric
hospitalized patients) as stated by Dr. Echevarria [see: Hepatitis B
virus - India (09): (GJ), recycled medical waste 20090313.1042]. In
2004, the CDC reported an outbreak of hepatitis B in injection drug
abusers with a mortality rate from fulminant hepatitis approaching 50
percent and noted several variables that might be associated
(acetaminophen, alcohol, genotype, etc).

[From the comments received it is clear that more basic information
is required for the proper understanding of this outbreak and its
implications for global health care. Hopefully the Gujarat Medical
Authorities will respond accordingly. - Mod.CP]
