Current status of cholera in the PAHO Region
--------------------------------------------
In Cuba, health authorities continue to investigate suspected cholera cases detected in several provinces. Since 24 Aug 2013, the International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point of Cuba has not reported additional confirmed cholera cases. Between epidemiological week (EW) 27 [1-7 Jul] of 2012 and EW 34 [18-24 Aug] of 2013, there have been 678 confirmed cholera cases, including 3 deaths.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 45 [8 Nov] of 2013, there have been a total of 31 206 suspected cholera cases, of which 462 died. Between EW 41 and EW 45 [6 Oct-9 Nov 2013], 116 additional suspected cholera cases were reported and 4 deaths. During the last 2 weeks, 12 of 32 provinces have registered suspected cholera cases; the provinces of Azua, Distrito Nacional, Puerto Plata, San Cristobal, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and La Vega account for 92 per cent of the suspected cases during these 2 weeks. In the past 2 EWs [3-16 Nov 2013] an increase in the number of the suspected cases has been recorded, this increase happened after the decline seen from EW 41 [6-12 Oct] of 2013 (see figure 1 [for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]) The fatality rate recorded in 2013 (2.2 per cent) continues to be higher than the fatality rate recorded in 2011 (1.7 per cent) and in 2012 (0.8 per cent). Health authorities continue to implement corresponding response measures.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) and until 13 Nov 2013, there have been 689 448 cholera cases, of which 384 956 were hospitalized (55.8 per cent) and 8448 died. The cumulative case fatality rate remains 1.2 per cent, with variations ranging from 4.4 per cent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 per cent, in Port-au-Prince. An increasing trend in cases has been noted in the last 2 weeks. Since the 26 Oct 2013 Epidemiological Update on cholera, there have been 5363 additional cases and 87 deaths reported nationally; with all departments registering new cases.

In Mexico, from 9 Sep 2013 to 15 Nov 2013, the IHR National Focal Point of Mexico has reported a total of 180 confirmed cases of infection with toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa, including 1 death, identified from more than 37 000 samples analyzed. Between 25 Oct 2013 and 8 Nov 2013, the authorities of Mexico had reported 4 new cases, 2 in the state of Hidalgo and 2 in the state of Veracruz. From 9 Nov 2013 to date, no additional confirmed cases have been reported. The health authorities of Mexico continue to work on surveillance, human resources training in health facilities and awareness, as mentioned in previous updates.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied with respect to this event.
