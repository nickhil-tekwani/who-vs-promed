Follow-up report No. 1
See also: 30 Jan 2004
Information received on 1 Mar 2004 from Mr Rafaqat Hussain Raja, Animal
Husbandry Commissioner, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Islamabad:
End of previous report period: 27 Jan 2004 (see Disease Information, 17
[5], 24, dated 30 Jan 2004).
End of this report period: 6 Feb 2004.
Location of the outbreaks: the outbreaks were reported at Poultry Estates 1
& 2, Korangi, Karachi, and in adjacent areas of Angara Goth, Karachi.
Description of affected population in the outbreaks: chiefly layers and
molting flocks.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
avi / 6 300 000 / 20 000 / approx. 10 000* / ... / 0

Causal agent: national laboratories isolated H7 and H9 strains of avian
influenza virus. The OIE Reference Laboratory in Weybridge, United Kingdom,
confirmed H7 strain.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the avian influenza virus was
probably introduced by wild migratory birds/waterfowl. Epidemiological
investigations to confirm this supposition are being launched.
B. Mode of spread: the widespread nature of the infection was due to
improper/careless handling and disposal of dead poultry.
C. Other epidemiological details: no case of human infection has been
reported from anywhere in the country.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Imposition of a temporary ban on the import of poultry and poultry
products of any kind from avian influenza-infected countries or from
countries where the disease is suspected.
- A committee comprised of officials from the Ministry of Health, the
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, and the National Institute of
Health, has been constituted and is constantly monitoring and reviewing the
situation.
- All the remaining birds at affected farms have been quarantined and
vaccinated using H7 and H9 strains of avian influenza virus.
- Zoosanitary measures have been instituted and inter-provincial movements
of poultry and their products have been restricted.
- Control of wildlife reservoirs in poultry farms.
- Zoning.
- The Livestock Department of Sindh province has been further investigating
the area of origin of infection.
- International assistance for control of avian influenza was requested.
The FAO(1) Office accordingly extended emergency assistance to Pakistan.
