_Salmonella enteritidis_ in the USA
----------------------------------
A cluster of _Salmonella enteritidis_ (SE) cases marked by a
distinctive pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern has been
identified in the USA and traced to consumption of natural raw
almonds.
To date, 32 cases have been identified with onsets between Mar 2003
and Apr 2004. These almonds (from Paramount Farms, California, USA)
were sold across the USA under several brands and exported to China,
Province of Taiwan, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico and the UK.
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recalled the
product and notified those countries who received the almonds. (For
more information, see the FDA web site <http://www.fda.gov/>).
Several USA health authorities are involved in the ongoing
investigations.
Salmonellosis outbreaks linked to almonds are rare and have only been
associated with almonds consumed in their raw state, without further
processing.
