Pseudomonas Bloodstream Infections - Heparin/Saline Flush - MO, NY,
TX, and MI, 2004-05
--------------------------------------------------
On 26 Jan 2005, CDC was notified of 4 cases of _Pseudomonas
fluorescens_ bloodstream infection among patients at an oncology
clinic in Missouri. All patients had received a heparin/saline flush
to prevent clotting of indwelling central venous catheters. The
flushes were preloaded in syringes by IV Flush and distributed by
Pinnacle Medical Supply (Rowlett, Texas). On 31 Jan 2005, a
nationwide alert against use of all heparin or saline flushes
preloaded in syringes by IV Flush was issued by the FDA; the company
recalled these products. As of 15 Feb 2005, state and local health
departments and CDC had identified a total of 36 _Pseudomonas sp._
infections in patients in 4 states who were administered the
heparin/saline flushes from multiple lots. This report describes the
ongoing investigation and provides recommendations for investigation
and management of potential cases.
Missouri
--------
During 29 Dec 2004 - 1 Feb 2005, a hospital physician diagnosed 9
cases of _P. fluorescens_ infection; 8 were in patients at an
oncology clinic, and 1 was in a patient hospitalized with sickle cell
disease. Median age of the 9 patients was 57 years (range: 32-72
years). Of the 8 patients with cancer, 3 (38 percent) had received
stem-cell transplants within 6 months of infection. All 9 patients
had long-term, indwelling, central venous catheters and had received
heparin/saline flush prepared by IV Flush, usually in 10-mL syringes.
Patients had either fever or fever and chills within 2-26 days after
their catheters were flushed.
Blood cultures drawn through the catheters grew _P. fluorescens_;
simultaneous, peripheral blood cultures did not grow the organism. In
1 patient, a tissue sample from the area surrounding the catheter
grew _P. fluorescens_. In addition, cultures of unopened
heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush grew _P. fluorescens_ in the
laboratory of the hospital. Catheters were removed, and the patients
were treated with intravenous and/or oral antibiotics; all patients
recovered from their infections.
New York
---------
On 4 Feb 2005, a hospital notified the New York City Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOHMH) and the New York State
Department of Health (NYSDOH) of 6 cases of _P. fluorescens_
infections in children with central venous catheters. All 6 patients
had received heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes by IV Flush.
NYSDOH and NYCDOHMH immediately alerted providers and laboratories
and asked them to perform surveillance for cases of bacteremia or
sepsis with _P. fluorescens_ and to submit isolates to their public
health laboratories for confirmation and molecular typing.
Surveillance of cases during 13 Dec 2004 -8 Feb 2005 resulted in
identification of 12 cases of _P. fluorescens_ infections. All 12
patients were children; median age was 9 years (range: 8 months-18
years). All 12 had long-term, indwelling, central venous catheters
and had been administered heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes
by IV Flush. Blood cultures were obtained through the catheters in 10!
patients (83 percent) and from peripheral sites in 3 patients (25
percent). Of the 12 patients, 10 (83 percent) had cancer, 1 had
cystic fibrosis, and 1 had an X-linked immunodysregulatory disease.
All the patients had fever, and 3 (25 percent) had hypotension. 9 (75
percent) were admitted to the hospital for treatment with intravenous
antibiotics, and one required admission to the intensive care unit
for management of hypotension; 7 (58 percent) had recurring febrile
episodes. All 12 patients were treated with antibiotics; 6 (50
percent) patients also required catheter removal. All 12 patients
recovered. Cultures of unopened heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush
grew _P. fluorescens_ in the New York State Public Health Laboratory.
Texas
------
During 12 Dec 2004 - 5 Feb 2005, physicians diagnosed 14
_Pseudomonas_ species bloodstream infections (11 _P. fluorescens_ and
3 unknown _Pseudomonas_ species) among patients in one hospital. The
14 patients had been admitted for various conditions, including
seizure, colon cancer, pneumonia, urinary-tract infection, and
sepsis. Median age of the patients was 50 years (range: 16 days-86
years). All patients had either short- or long-term, indwelling,
central venous catheters and had received heparin/saline flush
prepared by IV Flush. In all cases, the _Pseudomonas_ species were
recovered from peripheral blood cultures. All patients had fever
during their hospital stays; all were treated with intravenous
antibiotics, and peripherally inserted central catheters and central
venous lines were removed. 13 (93 percent) of the patients recovered;
1 infant remained hospitalized as of 22 Mar 2005, but the continued
hospitalization was not related to the infection. Cultures of
unopened !
heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush grew _P. fluorescens_ in the
hospital laboratory. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) testing
at the Texas State Public Health Laboratory revealed that isolates
from 8 patients and an unopened heparin/saline syringe from IV Flush
were indistinguishable by 1 enzyme.
Michigan
--------
In Jan 2005, a patient with a chronic, indwelling, central venous
catheter had onset of chills and fever several hours after the
catheter had been used during a surgical procedure. The patient had
received a heparin/saline flush, prepared by IV Flush, at a local
clinic during the preceding week. Blood cultures were obtained
through the catheter and grew _P. fluorescens_. The patient was
treated with antibiotics and recovered.
Investigation of IV Flush
-------------------------
A trace-back investigation by state and local health departments and
CDC determined that IV Flush was the source of the heparin/saline
flush administered in preloaded syringes to all patients with _P.
fluorescens_ infections. To produce its heparin/saline flush, IV
Flush ordered heparin powder and sent it to a compounding pharmacy,
where a concentrated heparin solution was made. This concentrated
solution was then returned to IV Flush, where it was added to bags of
saline solution, from which the syringes were filled. Sterility
testing of the concentrated heparin solution by IV Flush was
reportedly not performed. After discovering that the heparin/saline
flush was contaminated, the physician in Missouri informed IV Flush
and the Missouri State Department of Health and Senior Services. The
state health department notified CDC, which notified FDA, and IV
Flush subsequently initiated a nationwide recall. On 31 Jan 2005, FDA
issued an alert against use of the flush and subsequentl!
y issued an updated alert on 4 Feb (1).
Samples of unopened heparin/saline flush syringes were sent to CDC,
where bacterial cultures of 7 of 9 lots grew _P. fluorescens_. CDC
also plans to conduct PFGE tests on isolates from all 4 states; as of
22 Mar 2005, the only molecular typing results were from the Texas
State Public Health Laboratory. Information obtained by FDA indicated
that the heparin/saline flush might have been distributed to
locations in as many as 17 states during the preceding year. CDC
continues to work with state and local health departments and FDA to
ensure that heparin/saline syringes from IV Flush are no longer in
use in these locations and to search for additional cases.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The findings from this ongoing investigation indicate that
heparin/saline flush, preloaded in syringes by IV Flush, was
contaminated with _P. fluorescens_ during commercial preparation and
administered to multiple patients in at least 4 states. Exposure to
the contaminated flush has been associated with infections in 36
patients; additional potential cases are under investigation. Most of
the patients had serious underlying medical conditions and
subsequently had bloodstream infections; many required
hospitalization and surgical removal of long-term, indwelling,
catheters. CDC, FDA, and state and local health departments continue
their efforts to ensure that the recalled syringes are no longer
being used.
_P. fluorescens_ is a member of the fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria
group and is an infrequent cause of blood stream infections. Optimal
temperature range for growing the organism is 77 degrees F to 86
degrees F (25 degrees C - 30 degrees C); _P. fluorescens_ can be
difficult to grow when samples are incubated at 98.6 degrees F (37
degrees C), the temperature at which most bacterial cultures are
incubated in hospital microbiology laboratories (2). Depending on
laboratory capabilities, identification of _P. fluorescens_ can be
difficult; therefore, patients who received the heparin/saline flush
and were infected with unidentified _Pseudomonas_ species were
included in the case count in this report.
FDA is investigating the source of contamination in this outbreak,
which might have occurred either at IV Flush or at the compounding
pharmacy that prepared the heparin solution. Preparation of drug
products to fill prescriptions for specifically designated patients
is considered pharmaceutical compounding, not manufacturing. However,
companies that prepare products not requested by a prescription are
considered manufacturers and should follow requirements set forth by
FDA regulations on good manufacturing practices (3). These
regulations help ensure the sterility of products intended for
injection and include requirements for measures such as validation of
sterilization techniques and sterility testing of finished products.
In this case, sterility testing of the finished product was
reportedly not performed. Had it been done, the contamination that
led to this outbreak might have been detected before the product was
distributed.
Contaminated products prepared in compounding pharmacies have also
been implicated in previous clusters of infections, including
_Exophiala dermatiditis_ joint infections caused by injectable
steroids (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5149a1.htm> );
_Chryseomonas_ and _Serratia_ species infections, resulting in
meningitis from epidural injections (CDC, unpublished data, 2002;
Contra Costa Health Services, unpublished data, 2002); and
_Burkholderia cepacia_ blood stream infections from intravenous flush
(CDC, unpublished data, 2004). Regulatory oversight of compounding
pharmacies varies among states. However, compounding pharmacies are
subject to inspection by pharmacy boards, FDA, and accreditation
organizations. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists and
the U.S. Pharmacopeia have developed guidance and standards that
address quality assurance and sterile preparation of compounded
products (5, 6). In addition, in May 2004, the Pharmacy Compounding
Accreditation Board (PCAB) established a task force to set standards
for a voluntary accreditation board for compounding pharmacies (7).
Companies that manufacture products intended for injection should
follow FDA regulations for ensuring the sterility of these products
(3). Health-care providers who detect cases of _Pseudomonas_ species
infection in patients with central venous catheters are urged to
determine whether their patients received the heparin/saline flush
recalled by IV Flush. Although the product has been recalled, cases
have occurred up to 1 month after receipt of the product. Indwelling,
intravenous catheters that are used infrequently can become colonized
with organisms in a biofilm, and symptoms might not develop until the
catheter is used. Susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from
the 36 identified patients have varied, with multiple isolates
resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenem
antibiotics. Treatment for potential patients should include targeted
antimicrobial therapy and consideration of removing their catheters
(8). In addition, cases that might be related to use of this product
should be reported to state and local health departments, CDC, and
the FDA MedWatch program
