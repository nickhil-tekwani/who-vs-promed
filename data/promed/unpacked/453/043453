Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Death in Alberta
----------------------------------------------
A regional health official has [issued a new warning for farmers in the
Peace region following the recent death of a 22-year-old High Prairie man
as a result of [a hantavirus infection. Dr. Paul Schnee, medical officer
of the Keeweetinok Lakes Regional Health Authority, says the farmer came
into contact with mouse droppings on 2 occasions; the first in an attic of
an old house, the second in a vacant house trailer, about 2 weeks before
displaying any symptoms. [About 2 weeks is the usual incubation period for
[a hantavirus infection. Schnee stated that the man began suffering
"classic hantavirus symptoms" [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, including
vomiting and diarrhea, before being treated in High Prairie Hospital for
shortness of breath. Schnee says the man's condition began deteriorating
rapidly and he was sent immediately to the University of Alberta Hospital
where doctors reported they could not revive the patient.
This fatality, says Schnee, should serve to warn farmers in the area that a
hantavirus infection does not selectively affect only those in imperfect
health, or the elderly. "It can affect anyone at any age, the youngest I'm
aware of was 16 years old," says Schnee. "All that is required is to be the
unfortunate person to come in contact with [a virulent hantavirus." Schnee
added that even although Alberta has the highest number of
[hantavirus-associated deaths of any province, at one or 2 deaths per
year, the chance of [a fatality from this cause is still [low. Part of
the problem, says Schnee, is that the [initial symptoms of [a hantavirus
infection are similar to those of influenza and treatment is not sought
until it is too late. "The message I try to get out is if you've got
flu-like symptoms and you're having difficulty breathing and it's getting
worse, and you can think back to possibly coming in contact with deer mice
a couple of weeks back, there's a lot better chance of getting to the
[University of Alberta Hospital in time if doctors have that knowledge."
Schnee said that the recent death should also be a warning to farmers that
hantavirus can be a threat at any time of the year. "We tend to think of
this as a threat in the spring when farmers are moving a lot more grain
around and cleaning out their bins. But it can happen anytime. I know of
one case where a woman just went to get her skates in the middle of winter
and there were mouse droppings in the skates and she came down with it."
Despite the High Prairie tragedy, Schnee says there is no evidence to
believe there may be a hantavirus scare paralleling the one a few years ago
when there were alarming numbers of deer mice in the province. Deer mice
are distinguishable by their white underbellies and two-tone tails which
are dark on the top and white on the bottom.

[In Canada, the deer mouse is the primary host of Sin Nombre virus, the
hantavirus principally associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.
Hantavirus-infected deer mice have been found in every province of Canada
except Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, the Northwest Territories, and
Nunavut. However, only limited numbers of deer mice from Prince Edward
Island, Nova Scotia, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have been
tested. Other hantaviruses have been identified in other rodent hosts, such
as Prospect Hill virus in meadow voles, but none of these have been
associated with human disease. Recent studies have shown a significant
degree of genetic diversity among Sin Nombre-related hantaviruses across
Canada, and molecular epidemiology may improve understanding of the factors
associated with hantavirus infection. Although cases of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome have been confined to the western provinces, the
presence of infected deer mice in eastern Canada suggests that the
potential for human disease exists across the country. Prevention of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome can best be achieved through education of the
general public on the risks associated with exposure to rodents and their
excreta and adoption of appropriate preventive practices. - Mod.CP
