Portugal's cabinet issued a decree on Thursday banning the use of suspect
animal feed in the food chain in order to halt BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy). A government statement was quoted as saying, "This diploma
bans the entry, in any form, into the human and animal food chain... of
materials at risk from cattle, sheep and goats."
Portugal joins France and Britain as the only countries in the EU that have
so far formally banned the use of potentially harmful animal feed in the
animal food chain. Portuguese Agriculture Minister Fernando Gomes da Silva
said a long incubation period of some six years explained the latest surge
in cases and blamed the previous Social Democrat government for failing to
take adequate steps to stop the spread of the disease.
President Jorge Sampaio on Tuesday urged strict compliance with checks to
prevent the spread of mad cow disease in Portugal and to avoid panic in the
population, adding, "I expect the number of cases (of BSE) to increase until
the year 2000 and then fall. It is important that all sanitary steps are
taken so that there is no alarmism."

[I checked on back material in THE NEWS, Portugal's National
Newspaper in English
<http://www.nexus-pt.com/news/stories/b5cows.htm>
and found the following report. Please take note of the caveats.
Anyone intracerebrally injecting material into the bovine head would
either have to wait some years for BSE to develop if it were BSE
tissue or pray to fool the pathologists if it were chemicals. Either
way a very poor bet - Mod.MHJ

Mad Cow Fraud
--------------------
To date ninety cases of BSE have been detected in Portugal, although
thousands of animals have been destroyed when they have had contact with an
infected animal.
Government compensation is given to breeders whenever an
animal is found to be suffering from a contagious disease, and has to be
destroyed as a result. But the amounts of the compensation are considerably
less though than in the case of BSE infected animals, as the policy of the
Government has been to encourage farmers to come forward, and not hide the
fact that they might have an infected animal in their herd. This could
encourage unscrupulous people to artificially imitate the symptoms of BSE by
injecting a beast with substances directly into its brain. A farmer buying
such an animal in the belief that he was buying a BSE infected one, with the
aim of defrauding the Government, would come unstuck very quickly as
veterinary experts can easily detect when a cow really is mad.
