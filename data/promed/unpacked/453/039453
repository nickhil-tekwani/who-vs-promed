A vaccine campaign has been launched in response to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] exacerbated by drought conditions in Kampong Thom province, officials said yesterday [3 May 2016], as drought-relief efforts continued in Banteay Meanchey.

Chan Panhavoan, director of the veterinary office of the Kampong Thom provincial agriculture department, said yesterday [3 May 2016] that the highly contagious virus had spread among cattle and buffalo in mid-March 2016 and was brought on by the high temperatures that have dried up lakes, rivers and ponds.

The scarcity of water sources increases contact between livestock susceptible to the disease and animals carrying the virus, leading to outbreaks.

"Cattle in 4 districts -- Sandan, Prasat Sambor, Stoung and Kampong Svay -- are faced with this disease," he said, adding that so far, 300 animals have died.

According to Panhavoan, roughly 1641 animals in Kampong Thom have been vaccinated so far, with a target of 2000 necessary to contain the outbreak.

[FMD is endemic in Cambodia, which belongs to the FMD pool 1 (South-east Asia/Central Asia/East Asia). The other countries in this pool are China (People's Rep. of), China (Hong Kong, SAR), China (Taiwan Province), Korea (DPR), Korea (Rep. of), Laos PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Russian Federation, Thailand and Viet Nam.

According to recent EUFMD information, the circulating FMD viral lineages in Pool 1 per 2015 were:
Serotype O: O/SEA/Mya-98, O/ME-SA/PanAsia, O/CATHAY, O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d,
Serotype A: A/ASIA/Sea-97 and Iran-05SIS 10 sublineages
Serotype Asia-1 had not been detected in the region since 2005 (Myanmar) and 2006 (China (People's Rep. of) and Viet Nam).

Cambodia reported during 2015 the circulation of FMD virus serotypes O and A. For Cambodia's monthly reports to the regional SEACFMD (The South-East Asia and China Foot and Mouth Disease) campaign, per serotype (and untyped), please go to http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd. - Mod.AS
