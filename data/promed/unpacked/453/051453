Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus causes serious inflammation of the brain in people and fertility problems in pigs. Mosquitoes were previously the only known transmission route. However, the virus can also be spread from pig to pig by direct contact, and this could enable it to circulate in pigs during the mosquito-free winter season.

The JE virus is the main cause of serious encephalitis in people in Asia. The virus is found in large parts of Southeast Asia and is now also widespread in India. It circulates between birds and mosquitoes and between pigs and mosquitoes, and is passed to humans through mosquito bites. In children in particular, infection can lead to acute encephalitis and permanent impairment or even death.

In pigs, the main effect of the virus alongside fever and encephalitis is fertility problems. The virus is closely related to the West Nile, Zika and dengue viruses. All are transmitted by mosquitoes and are flaviviruses, which cause serious illness in humans and animals.

Previously, the only known transmission route for JE viruses was mosquitoes. A team of researchers from the Institute of Virology and Immunology and the University Bern at the Vetsuisse Faculty led by Dr. Meret Ricklin and Prof Artur Summerfield have now shown that JE viruses can also be passed directly from pig to pig. The study has just been published in the journal Nature Communications.

Up to now, there had been no explanation for how the JE virus could survive over winter in regions such as the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, and cause new outbreaks the following year. Outbreaks in some cases occurred on the same farms as in the previous year, despite the fact that no infected mosquitoes could be found in the area. In Taiwan, too, pigs were infected with JE viruses during the winter, but no infected mosquitoes found.

As the researchers have now been able to show, infected pigs discharge the virus in their saliva for several days, and the animals are also susceptible to infection through the mouth or nose with very low doses of the virus. In pigs -- as in humans -- the virus was found to spread through the brain and cause inflammation. The virus was, however, found to grow most in the tonsils, where it was detectable for several weeks or even months. The authors suggest that JE viruses could possibly circulate in pigs and survive for up to months. When the virus is secreted again, for example as a result of a different infection that weakens the immune system, a new infection cycle could then begin. However, the researchers say that further studies are needed to prove this link.

The study published shows that even for viruses that are spread by insect bites, direct transmission through animal to animal contact cannot be ruled out. "This means that the virus could circulate within the pig population without mosquitoes, and thus spread even to regions with a temperate climate", says Artur Summerfield. This would theoretically also mean a higher risk to humans. A vaccine is, however, available for both people and animals. The virus has to date only occurred in Europe in travellers returning from Asia and in those cases did not lead to any further infections.

The Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) with sites at Mittelhausern and Bern is the Swiss reference laboratory for the diagnosis, surveillance and control of highly infectious animal diseases. IVI is part of the Swiss Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO).

As part of cooperation with the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Bern, the IVI is responsible for teaching and research in the field of virology and immunology. Research activities include both basic and applied research, and provide an important basis for the control of animal diseases and zoonoses (infectious diseases that can be spread between humans and animals).

[The abstract of the paper mentioned above is the following:

"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a main cause of severe viral encephalitis in humans, has a complex ecology, composed of a cycle involving primarily waterbirds and mosquitoes, as well as a cycle involving pigs as amplifying hosts. To date, JEV transmission has been exclusively described as being mosquito-mediated. Here we demonstrate that JEV can be transmitted between pigs in the absence of arthropod vectors. Pigs shed virus in oronasal secretions and are highly susceptible to oronasal infection. Clinical symptoms, virus tropism and central nervous system histological lesions are similar in pigs infected through needle, contact or oronasal inoculation. In all cases, a particularly important site of replication are the tonsils, in which JEV is found to persist for at least 25 days despite the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Our findings could have a major impact on the ecology of JEV in temperate regions with short mosquito seasons."

Another recent paper by the same team has addressed specifically the JEV tropism mentioned above:

Abstract:
"Pigs are considered to be the main amplifying host for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and their infection can correlate with human cases of disease. Despite their importance in the ecology of the virus as it relates to human cases of encephalitis, the pathogenesis of JEV in pigs remains obscure. In the present study, the localization and kinetics of virus replication were investigated in various tissues after experimental intravenous infection of pigs. The data demonstrate a rapid and broad spreading of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) and various other organs. A particular tropism of JEV in pigs not only to the CNS but also for secondary lymphoid tissue, in particular the tonsils with the overall highest viral loads, was observed. In this organ, even 11 days post infection, the latest time point of the experiment, no apparent decrease in viral RNA loads and live virus was found despite the presence of a neutralizing antibody response. This was also well beyond the clinical and viremic phase. These results are of significance for the pathogenesis of JEV, and call for further experimental studies focusing on the cellular source and duration of virus replication in pigs."

The following summary is derived from chapter 2.1.7 "Japanese encephalitis" of OIE's Manual (available, with extensive additional information, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.07_JEV.pdf).

"1. Definition of the disease: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae and causes encephalitis, principally in horses and humans. JEV also infects pigs where it causes abortions and stillbirths. JEV is maintained in nature between mosquitoes and pigs. The major vector of JEV is a culicine mosquito, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_. Pigs act as important amplifiers of the virus, and birds can also be involved in its amplification and spread in the environment. The disease has been observed in large parts of Asia and recently in the western Pacific region.

"2. Description of disease: In horses, the infection is usually inapparent. Affected horses show clinical signs that include pyrexia, depression, muscle tremors, and ataxia. In pigs, abortions and stillbirths can occur when pregnant sows are infected with JEV for the 1st time. Infected pregnant sows usually show no clinical signs.

"3. Identification of the agent: For virus isolation, brain material is collected from sick or dead horses that have demonstrated the clinical signs of encephalitis. Isolation procedures include the inoculation of mice and cell cultures. A suspension of brain tissue is inoculated intracerebrally into 2-4-day-old mice. If the mice show neurological signs followed by death within 14 days, then virus identification can be carried out by cell culture. The virus can also be isolated in primary cell cultures made from chicken embryos, porcine or hamster kidney cells and established cell lines such as African green monkey kidney (Vero), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), or mosquito (C6/36) cells. Identification of the virus isolated in mice or in tissue cultures is confirmed by serological or nucleic acid detection methods such as reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay.

"4. Serological tests: Antibody assay is a useful technique for determining the prevalence of infection in a horse population, and also for diagnosing Japanese encephalitis in diseased individuals. The assay methods include virus neutralisation (VN), haemagglutination inhibition (HI), complement fixation (CF), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There is serological cross reactivity with other flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus, which can confuse the diagnosis. The plaque reduction VN test is the most specific and can be used to differentiate JEV infection from other flavivirus infections. Because of the cross-neutralisation within the Japanese encephalitis serocomplex, diagnosis by serology should be confirmed, preferably by virus isolation.

"5. Requirements for vaccines: Two types of vaccines are commercially available in several Asian countries for humans and animals. For horses, inactivated vaccines prepared from infected mouse brains or in cell cultures have been used. For pigs, inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are available."

Please note that the above OIE review was last updated in 2010; the reference to the virus transmission by vectors may be subject to discussion in view of the current research results, suggesting direct transmission in pigs. - Mod.AS]
