A strange disease has broken out in West Nile region claiming 4 lives and sending 64 to hospitals. Obongi County MP [Member of Parliament] Fungaroo Caps, while addressing the press at Parliament today [28 Apr 2014], said the disease has symptoms of Ebola and cholera though not yet confirmed.

"It is a contagious disease which kills very fast. Moyo district is the most affected, and particularly Obongi county," Fungaroo added. The health centre of Obongi is already congested as more patients continue to flock in. "Tents are immediately required since patients are on the open veranda."

The disease reportedly broke out on Saturday [26 Apr 2014], and the Ministry of Health was alerted, but nothing has been done so far. "We call upon all charity organizations and other NGOs to quickly help us," Fungaroo appealed. He further observed that there is no proper treatment being given to the soaring numbers of patients apart from simple dehydration interventions.

"Women are the most affected, especially in Aliba and Imara sub-counties. Worse still, there is no ambulance on the ground."

People are being transported on boda bodas [motorcycle taxis] instead, which has caused more infections [of the drivers].

[We thank Jonathan for this report. He added that television broadcasts said that tests for cholera were negative.

The WHO Factsheets say:
- Cholera has a short incubation period, from less than one day to 5 days, and produces an enterotoxin that causes a copious, painless, watery diarrhoea that can quickly lead to severe dehydration and death if treatment is not promptly given. Vomiting also occurs in most patients.

- Ebolavirus disease (EVD) has an incubation period of from 2-21 days. It is a severe acute viral illness often characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.

The difference in the diarrhoea is that with cholera it is watery, clear and much more frequent than with EVD.

The Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) -- where I worked 50 years ago, when it was the East African Virus Research Institute -- has the reagents to test for both ebolaviruses and Marburg virus. But West Nile district is quite remote from the capital, Kampala and the UVRI. The West Nile district (now a region containing several districts) was where the 1st isolation of West Nile virus (WNV) was made from a fever patient. WNV causes a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Cholera and Ebola do not cause joint pains.

We would be glad to receive any follow-up reports. We received follow-up to only one of the 5 outbreaks listed below; we would still like to know what those were due to. - Mod.JW
