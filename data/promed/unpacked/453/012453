Public health figures revealed this week that there have been 6 cases of measles in Central Beds between January and May [2013] -- compared to zero in Bedford and Luton. The figures were released by Public Health England to encourage parents to make sure their child has been vaccinated against the highly-infectious disease.

"Thanks to the hard work of local health teams we are making good progress towards the 95 per cent target, but there still remains a large number of 10-16 year olds, together with many younger children and adults who are under-vaccinated. The programme will continue until we reach as many children as possible in the age groups most affected. If your child has not had 2 doses of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine, the upcoming summer holiday is a good time to contact your GP."

Director of public health Muriel Scot said: "We're actively working across all schools to promote the importance of the MMR Programme and have written to schools to raise awareness and to increase uptake. The local programme in Bedfordshire for all 10-16 year olds runs via local GPs so we are encouraging all parents to make an appointment for their child to have a free vaccination."

Measles cases continue to rise in Gloucestershire, with further cases reported in May [2013]. Figures released by Public Health England (PHE) last week show a further 4 cases of the infectious disease were recorded in May [2013] on top of 58 cases from January to April this year [2013]. The figures show that a total of 62 cases have been recorded so far this year compared to just 3 for the same period last year [2012]. Dr Shona Arora, PHE director for Gloucestershire, said: "Measles is a highly infectious and unpleasant disease that can lead to very serious complications. Children who have not had the MMR vaccine are at high risk of catching the disease. "If your child has not had the MMR vaccine, the upcoming summer holidays is a good time to contact your GP to get them vaccinated." Gloucestershire County Council is supporting PHE's national catch-up campaign.

Parents are being urged to make sure their children are immunised against measles, as the latest figures reveal that the number of confirmed cases in Lancashire so far this year [2013] have exceeded the total number of cases during the whole of 2012. Since January this year, health chiefs have had more than 350 notifications of measles and up until the end of June, there were 96 confirmed cases. This is higher than the 92 cases that affected people in Lancashire during the whole of last year [2012].

Lancashire County Council has launched a new campaign to make parents aware that one in 10 children are at risk of measles because they are not fully immunised. Aimed at parents of children aged between 10 and 16, and the children themselves, the campaign is aiming to ensure children who missed out on the full, 2-dose MMR vaccine get the full protection of immunisation now.

County Coun Azhar Ali, cabinet member for health and wellbeing, said: "Measles is a highly infectious disease that can be very serious, leading to ear infections, fits, brain damage and even death. "Since January this year [2013], there have been more than 350 notifications of measles in Lancashire, with children aged 10 to 16 most affected. Through this campaign we are urging parents and children to make sure they get the full benefits of vaccination by visiting their local GP. "If people can't remember how many doses they have had, their GP will have a record. Don't take any risks with your child's health -- get them vaccinated now." Through the campaign, information will be sent to all parents of secondary school pupils and primary school pupils in years 5 and 6.

As many as 882 cases of measles were reported in Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) during the first 6 months of this year [2013] and the number is going to increase, according to health experts, as no proper catch-up activity was conducted to target the children who missed routine immunisation. Besides, the door-to-door vaccination campaign to combat the disease has also been delayed. The hospital reported 128 admissions to the hospital and confirmed 6 deaths till June [2013]. The data shows that over 50 per cent of patients had been vaccinated against the disease [but] still they contracted the disease while many reported cases were unvaccinated.

The hospital recorded the cases from areas of Islamabad city, Bara Kahu, Alipur, Bari Imam, Rawalpindi, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Murree, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan. The majority of the cases are reported from slums and rural areas where coverage of routine immunisation is low, according to the officials of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI).

According to health officials, Pakistan is a measles endemic country [since] immunity levels in children and routine immunisation levels are also very low, so catch-up activity to vaccinate the default children who missed the routine immunisation and door-to-door campaign is crucial. Initially, the Capital [Islamabad] administration was in denial and was not ready to accept that there was an outbreak of the disease, but after accepting it too late, they failed to take any proper measures to combat the disease, [according to] health experts.

Health experts and officials of the capital administration at a meeting on 8 Jan 2013 had decided to vaccinate children up to the age of 15 years in Islamabad's small communities where measles cases were being reported. But due to weak health infrastructure there has been no micro-plan or massive campaigns to vaccinate the children against the disease. According to officials, nearly 30 per cent of children missed immunisation as health units of Capital Administration Development (CDA) and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) lack staff and infrastructure to carry out the campaigns. The population of the capital has increased from 300 000 to about 1.5 million but the number of staff and resources are still the same as they were before when the city was established. And the successive CDA chairmen and the Islamabad commissioners did not plan to invest in the health sector and other areas that directly affect health of the public.

Update: 100 measles patients were brought to different hospitals in the province on Tuesday [16 Jul 2013], including 17 in Lahore. So far 22 321 measles cases have been reported from across the province including 5791 in Lahore. So far 189 children have lost lives to measles in the province including 86 in Lahore.

A total of 10 more measles cases have been reported in the Holy Family Hospital (HFH) Rawalpindi [Punjab province], while a general rise in measles cases have been witnessed throughout the city. Approximately, 634 measles affected children were brought to HFH, out of whom 435 were admitted and kept in isolation wards. However, only 10 children now remain and are under treatment in the hospital. According to the physician in charge of the Infectious and Disease Ward, Dr Javed Hayat, the recovery period spans up to 14 days but takes longer if the patient is already suffering from another infection.

Doctors claimed that children already vaccinated against measles are not risk-free but their complications are mild compared to those who have not been vaccinated. Dr Hayat advised the parents to get their children vaccinated [in a timely manner] to reduce the risk of complication from the disease.

The health authorities of the Gatineau-Ottawa are asking physicians to be alert to detect any new cases of measles in their patients. A child in Gatineau [Quebec province] had to be treated at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario last week for this viral infection. Some 50 people who have been in contact with the patient have all [been] notified, but the infection could spread further. Symptoms of measles are fever, cough and white spots in the mouth. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with secretions from the nose or throat, especially during coughing and sneezing.

The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a health notice, after dozens of cases of measles were reported in 6 provinces. Officials said so far in 2013, nearly 30 cases of measles were identified in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. The number is high, considering at this point in 2012, 6 cases had been reported.

Public Health Canada said measles can cause blindness, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), or serious respiratory infections, like pneumonia. The illness can also spread easily through contact with a person infected with measles. In addition measles can affect all age groups, and can be prevented by vaccine -- completed in 2 doses. According to health officials, most cases reported so far in 2013 are related to travel so anyone planning to travel to countries where the illness is still common is urged to get both vaccination doses before travelling. While travel restrictions are not in place, travel health notices have been issued for a number of areas in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America -- more information on the notice can be found online [at http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/notices-avis/notices-avis-eng.php?id=98].

Anyone who has travelled to the affected areas and develops the following symptoms: fever, runny nose, drowsiness, irritability, red eyes and/or sensitivity to light, small white spots on the inside of the mouth and throat, or a red blotchy rash that starts on the face 3 to 7 days after the start of symptoms, and then spreads to the rest of the body. Symptoms are treated with medication, as there is no specific treatment for measles, and most people who contract it fully recover.

A confirmed case of measles in Ventura County has health officials emphasizing the importance of immunization against the highly contagious disease that has been mostly eradicated in the US. A European tourist is confirmed to have the disease, the Ventura County Public Health Care Agency said Friday [19 Jul 2013]. Another tourist, also from Europe, is suspected of having the disease.

Symptoms of measles include fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and a rash all over the body. Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing. It is so contagious that any child exposed to the virus who is not immune will likely contract the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Because the virus is so easily spread, anyone with measles-like symptoms should call their doctor's office or clinic before visiting in person so they can be separated from other patients, health officials say.

Measles was declared eliminated from the US in 2000, according to the CDC. About 60 cases of measles are reported yearly in the country. But in 2011, the number of reported cases was higher than usual at 222. Of those patients, nearly 40 percent contracted the virus in other countries. Worldwide, there are about 20 million cases and 164 000 deaths from measles every year. More than half of those deaths occur in India, according to the national health agency.

Children should get 2 doses of a vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella, also known as MRR, the CDC recommends. The 1st dose is administered between the ages of 12 and 15 months; the 2nd dose is given between ages 4 and 6.

A measles outbreak in Brooklyn [New York] this year [2013] shows how easily one of the most contagious diseases leaps hemispheres.

In March [2013], New York City health authorities saw a sudden rise in measles cases in several densely populated Orthodox Jewish communities. The disease quickly spread. Among the 58 measles cases reported thus far, a child contracted pneumonia and 2 pregnant women were hospitalized, according to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. One of the women had a miscarriage. The department traced the outbreak to a person who it concluded brought the virus from a trip to London, says Jay Varma, the department's deputy commissioner for disease control. Overall, vaccination rates are high in the communities, he says, but the outbreak then started in a small group of families with members who refused vaccines, he says.

New York State Senator Simcha Felder, whose district was affected by the outbreak, cites large families as well as close quarters in school and Orthodox synagogues. "If you add up all the pieces, it makes sense once there's one or 2 people [with measles] that it spreads like wildfire," he said. "There's a unified effort by rabbis, synagogues, schools" and community leaders such as himself, he said, to make sure they're vaccinated. "We're getting the word out."

While measles no longer circulates freely in the US, health authorities still battle outbreaks. All states require that children receive vaccinations before attending school, with some exceptions for medical reasons. But many states grant religious or philosophical exemptions, creating pockets of vulnerability. Some of these communities have become tinderboxes for measles. "Measles has a real knack for finding people who aren't vaccinated," said Gregory Wallace, a measles expert at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Health authorities say vaccination rates of around 95 percent are needed to prevent outbreaks.

A total of 2 measles cases were reported in Western Washington this week, and public health officials are warning people to take steps to avoid an infection. Siblings, an adult and a child, were diagnosed with measles -- and authorities said they were in several public locations during the time that they were contagious. It's believed they contracted measles outside Washington State. Those 2 cases confirmed Wednesday [17 Jul 2013] are unrelated to the measles case in a Sea-Tac International Airport traveler in early July [2013]. Measles is a highly contagious and potentially severe disease that causes fever, rash, cough, and red, watery eyes. It is mainly spread through the air after a person with measles coughs or sneezes.

Here are tips from Public Health (Seattle and King County): What to do if you were in locations of potential measles exposure. Because most people in our area have immunity to the measles through vaccination, the risk to the general public is low. In addition, outdoor exposure locations carry lower risk. However, all people who were in the following locations around the same time as the 2 individuals with measles should:
- Find out if they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously.
- Call a health care provider promptly if they develop an illness with fever or illness with an unexplained rash between [16 July 2013] and [8 Aug 2013]. To avoid possibly spreading measles to other patients, do not go to a clinic or hospital without calling 1st to tell them you want to be evaluated for measles.

Locations of potential exposure to measles: Before receiving the measles diagnosis, the 2 contagious individuals were in locations in the community where other people might have been exposed. Anyone who was at the following sites during the following times was possibly exposed to measles:
- Mercerdale Park, 77th SE & SE 32nd, Mercer Island (9 Jul 2013: 6pm-10pm)
- Ken's Market, 7231 Greenwood Ave N, Seattle (10 Jul 2013: 11am-2pm)
- Spud Fish and Chips, 9702 NE Juanita Dr, Kirkland (10 Jul 2013: 2pm-5pm)
- Quality Food Center (QFC), 211 Parkplace Center, Kirkland (10 Jul 2013: 3pm-6pm)
- Quality Food Center (QFC), 7823 SE 28th St., Mercer Island (10 Jul 2013: 7pm-10pm and July 15, 2013: 1pm-4pm).
If you were in these areas at the times above and are not immune to measles, the most likely time you would become sick is between [16 Jul 2013] and [8 Aug 2013].

Measles symptoms begin 7 to 21 days after exposure. Measles is contagious from approximately 4 days before the rash appears through 4 days after the rash appears. People can spread measles before they have the characteristic measles rash. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age and those with weakened immune systems.
