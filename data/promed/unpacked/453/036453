The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the presence of
potato wart in a single potato field near Freetown, Prince Edward Island,
following the collection and testing of soil samples carried out over the
past weeks. Potato wart, a soilborne fungus, poses no threat to human
health and does not affect the safety of potatoes for consumption. It is
considered a quarantine pest by Canada and many other countries because it
reduces yield and makes potatoes unmarketable. Potato wart can be
transmitted to pest-free areas through infected soil or potatoes.

The CFIA has advised its major trading partners that potato wart has been
confirmed. Also, the CFIA has implemented containment measures and a
long-term management plan designed to minimize trade impacts for the potato
industry in PEI and the rest of Canada. This plan was established after the
initial finding of potato wart in 2000 to identify regulatory requirements,
manage detections, and prevent trade disruptions in the event of future
positive finds of the plant disease in Canada or the USA.

The latest find of potato wart was made following the voluntary submission
to the CFIA of a tuber displaying potato wart symptoms and the resulting
investigation to determine the precise origin of the infected tuber. The
field is in close proximity to a field, which is already known to be
positive and has been under surveillance since the 1st potato wart
detection in 2000.

When the producer submitted the sample, the CFIA immediately implemented
control measures to limit the potential spread of infested soil and plant
parts. These measures are consistent with potato wart regulatory measures
taken to date in PEI. Compensation may be available to affected parties
under the Potato Wart Compensation Regulations, 2003, which provides
compensation to persons for any treatment, prohibition, restriction, or
disposition imposed as a result of the presence of potato wart.

[The potato wart fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_ is considered one of the
most important pathogens of potato. It is endemic in Europe and also
reported from some other locations. It can also affect tomato and some
solanaceous weeds and is listed as a quarantine pathogen for the EC by the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). On infected tubers, 'eyes'
develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected
early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts
darken with age, and eventually rot and disintegrate. Diagnosis requires a
laboratory examination as similar symptoms can be caused by other
pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and reinfection
as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is therefore less damaging in
warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected
seed tubers, and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The
fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host.
There are several pathotypes (defined by their virulence on different host
cultivars), and potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been
developed. However, new pathogen strains are emerging compromising the
efficacy of host plant resistance. Disease management is based on the
control of pathogen spread. Unfortunately, it appears that the attempts to
confine the pathogen to the site of its 1st discovery on PEI have been
unsuccessful.
