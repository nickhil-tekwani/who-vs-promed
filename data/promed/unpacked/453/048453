From: Spielman, Andy <ASPIELMA@sph.harvard.edu>
I am pleased to offer my very enthusiastic endorsement of ProMED-mail. This
list has been thoroughly effective in keeping its subscribers in touch with
disease outbreaks occurring virtually anywhere in the world.
Objectivity is insured by a skillful team of subject-editors that manages
these interpretations and first-hand reports. The public health community
is amazingly well served by ProMED-mail.

[I would like all fellow academics to ponder how your teaching programs
might benefit from one of our CD-ROMs containing the ProMED-mail archives.
If the answer is affirmative, we could make good use of your pledge, and
would like to hear about any innovative strategies. See pledge format
below. - Mod.PC]
