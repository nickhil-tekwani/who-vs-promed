Lab results on Sunday [25 May 2020], found a dubious dish dubbed "death dumplings" after at least one woman died, contained the potentially fatal salmonella bacterium. After sale of the dumplings in southeast metro Bangkok was blamed for one death and several illnesses, the lab results, which came out yesterday, 24 May 2020, confirmed they contained _Salmonella_, according to Prakit Wongprasert of the Samut Prakan provincial health office.

Earlier this month [May 2020], a 66-year-old woman suffered severe diarrhea and was taken to a hospital. Her condition was allegedly caused by eating a dumpling bought from a local vendor. Others in her family, who also ate the dumplings, said they also had severe diarrhea. The woman died a few days later. Her death, led the media to dub the dim sum snack as 'death dumplings,' after several others came forward to say they had taken sick from eating them.

Local police said they have questioned witnesses and summoned the unidentified dumpling vendor.

[Young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems may be prone to more serious illness from salmonellosis, including severe diarrhea, which can result in severe dehydration. The report does not mention what co-morbidities that woman may have had. It also does not state if the woman or any of the others who became ill actually had _Salmonella_ grown from stool or blood cultures.
