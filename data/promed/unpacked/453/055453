Local health officials want to know whether [one of] the deadly
rodent-borne hantavirus[es] killed a Belle man and infected another
resident. Lab results from local hospitals indicated that both men
were infected with [a] hantavirus, said Dr. Kerry Gateley, director
of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department.
Blood samples have been sent to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta for additional testing.
Health department workers have interviewed friends and family members
of the men, and visited their homes and work sites.Gateley described
both men as "young adults," but declined to give their ages. "We only
have preliminary results," he said. "We're conducting an
investigation. Obviously, this is not something you run across very often."
One of the Belle men died about 7 weeks ago. The lab result on the
other man indicated an "old hantavirus infection," Gateley said. The
man was never hospitalized. "It came back that some time in the
past, the person could have been exposed to [a] hantavirus," Gateley said.
Gateley said he knew of only 2 hantavirus [infection] cases in the
state -- both in Elkins -- during the past several years. No previous
cases have been reported in Kanawha County. Gateley said people are
most likely to contract the disease this time of year while cleaning
out cabins, sheds and garages. "People disturb the area where
rodents have been nesting, and it creates a [virus-laden] dust that
people breathe in and become infected," he said.
Gateley recommended that people open doors and windows in places
where rodents may have nested last winter, then wait about 30 minutes
before entering. He said it also helps to spray suspected nesting
areas with water or bleach.

[This report does not speculate on which of the hantaviruses might be
involved in these cases. Hantaviruses that cause hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome [HPS] in the eastern and southeastern
USA include: Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses. There have been 3 cases of Monongahela hantavirus
infections, 2 of which were reported previously from Randolph County,
West Virginia (see the CDC Weekly Morbidity and Mortality Report of
November, 2004
