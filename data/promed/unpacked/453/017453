The secret to curing West Africa from Ebola is no secret at all
---------------------------------------------------------------
Port Loko is not far from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone and a global hub of maritime commerce. City and town, linked by paved roads, remain epicenters of Ebola transmission and deaths. Getting to zero new infections is the overarching goal of what is now the world's largest public-health undertaking. But it's still far from an ambitious clinical endeavor. The numbers say it all. Not a single American has died of Ebola; the majority of Europeans infected have survived; a Cuban survivor is already back here at work. Across West Africa, 70 percent of those afflicted die. And that figure applies only to the sick who receive care at treatment centers: More than 90 percent of those who stay home perish.

A year into the epidemic, with billions of dollars pledged to fight Ebola, what accounts for the extreme variation in death rates? How can an ambitious public-health effort be so unambitious clinically? There are many reasons for variations in survival, but among the top 5 are not that shipped-home expatriates received experimental treatments. What kills most Ebola patients is a massive loss of the body's vital fluids -- up to 10 liters of day -- along with proteins and electrolytes, primarily through vomiting and diarrhea. And that's not counting fluid losses from fever in broiling treatment centers, whose makeshift appearance offers a clue to the quality of care within. Clinicians and other staff in the hot zone can barely stand more than a couple of hours inside the centers, their protective gear sloshing with sweat, rubber boots brimming with a foul mix of perspiration and chlorine.

We often hear there's no treatment for Ebola or other hemorrhagic viruses. That's not true. What the expatriate survivors all received was excellent supportive care, most of it from nurses. In medical parlance, the term "supportive care" does not mean hand-holding but the replacement of fluids and electrolytes; treatment of secondary infections (bacteria escaping from the gut, say, or malaria); and, in some cases, renal dialysis and assisted ventilation. All of this is standard practice in countries pleased to be able to call themselves "donor nations."

Parents from these nations know how difficult it is to get a sick toddler to take in Pedialyte; vomiting kids can't keep it down even when it's made to taste like fruit drinks. Here in West Africa, we need swift and better intravenous access and intraosseous needles, which can infuse large volumes of fluid when patients arrive at clinics so dehydrated that it's difficult to find a vein. Three weeks ago, a baby named Jariatu was found by a burial team, barely alive, in a house full of dead family members. She was taken to Port Loko, where nurses and doctors were unable to locate a vein for an IV; the baby was dying, too unresponsive to drink. So the Partners in Health team, Sierra Leoneans among them, did what they would do in Boston or Haiti: They inserted an infusion needle into the bone marrow of her tibia. It was 3 days before Jariatu was conscious enough to show any interest in taking anything by mouth. She's expected to survive.

What we need -- what we've always needed -- to improve survival in West Africa is the capacity to safely deliver excellent supportive care. So what's the debate about? It's hard to deliver supportive care here, due to the obvious lack of staff and stuff and space, and it's dangerous. Though they're afraid of Ebola, as any sane person should be, thousands of medical professionals, most of them African, show up for work every day (a lack of electricity makes it hard to make a similar claim about night shifts, which is another cause of high mortality). Doctors Without Borders deserves special praise, since it was the 1st to sound the alarm and has brought thousands of volunteers and staff into the battle. When I noted to the New York Times recently that Doctors Without Borders wasn't "doing enough," what I meant was that we all need to provide better supportive care to increase survival. Double standards between such settings as Atlanta and Freetown are also harming efforts to find all patients with Ebola, which hampers efforts to isolate them from uninfected family members. Could there be a relationship between poor-quality care and people's reluctance to seek it in hot and raggedy Ebola units, where patients are interned until death or until blood tests show no circulating virus?

The primary task of the doctors, nurses and others working in treatment centers is to unlink these 2 events, infection and death. The quality of care in this part of West Africa -- not simply for Ebola but for more common ailments and injuries -- must be improved. Improving care means introducing capacity to monitor electrolytes, which we've recently done in rural Sierra Leone, instead of doing a single lab test for Ebola. It means cooler units -- even fans would help -- and personal protective gear made for tropical conditions. It means improved nutrition and a lot more support for the public health delivery system.

Since hospitals with poor infection control have always amplified Ebola's spread, the 2 tasks -- stopping transmission and improving care -- are the means by which the world's largest outbreak will be halted and proper health systems built. Since the most shockingly inadequate part of the response has been clinical, the Partners in Health team recently signed what we jokingly called the Port Loko Accords: a pledge to drop case-fatality rates to less than 10 percent. We were extremely serious about the number, which is still higher than that in the affluent world. If we try and fail, we'll keep trying while awaiting new and better ways to treat Ebola and other pathogens far more deadly for some -- those bereft of decent health systems -- than for others.

It is clear that aggressive supportive care is the key to improving survival, but the infrastructure to deliver this needs to be established. - Mod.LM]

Eight ways Ebola threatens the children of West Africa
------------------------------------------------------
Editor's note: These remark are from CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden who recently returned from a trip to West Africa.

While visiting Macenta in rural Guinea, I saw a woman joyously bouncing a young child on her knees, making animated expressions and encouraging and entertaining the child. The woman was a survivor of Ebola, and the child had just been ruled out for the disease -- even though her parents had both died from it. In the next tent, an infant was recovering from Ebola, being cared for by her own mother, an Ebola survivor.

In any emergency, children are among the most vulnerable population. The Ebola epidemic has been especially devastating to children in in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

There are millions of children living in the 3 heavily Ebola-affected countries. They face daunting challenges.

1. Death rates from Ebola are particularly high in children under 5 -- more than 80 percent.

2. Children in families with Ebola face severe stigma. I met a family with several survivors whose healthy 4-year-old child wasn't allowed out of the house because the neighbors wouldn't tolerate it.

3. At least 11 000 children have lost at least one parent to Ebola. Many orphans are shunned by their communities, but in many communities survivors and others are increasingly providing support services.

4. Routine health care is severely undermined, and basic health services for children are often unavailable. Malaria, which is endemic and severe in all of the 3 countries, is a leading killer of young children. Without treatment, many are at risk of death from an infected mosquito.

5. Obstetrical services are largely unavailable, increasing the risk that mothers and infants will have unsafe deliveries, many with potentially life-long consequences such as brain damage.

6. Many children have experienced deep psychological trauma from the outbreak, witnessing the illness or death of family members, or seeing horrors on the street or elsewhere.

7. Vaccine rates have plummeted, putting a million children at risk for measles and other preventable diseases. CDC is working with the countries, USAID, WHO, the GAVI Alliance, and others to implement vaccination campaigns.

8. Most schools are closed, keeping millions of kids out of classrooms for the past 6 months. Out of school, children are at no less risk for Ebola, but much greater risk for violence, abuse, and other social problems -- in addition to missing critical time in education. CDC is working with UNICEF and USAID to get schools re-opened as quickly and safely as possible.

Stopping Ebola remains our 1st priority, but cannot be our only one. I am especially concerned about the thousands of children under age 5 in these impacted countries not being immunized against measles and other killer diseases. ... -- more

[3] Clustered transmission model
Date: Fri 16 Jan 2015

Social clustering influenced spread of Ebola virus in West Africa
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Scarpino SV. 2014; Clin Infect Dis. 2014;doi:10.1093/cid/ciu1131.
http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/12/12/cid.ciu1131.abstract

Significant social clustering could to be a factor in the transmission of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, according to recent findings.

Researchers collected 78 Ebola virus genome sequences from more than 70 percent of the confirmed cases occurring in Sierra Leone during June. A transmission-oriented phylodynamic model, which assumes a time-based evolutionary reconstruction of the viral dynamics, was then applied to the genome sequences. Transmission chains using a Bayesian approach on the same genomic information.

With this data, researchers used a complementary Susceptible Exposed Infectious Removed (SEIR) network model to approximate clustering based on confirmed Ebola virus disease cases and deaths, deducing criteria for a clustered (phi greater than 0) and nonclustered population (phi = 0). SEIR models parameters were fit to the aggregate numbers of confirmed Ebola virus cases and laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease deaths documented in WHO Global Alert and Response news between 27 May and 31 Aug 2014.

The researchers found that the best-fit phylodynamic model for the virus' genomic data produced a basic reproductive ratio of 1.4 (95 percent highest posterior density: 1.1-1.8), with different model parameters producing similar measures. Using this data, researchers estimated a secondary infection ratio of 1.35, and both genomic analyses yielded similar estimated starting dates for the Sierra Leone outbreak. These dates were more recent than has been previously reported, but consistent with the 1st Sierra Leone infections reported at a funeral in May [2014].

A fit of the SEIR model, which estimated the proportion of possible high-risk contacts of an infected person who is also a contact, found evidence of a clustered population (phi = 0.71; 95 percent CI, 0.66-0.72), along with an estimated basic reproductive ratio of 1.29 (95 percent CI, 1.27-1.37).

The comparison of epidemiological data evaluated by models with and without clustering suggested compelling evidence for clustering in the contact network, the researchers wrote. Transmission events of infections spread through social clustering were correlated, and occurred within reciprocally associated subgroups.

"The clustering of transmission we infer has implications for the public health response such as the rate at which health resources, such as hospital beds, are required, for deriving realistic predictions about epidemic potential, and for the design of vaccine trials," the researchers wrote.

Abstract:

Using Ebolavirus genomic and epidemiological data, we conduct the 1st joint analysis where both data types are used to fit dynamic transmission models for an ongoing outbreak. Our results indicate that transmission is clustered, highlighting a potential bias in medical demand forecasts, and provide the 1st empirical estimate of underreporting.]
