The Ministry of Health and Social Services in Erongo Region, various local authorities and the governor's office are on high alert for more cases of hepatitis E, after 4 persons tested positive for the disease in Swakopmund. The cases were detected in Mondesa and DRC (Democratic Resettlement Community). The acting regional health director, Dr. Amir Shakir, yesterday indicated there are 32 other suspected cases whose results are pending. He explained that samples from the cases were sent to South Africa, and the confirmed diagnosis would take about 2 weeks. Meanwhile, Dr. Shakir says measures to control the spread of the virus have already started.

Namibia has been battling the disease since October 2017 with more than 500 confirmed cases and at least 14 deaths since the outbreak began. Hepatitis E is contracted through fecal-contaminated water and environmental contamination due to poor sanitation. The governor of Erongo Region, Cleophas Mutjavikua, yesterday told New Era that he was briefed by Dr. Shakir, upon which he alerted all towns and settlements in the region to advise residents.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. More than 60 percent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 percent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in east and south Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 percent are common in some age-groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html).

Erongo is one of the 14 regions of Namibia; its capital is Swakopmund. The region comprises the Swakopmund magisterial district up to the Ugab River and includes the Walvis Bay, Omaruru and Karibib magisterial districts. This region is named after Mount Erongo, a well-known landmark in Namibia and in this area. It can be seen on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erongo_Region. - Mod.LL
