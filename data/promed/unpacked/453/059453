An epidemic of viral gastroenteritis has spread to at least 29
health-care institutions across Montreal, making it the worst of its
kind in a decade, public-health officials say. Both patients and
staff are falling ill, and elective surgery is being cancelled to
free beds at the Jewish General Hospital, the latest to be hit with
an outbreak.
Experts warn the epidemic -- which is also ripping through
neighbourhoods outside hospitals -- hasn't peaked yet. "It's
certainly one of the worst years in the past 8-10," said Mark Miller,
chief of infection prevention and control at the Jewish General.
Similar outbreaks have been reported in the United States, Europe and
Japan. Experts suspect that a new, more contagious strain of the
Norwalk virus [now designated norovirus] has emerged, causing the
epidemic. "We're being hit very hard in eastern Canada, and this is
just the beginning of winter, which is usually the worst season for
[norovirus infection]," Miller said. "I don't anticipate that this is
going to peter out for at least several weeks."
Until now, the outbreaks have had little impact on hospital
operations. But yesterday, the Jewish General announced that it is
postponing elective surgeries indefinitely to make more beds
available. Eleven elective operations scheduled for today have been
cancelled. Emergency surgeries will continue, however.
A total of 12 patients and 8 staff at the Jewish General have
developed viral gastroenteritis, an inflammatory illness that causes
fever, vomiting and diarrhea. It lasts 24 to 72 hours. The hospital
has decided against ordering a quarantine in all 5 wards where
patients are ill, but has otherwise taken extraordinary precautions
to contain the outbreak. "To quarantine every single ward means to
essentially close down the hospital," Miller said. "So what we're
trying to do is relocate the patients."
Less than 3 weeks ago, six Montreal hospitals were hit with outbreaks
of gastroenteritis. By yesterday, that number had jumped to 13,
Blaise Lefebvre of the Montreal Public Health Department said.
Sixteen nursing homes are grappling with gastro outbreaks, up from 10
in December 2006. "Viral gastroenteritis is something we see at this
time of the year, but this year is significant," Lefebvre said. At
the Centre hospitalier de LaSalle, a dozen patients have come down
with gastroenteritis, forcing the hospital to quarantine the 2nd floor.
Lyne Champoux, an official with the health network that oversees the
hospital, said effective infection-control measures have been
undertaken. "We reacted by calling the families," Champoux said.
"We've also put up posters on the 2nd floor telling people not to visit."
Miller explained that the hospital outbreaks probably originated in
the community. The virus is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and
people visiting hospitals have unwittingly passed it on to patients.
Miller urged people to stay away from the Jewish General to "give us
some breathing time to get it under control and to take the pressure
off the beds. In general, stay away from other people when you are
sick because that's what spreads it," he added. "Good handwashing also helps."

[There is now ample evidence that noroviruses are genetically diverse
and that different genotypes are present around the world, exhibiting
sufficient antigenic diversity to prevent a build-up of global or
community immunity. It is not clear from the information available at
present whether the virus currently affecting health-care facilities
in Montreal is a more virulent strain than the noroviruses
circulating elsewhere at the present time. The results of genotype
characterization are awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
