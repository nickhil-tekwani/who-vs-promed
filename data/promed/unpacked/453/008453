Novel coronavirus infection - update [26 Mar 2013]
---------------
The Robert Koch Institute [RKI] informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a new confirmed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV). The patient was a 73-year-old male from United Arab Emirates [UAE], who was transferred from a hospital in Abu Dhabi to Munich by air ambulance on [19 Mar 2013]. He died on [26 Mar 2013].

In the United Kingdom, the index patient in the family cluster reported on [11 Feb 2013] with travel history to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia prior to his illness, has died.

To date, the WHO has been informed of a global total of 17 confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 11 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, the WHO encourages all Member States (MS) to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. The WHO is currently working with international experts and countries where cases have been reported to assess the situation and review recommendations for surveillance and monitoring.

All MS are reminded to promptly assess and notify the WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

The WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied. The WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The above mentioned cases were reported in earlier ProMED-mail posts, including a media report announcing the death of the case in the UK (see Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Germany ex UAE 20130326.1603038 and Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (12): KSA, UK fatality, RFI 20130323.1600113).

As of today, 26 Mar 2013, the breakdown of cases (and deaths) by country of report is:
- Saudi Arabia: 9 (6 deaths)
- Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
- UK: 4 (one patient from Qatar -- under treatment, 3 patients from UK -- one with history of travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan prior to illness; one recovered, 2 deaths)
- Germany: 2 (one patient from Qatar -- discharged, one patient from the UAE - one death).

As mentioned in the above WHO release, the total number of confirmed nCoV cases is now 17 with 11 deaths, bringing the case fatality ratio to 64.7 percent. Caution in interpretation of this figure as the numbers of cases is still very low and the ability to detect prior mild infections with this specific coronavirus is presently absent. Given the histories of other respiratory illnesses in contacts of cases that were relatively mild and associated with full recovery, but tested negative for infection with the nCoV, the possibility that there are more infections associated with milder disease is there.

In the report of the Jordanian cluster, there were a total of 11 individuals reported to have had respiratory illnesses, with confirmation of nCoV infection in specimens from the 2 fatal cases only (see prior ProMED-mail reports: Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean: WHO, Jordan, conf., RFI 20121130.1432498 and Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (04): RFI, Jordan, April 2012 20120925.1308001).

More information on the epidemiologic investigations of this newest case would be greatly appreciated.
