Large scale biosecurity checks of honey bee hives has found signs of American foulbrood.

Agriculture Victoria undertook biosecurity check of bee hives from Victoria, NSW [New South Wales] and Queensland as more than 4.2 billion bees were transported to Victoria's north west to pollinate almond blossoms.

More than 1000 hives were audited and more than 100 were found to have clinical signs of American foulbrood.

Agriculture Victoria senior apiary officer Joe Riordan said there was a risk of pests and diseases spreading during almond pollination due to the high density of hives.
He said the surveillance focused on endemic bee diseases, appropriate registration and branding of hives and checking of interstate movement's certificates.

There is no treatment for American foulbrood colonies and the colony must be euthanised, burnt then buried.

Disinfection includes dipping hive components in hot wax, at 150-160°C [302-320 °F], for 12 minutes, or gamma-irradiation.

The disease is endemic in Victoria. It can be managed if the beekeeper has apiary barrier management systems and does honey culture testing to narrow down infected hives.

Mr Riordan said beekeepers should adopt the Australian Honey Bee Industry Biosecurity Code of Practice and be aware of the signs of American foulbrood and exotic pests such as _Varroa_ mite.

"Australia remains _Varroa_ mite free and this status is attributed to strong biosecurity programs that have kept this economically devastating threat from our shores," he said.

[American Foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiﬁable disease of honey bees. _Paenibacillus larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
