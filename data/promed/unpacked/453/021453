TORONTO (CP): A week after the first recall of potentially contaminated
Greek pasta salad was issued across Ontario, about 500 people have fallen
ill with shigellosis -- 114 in Toronto alone. Yet, initial tests done on
employees at Tiffany Gate Foods Inc, the company that makes the salad, have
led to more questions than answers. The tests revealed that no one at the
company has recently had shigellosis, the illness caused by shigella
bacteria. Faron Kolbe, a spokesperson with Toronto public health, said the
department is now waiting for results to come in from a second set of tests
performed on Tiffany Gate employees.
The current outbreak occurred after people ate Greek pasta salad bought at
stores. On 27 May 2002, federal investigators said they had largely
finished scouring the Tiffany Gate plant, taking food samples to determine
where the contamination may have seeped in. They are also awaiting lab
results to prove shigella bacteria were, in fact, present in the company's
salad. Final results should be available by the end of the week.
Tiffany Gate issued a recall of its salad on 18 May 2002, after federal
food inspectors told the company that people had complained of stomach
cramping, bloody diarrhea, headaches, and other symptoms of shigellosis. A
day later, more than 40 people had fallen ill. By 27 May, that number had
risen to 504 ill people, said Gord Haugh, a spokesperson from Ontario's
health ministry.
Tiffany Gate has been making the salad for years, shipping it to hundreds
of supermarkets and stores across Ontario and eastern Canada. The salad
will not be shipped out again until investigators figure out what could
have caused contamination. The company continues to produce hundreds of
other products, including various salads, chicken dishes, and desserts. It
also continues to defend its food making procedures, arguing this is the
first contamination the company has faced in 14 years of operation.

[It appears from these reports that the pasta salad was implicated on
epidemiological grounds and tests have not yet confirmed the association.
Since the infectious dose for humans for shigellosis is quite small,
culturing the food may not always find these small numbers of bacilli. In
addition, since shigellosis may cause mild symptoms and a carrier state is
much less common than with salmonellosis, culturing food workers after the
fact may not necessarily yield the index case. - Mod.LL]
