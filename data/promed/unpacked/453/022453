After reporting 218 cases of it [scrub typhus], Uttar Pradesh is gearing up to boost testing for the diagnosis of scrub typhus, a life-threatening infectious disease, in districts. According to data available from the state health department, Amethi has reported 14 cases of the disease so far, Ghaziabad 37, Ayodhya 13, Azamgarh 11, Balia and Bahraich 10 each, and Jaunpur 2. Meerut has reported a casualty. "We are upgrading our labs and also health facilities in the state so that they can accurately diagnose scrub typhus," said Dr Lilly Singh, director general of medical health.

Scrub typhus is caused by a bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, and spreads through the bite of infected chiggers (larval mites). Its symptoms are similar to that of vectorborne diseases and include fever, headache, body aches, rashes, and muscle pain.

"We have labs at divisional levels and samples from districts come to these labs for the testing of scrub typhus. With more labs coming up, samples will be tested possibly in the same district or the adjacent district," said a senior health official.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults and feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for the maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Other than the necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (the eschar), scrub typhus has no distinctive clinical features to make an accurate clinical diagnosis and the presence of an eschar in patients has been reported to vary widely. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, but we are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis was made in these patients in Uttar Pradesh or what type of tests are being done at division laboratories.

The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of proteus bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test in Sri Lanka (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.11.020).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibodies to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India. Having an accurate, available, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test for scrub typhus would be important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892940/#abstract-2title).

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html); doxycycline is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/doxycycline/index.html). Treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting results of laboratory confirmation. - Mod.ML
