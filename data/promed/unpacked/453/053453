After hundreds of cases of respiratory distress and acute diarrhea within
Thai refugee camps along the Cambodian border, a warning has been issued on
a possible outbreak of anthrax. The public health chief of Si Saket province
in northeastern Thailand cautioned people against eating raw meat from
Cambodian cattle sold over the border. The refugees, it is reported, are
selling their cattle to Thai merchants at cut-rate prices to get money for
food.
Of the 1,500 Cambodians who have sought treatment at a makeshift health
clinic, over 800 cases have been respiratory, over 300 acute diarrhea. There
are approximately 84,000 refugees massed along the border in Thai camps.

[The above account gives no details of human cases nor of diagnosed
livestock cases. Thailand is essentially anthrax-free but cases occur in the
border districts following the importation of infected stock from their
neighbours - with the exception of Malaysia which is anthrax-free. Last year
there was a bad outbreak when notification of laboratory results was delayed
and the affected bunch of cattle, held near the border, was released and
reached Bangkok, where further cases occurred. Details have been requested
of our Thais colleagues. - Mod.MHJ
