Last month [December 2020], more than 20 children died in Balkh province from the pneumonia disease prevalent to the extreme cold weather.

Pneumonia cases are increasing among the children this winter, and 326 children have been hospitalized in December (2020), health officials noted to ATN News. The Children's Department of the Balkh public Health Directorate, Nawroz Seberi, said that "1679 children were hospitalized in Qaws (December 2020) of which 326 patients suffered from pneumonia; that shows a 20 percent increase in cases."

Concurrently, the Save the Children organization warned the country that more than 300 000 children are suffering from the cold and freezing weather crisis which can lead to diseases and worst-off to their death. The lack of proper clothing and heating equipment is considered to be one of the factors, the organization emphasized. Chris Nyamandi, the Organization's country director in Afghanistan denoted last month [December 2020] in a statement that "while schools are closed until March [2021] in the coldest parts of the country, this is a serious blow because often the classroom is the only source of warmth for children during winter -- where temperatures can plummet to below -27 deg C [about -17 deg F] in parts of the country", Ariana News reported.

"For thousands of children the Afghan winter is a time of grim survival," Nyamandi added. He further indicated that "the situation is bleak for children forced to live in camps in places like Balkh province. It is already very cold in this northern province with overnight temperatures as low as [-10 deg C/14 deg F]. But it will get much colder before March." Meanwhile, a nationwide polio vaccination campaign has started in Afghanistan as the country suffers from polio disease.

A 5-day vaccination campaign has been launched by the Afghan government and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). The campaign program is expected to cover the vaccination of 10 million children under the age of 5 across the country.

The Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health said that insecurity in different parts of the country is the main reason, vaccines couldn't reach most of the children in Afghanistan. At the same time, as the vaccination campaign has started in the country, the Taliban announced their support for the program after the Taliban deputy leader, Mullah Baradar, met with the World Health Organization and the UNICEF representatives to discuss the polio program implementation in Afghanistan, BBC News reported.

[According to the report above, there has been an unusual increase in the number of pneumonia cases in Balkh province of Afghanistan since December 2020. Among the 1679 cases hospitalized, 326 patients suffered from lower respiratory tract infections/pneumonia.

However, the report does not mention the etiology of these cases. In order to identify/verify any clustering of cases or for detection of outbreak and timely response, baseline information is required to understand whether this pattern is seen every year. Establishment of regular surveillance system for acute respiratory infection (ARIs) in children is required in order to determine the burden of severe acute respiratory illness/pneumonia in the population, associated risk factors, and temporal trends. Provision of laboratory services is necessary to identify bacterial and viral etiologies to guide vaccination strategies as well as empirical therapeutic regimens.

More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
