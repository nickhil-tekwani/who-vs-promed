France will tighten measures to contain bird flu after a resurgence of the virus that swept through poultry flocks last winter, said the agriculture ministry, adding that the nationwide alert level on bird flu had been raised to 'moderate' from 'low'.

France experienced its worst-ever bird flu crisis between November [2021] and May [2022], with over 19 million animals being culled to stem a [highly pathogenic] strain of the disease that spread in major poultry breeding regions in western France.

The government scaled back restrictions in June [2022] after a lull in outbreaks, before an unusual upturn in cases during the summer that affected large numbers of wild birds in coastal areas as well as some farm flocks inland.

Other European countries have also reported renewed outbreaks of bird flu since the summer.

[The most recent season of avian influenza in France, starting in fall 2021, has become exceptional in view of its extended course. Since mid-May 2022, an increase in cases has been observed in "indigenous" wildlife on the Channel coast, where grouped mortalities of coastal birds were observed, followed in June [2022] by bird mortalities on the Normandy coasts and later, in July 2022, on the Brittany coasts. Since then, these mortalities have been continuing on the coastal departments with some spread inland. Environmental contamination remains high in the affected regions with sporadic introductions into poultry farms. A similar course has been reported from several countries, from the Baltic Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, an outcome of HPAI H5N1 becoming endemic in wild bird populations.

A map of Europe showing the HPAI outbreaks and cases in poultry (pink) and nonpoultry (blue) between 1 Jun 2022 and 23 Sep 2022 is available in Figure 3 (page 9) of UK's APHA risk assessment dated 28 Sep 2022 (https://tinyurl.com/2p8adcme). Reports from September 2022 are shown with central black dots. - Mod.AS
