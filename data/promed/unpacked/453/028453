[1] Melamine in Chinese soybeans fed to organic French poultry

Chinese soybeans contaminated with melamine withdrawn from the French market
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nearly 300 tonnes of soya meal imported from
China and destined for organic poultry in Western
France have been withdrawn from the market after
the discovery of a melamine rate fifty times
higher than the permitted standard, it was
learned Friday [28 Nov 2008] from of the
importing cooperative.

Christophe Courousse, communications director of
the cooperative Terrena in Ancenis
(Loire-Atlantique), told AFP on Friday: "One of
the 3 imported batches, of 293 tonnes, had a
rate of melamine of 116 mg/kg while the standard
[permitted maximum level?] is of 2.5 mg. All food
products made from these materials have been
removed from the market in early November".

Soybean meal had been delivered, before the
chemical analysis, mainly to 127 organic farmers
in Pays de Loire through the Bio animal nutrition
(BNA), a subsidiary of Terrena a Mervent
(Vendee), which specializes in the manufacture of
organic food.

"The analysis of pork and laying hens show that
there is no danger to public health. Unlike
dioxin, melamine does not accumulate in the body.
There is no transmission in the food chain ",
AFP was told by Fr√©deric Andre of the Veterinary
Services Directorate in Vendee.

Soya cake with melamine has been used to
manufacture feed for farmers in 11 departments:
Loire-Atlantique, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne,
Deux-Sevres, Vendee, Calvados, Eure,
Ille-et-Vilaine, Indre -et-Loire, Sarthe and Orne.

The company BNA announced its intention to sue
for fraud, adding melamine to "artificially
inflate the protein levels and increase the
selling price of the product", said Courousse.

"The organic sector needs 18 000 tons of soybeans
while France produces only 4000 tonnes," says
Courousse. Imports from China were due to poor
harvest in Brazil, the traditional supplier.

Controls on stored stocks have been carried out
following a warning from the European Union in
late October, recommending vigilance on imports
from China.

Meanwhile, the Ecocert agency, in charge of the
organic certification of imported soybeans, said
that the Chinese exporter had committed a "fraud"
which its control procedures was unable to
detect. [ECOCERT is an organic certification
organization, founded in France in 1991. It is
based in Europe but conducts inspections in over
80 countries, making it one of the largest
organic certification organizations in the world;
see <http://www.ecocert.fr/Contact.html>. - Mod.
AS].


"Our certification covers a production method",
AFP was told Jerome Viel, head of certification
at Ecocert. The body, which has an office in
Beijing, controls "practices" and checks the
"traceability", but can not "guarantee" against
"frauds" such as the ones [suspected to have
been] committed by the Chinese exporter, he said.

There are many ECOCERT controls on the products
themselves, but they "address mainly pesticides,"
he explained.

Since that case, "we decided to increase the
Ecocert surveillance upon imports of organic soya
cake, whatever their origin," he said.

According to Terrena, the Chinese supplier in
question is Hongliang, based in Dalian (Northern
China). Its export authorization in France has
been suspended by the Ministry of Agriculture,
said Ecocert.

For their part, European manufacturers of natural
soybean products have to specify in a statement
that the products, intended for human consumption
such as soy milk, soy desserts, Soy steaks etc.,
placed on the market, are not involved in the
melamine contamination problem.

[2] US: revised melamine tolerable daily intake

Date: Sat, 29 Nov 2008

FDA sets melamine standard for baby formula
-------------------------------------------
Less than 2 months after federal food regulators
said they were unable to set a safety threshold
for the industrial chemical melamine in baby
formula, they announced a standard that allows
for higher levels than those found in U.S.-made
batches of the product.

Food and Drug Administration officials on Friday
[28 Nov 2008] set a threshold of 1 part per
million [=1.0 mg per kg] of melamine in formula,
provided a related chemical isn't present. They
insisted the formulas are safe. [An FDA interim
safety/risk assessment on melamine and structural
analogues, published last month, established for
melamine a tolerable daily intake TDI of 0.63 mg
per kg of body weight per day. - Mod. AS].

The setting of the standard comes days after The
Associated Press reported that FDA tests found
traces of melamine in the infant formula of one
major U.S. manufacturer and cyanuric acid, a
chemical relative, in the formula of a second
major maker. The contaminated samples, which both
measured at levels below the new standard, were
analyzed several weeks ago.

The FDA had stated in early October that it was
unable to set a safety contamination level for
melamine in infant formula.

Dr. Stephen Sundlof, FDA's director of food
safety, said Friday the agency was confident in
setting the 1 part per million level for either
of the chemicals alone. although there has been
no new scientific studies since October that
would give regulators more safety data. He had no
ready explanation for why the level wasn't set
earlier.

The standard is the same as the one public health
officials have set in Canada and China where in
September the problem of melamine in infant
formula first surfaced. But it is 20 times higher
than the most stringent level in Taiwan.

Sundlof said the lack of dual contamination was
key because studies so far show dangerous health
effects only when both chemicals are present. He
emphasized that neither of the two tainted
samples had both contaminants.

The agency still will not set a safety level for
melamine if cyanuric acid is also present, he
said.

Both the new safety level and the amount of the
chemical found in U.S.-made infant formula are
far below the amounts of melamine added to infant
formula in China that have been blamed for
killing at least three babies and making
thousands ill.

"The levels were so low ... that they do not
cause a health risk to infants," Sundlof said.
"Parents using infant formula should continue
using U.S.-manufactured infant formula. Switching
away from one of these infant formulas to
alternate diets or homemade formulas could result
in infants not receiving the complete nutrition
required for proper growth and development."

Reacting to news of the contaminated formulas,
members of Congress, a national consumer group
and the Illinois attorney general have demanded a
national recall, something the FDA said made no
sense because it had no evidence suggesting that
the formula would be dangerous for babies at the
levels of contamination found.

After saying it made an error in its data, the
FDA on Wednesday [26 Nov 2008] produced these
results: Nestle's Good Start Supreme Infant
Formula with Iron had 2 positive tests for
melamine on one sample; Mead Johnson's Infant
Formula Powder, Enfamil LIPIL with Iron had 3
positive tests on one sample for cyanuric acid.

Separately, a 3rd major formula maker, Abbott
Laboratories, told the AP that in-house tests had
detected trace levels of melamine in its infant
formula.

Those three formula makers manufacture more than
90 percent of all infant formula produced in the
United States.

The FDA said it had analyzed 74 samples and was continuing to examine 13 more.

The agency had left the impression of a zero
tolerance on Oct. 3 when it stated: "FDA is
currently unable to establish any level of
melamine and melamine-related compounds in infant
formula that does not raise public health
concerns."

The FDA and other experts said they believe the
melamine contamination in U.S.-made formula had
occurred during the manufacturing process, rather
than intentionally. The U.S. government quietly
began testing domestically produced infant
formula in September, soon after problems with
melamine-spiked formula surfaced in China.

Melamine can legally be used in some food
packaging, and can rub off into food from there.
It's also part of a cleaning solution used on
some food processing equipment.

There is a gap between the concentration that the
FDA detected in formula and the agency's estimate
of how much melamine could contaminate food from
the manufacturing process. The expected
contamination from processing - 15 parts per
billion - is about one-tenth the amount that the
agency has detected in infant formula. FDA
officials have not responded to questions from
the AP this week about how that gap might be
explained.

The agency said it is continuing research on
animals to see the effects of ingesting both
melamine and cyanuric acid.
