Veraguas Ministry of Health authorities confirm the death of a 42 year old woman, from [a] hantavirus [infection]. The woman resided in Las Palmas district and is the 1st death in Veraguas province from [a] hantavirus [infection]. It is assumed that the victim became infected in Divala, Chiriqui province, where she had been visiting for some days.

Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is an acute, serious disease caused by [a] hantavirus. The mice in the countryside (mainly long-tails) transmit [the virus] to people, shedding virus in saliva, feces and urine.

The virus is transmitted to people:
- by inhalation: this is the most frequent cause. It occurs when we breathe in open or closed spaces (sheds, gardens, pastures) where there is feces or urine from infected rodents that shed the virus, contaminating the environment;
- by direct contact: through touching infected live or dead rodents or the feces or urine of these rodents;
- by bites: being bitten by infected rodents.

[Veraguas province adjoins both Los Santos and Herrera provinces, where all the reported cases of hantavirus infections have occurred so far in 2015. Cases in Veraguas province are not surprising. There were 2 suspected cases in Veraguas province in April this year (2015) that apparently were not fatal. No cases have been reported previously in Chiriqui province, nor are the dates of the woman's stay there given, relatively to the onset of her disease, so it is not certain in which province the infection was acquired. There have been several hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases in the Azuero region, which includes Los Santos and Herrera provinces, both of which have had HPS cases this year (2015). This region is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. No data on the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible. Choclo is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

The preventive measures indicated in previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
