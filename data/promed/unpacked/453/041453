News of the response
Support
-------
The transit center of Beni was inaugurated this Thu 15 Nov 2018. Located opposite the office of the head of the health zone, this 16-bed transit center will isolate all suspected cases waiting for laboratory results. Only laboratory confirmed cases will be transferred to the Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Beni. This transit center was built to alleviate the burden of the 60-bed Beni ETC, which was regularly filled due to the large influx of suspected cases detected every day.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 30 563 people have been vaccinated [in North Kivu and Ituri provinces; see numbers at the source URL above].

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry revised its tally of the ongoing Ebola outbreak today [15 Nov 2018], noting 3 more cases and 1 additional death. Officials have now reported 344 cases and 202 deaths in an outbreak that begin in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in August [2018].

- Thu 15 Nov 2018. Japan to improve Ebola testing system amid rise in foreign tourists
[Japan Times, edited]
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/11/15/national/japan-improve-ebola-testing-system-amid-rise-foreign-tourists/#.W-2JORNKhZ0

A Japanese national research institute said [Thu 15 Nov 2018] it will import strains of Ebola and 4 other deadly viruses to improve detection processes amid a rise in the number of foreign visitors to the country. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases plans to bring the pathogens to a facility in the western suburbs to Tokyo ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but will not push forward without local support, a health ministry official said.

The viruses to be imported are those that cause 5 types of hemorrhagic fever -- Ebola, Crimean-Congo, Lassa, Marburg, and South American. The pathogens do not exist in Japan and have never been deliberately imported. According to the institute, having access to the pathogens would not only increase the speed and accuracy with which it could identify an infected person, it would also give it the ability to conduct tests to assess a patient's recovery. The pathogens would be kept at the institute's laboratory in the city of Musashimurayama, western Tokyo. The lab is currently the only one in Japan with the maximum biosafety level -- BSL-4.

The laboratory won the designation allowing the possession of pathogens in 2015 following a flurry of suspected Ebola infections among people returning from West Africa, the site of an outbreak that, according to the World Health Organization, killed more than 11 300 people. Despite the tight security at the lab, the plan could run into opposition from local residents concerned about the deadly viruses being brought into their neighborhood. "We will avoid being hasty, and work to gain the understanding of the local community," the official of the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry said. The institute said it will hold meetings to keep residents informed of the plans.

- Thu 15 Nov 2018. Uganda: possible 1st case in Hoima
[AllAfrica, Daily Monitor (Uganda) report; edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201811150693.html

There was tension in Hoima district on Thursday evening [15 Nov 2018] after a 31 year old Boda boda [bicycle and motorcycle taxis] cyclist died with symptoms similar to those of Ebola. According to health personnel, [the man] died after intense vomiting of blood. He reportedly had red eyes, passing watery stool, and with high fever.

The deceased is a resident of Kitongole village, Kibugubya parish in Kyabigambire subcounty [Hoima district]. He had been complaining of abdominal discomfort and on Wednesday afternoon [14 Nov 2018] he went to Mparangasi HCIII riding his motorcycle but got treatment for headache. After a few hours at his home, he started vomiting and later passed blood oozed from nose, the medics who rushed to the scene said.

The Hoima district health inspector Mr Fredrick Byenume who was part of the team that rushed to the scene said samples were picked from the deceased to ascertain the cause of his death. "Samples have been sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute for testing and we expect results today," Byenume said.

The death was widely suspected to be of Ebola according to residents who called leaders for rescue. "I immediately alerted Hoima district local government, Hoima regional referral hospital, the Ministry of Health and the WHO," Wakabi said. Medics rushed to the scene dressed in protective gears, obtained samples from the deceased and used a no-touch technique of burying the deceased.

Hoima district shares a boarder with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) where the Ebola outbreak has been confirmed. The minister of health is on high alert to detect and control any suspicious Ebola cases.

[The tests should be complete by 16 Nov 2018, but Ebola is certainly a possibility. This would be the 1st confirmed case in neighboring Uganda if indeed Ebola is confirmed by the Uganda Virus Research Institute. There are other diseases that present very much like Ebola, so we must wait for the laboratory assays to be complete. All health workers and the community responded as they should with appropriate protocol, except he was treated for headache upon presentation at the clinic without further suspicion. More to come once results are made public. - Mod.LK
