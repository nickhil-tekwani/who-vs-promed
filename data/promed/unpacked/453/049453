2 new studies found that the Ebola vaccine -- being used for ring immunization in West African countries that have recently reported cases of Ebola -- is safe and generates strong immunity in both children and adults.

The World Health Organization and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention told Devex that the findings of the studies are expected to bring about policy changes in the continent's response to Ebola to include children in vaccination campaigns.

In May 2014, the government of Sierra Leone announced an Ebola outbreak, and as it was responding to the outbreak, clinical trials targeting adults and children in Sierra Leone's Kambia district for Johnson & Johnson's 2-dose Ebola vaccine regimen -- called Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccines -- were planned to test the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.

During the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, 28 652 cases and 11 325 deaths were reported. Approximately 20% of cases were in children under 15, and children younger than 5 years old are at a higher risk of death than adults.

Before the trials eventually commenced, the outbreak had slowed down and the team of researchers led by Dr. Muhammed Afolabi and Dr. Daniela Manno, both from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, had to pivot the goal of the study from testing for effectiveness to its safety and ability to generate strong immune responses.

"This is a vaccine that can be used more broadly, including to protect children from being infected by Ebola, so this is a very important finding that can be worked into the process of preparing supplies." said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, regional director for Africa, World Health Organization.

Working with the health authorities in Sierra Leone, the researchers recruited children and adults in separate studies. According to the findings published in The Lancet Infectious Disease Journal, the vaccine was found to be safe and generated adequate immune responses in both adults and children.

The 1st study found the vaccine regimen was well tolerated and induced antibody responses to Zaire ebolavirus 21 days after the 2nd dose in 98% of adult participants, with the immune responses persisting for at least 2 years.

Among children aged 1-17, the 2nd study found the vaccine was "well tolerated with no safety concerns," and "induced robust humoral immune responses, suggesting the suitability of this regimen for Ebola virus disease prophylaxis in children."

Ebola virus antibody responses were observed in 98% of children aged 12-17, 95% of children aged 4-11, and in 98% of children aged 1-3, 21 days after receiving the 2nd dose of the vaccine.

Afolabi told Devex the evidence provided by the study is expected to bring about policy changes including the inclusion of children as young as 1 in Ebola vaccination programs.

"The results show that this vaccine regimen has the potential to save many young lives," Afolabi said.

The vaccine is currently administered through a ring vaccination approach in which adult contacts of suspected cases and front-line health workers are given the doses. Children below the age of 17 are excluded due to a lack of data regarding safety and efficacy in children.

"After the resurgence of Ebola virus disease in Guinea, 5 years after it became the epicentre of the 2014-16 epidemic in West Africa that claimed more than 11â€‰000 lives, and following successive outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the need for safe and effective vaccines to curb disease transmission remains as urgent as ever. In May, 2020, the Janssen Vaccines & Prevention heterologous primary and booster Ebola vaccine regimen, comprising the adenovirus type 26 vector-based vaccine expressing Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia Ankara vector-based vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Zaire Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Marburg virus, and nucleoprotein from the Tai Forest virus (MVA-BN-Filo), administered 8 weeks apart, was granted marketing authorisation by the European Commission for the prevention of Ebola virus disease in adults and children aged 1 year or older.(1) Clinical development of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen included several phase 1 clinical trials done simultaneously at various sites: in Uganda, which is endemic for Ebola virus disease and at risk of an outbreak, with reported cases of Ebola virus disease; in Tanzania and Kenya, which are also at risk of an outbreak, but have no previously reported cases of Ebola virus disease; and in the UK and the USA, which are only at risk of imported cases of Ebola virus disease.(2) These trials allowed the collection of safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data (3 , 4 , 5 , 6) across various epidemiological settings. Additionally, African participants included malaria-naive individuals from a high-altitude setting (Nairobi, Kenya) and individuals with partial immunity to malaria (Mwanza, Tanzania, and Masaka, Uganda). This strategic approach led to the generation of locally relevant data and provided a robust evidence base to inform the selection of Ad26.ZEBOV as a prime and MVA-BN-Filo as a boost for phase 2 clinical trials". - Mod LK]

It is already general knowledge that the deadly Ebola could lie dormant in survivor's tissues, but a new study suggests that these 'virus reservoirs' are capable of reawakening and triggering an outbreak even 5 years after infection.

The new case that began in a town named Goueke, reported in January 2021, sparked Guinea's 2nd outbreak of the Ebola virus disease within the past decade. There happened to be a misdiagnosis of a 51-year-old woman who was admitted to a hospital and discharged 2 days later after initially diagnosing her of malaria. The patient died 3 days later.

The outbreak involved 16 confirmed cases and 12 deaths. Researchers investigated the genomes of samples from several patients using next-generation sequencing, and later on eliminated sustained human-to-human transmission or zoonotic transfer as causes, based on evidence.

Analysis showed that the 2021 Guinea strain shares similar genetic origin to that from the 2013-2016 wave.

While it has been generally presumed that most of the Ebola outbreaks have resulted from the virus 'spilling' from an animal host to a human or actively circulating in the community, the new study shed light on human-to-human transmission from individuals previously infected many years earlier.

If that's the case, the virus would have already accumulated a certain number of mutations, but 2021 findings show that the virus had just 12 changes, "far fewer than would be expected... during 6 years of sustained human-to-human transmission."

"That strongly suggests the source was a reactivated virus that had lain dormant in a survivor," said Alpha Keita, lead researcher at the University of Montpellier.

"This is the longest known time between the declared end of an epidemic and a viral resurgence," he noted. "It's a new paradigm; the possibility that transmission from an individual infected during a previous epidemic could be the source of a new outbreak."

While mysterious, science always gives clues to those who seek.

Experts hypothesize that virus' sudden awakening could be that Ebola antibodies may be detected in survivors and it is the body's way of responding to a resurgent virus.

"Around 2/3 of Ebola survivors have high antibody levels even 5 years after infection, but the question to pose is what happens if there's a resurgence in the people whose immunity has dropped," said Keita.

"The study's findings have considerable implications for public health and care of survivors of Ebola," said Robert F. Garry of Tulane University's School of Medicine. "Humans can now be added to the list of intermediate hosts that can serve as long-term Ebola virus 'reservoirs' and trigger new outbreaks," he also wrote.

This calls out a need for vaccination especially among healthcare workers and "monitor Ebola survivors for signs of a flare-up," Garry added. "We need a real, long-term follow-up protocol... so we can catch resurgence in previously infected people in time."

[This long-term persistence of Ebola in a human for 5 years signals the need for continued surveillance of the population since it suggests humans may serve as reservoirs of the virus. Doctors need to be alerted to consider Ebola as an etiologic agent even in the absence of an outbreak. Vaccination of the population and health care personnel in virus hot spots becomes important to prevent spread from persistently infected individuals. The findings above in this post report that the Johnson & Johnson's 2-dose is safe even for 1-year-old children, who can now be included in the vaccination campaign. - Mod LK]
