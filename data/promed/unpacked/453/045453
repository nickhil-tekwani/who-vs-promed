Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) has reached outbreak proportions, forcing the authorities to take urgent measures to contain it.

The Health Ministry has placed the country under the "alert level" following last week's 1379 cases nationwide with Selangor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur topping the list.

Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said there was an increase of 83 cases or 6.4 per cent as compared with 1296 cases the week before.

"The upward trend began in the last week of April [2016] with 794 cases. A directive was issued in early May [2016] to all state health departments to step up monitoring and preventive efforts," he said.

Selangor has the highest number of cases with 4441 (32.6 per cent), followed by Johor 1393 (10.2 per cent), Kuala Lumpur 1317 (9.7 per cent), Sabah 1299 (9.5 per cent), and Sarawak 1108 (8.1 per cent).

In Negri Sembilan, health authorities have closed 12 nurseries and preschools to enable disinfection procedures to be carried out there. State health director Dr Abdul Rahim Abdullah said the outbreak of the disease was also detected in 6 houses. "Up to [Sun 12 Jun 2016], a total of 485 HFMD cases have been reported. So far, there is no new outbreak besides the 18 spots," he said, adding that nurseries and preschools in Taman Seri Pandan, Seremban, were among the first affected areas. An alert will be put out to warn the public if the number of weekly cases exceeds 20. Last month [May 2016], the number of cases shot up to 87 in the 4th week from 28 in the 2nd week.

In Kuala Terengganu, there was a 35 per cent increase in cases as the authorities took prompt action to inspect day care centres, kindergartens and surroundings. State Health, Women, Family and Community Development Committee chairman Datuk Muhammad Pehimi Yusof said 165 cases were reported in the 1st 5 months this year [2016], a surge from 122 cases for the whole of last year [2015].

In Ipoh [Perak state], the number of cases was dropping, from a peak of 25 cases between February and May [2016]. Perak health director Datuk Dr Juita Ghazalie said it was a cyclical pattern in which the disease would rise every two years.

Dr Juita said useful information on the disease had been disseminated to all parties and a sentinel surveillance laboratory set up at Taiping and Seri Manjung Hospital to monitor the situation closely.

HFMD is highly contagious and caused by enteroviruses, particularly the coxsackie A16 and enterovirus 71 strains.

Symptoms include fever, sore throat, rashes on the hands and feet, and mouth ulcers. In severe cases, patients can come down with other complications such as meningoencephalitis or myocarditis and may even result in death.

[HFMD caused by coxsackie virus A16 infection is a mild disease and nearly all patients recover within 7-10 days. Complications are uncommon. HFMD caused by enterovirus EV71 may be associated with neurological complications such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis.

Cases of fatal encephalitis, which occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998, were caused by EV71. (http://www.expat.com.my/Hand%20Foot%20Mouth%20Disease%20HFMD%20in%20Malaysia.htm). - Mod.LK
