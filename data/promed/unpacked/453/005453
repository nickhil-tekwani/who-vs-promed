[1] USA (IA): H1N1v

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on 4 Jun 2021 one human infection with an influenza A(H1N1) variant (A(H1N1)v) virus [in] Iowa. The patient is an adult, was not hospitalized, and has completely recovered from their illness.

Investigation into the source of the infection revealed that the patient works on a farm with swine present. No human-to-human transmission of A(H1N1)v virus has been identified associated with this patient.

This is the 2nd influenza A(H1N1)v virus infection identified in the USA that occurred in 2021.

Five human infections with a novel influenza A virus have been reported in the USA this season, including one H3N2v (WI), one H1N2v (OH), and 3 H1N1v (IA, NC, WI) infections. Three infections have occurred in children, and 2 have occurred in adults. All cases either had direct contact with swine or lived on a property with swine present, says the CDC.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine (but not people) is detected in a person, it is called a "variant influenza virus."

The World Health Organization (WHO) says zoonotic influenza diseases are caused by animal influenza viruses, such as bird flu and swine flu. People can be infected with avian influenza virus subtypes A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) and swine influenza virus subtypes A(H1N1) and (H3N2).

[H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 are types of flu viruses that commonly circulate in North American swine herds. When a virus that circulates in pigs is found in people, it's called a variant. This is indicated by using a lowercase "v" at the end of its name. H1N1v, H1N2v and H3N2v are variant viruses of type A influenza. Cases of human influenza A with swine origin are rare. To date, there's no evidence of sustained person-to-person spread. Worldwide, only 31 cases of H1N1v, 29 cases of H1N2v, and 437 cases of H3N2v have been reported in humans since 2005 (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/human-influenza-a-h1n2-v-swine-origin.html).

Most infections with variant viruses have occurred in children (persons 18 or younger), and most cases have reported direct or indirect exposure to swine before onset of illness. Limited transmission from close contact with an infected person has been observed in some investigations of human infections with variant viruses, but sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. The USA has documented 13 cases of H1N1v, 29 cases of H1N2v, and 432 cases of H3N2v since 2010 (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html). Iowa has reported only one case of H1N1v in the 2020-21 season. - Mod.UBA

[2] Taiwan: H1N2v

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/h1n2v-influenza-case-reported-in-taiwan-84570/


The Taiwan Center for Disease Control has reported a human H1N2v influenza case in a 5-year-old girl living in the central area. She had mild illness (fever, runny nose and cough) and didn't require hospitalization and was engaged in livestock breeding at home.

H1N2 is a low-pathogenic influenza virus that exists in pigs. It rarely spreads among people, but there are occasional reports of human infection. A total of 30 confirmed cases of H1N2v influenza worldwide from 2012 to 2021 are distributed in the Americas, with the United States reporting the most cases, followed by Brazil. Most cases have a history of pig exposure or have been exposed to a contaminated environment.

When an influenza virus that normally circulates in swine is detected in a person, it is called a variant influenza virus and is labeled with a "v". Influenza viruses such as H1N1(v) and other related variants are not unusual in swine and can be directly transmitted from swine to people and from people to swine. When humans are in close proximity to live swine, such as in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs, movement of these viruses can occur back and forth between humans and animals.

The illnesses resulting from H1N1(v) infection are similar to seasonal influenza. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, decreased energy, coughing, runny nose, and sore throat.

Today's [7 Jun 2021] report mentions that 3 of the patient's contacts had "flu-like" symptoms, but they were unable to identify H1N2v in any of them. As it isn't stated, we don't know the timing of the testing of these contacts, which might have affected the ability to detect a specific subtype. In any event, despite the plural tense in the translated title, the CDC found no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

The (translated) statement from Taiwan's CDC follows:

"There have been cases of H1N2v influenza virus isolated from patients with respiratory diseases in China, and the patients have recovered. The Department of Disease Control urges the public to do a good job in personal health management.

"The Department of Disease Control said today [7 Jun 2021] that it received a notification from the hospital in April [2021] that a 5-year-old girl living in the central area with a mildly ill patient with influenza had isolated a type A influenza virus that cannot be subtyped. The department further tested and sequenced the gene as the H1N2v influenza virus.

"[Three of 6] close contacts of the investigated cases had influenza-like symptoms, and no H1N2v influenza virus infection was found after inspection. Agricultural administration units and relevant medical and veterinary experts were invited to hold a meeting to discuss and make judgments based on the above-mentioned existing epidemiological investigation results. This case should be a sporadic case, similar to past international cases. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The health and agricultural administration units will continue to strengthen human, animal and environmental monitoring.

"The Department of Disease Control pointed out that the girl had never gone abroad and was engaged in livestock breeding at home. She developed runny nose and cough on 12 Mar 2021. She developed fever on 13 Mar 2021 and went to the doctor for persistent fever on 14 Mar 2021. The flu is fast. The screen was positive for type A. The doctor assessed that there is no need to be hospitalized. After prescribing influenza antiviral drugs, [she] returned home and has recovered. On 5 Apr 2021, the H1N2v influenza virus was isolated from the girl's respiratory tract specimen, and tests for common respiratory tract infections such as adenovirus, respiratory fusion virus, coronavirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus were all negative. In addition, the agricultural administration unit also collected specimens from pigs from the pig farms operated by the case's family, and the results showed that no H1N2 influenza virus was detected.

"International H1N2 is a low-pathogenic influenza virus that exists in pigs. It rarely spreads among people, but there are occasional reports of human infection. A total of 30 confirmed cases of H1N2v influenza worldwide from 2012 to 2021 are distributed in the Americas, with the United States [having] the most cases, followed by Brazil. Most cases have a history of pig exposure or have been exposed to a contaminated environment, and they will not be infected by eating meat. The gene sequence of the virus isolated from the patient this time is the closest to the H1N2 influenza virus strain isolated from pigs in the country in the past, but it is not the same, and it is sensitive to antiviral drugs such as Ke flu and Relenza.

"The Department of Disease Control reminds that to prevent new type A influenza, people should follow the principle of "5 musts and 6 nos"; "5 musts": meat and eggs must be cooked, hands must be washed with soap, symptoms appear, wear masks, and promptly seek medical treatment and inform the profession and contact history, people who have been in contact with poultry and livestock for a long time should be vaccinated against influenza, a balanced diet and appropriate exercise; "6 nos": do not eat raw poultry eggs or products, do not smuggle and buy meat from unknown sources, do not contact or feed animals, do not leave them in the wild, discard animals at will, do not mix breeding animals with other poultry, and do not go to places with poor air circulation or crowded people.

[Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.

All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)], and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.
