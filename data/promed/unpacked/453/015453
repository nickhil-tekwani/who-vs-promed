Two brothers are amongst the latest children to be diagnosed with scarlet fever. A 4-year-old and his 18-month-old brother are both on antibiotics and recovering after contracting the condition in recent days.

Their mother, 29, of Carrington, said her 4-year-old 1st began showing signs of having the infection after coming home from Haydn Road Primary School in Sherwood on Thu 13 Mar 2014.

She said: "He didn't seem very well, and his teacher said he fell asleep at break-time, which was unusual. He woke up Friday [14 Mar 2014] morning saying his throat really hurt, and he couldn't swallow. His throat was scarlet and his tonsils were swollen. I rang the school, and they were excellent and said to listen to the doctor's advice and don't bring him in. As the day went on, he got worse and was vomiting, had a high temperature, and was shivering."

The 4-year-old's condition worsened further on Saturday [15 Mar 2014], leading [his mother] to call out-of-hours doctors working for Nottingham Emergency Medical Services (NEMS).

She said: "It was really scary. His tongue was swollen with a white coating and red spots poking through. A rash then started to appear on the back of his hands, and spread until he was completely covered."

His mother said [her other son] also started showing symptoms on Sunday [16 Mar 2014], while she and her husband had also been diagnosed with tonsillitis as a result of the infection's presence in their home. She said: "Thankfully, [her younger son] has been a lot milder. It's all come completely out of the blue. They had always been healthy."

Haydn Road Primary School is now the 8th school the Post is aware of where there have been cases of children with scarlet fever in recent weeks. The school's head teacher, Sarah Fielding, was unavailable for comment when approached by the Post. The other schools to have had cases of scarlet fever are Ollerton Primary School, Jesse Gray Primary School in West Bridgford, Chaucer Infant and Junior in Ilkeston, Mapperley Plains Primary School, Whitegate Primary School in Clifton, Ashfield Plaza Day Nursery in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, and Netherfield Primary School.

In the 1st 8 weeks of this year [2014], 46 cases of scarlet fever were confirmed in Notts, in addition to the 9 cases that arose last week. This compares with 15 cases the 1st 8 weeks of last year [2013] and 156 recorded in the county for the whole of 2013.

Meanwhile, [another] mother of 2 also contacted the Post to say her 4-year-old son had scarlet fever as far back as December [2013]. It led to him having time off from Bluebell Hill Primary School, in St Ann's, in the lead up to Christmas. She said the school had sent text messages to parents in the last week asking them to be on the lookout for symptoms. "Parents should look for the quick onset of the fever; that's the biggest sign," she said. "Normally, when your child gets ill, it's gradual, but this was immediate."

Jonathan Gribbin, consultant in public health at Nottinghamshire County Council, said: "Symptoms include an initial sore throat, headache, and a high temperature, with red blotches or a rash developing later. Once diagnosed, it's also important to keep children out of school and away from other people until they have been on a course of antibiotics for at least 24 hours."

[ProMED-mail previously posted 5 reports on outbreaks of scarlet fever in diverse regions of the UK in the past several weeks: One outbreak occurred in Dundee, a city in the Tayside region of Scotland, which lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay (Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (04): (Scotland) RFI 20140306.2317827); a 2nd in the counties of Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset in the South West Region of England (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (03): (England) RFI 20140304.2311992); a 3rd in the East Midlands Region of England that extends to the North Sea coast (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (02): England 20140302.2308816), and a 4th in Cumbria in the North West Region of England (ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK: England, alert 20140215.2279072.)

The previous ProMED-mail report on scarlet fever in the East Midlands Region on 2 Mar 2014 involved Lincolnshire (Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (02): England 20140302.2308816). The news report above concerns an outbreak of scarlet fever in the adjacent county of Nottinghamshire to the immediate west of Lincolnshire. A map that shows the spread of infection across Nottinghamshire can be found at: http://www.nottinghampost.com/Scarlet-fever-New-map-shows-spread-infection/story-20814490-detail/story.html.

Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular typing methods such as multilocus sequencing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis will be necessary to see whether there is commonality among the outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate updated information on the epidemiology of the outbreaks in the affected regions, as well as information on the molecular characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved.
