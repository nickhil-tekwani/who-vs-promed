[Remember that thus far all newly confirmed cases have had dates of onset in 2019, making 2019 a very serious year for polio-eradication efforts and for the children who have been affected by this increase in activity. One observation that is "front and center" is that there were more cases of paralytic disease associated with the attenuated viruses used in the OPV (oral polio vaccine) than there were associated with infection with the wild poliovirus. The global tally of cVDPV-associated polio for 2019 is presently at 259, whereas the global tally of WPV1-associated polio for 2019 is 163 (although with the additional case reported in Pakistan in the past 24 hours there are now 164 WPV1-associated cases).

The impact of the outbreak of cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria, includes outbreaks in Togo, Benin, Niger, and Ghana. Countries with major outbreaks include Angola, with 88 cases reported during 2019, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with 63 cases.

This week's report is sobering, as active cases have been reported from Pakistan (WPV1), Angola (cVDPV2), Benin (cVDPV2), Central African Republic (CAR) (cVDPV2), Ghana (cVDPV2), Philippines (cVDPV2), and Togo (cVDPV2). In addition, there is evidence of continued circulation of both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2 in Malaysia with positive environmental samples.

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Philippines (BARMM): 2 newly confirmed cases
Date: Wed 15 Jan 2020

Philippines situation report 13 - Polio outbreak - 15 Jan 2020
-----------------------------
Highlights
- Two new cases with cVDPV2: a 2-year-old and a 3-year-old boy from Maguindanao in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM);
- Currently 11 human cases confirmed with cVDPV2, 1 case with cVDPV1, 1 case with VDPV1, and 1 case with immunodeficiency-related VDPV type 2 (iVDPV2);
- 3 cVDPV1 cases from Sabah, Malaysia, are all genetically linked to the Basilan case;
- Limited polio outbreak immunization in areas affected with VDPV1 conducted in Zamboanga and Isabella (Region IX), Lambayong (Region XII), and the island provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi (BARMM) vaccinated 689 273 children under 10 (93.2% of the target) on [6-12 Jan 2020]; 2 more rounds are planned for the same areas and children on [17 Feb-1 Mar 2020] and [23 Mar-4 Apr 2020];
- Preparations ongoing for 3 more rounds against poliovirus type 1 and 2 in Mindanao targeting 3.3 million children under 5 up to April 2020;
- Additionally, 2 more rounds planned in National Capital Region (NCR) against poliovirus type 2 targeting 1.4 million children under 5 up to March 2020. Department of Health (DOH), UNICEF, and WHO experts conducted orientation on 10 Jan [2020];
- 2.9 million doses of monovalent oral polio vaccine against poliovirus type 2 (mOPV2) were shipped through UNICEF for NCR, with a further 300 000 doses still needed to complete all pending rounds;
- Airport closure due to the eruption of the Taal volcano near Metro Manila is causing some delay in the deployment of consultants;
- Current polio outbreak resulting from persistently low routine immunization coverage and poor sanitation and hygiene;
- Philippines is affected by both cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. cVDPV is considered a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1)
3 cVDPV1 cases from Sabah state, Malaysia, were confirmed to be genetically linked to the Basilan case by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia. Since the viruses are genetically linked, they are classified as circulating. All 13 cVDPV1 environmental samples found in Manila are genetically linked.

The VDPV1 case from Lamboyang, Sultan Kudarat (Region XII), is not genetically linked to the Basilan and Malaysia cases and is therefore not categorised as circulating.

Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)
Two new human cases were confirmed with cVDPV2: a 2-year-old from Shariff Saydona, Mustapha, and a 3-year-old boy from Datu Hoffer, both in Maguindanao (BARMM), bringing the total number of human cases to 11. All cases were reported from Mindanao (BARMM and Region XII), whereas the 17 confirmed environmental samples were found in NCR and Davao. The iVDPV case from Laguna is not linked to the cVDPV2 cases.

All samples were tested by the National Polio Laboratory at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM), whereas sequencing and genetic analysis is done at the NIID in Japan, with additional genetic characterization provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Response
Risk assessment
The risk for further polio transmission continues to be assessed as high at the national level with an increasing number of human cases and environmental samples testing positive for poliovirus type 1 and 2, because of chronically suboptimal immunisation coverage, sub-optimal performance of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, and poor sanitation and hygiene conditions. With 3 cVDPV1 cases from Malaysia confirmed to be related to the one Philippine cVDPV1 case, the regional risk of potential spread across international borders remains moderate, especially considering the large number of overseas Filipino workers (OFW) and the ease of travel between islands without any form of control, especially by traders from Mindanao.

Overall risk
National: high
Regional: moderate
Global: low

[This Situation report gives details on all aspects of the polio outbreaks ongoing presently in the Philippines. There apparently continues to be transmission of cVDPV1 in Manila with all isolates genetically related, but no cases of paralytic disease have been identified related to this cVDPV1. The major activity with paralytic cases is occurring in the south of the country in the Mindinao region, where the 2 newly confirmed cases reside.

I highly recommend interested parties go to the source URL and read the entire situation report to get a good detailed report on the polio outbreaks in the Philippines and control efforts.

[3] Philippines: 4 newly confirmed cases

Four more children have been stricken with polio, bringing the total number of polio cases in the country to 16 since the outbreak was declared in September 2019.

Quoting the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Thursday [16 Jan 2020] that the new cases involved 2 boys from Maguindanao, aged 2 and 3 years old, a 2-year-old boy from Sultan Kudarat, and a 3-year-old boy from Quezon City. The boys had fever, diarrhea, muscle pain, asymmetric ascending paralysis, and weakness of extremities, the DOH said in a statement.

The DOH has extended its Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio (SPKP) campaign to ensure that no child is left unvaccinated and to boost protection for those already vaccinated.

The new campaign is scheduled from [20 Jan 2020] to [2 Feb 2020] in all regions of Mindanao, and from [27 Jan 2020] to [7 Feb 2020] in the National Capital Region.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III urged all parents and caregivers of children under 5 to take part in the vaccination. "Have your children, including those with private physicians or pediatricians, vaccinated with oral polio vaccine (OPV) by health workers and bakunators. Additional polio doses can provide additional protection to your children. There is no overdose with the oral polio vaccine," Duque said in a statement.

The DOH and local government units aim to accomplish a 95% polio vaccine coverage in all identified areas for every SPKP round.

The DOH also urged all health facilities to strengthen their acute flaccid paralysis surveillance to put a halt to the polio outbreak threatening the country.

[While this report mentions 4 newly confirmed cases, 2 of these cases were reported in this week's update above. Disturbing news is the occurrence of a case in Quezon City, which is part of the Metro Manila area and considered the most populous location in the Philippines. The other newly confirmed case is from Sultan Kudarat, located in the Mindinao region. Dates of onset of these 2 newer reported cases would be helpful to know if they have preceded control measures or are occurring in areas after control measures were implemented. - Mod.MPP]

[4] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): 1 newly confirmed case
Date: Wed 15 Jan 2020
Source: The Nation [edited]
https://nation.com.pk/15-Jan-2020/new-polio-case-reported-from-lakki


The National Institute of Health (NIH) has notified a new wild poliovirus (WPV) case from district Lakki Marwat that has taken the district cases count to 32 and 92 in the province. According to details, the wild poliovirus has been isolated from the stool sample of a 25-month-old male child from union council Tajazai, Tehsil Lakki Marwat, district Lakki Marwat. The epidemiological study of the children shows that the family [refused] essential immunisation, and the affected child was zero dose for essential immunisation, while their SIAs history is under investigation.

Coordinator of the EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Abdul Basit, while commenting on the reporting of a new polio case from district Lakki Marwat, regretted that another child is crippled by polio due to misconceptions of the family. He said that polio has turned into an epidemic and is on fire in southern districts, especially Bannu division, as 66 children were left with permanent disabilities in the division.

"It should be enough as an eye-opener for the people of Lakki Marwat and Bannu who are resisting polio vaccination and were, therefore, responsible for the lifelong disability of their children," he said. He added that the polio vaccine was completely safe, and Halal and the entire world, including Muslim countries, have eradicated polio using the same vaccine.

[5] Nigeria: Violence against polio teams
Date: Thu 16 Jan 2020

http://saharareporters.com/2020/01/16/bandits-attack-polio-vaccination-centre-kill-two-health-workers-zamfara


Bandits in Zamfara have killed 2 health workers supervising a polio vaccination round in the state, according to a report by PUNCH.

The attack is said to have happened in Makosa Village, a precinct of Zurmi local government area [LGA].

An eyewitness said the bandits stormed the village at noon and went straight to the primary healthcare centre, where the vaccination was going on.

"They asked everyone to submit their belongings, but the health workers, [LS] and [LM], were shot for failing to comply. After robbing the people of their belongings, the bandits also carted away their animals," the source said.

The police spokesperson in Zamfara confirmed the killing, saying, "Those who launched the attack are part of the recalcitrant bandits who stormed the village with the intention of committing robbery. The information we received was that the 2 health workers lost their lives because they didn't surrender their handsets to the hoodlums, who in turn became angry and killed them."

[Violence against polio vaccination teams continues to occur. This does not bode well for the polio-eradication effort.

Zamfara is a state located in the northwest of Nigeria where there has been violence and civil unrest in the past. Hopefully this episode is truly bandits and not really directed at the polio program (see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zamfara,+Nigeria/@12.0099772,4.9634646,8z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x11b6f9e0373bad61:0x916d1c5e3f110709!8m2!3d12.1844159!4d6.2375947). - Mod.MPP
