Thousands of mango trees in the UAE have been hit by a disease
resulting in high tree mortality, officials said. A fungus called
_Ceratocystis manginecans_, commonly known as mango killer, was
identified as the cause of the disease. If left untreated, the
disease has the potential to wipe out entire farms.

In response, the Ministry of Environment and Water has geared up to
protect the trees by containing and controlling the disease. "The
disease leads to rapid deterioration of the mango trees. Once
infected, the trees die within 6 months," reports the ministry. The
ministry is currently working to save the mango farms and will
implement serious measures to fight the infection and prevent its spread.

The fungus prevents the movement of water and nutrients from the
roots to the branches and the twigs. The symptoms of the disease
include sudden browning and wilting of leaves. This then progresses
gradually to the drying out of branches until the whole plant dies.
Insects such as bark beetles [presumably] act as vectors in spreading
the fungus.

The disease first appeared in the UAE in 2005 in the eastern region.
Since then, it has spread to other areas including Bitnah, Masafi,
Dadna, Dibba and Kalba. In Oman, the same infection was reported in
2000 and resulted in a huge decline of yield. The cause of the
disease remained unknown for a long time. Researchers in Oman were
finally able to successfully identify the fungus causing the disease.

[The disease described above is usually referred to as sudden decline
(or sudden wilt) of mango. It is of great economic importance since
the trees die within a very short time. The fungi _Lasiodiplodia
theobromae_ or/and _Ceratocystis fimbriata_ have been reported to be
associated with this wilt in different areas. In 2009, 2 additional
fungal species were isolated from affected mango trees in Oman and
classified as new species: _C. manginecans_ and _C. omanensis_
(ProMED-mail post 20091214.4240). The report above appears to be the
1st time these new species have been identified outside Oman.

It has been suggested that nutrient deficiencies and environmental
stress factors may increase the susceptibility of mango trees to
sudden decline. Bark beetles (_Hypocryphalus mangiferae_) were
previously shown to carry _C. fimbriata_ and _L. theobromae_ and are
also thought to be responsible for transmitting the new species.

Some fungicides were found to be helpful if applied quickly enough,
but genetic resistance is considered the best means of disease
management. Control programmes established in Oman use exotic
rootstocks from various countries with degrees of resistance to
sudden decline which are grafted with scions of local varieties. It
is hoped that this will produce trees suitable to local conditions
but showing resistance to the pathogens.
