Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) begins toxic clean-up
-----------------------------------------------
Ivory Coast has begun to make safe 11 sites contaminated by toxic
waste that killed at least 7 people and led to the resignation of the
cabinet. Thousands of people queued at hospitals and health centres
to get treatment for symptoms related to the toxic fumes.
A French company is carrying out the clean-up operation, which is
expected to take 2 weeks.
The clear-up began at Abidjan's main rubbish dump, the site worst
affected by the foul-smelling sludge.
"Technically, it is not very easy, we are talking about toxic waste,
so we have to be very careful," said Francois Salbaing, from France's
Seche group.
The 400 metric tons of waste contained a mixture of gasoline, water
and caustic washings. The government's slow reaction to the crisis so
enraged Ivorians that the cabinet was forced to resign and the
government reshuffled.
Many thousands of people have sought treatment for vomiting, stomach
pains, nausea, breathing difficulties, nosebleeds and migraines.
The company which chartered the ship which transported the waste,
Trafigura Beheer BV, says it informed the Ivorian authorities that
the waste should be disposed of correctly.
An inquiry is under way, and 8 people have been arrested so far.

French arrests over Ivorian waste
-------------------------------------
Two senior French officials of the company whose toxic waste has been
dumped in Ivory Coast have been charged with poisoning, an official says.
Dutch-based company Trafigura Beheer BV says it is "shocked," and
says the 2 had gone to help those affected by the waste, which has
left 7 dead. Trafigura has always maintained it paid Ivorian firms
and officials to dispose of the waste safely.
The Ivorian government has resigned over the scandal. Several senior
officials have also been suspended, and 8 Ivorians have been arrested.
Trafigura director Claude Dauphin, and its West Africa manager
Jean-Pierre Valentini were charged with poisoning and breaking toxic
waste laws, said justice ministry official Ali Yeo. They were
remanded in custody. Trafigura says the 2 men were initially
questioned merely as witnesses, a claim a police superintendent
refused to confirm. They were prevented from leaving the country on
Saturday [16 Sep 2006], as they were about to board a plane for
Europe. He said that an official report had been sent to Ivory
Coast's Criminal Investigation Department, and the matter was now in
their hands.
On Sunday [17 Sep 2006], the massive job of cleaning up the polluted
sites around the main Ivory Coast city, Abidjan, began.
It will take several weeks for the 400 metric tons of waste, which
contained a mixture of gasoline, water and caustic washings, to be
removed from all the 11 areas.
Ivorians are still heading to the hospitals in large numbers,
complaining of headaches, diarrhea and breathing problems.
The BBC's James Copnall in Abidjan says that until all the toxic
waste has been neutralized, the city's residents will continue to be
angry and scared.

[Clearly, 400 tons is a large toxic dump or spill. The mixture,
caustic washings, gasoline and, as a previous posting indicated,
hydrogen sulfide, are worse than a spill of one singe entity.
With gasoline in the mixture, as well as other things probably not
yet mentioned or identified, one should become concerned about the
type of soil this dumping has occurred on and the location of the
ground water relative to the site or sites. Many chemicals will pass
through soil to be found in ground water systems. One also wonders
whether there are prevailing winds or breezes that are carrying fumes
into more populated areas of the town as well.
The 2 source sites for these articles have photographs of portions of
the spill/dump sites. - Mod.TG]
