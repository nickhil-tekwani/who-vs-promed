Thus far in 1997, 10 dengue cases have been reported in Texas. Five of the
patients, residents of Cameron (2 patients) or Hidalgo (3 patients) County
along the Texas-Mexico border, were ill in October and early November. Two
of the five South Texas patients visited either Matamoros or Reynosa,
Tamaulipas, Mexico in the 15 days prior to onset of illness; the other 3
patients, 1 in Cameron Co. and 2 in Hidalgo Co., had not traveled.
The remaining 5 patients (3 with onset of illness in January, 1 with onset
in August, and 1 with onset in late September) reside in other areas of
Texas. They all had travel histories: two had been to Puerto Rico; the
others had been to Costa Rica, Trinidad, or Colombia.

[Mexico and the U.S.A. might be very serious as to where their borders are
but mosquitoes do not at all care. They just want a nice warm (blood) meal
and a place to rest their weary nonbones at night. Cases of dengue
indigenous to the USA have been reported nearly each year for many years.
This likely reflects the continuing situation in Mexico but is also
reflective of the presence of vector mosquitoes on the north side of the
border. That three patients "had not traveled" may be indicative only of a
lack of history of travel but those cases may also indicate isolated
person-to-person transmission near an endemic focus. Continued surveillance
for dengue in south Texas will certainly provide information useful for
control and prevention of further spread, should such a scenario present
itself. - Mod.CHC
