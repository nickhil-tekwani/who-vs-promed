A typhoid epidemic has broken out in the Wagoora area of north Kashmir's Baramulla district, where more than 300 patients are suffering from this waterborne disease, and the number is increasing with every passing day. On average, 20 patients [a day?] complaining of typhoid fever are treated at different private clinics in the area, which are without basic public health facilities.

The epidemic is directly traceable to the fact that a great proportion of the population had to drink water from the polluted Nalla Ningli [river], which is the main source of drinking water to dozens of villages in the area, medical experts say. They say the reason for typhoid fever is the pollution or infection in the Nalla Ningli, which houses over 100 toilets on its banks.

Cries are getting louder in the area that the villages of Wagoora Block need a storage reservoir to furnish a filtered water supply. The Wagoora Welfare Committee (WCC), which comprises over a dozen (12) members from different villages of the area, is demanding adequate health facilities. "We should have at least a Public Health Centre in Wagoora to keep a check on the waterborne diseases," said a WCC member, Ghulam Nabi Wani.

Medical experts say there has been an outbreak of typhoid fever about this time every year for the past 5 years. A pharmacist, Muteeb Ali, said he has a list of over 30 patients of Wagoora and knew also of 3 cases in Darwa and 15 in Manigam, the villages situated on the banks of Nalla Ningli.

"For the past 2 months, each day, I receive 4 fresh cases of typhoid from different villages of Wagoora area," said Ali. Others in the area estimated that more than 300 cases had occurred in the adjoining villages of Wagoora.

For the past 3 years, typhoid fever has been recurring in the area on a larger scale, said a local physician, Dr Reyaz Ahmad. "The main reason for the spread of typhoid is the infected water of Nalla Ningli, which is used for drinking and cleaning kitchen utensils," said Dr Reyaz.

The chief medical officer of Baramulla said: "It is not an epidemic. The number of these patients increases in every rainy season, and it happens in every district; Wagoora is not an exception."

Seven cases of typhoid have been reported in Taveuni [Northern Division] so far in 2013, says Health Ministry spokesman Shalvin Deo. He said they received 2 cases from Qamea, 2 from Matei, one from Dreketi in Somosomo, one from Navakawau in the south of the island, and one from Vatuulo Estate.

At Vuniwai in Naqara, which experienced an outbreak of typhoid 2 years ago, Mr Deo said the ministry was aware of the risk of the disease. "However, the cases we have received are very rare, and people need to take care with their daily hygiene," he said. "People need to wash their hands with soap and water before eating, after using the toilet, or while preparing food. We are advising people to have clean sanitary toilets and ensure they have a safe water supply."

Mr Deo advised people to boil drinking water before drinking and maintain clean homes and compounds free from roaming animals.
