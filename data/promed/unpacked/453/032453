Minister Veerman has decided today to significantly relax the export ban on
ruminants from the north Netherlands. Cows, sheep and goats for immediate
slaughter can be exported. Animals exported for other purposes should not
demonstrate clinical signs of bluetongue and should be tested serologically
and found negative before being exported.
The investigations performed so far have shown no spread of the disease in
north Netherlands. However, there are still suspected cases outside --
though adjacent to -- the 150-km zone around the Kerkrade focus, where
control and surveillance measures have been implemented. Moreover, a
relatively large number of animals had been transported from south to north
Netherlands preceding the outbreak; it is known that it might take up to 2
weeks for signs in infected animals to become visible. Consequently, the
Minister is of the opinion that it is too early to completely lift the
export ban. The current relaxation of measures minimises the losses.
In addition, the surveillance zone and protection zone have been combined
to form a restriction zone with a radius of 150 km, similarly to those in
Germany and Belgium. Since a case has been confirmed in Elsloo, the zone
boundaries have been increased by 20 km.

An outbreak of bluetongue virus in sheep and cows in Belgium spread further
after growing throughout the week, sowing alarm among livestock farmers hit
hard by a ban on live exports.
By Friday [25 Aug 2006] the country had recorded 37 cases of the
insect-borne viral infection, which causes fever and swelling in sheep,
turning their tongues blue. The count rose steadily in the week from 17 on
Wednesday and 28 on Thursday.
The disease affected sheep and cows in the east of the country, where
measures were put in place last weekend banning the movement of ruminant
animals around infected farms in the regions of Liege and Limburg.
Belgian health authorities on Thursday banned exports of live sheep and
cattle as well as live animal cells such as semen, ova and embryos,
following European Union regulations.
The disease is not known to affect humans.
If the ban lasts, it is likely to affect Belgium's up to 4000
veal-exporting farmers, the head of the farmers' federation for the
French-speaking Walloon region, Jean-Pierre Champagne, told AFP.
These farmers will find themselves burdened with up to 60 000 veal, he
said, most of them from the Netherlands where the outbreak started.
In this case, the federation would call for aid to fund a cull of animals,
he said. The Walloon region agriculture ministry has already called for a
fund to be set up to compensate farmers affected by the outbreak.
Belgium's federal food safety agency Afsca called for animals to be treated
with insecticide, instead of a systematic cull.
Cold weather may destroy the virus, according to Afsca, but Champagne
warned the outbreak could survive into the peak of the veal-exporting
season in September and October. [As a matter of fact, cold weather does
not destroy the virus but suppresses the activity of the vector. - Mod.AS]

[Subscribers are referred to the comprehensive paper by B.V. Purse et
al.(2005), "Climate change and the recent emergence of bluetongue in
Europe", published in Nature Reviews Microbiology 3, 2, 171-181.
The two BTV serotypes which have been recorded in southwestern Europe in
recent years are BTV2 and BTV4, which makes them plausible candidates for
the current (yet to be serotyped) epizootic. Obviously, this remains
speculative.
The apparent difference between the Netherlands -- where sheep are
reportedly the main affected species -- compared to Belgium and Germany --
where cattle seem to be clinically affected more severely than sheep -- is
rather puzzling. It would help to obtain information about the sheep breeds
exposed to infection in each of the countries; selective breed
susceptibility is one of the known characteristics of bluetongue. A
striking recent example was the high susceptibility of the Sardinian dairy
sheep compared to other breeds. - Mod.AS]
