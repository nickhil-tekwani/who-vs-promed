---------------------------------------------------
Fanconi syndrome (non-glycosemic glucosuria and proximal tubular
dysfunction) can be a result of heavy metal poisoning, in particular acute
cadmium poisoning. The livers of horses are not considered safe for eating
because they accumulate high levels of cadmium.
I can easily imagine a scenario where a manufacturer might substitute horse
livers for those of more wholesome animals for the purpose of widening the
profit margin, especially where the target consumer is non-human. One
wonders what is the usual base material of the imported pet chews.
Fanconi syndrome is also caused by _Aristolochia_ spp. in herbal medicines,
but I can't see why anyone would gratuitously adulterate a pet food with
herbal medicines.

[Unfortunately, alterations of food by many means, including accidental,
can and do occur. So although herbals might not be intentional, it could
happen.
Although horse livers do accumulate cadmium, the horse can also suffer from
such accumulation of cadmium. Undoubtedly, if this were to be the case,
then the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) would have something to say
about misbranded products. - Mod.TG]
