Pelicans poisoned
-----------------
The death of 2 pelicans from botulism on the Cooks River last week
[week of 12 Jan 2009] has wildlife rescue services worried about an
outbreak of the disease.

Cooks River Valley Association president Peter Munro said the
poisoning deaths might be linked to a fish kill in December [2008]
caused by aluminium from paint discharged into a stormwater drain.

"Maggots [on dead birds], which are immune to the bacteria, get eaten
by fish and birds, causing it to spread up the food chain," he said.

A 3rd pelican found floating on the river by Earlwood couple Juliet
Barr and Peter Crutchfield is expected to die.

Australian Seabird Rescue president Marny Bonner said the botulism
toxin is produced by bacteria in decaying animal and vegetable
matter. Once ingested by birds it paralyses the neck and limbs and
most die within 48 hours.

"The bacteria flourish in warmer conditions and is getting worse
because of the run-off of fertilisers and dog excrement which raises
the pH level in waterways," she said. "It is the most significant
disease, killing millions of waterbirds including waders, ducks, and
spoonbills every year."

The service rescued about 60 affected pelicans in New South Wales
(NSW) this summer [2008].

The disease is only transmitted through ingestion and there is no
risk to humans handling sick or dead birds.

A NSW Department of Environment spokeswoman said no tests were being
done to confirm the presence of botulism and the department had
received no reports of the 2 poisoned pelicans.

Botany Bay Planning and Protection Council president Bernie Clarke
said people should not swim or fish in the Cooks River.

Insufficient tests were done on cryptosporidium parasites also caused
by decaying carcasses and run-off, Mr Clarke said.

Report sick and injured birds to the department's 24-hour pollution
line, 131 555.

[The environmental conditions (nutrients, temperature, etc) in
several regions of Australia seem to be right for the bacteria
_Clostridium botulinum_ to flourish, producing the toxin botulinum.
