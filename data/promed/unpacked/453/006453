The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 27 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 885, of which 820 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there have been 555 deaths (490 of confirmed and 65 of probable cases);
- 27 suspected cases under investigation;
- 6 new confirmed cases, including 5 in Katwa and 1 in Kalunguta. The new case confirmed in Kalunguta is a known contact of a confirmed case of Katwa who had refused follow-up and vaccination;
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Kalunguta (all community deaths);
- 1 recovery released from the Beni ETC.

**Database clean-up in progress: revision of the database of those who have recovered. We will start sharing the number of recoveries as soon as the revision is complete.**

News of the response
Minister's visit to Butembo
---------------------------
- On Thu 28 Feb 2019, the minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, accompanied by the representative of the WHO in the DRC, went to Butembo to inquire about the situation on the ground following the 2 arson [events] that destroyed Ebola treatment centers [ETCs] in Katwa and Butembo.
- These 2 incidents greatly disrupted the response teams. For several days, these teams have been the target of attacks and threats that have significantly slowed down the response activities, particularly the follow-up of contacts, the investigation of alerts, the vaccination of contacts, and the prevention and control activities. Thus, a significant upsurge of cases in health areas of Katwa and Butembo in the coming days is expected. The minister met with members of the sub-coordination and field teams to reassure them of the full support of the Ministry of Health.
- With the mayor of the city and the coordinator of the Butembo sub-coordination, the minister visited the sites of the 2 burned ETCs. The minister emphasized to the mayor of Butembo that it will be impossible to control the epidemic in the city until the security of the response team is assured.

Vaccination
-------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 84 361 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

- 4 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo;
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo (all community deaths).



News of the response
Attack on Butembo Ebola treatment center
----------------------------------------
- On the evening of Wed 27 Feb 2019, unidentified gunmen attacked the Butembo ETC co-managed by Médecins Sans Frontières and the Ministry of Health. This attack took place only 3 days after the arson attack of the Katwa ETC, the neighboring health zone.
- At the time of the attack, 38 suspected patients and 12 confirmed patients were being treated at the ETC. Of the suspected patients, 32 fled. And among the confirmed cases, 8 were found in their single rooms. Research is under way to find the 4 confirmed ill fugitives. All the patients found, as well as the medical staff, are safe and unharmed. The patients were temporarily transferred to the Butembo transit center operated by Alima [Alliance for International Medical Action].

Workshop on the implementation of the 3rd strategic response plan (SRP)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- On Tue 26 Feb 2019, the minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, opened in Goma the workshop on the implementation of the 3rd strategic response plan (SRP 3) for the Ebola epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. This workshop brought together all the national and international actors of the response, including all the health authorities of the different health zones of the region.

The purpose of the 2-day workshop was to explain the SRP 3 to all local health authorities, senior staff of strategic coordination and sub-coordination, as well as to give them ownership of the plan to ensure better implementation.
This new plan focuses on 3 important areas:
1. The anchoring of the response in the local health system: The leadership and the expertise of the response belong to the specialized teams, while the optimization of the functioning of the health system is the responsibility of the actors of the local health system (Provincial Division of Health, Health Zone, and Health Area).
2. The establishment of an information management system: The information management mechanism has been strengthened to improve data collection and analysis at all levels.
3. The importance of accountability: An important addition in SRP 3 is the accountability framework for each stakeholder involved in the response, both local providers and international partners. This accountability framework clearly identifies the roles and responsibilities of each organization in the response to assess their performance on the ground.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 84 094 persons have been vaccinated.

News of the response
Revision of databases
---------------------
- The different databases are being revised to check and harmonize them. In discussion with the different partners involved in epidemiological surveillance, the decision was made to reclassify all cases in the health zone where their symptoms of the disease started. Several questions arose as to the classification of some cases that had moved between 2 or even 3 health zones between the onset of symptoms and death. In these particular cases, only thorough investigations can determine where the person started to show signs of the disease, which may take several days. Pending the results of the investigations, some of these cases are tentatively classified in the health zone where they were detected.
- Among these cases, there is the patient from Katwa [North Kivu] who fled to Bunia [Ituri] with her family after falling ill in her area of residence but whose body was found in Komanda [Ituri]. This patient was initially classified in Komanda but was reclassified to the Katwa health zone after completion of the in-depth investigation.
- On Tue 26 Feb 2019, Lubero district [North Kivu] chief medical officer stated that a case of Ebola had been detected in the health zone of Lubero. This is a young woman from Katwa [North Kivu], who was known to be in contact with another confirmed case and who refused to be transferred to the Ebola treatment center when she became ill. She ran away from Katwa to Lubero. She died the next day at the Lubero General Referral Hospital from where the alert was launched. This patient was classified in the health zone of Katwa, where her 1st symptoms appeared.

Vaccination

The health zone of Lubero [North Kivu] is the new health entity entering the Ebola epidemic. The confirmation was made on Mon 25 Feb 2019 by the chief doctor of the health zone. A confirmed case of Ebola has indeed died at the reference general hospital of Lubero. [See MoH report above] The response teams are deployed on-site to stop the threat.

The 1st action by the WHO and MSF team present at the Lubero General Referral Hospital is the dignified and secure burial of the confirmed fatal case. The funeral took place on the evening of Sat 23 Feb 2019 in Ngeleza, East of Lubero-Center. On Sun 24 Feb 2019, the team of health professionals proceeded to identify the 1st contacts of the victim. According to medical sources, at least 86 contacts were identified on Mon 25 Feb 2019. Our sources informed that vaccination of these 1st contacts -- those taking care of the deceased and the family members -- has started.

For the moment, the sensitization sessions have started at the Lubero-Center and all over the health zone. The Lubero health area is the 6th area affected by Ebola in the territory of Lubero.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the last 21 days (6-26 Feb 2019), 77 new cases have been reported from 33 health areas within 9 health zones (figure 1), including: Katwa (45), Butembo (19), Vuhovi (4), Kyondo (3), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (1), Beni (1), Mandima (1), and Rwampara (1).

Although there are decreasing trends in case incidence (figure 2), the high proportion of community deaths reported among confirmed cases and relatively low number of new cases who were known contacts under surveillance could increase the risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case incidence and contact tracing activity, as well as in areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission. Following attacks this week on the treatment centres in Katwa and Butembo, WHO is working with partners to ensure the safety of the patients and staff. These incidents are disruptive to the response on many levels and can also hamper surveillance activities in the field.

As of 26 Feb 2019, 879 EVD cases (814 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (499) were female and 30% (264) were children aged less than 18 years. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Overall, 553 deaths (case fatality ratio: 63%) have been reported and as of 19 Feb 2019, 257 survivors have been reported. There is ongoing cleaning of the case database to correct the number deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs).

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/msf-pulls-staff-drc-ebola-hot-spot-after-attacks
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Attacks on Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) outbreak epicenter continued to reverberate a day after the strike on the Butembo facility, with Doctors Without Borders (MSF) evacuating medical staff from the area amid a report of causalities in security services and efforts to find patients who fled the violence.

Along with fresh details about the attack, WHO called the events deplorable and warned that the aftermath could increase transmission.

MSF suspends patient care in hot spot
-------------------------------------
MSF said assailants set some of the Butembo compound's facilities and vehicles on fire, and while the blazes were contained and no staff or patients were hurt, teams were forced to stop patient care. The nonprofit organisation's ETC housed 57 patients at the time, including 15 with confirmed Ebola infections. All patients still in the ETC were transferred to a transit center.

Given a similar attack on an MSF facility in Katwa 3 days earlier that killed a caregiver, "MSF has evacuated staff from the area for their safety pending a thorough analysis of the risks associated with continuing to provide medical care there," the organization said in a news release. Hugues Robert, MSF emergency desk manager, said in the release that the attacks endanger not only the lives of its staff members, but also the most vulnerable people at the heart of the response: the patients. "In light of these 2 violent incidents, we have no choice but to suspend our activities until further notice," he said. "As medical responders, it is very painful to have to leave behind patients, their families, and other members of the community at such a critical time in the Ebola response."

MSF also manages Ebola activities in the North Kivu province towns of Kayna, Luberu, and Goma and operates 2 Ebola isolation facilities in the Ituri province cities of Bwanasura and Bunia.

WHO: deplorable, disrespectful attacks
--------------------------------------
In a statement today [28 Feb 2019], WHO said the attacks affect people's lives and increase the risk of disease spread. "They are profoundly disrespectful of the dedicated work of local, regional and international responders," the agency said. WHO and its partners are working to ensure patient and staff safety, and efforts are under way to expand the Katwa transit center where patients at the damaged ETCs have been moved. A top priority is quality clinical care for patients, and staff are working to find 4 patients who fled during the violence, WHO said.

Though MSF and WHO staff are safe, security services sustained casualties, WHO added. The group also said it is working closely with partners to determine steps to ensure the overall Ebola response is maintained. In a separate statement summarizing the latest outbreak trends, the WHO said Katwa and Butembo are the areas of highest concern, though small clusters of cases continue to pop up across a broad area.

Though cases show a decreasing trend, the high proportion of community deaths and relatively low number of new cases from known contacts increase the risk of more transmission chains in affected communities, the agency said. And it worries that the attack on Katwa and Butembo ETCs could disrupt field activities.

Attack caused 32 patients to flee
---------------------------------
Late yesterday [27 Feb 2019], the DRC's health ministry shared new details about the attack on the Butembo ETC, which it said involved unidentified gunmen. Of the suspected patients, 32 fled, and, of the confirmed patients, most were found in their single rooms. But 4 fled, and efforts are under way to find them. The health ministry said all patients and medical staff are safe, and the patients were temporarily taken to a Butembo transit center run by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA).

The attack came just 3 days after a similar event in Katwa [24 Feb 2019] at another MSF ETC, less than a week since a nurse was abducted and killed in Vuhovi [20 Feb 2019].

Cases grow to 885, with surge expected
--------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the outbreak total continues to grow, and in updates yesterday and today [27-28 Feb 2019] the health ministry reported 10 more cases, including 8 in Katwa, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Kalunguta [North Kivu]. The patient from Kalunguta is a known contact of an individual from Katwa who refused follow-up and vaccination.

In today's [28 Feb 2019] update, the ministry said Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, the country's health minister, along with a WHO representative from the DRC, visited Butembo today. The visit included the 2 ETC arson targets, to assess the situation on the ground.

Kalenga said the incidents have greatly disrupted the Ebola response, and the attacks and threats have significantly slowed the Ebola response, especially contact follow-up, alert investigations, vaccination of contact, and infection prevention and control activities.

"Thus, it will be expected a significant upsurge of cases in health areas of Katwa and Butembo in the coming days," officials said, adding that Kalenga met with field teams to reassure them that they have full health ministry support. In meeting with Butembo's mayor today, Kalenga said the Ebola epidemic will be impossible to control without security assurances for field workers.

[The situation in Butembo and Katwa is very difficult. MSF has suspended patient care in these 2 locations for reasons of safety. WHO states it and its partners are working to ensure patient and staff safety, but there have now been 2 violent events. What can be done to protect the patients and staff? And without that protection, how will this outbreak in the DRC be brought to an end, even more, not expand geographically?

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/unknown-forces-attack-butembo-ebola-treatment-center

Unknown forces attack Ebola treatment center
--------------------------------------------
Today [27 Feb 2019] Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said an Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Butembo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was attacked, and reports on social media suggested the building had been set on fire. "Tonight another deplorable attack on an Ebola treatment facility has taken place, this time in the city of Butembo," said Hugues Robert, MSF emergency desk manager, in a news release. "This follows the attack last week [24 Feb 2019] on another MSF Ebola treatment center in nearby Katwa. This attack has not only put the lives of Ebola patients and their families in danger, but also those of MSF and Ministry of Health staff. [Our efforts are currently focused on the immediate safety of both staff and patients]"

Currently there is no word from MSF on the number of fatalities and injuries, if any. MSF's ETC in Katwa was set afire on 24 Feb 2019, and MSF was forced to suspend activities there yesterday [26 Feb 2019]. The Butembo ETC is the largest built in the 8 months the DRC has battled an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with new cases announced daily.

The region is home to dozens of paramilitary and rebel forces, most notably the Allied Democratic Forces. Since the outbreak began last August 2018, numerous outbursts of violence against healthcare workers and attacks on clinics have been reported. The rebel forces have also conducted disinformation campaigns about how Ebola is transmitted and treated.

According to data from MSF, as of 27 Jan 2019, the Butembo ETC had admitted 1400 patients, with Beni's ETC (1370 admissions) the 2nd busiest. And the Butembo center had confirmed 197 Ebola patients, compared with 41 at the Beni ETC.

The Katwa ETC, before the attack this week, had admitted 602 patients, including 49 confirmed cases, since December, according to an MSF update yesterday.

New wave of violence
--------------------
Butembo, along with Katwa, is one of the most active Ebola hot spots, reporting several new cases in recent days. The Katwa ETC attack resulted in one fatality. The 10 Ebola patients in treatment at the clinic, however, were safely transported to other ETCs. Yesterday [26 Feb 2019], MSF said the Katwa ETC would be closed indefinitely. On 20 Feb 2019, officials in the DRC said a nurse had been abducted and murdered in Vuhovi. The incidents may represent a new wave of violence that follows spikes of Ebola activity. In the early months of the outbreak, the violence was focused in Beni and Mblanka, the 1st cities to face the deadly virus.

[Congo's health ministry says 4 confirmed Ebola patients are missing after an attack [Wed 27 Feb 2019] on a treatment center in the eastern city of Butembo. It was the 2nd attack on an Ebola treatment center in the past week. Assailants attacked another center on [Sun 24 Feb 2019] in Katwa, killing one person and injuring another.

The ministry said late [on Wed 27 Feb 2019] that 32 of the 38 suspected Ebola patients fled. Those found, including 8 confirmed to have Ebola, have all been temporarily transferred to another center. The ministry is searching for the 4 missing patients, who are highly infectious.

WHO expresses concern over damage to Ebola treatment facilities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is deeply concerned about the recent attacks on the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)-run Ebola treatment centres on 24 Feb 2019 in Katwa and on 27 Feb 2019 in Butembo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Such attacks are deplorable for their immediate impact on lives and for the risk of spreading the disease further. They are profoundly disrespectful of the dedicated work of local, regional and international responders.

Following the most recent Butembo attack, WHO and partners are working to ensure the safety of the patients and staff. Patients have been transferred to the Katwa transit centre, which WHO is expanding to house and treat these additional patients. It is a priority of the response to ensure quality clinical care for the patients. Staff on the ground are also working to follow up with the 4 convalescent patients who sought shelter elsewhere during the violence.

MSF reported that their staff were safe. Likewise, WHO staff in the area are all accounted for. However, security services did experience casualties.

These attacks have occurred in areas with ongoing transmission of Ebola in the community and could lead to increases in transmission and result in more hardship for the local community. The violence and disruption to the treatment centres also make it difficult for Ebola responders to carry out field work.

WHO teams on the ground continue to work tirelessly to respond to the challenges. WHO is working closely with our partners to determine appropriate action to ensure the overall Ebola response is maintained. Working with the Ministry of Health and our partners, our priority continues to be to end the outbreak.

[Axios, abridged, edited]
https://www.axios.com/ebola-congo-deadly-violence-politicians-misinformation-fa8d3bbf-76f5-453b-8a48-a37186338402.html
[byline: Eileen Drage O'Reilly]

Anti-health worker rhetoric has led to deadly violence and setbacks for combatting the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the country's Ministry of Health and reports from international health organizations.

Why it matters: Doctors without Borders (MSF) announced [Tue 26 Feb 2019] it is closing its Ebola treatment center (ETC) in Katwa after a violent attack killed one person and forced staff and patients to flee. Continued violence against health care workers and treatment centers has severely damaged efforts to combat this deadly outbreak, as each pullback or break in treatment can allow the contagious virus to spread.

According to a DRC Health Ministry spokesperson, local politicians are using anti-Ebola-treatment rhetoric "just to gain popularity," which is fomenting a "high level of urban violence" in Katwa, a current epicenter of the outbreak that has now surpassed the number of cases in the previous epicenters of Beni and Mangina.

Background: This outbreak is more challenging than the prior 9 outbreaks, as it's the 1st in an area experiencing an active, decades-long conflict. The 2 affected provinces also haven't experienced the disease before.
- This creates the need to educate and push against misinformation, Daniel Lucey, adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University Medical School, tells Axios.

What's new: On 24 Feb 2019, there was a "traumatic" attack on the Ebola treatment center in Katwa, which ended up killing 1 person, partially burning down the facility, and forcing personnel and 10 patients to be evacuated, MSF announced.
- "This attack has crippled our ability to respond to what is now the epicenter of the outbreak," Emmanuel Massart, MSF's emergency coordinator in Katwa, said in a statement on Tue.
- "After some successes in stopping transmission in the initial epicenters of Mangina and Beni [North Kivu] -- and some ancillary locations such as Tchomia [Ituri], Mutwanga, and Masereka [North Kivu] -- the epidemic has spread from 4 to 19 health zones," MSF announced.
- "We increased security around ETCs as we constantly receive threats of attacks," DRC Ministry of Health spokesperson Jessica Ilunga tells Axios. "The attack in Katwa was incredibly shocking for health teams. We were lucky that patients did not escape and that we managed to transfer them safely to other facilities. But if there is another similar attack, we might not be as lucky."
- A spokesperson for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases tells Axios that patients from the Katwa facility were transferred to another center in Butembo.

"I really admire the people on the ground who are doing this day and night. ... Their lives are at risk and they're still doing it, but that's what it'll take to get this done," Lucey said.

Yes, but: Lucey also said he's "hopeful" that the same measures can be taken in Katwa that succeeded in Beni, the former epicenter where there's been no new cases for 23 days, with 1 exception -- a suspected case of sexually transmitted Ebola from a man who had been successfully treated.
- Very rarely, the Ebola virus can remain in a survivor's semen for months or even a year after it's no longer present in the blood, Lucey said.
- A synopsis in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases says more research is needed for studying immunologically protected body sites, like male gonads and parts of the eye, as potential new chains of transmission.

[Devex, abridged, edited]

[byline: Jenny Lei Ravelo]

Two attacks on Médecins Sans Frontières Ebola treatment centers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo within a span of 4 days have pushed the organization to rethink its strategy to gain trust among the local community.

A 70-bed treatment center in the district of Katwa -- the current epicenter of the epidemic -- was attacked on [Sun 24 Feb 2019], killing one and forcing MSF to shut down its operations in the district. A 2nd attack followed [Wed 27 Feb 2019], on a treatment center in Butembo. The incidents have prompted the organization to recognize the need for Ebola response actors to do a better job on community engagement.

"The control of the epidemic won't be achieved without the mobilization of the population, and it is clear that the actors of the response, MSF included, did not manage to gain this trust," Emmanuel Massart, MSF's emergency coordinator in Katwa, told Devex on [Wed 27 Feb 2019].

"If the response doesn't manage to win the trust of the people affected by Ebola, it is impossible to care for patients, and impossible to contain the outbreak," he added.

Assailants threw stones and set fire on parts of the MSF-managed facility in Katwa, destroying medical wards and equipment, according to a news release. All staff and patients were evacuated, except for one who reportedly died. It's unclear if the victim is a family member of a patient or nurse at the facility, as communicated by DRC's Ministry of Health.

On the night of the attack, 4 of the confirmed patients with Ebola from the Katwa center were transferred to Butembo, where MSF runs a 90-bed Ebola treatment center. With the fresh attack on the center on [Wed 27 Feb 2019], it's unclear how the organization's operations in the city will be impacted.

There is one other 20-bed transit center operating in the city, managed by the NGO Alliance for International Medical Action, where the 6 suspected Ebola patients evacuated from MSF's facility in Katwa were transferred. Additionally, MSF has ongoing operations in Bunia, Bwana Sura, Kayna, and Biena.

At the moment, the organization is rethinking its position in the context of the Ebola response in Katwa, which registered the greatest number of confirmed cases (231) and deaths (173), according to the latest statistics from the DRC Ministry of Health. But nothing has been decided yet, Massart said.

The incidents from this week were not isolated. This February [2019] alone, Massart said MSF was made aware of at least 30 incidents targeting Ebola responders in the city.

Community engagement could mean consulting the population on solutions, such as involving them in developing a strategy for health promotion, said Massart. MSF, he said, has trained and is working directly and well with the community in Kalunguta, Kanyunga, and Butuhé for infection protection, control, and health promotion. "Even if it is more challenging to replicate in big urban areas such as Butembo and Katwa, a similar approach needs to be applied," he said. "The response must be adapted to the context not the other way around," he added.

MSF emergency desk manager Hugues Robert said in a news release following the attack in Butembo that the organization is currently focusing efforts in bringing both its staff and patients to safety.

The Ebola epidemic is still not under control more than 6 months since the outbreak was determined in August 2018 in North Kivu province. While Ebola response actors were able to stop the transmission in the initial hotspots of Mangina and Beni, and some other locations, the epidemic has spread out to 19 other health zones. A total of 548 people have died from the outbreak, and a total of 872 cases have been reported to date.

On 13 Feb 2019, the country's health minister launched the country's new Ebola strategic response plan for February to July. But the plan, which requires a total of USD 148 million, has so far only received less than USD 10 million in pledges. In a news release, WHO's Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called on donors to continue supporting the outbreak response. "We have a shared responsibility to end this outbreak," he said

[4] Spread of Ebola
- Mon 25 Feb 2019. Spread of Ebola
[NPR, All Things Considered, abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/02/25/697073103/why-does-ebola-keep-spreading-in-congo-heres-a-major-clue?t=1551278052114

Why does Ebola keep spreading in Congo? -- it is spreading from visits to health clinics where there is no triage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The surge of confirmed cases in Katwa and Butembo -- 307 and rising -- is now the largest flare-up during the course of this outbreak, which has infected nearly 900 people since August [2018]. And WHO officials estimate that in about 1/5 of these recent cases, the person contracted Ebola at healthcare facilities.

When Yao [Yao is leading WHO's on-the-ground response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak] started visiting the clinics, it was pretty obvious how this was happening: Even government-run facilities such as large hospitals hadn't set up triage tents to separate possible Ebola patients from everyone else. "This disease is not well-known in this part of the country. It is the 1st time," Yao explains, even though Ebola has broken out in other parts of the DRC on multiple occasions.

Even more problematic, says Yao, are the hundreds of unofficial private health facilities in this area. Some are large operations. In many other cases, says Yao, "it's just a house -- a very old house." And often a crowded one at that. "In one bed putting 2 children." These facilities are also often short on supplies. "You can see people using several times the same gloves or the same equipment," including syringes, says Yao. Along with modern medicine, many facilities also offer traditional cures. (Indeed, health officials commonly refer to such facilities as "tradi-moderns.") And this too creates opportunities for infection, says Yao. That's because the traditional medicines are often diluted in water and put in a cup for the patient to drink. Then, he has noticed on his visits, the cup often isn't cleaned before it's passed on to the next patient.

In response to all these findings, Congo's government and the WHO are trying to reach out to every one of these health facilities in Katwa and Butembo. In conjunction with a range of nonprofit aid organizations, they are training the staff on infection control and providing them with necessary protective equipment. But it's a daunting task. Just finding all the private clinics is difficult because there's no official list, says Yao. Officials know about only the ones reported by Ebola patients.

Dr Cimanuka Germain of International Medical Corps, which is helping with the effort, says private clinics sometimes resist the help. For instance, when he told the staff of one clinic that they should report suspected Ebola cases to a hotline instead of treating them, their response was: "This is not possible for us." That facility treats about 65 patients a day, says Germain. They didn't want to lose business. Then there's the facility where Germain spent days training nurses on how to set up and operate a triage tent. 2 weeks ago he showed up for a surprise visit. "One of them was there without wearing gloves," Germain says, sighing incredulously. For Germain the takeaway was clear: "To change someone's behavior is not [a matter of] one day or 2 days -- you need time." He had been visiting weekly -- but from that point on he assigned 2 people from his organization to keep watch at the clinic all day every day. And he has done the same thing for the 11 other facilities working with International Medical Corps.

Officials are optimistic the watchdogging will work because of the success of similar efforts in a town called Beni -- about 40 miles [about 65 km] from Katwa. Last autumn [2018], Beni was the epicenter of the outbreak, with the number of cases ultimately topping 200. But over the last 3 weeks, the caseload there has dropped to nearly zero.

- Tue 26 Feb 2019. South Sudan: UN gives South Sudan USD 2m for Ebola prevention
[AllAfrica, abridged, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201902270006.html
[byline: Joseph Oduha]

The United Nations has given USD 2 million to South Sudan to support critical Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness activities in the country. The EVD activities are preventive measures to protect an estimated 440 000 people in high-risk areas, mostly in Equatoria, which borders the Ebola-hit DR Congo.

In its weekly briefs, the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) disclosed that the money would help to strengthen surveillance, build case management capabilities and enhance laboratory services and increase infection prevention and control in Western, Central and Eastern Equatoria.

"The implementation of the preparedness plan continues across border areas considered to be at high risk of EVD. These include entry screening of travellers at selected points, health facility and community-based EVD surveillance, and community engagement," the agency said. "Capacity for infection prevention and control, case management, and for safe and dignified burials is also being enhanced. 19 screening points are operational across the country." OCHA said further that several NGOs in Yei had already trained and deployed 40 community-based mobilisers in 5 communities for house to house sensitisation. Further, said the agency, the construction of a temporary holding unit had been completed in Nimule in Eastern Equatoria.

Twenty healthcare workers were trained on infection prevention and control, case management, and water, sanitation and hygiene activities in Juba, and another 40 health workers were trained in Maridi. About 56 health facility workers were also trained and given cell phones to help with reporting on surveillance, OCHA disclosed. Despite the preparedness response, the agency added that consistent access to areas outside Yei County remained a challenge due to insecurity.

On 29 Jan 2019, aid partners reported that they had failed to secure humanitarian access to Lasu in Otogo county to verify reports of the arrival of over 7000 returnees from the DRC, who would require EVD screening. "Efforts to secure access are continuing, to be able to reach areas as needed in February and March [2019] to undertake critical preparedness activities," OCHA noted. South Sudan populations residing along the borders with DR Congo have been living with fear of Ebola spread.
