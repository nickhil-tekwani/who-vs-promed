Fear of fowl pest mutation
--------------------------
With 2 cases of fowl pest [highly pathogenic avian influenza - HPAI] now
reported across the Dutch border, the authorities in Belgium are taking no
chances. After imposing a transport ban in the affected areas, they have
stepped up an emergency vaccination campaign to protect people from the
virus that causes fowl pest in chickens. All non-professional
chicken-rearers and others coming into contact with the animals are now
advised to get an anti-flu injection or to take antiviral medicines.
The move comes after a Dutch veterinarian died of pneumonia last Thursday
after catching avian flu while working at an infected poultry farm. The 57
year old vet had not been vaccinated or taken antiviral drugs. His death
has fueled fears that the virus has mutated to a human strain in much the
same way as an animal disease is believed to be the origin of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS). [Though there has been speculation, so far
there are no scientifically-based data indicating SARS' origin in animals.
- Mod.AS]
Experts, however, are playing down the chances that fowl pest could cause a
full-blown epidemic in humans. A World Health Organization spokesman said
on Saturday that the disease did not appear to spread easily from human to
human.
Dutch virologist Ab Osterhaus commented on national television that
mutation of the virus was theoretically possible but practically
improbable. He explained that this would require the exchange of DNA in a
human simultaneously infected with avian influenza and a similar human
variety. With the flu season over, the chances of that happening were
remote, he said.
In another interview this morning, Dr Osterhaus described the special
emergency measures taken by Belgium as "overkill". "The preventive
treatment of those few additional people doesn't make much sense," he
remarked. In his view, the approach adopted by the Dutch government should
be adequate, if followed meticulously. This means that all those involved
in the fight against fowl pest are obliged to take special precautions,
including vaccination and the use of antiviral drugs.

Independent inquiry into the death of a veterinarian
----------------------------------------------------
State secretary Ross (VWS) and minister Veerman (LNV) have decided to carry
out an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the death of the 57
year old veterinarian in Den Bosch from serious pneumonia. Since
fowl-plague [highly pathogenic avian influenza - HPAI] virus was detected
in the veterinarian's lungs, and while no other explanation for the
progression of his disease has been found, there is a strong indication
that his death is the outcome of infection with the HPAI virus.

Questions about the antiviral medication oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is oseltamivir (Tamiflu)?
Tamiflu is an antiviral medication [neuraminidase inhibitor. - Mod.SH]
active against influenza viruses.
2. How does it work?
It prevents the early multiplication of viruses in the body, so that cells
already infected do not reinfect other cells.
3. Why should oseltamivir be used?
Oseltamivir is used to prevent the infection of humans with the fowl-plague
virus during the fight against the epidemic. This way, the people exposed
to the virus through their activities in the infected holdings are
protected. Such people include assessors, veterinarians engaged in sample
collection and culling activities, or tenants, residents, and laborers on
the infected or suspected farms. In some cases the drug may be used to
treat people who are already infected with the virus.
4. Why should a flu jab [vaccination] be given in addition to oseltamivir?
The flu jab is the best way to prevent infection with the currently
circulating human influenza virus. This is crucial to prevent the fowl-pest
virus and the common [human] virus from co-infecting the same person,
enabling the creation of a new virus.
5. How long can oseltamivir be taken?
No data are available regarding the effects of extended use. Data from
prevention studies, however, showed no indications limiting its use for 6
weeks. Under [medical] supervision, the medication can be taken for longer
periods.
6. Does oseltamivir influence the ability to drive or use machinery?
As far as is known, oseltamivir does not affect driving fitness or the
ability to operate machinery.
7. Are alternative drugs to oseltamivir available?
No, at present no other neuraminidase inhibitors are available. [Zanamivir
is another neuraminidase inhibitor, introduced before oseltamivir, whose
efficacy appears to be similar. - Mod.SH]
8. Can oseltamivir be used during pregnancy?
No sufficient data on the use of oseltamivir in pregnant women are
available. Consequently, its use during pregnancy may be considered only
for cases in which the potential benefit for the mother outweighs the
potential risk to the fetus.
9. Can oseltamivir be used during breast feeding?
Here also, oseltamivir can be used only when the potential benefit for the
mother justifies the potential risk to the baby.

Confusion following doctor's death of fowl plague
-------------------------------------------------
The ministries of Public Health [VWS] and of Agriculture [LNV] have
different interpretations regarding the scope of the directives for people
engaged in the fight against fowl plague.
They have announced an inquiry into the death of a 57 year old veterinarian
from Rosmalen probably caused by the fowl-plague virus. [see 1].
State-secretary Ross of Public Health [VWS] said on Saturday evening on NOS
TV, "Should the veterinarian have taken the drug which is compulsory for
everyone in contact with infected birds (), then he would have been
protected against infection."
The victim's family said on Monday that no one told the veterinarian he had
to take the antiviral drug. He was engaged by the Animal Health Service
(GVD) in the fight against fowl plague, participating with 2 other vets in
a team which visited a farm to investigate a suspected case, where he
obtained several blood samples and took poultry manure [for
investigations]. The difference between the interpretations of the 2
ministries relates to the reason for the victim's non-use of the drug. In a
directive of 17 Mar 2003, VWS said, "all culling personnel and others who
maintain extended, intensive contact with possibly infected chickens
(should) receive preventive antiviral medication on a daily basis." The
veterinarian did not receive these drugs [from his employer? - Mod.AS].
It seems that the words "extended" and "intensive" were differently
interpreted. According to a spokesman from the LNV, these terms did not
cover the sampling during a first visit to a farm, but applied instead to
the culling activities of the National Inspection Service for Livestock and
Meat (RVV) and the veterinarians. On the other hand, according to the VWS,
any direct contact with (possibly) infected animal is "intensive". The only
"non-intensive" contact, according to them, was the installation of the
"entrance forbidden" bands (ribbons) around farms.
The colleagues of the late veterinarian in the GVD in Deventer decided on
Saturday to discontinue their visits to poultry farms until clear
directives are available. When the VWS produced its clearer guidelines
later that day, they renewed their work.

[The current HPAI outbreak, now covering 2 countries and threatening to
spread further in Europe, is characterized by its significant zoonotic
aspects. The experience gathered in the Netherlands, including the
described controversies regarding protection of humans, is unique and might
become essential for other countries; therefore it deserves detailed
reporting. We shall continue following this emerging outbreak with interest
and great concern, wishing the Dutch and Belgian authorities success in
their disease-control endeavors. - Mod.AS]
