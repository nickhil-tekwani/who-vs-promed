Potato cyst nematodes (_Globodera rostochiensis_), Altai region, Russia
In 30 districts of the Altai region potato fields are infested with the
golden potato nematode (_Globodera rostochiensis_) [Gs]. Weak to high
levels of infection are reported according to expert helminthologists of
the Territorial Management of Federal Service on Veterinary and
Plant-sanitary Inspection in the Altai region and Altai Republic.
Gs causes the dangerous potato disease globoderosis, which is of quarantine
importance for Russia. In infested fields, the 1st appearance of the
disease is seen after 5-6 years of cultivation. With increases in levels of
infection, the yield of the potato crop is reduced, its quality (amount and
weight of tubers) decreases, and the percent of starch and quantity of
vitamin C in tubers is also reduced.
Boris Banshchikov, deputy chief of Territorial Management of Russian
Agricultural Supervision for the Altai region and Altai Republic, has
declared that uncontrolled barter transactions, introduction of new
technologies of agricultural crop production, huge imports of the
foodstuffs, fodder and raw material are of special concern for the
phytosanitary service. They create an opportunity for drift and
distributions of new pathogens, especially such dangerous quarantine pests
as the pale potato nematode, already affecting potato cultivars and potato
hybrids.
The main requirement is that all potato producers sell only potatoes with
quarantine certificates. Constant supervision of the phytosanitary
condition of planted potato crops [is required], and experts in
phytosanitation laboratories should carry out these measures.

[To accommodate the potato cyst nematodes and related species having round
cysts, a new subgenus (_Globodera_) was erected and later elevated to
generic status in 1975. There are 2 species of potato cyst nematode (PCN)
affecting crops in Europe. The 'white' or 'pale' PCN (_Globodera pallida_)
is now believed to be the more dominant species, while the 'yellow' or
'golden' PCN (_Globodera rostochiensis_) still causes serious losses in
some areas. Together they are estimated to result in annual losses in
European potato production valued in excess of 200m BPS [USD 349 million].
A recent survey of soil samples taken by growers revealed that up to 60
percent of the land cropped with potatoes in the UK is infested with PCN.
Annual loss to the UK potato industry as a direct consequence of PCN has
been estimated at approximately 9 percent of crop value, worth around 43m
BPS [USD 75 million].
Disease management is traditionally by crop rotation, as it is recognized
that several years in the absence of potato cultivation will reduce the
population of nematodes to a significant degree; 7 years without potatoes
is a common recommendation. More recently, crop rotation has been
supplemented by use of resistant potato cultivars and nematicides
(fumigants or granular systemic compounds). An integration of these methods
can be used to keep the nematode population levels below economic
thresholds. Control on tomatoes is chiefly by soil fumigants.
Both species of potato cyst nematode are A2 quarantine pests for EPPO
(OEPP/EPPO, 1978; 1981). They are also of quarantine significance for APPPC
and NAPPO. In addition, _G. rostochiensis_ is a quarantine pest for CPPC
and IAPSC.
The nematodes are already established in most or all areas in the EPPO
region that are important for the cultivation of potatoes for consumption
or the production of starch; therefore, regular attention to control is
needed in such areas. Where domestic legislative measures are in force,
import regulations are justified to ensure comparable standards for
imported material. It is essential that areas of seed potato production be
kept as free as possible from these nematodes.
