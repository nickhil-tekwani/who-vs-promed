[This is the 1st H5N6 subtype detected in Germany. Given the recent detections of H5N6 in Switzerland and the Netherlands, it is likely that this German detection is the same strain. Additional information would be appreciated.

The current H5N6 strain circulating in Europe is a reassortant between the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus and a low pathogenicity H5N6 virus; see ProMED-posting 20171215.5506383. - Mod.CRD
