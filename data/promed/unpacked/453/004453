The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday announced an outbreak of Asia type 1
foot and mouth [FMD] among cattle in Huangzhong County, Qinghai
Province.[Latitude 36.4956, Longitude 101.5972; map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CH/6/Lushar.html>].
The outbreak has been restricted to the area after officials slaughtered 50
cattle, including the diseased ones, the ministry said in a statement it
posted on its Website. Some cattle died at pens of farmers of the Hongyagou
Village last Wednesday [16 Aug 2006?], it said. The state FMD lab confirmed
the disease on Friday [18 Aug 2006].

[We appreciate Dan Silver's added comment: "China has reported an outbreak
of FMD in Huangzhong County in Qinghai. Huangzhou County is in the eastern
part of the province. The previous posting on FMD in Qinghai
(20060730.2101) concerned Haixi Mongolian region, which is in the
north/northwest of the province".
An interactive list of the administrative divisions of Qinghai, including
accessible maps, is available at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_administrative_divisions_of_Qinghai>.
Modified stamping out does not seem to be overly effective, since the Asia
1 serotype seems to cover large parts of China. Mass vaccinations, applying
effective vaccines, repeated periodically and covering all susceptible
species, might have a better chance.
