Health officials in British Columbia are warning the public about a spike in cases of norovirus linked to eating raw BC oysters. In a bulletin issued Friday [18 Mar 2022], Vancouver Coastal Health said 50 people had presented with acute gastrointestinal illness since Monday [14 Mar 2022] after eating the shellfish raw. The health authority said norovirus had been confirmed through testing in some of the cases and was suspected in others. Symptoms of norovirus can include nausea, cramping, chills, fever, stomach pains, diarrhea, and vomiting, and generally occur within 12-48 hours of consumption of affected shellfish. The virus can be killed by cooking oysters to an internal temperature of 90 deg C (194 deg F), for 90 seconds before eating.

Health officials have not limited the sale of raw oysters, but the BC Centre for Disease Control issued a notice to businesses that sell them on Friday [18 Mar 2022], with recommendations on how to reduce risk. The BC CDC, local and federal officials, and the shellfish agency are investigating, and "affected harvest areas are being closed and will reopen when contamination is cleared," Vancouver Coastal Health said.

In 2016 and 2017, more than 400 people across Canada fell ill after eating raw BC oysters. The BC CDC later said it believed the outbreak was linked to norovirus in sewage carried by ocean currents combined, combined with cold weather that helped the virus to survive.

Anyone who becomes ill after eating oysters is being asked to report it to Vancouver Coastal Health at (604) 675-3800 or by e-mail to <EHVC@vch.ca>.

[Uncooked shellfish are a common vehicle for norovirus infection.

Norovirus can be transmitted by
- eating food or drinking liquids that are contaminated with norovirus;
- touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus and then putting your fingers in your mouth; or
- having direct contact with someone who is infected with norovirus, such as by caring for them or sharing food or eating utensils with them.

The 1st sign of norovirus is usually a sudden sick feeling, followed by forceful vomiting and watery diarrhea. Some people may also have a raised temperature (over 38 deg C / 100.4 deg F), headaches, stomach cramps, and aching limbs. Symptoms usually appear 1-2 days after exposure to infection, but they can start sooner. Most people make a full recovery within a few days. Apart from the risk of dehydration, the illness is not generally dangerous, and there are usually no long-lasting effects from norovirus infection. - Mod.LL
