In early Sep 2006, an outbreak of 26 cases of legionnaire's disease
was detected in southeast Paris, by the local health authorities
responsible for surveillance (Figure, [for figure, see original URL -
Mod.LL]). All patients had symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract
infection and tested positive for urinary antigen, indicating a
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 infection. Dates of symptom
onset ranged from 28 Jul to 2 Sep 2006. Patients' ages ranged from 21
to 86 years, 85 percent were men, and 2 patients have died.
Local and national health authorities began an epidemiological
investigation, interviewing patients using a standard questionnaire.
Patients were asked about their activities, including work and
leisure, in the 10-day period before the onset of symptoms. The
results showed that during this period, all patients had stayed or
visited an area in southeast Paris around the Gare d'Austerlitz
railway station.
Environmental investigations were carried out in southeast Paris by
the local environmental health authorities. All identified cooling
towers were tested for legionella, and 4 sites in the defined area
were identified as suspect, because positive samples had been taken
from their cooling towers during the summer period. All these cooling
towers were disinfected.
Isolates obtained from samples from 7 patients were sent to the
national legionella reference laboratory, together with the positive
samples from the cooling towers, for pulse-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) subtyping. Isolates from 6 patients matched the environmental
strains isolated from the cooling towers of 1 of the 4 sites, as
assessed by PFGE subtyping. The cooling towers of this site were shut
down on 7 Sep. No additional cases have been detected since the onset
of the last case on 2 Sep 2006.
A Community alert was sent through EWGLINET (The European Working
Group for Legionella Infections, <http://www.ewgli.org/ewglinet.htm>)
and the European Union's Early Warning and Response system but no
cases linked to the outbreak in travelers from other countries have been found.

[Sources of aerosolized water, particularly cooling towers, continue
to be a significant factor in the spread of legionellosis, especially
when cases appear to have nothing else in common.

station is located in the 13th arrondissement (administrative
