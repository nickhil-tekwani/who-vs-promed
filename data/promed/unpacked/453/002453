"Infection with infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) means infection with highly polymorphic region (HPR)-deleted ISAV or HPR0 ISAV (with a non-deleted HPR) of the genus _Isavirus_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae.

Infection with HPR-deleted ISAV may cause infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which is a generalised and lethal condition characterised by severe anaemia, and variable haemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 percent) typically only in a few cages. Cumulative mortality may become very high for a period lasting several months if nothing is done to limit disease dissemination.

Detection of HPR0 ISAV has never been associated with ISA in Atlantic salmon. This virus genotype replicates transiently and has mainly been localised to the gills. A link between non-pathogenic HPR0 ISAV and pathogenic HPR-deleted ISAV, with some outbreaks potentially occurring as a result of the emergence of HPR-deleted ISAV from HPR0 ISAV has been suggested.

Initially reported in Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA in Atlantic salmon has since then been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands (2000), the USA (Maine in 2001) and in Chile (2007). The presence of the HPR0 ISAV variant has been reported in all countries where ISA has occurred."
