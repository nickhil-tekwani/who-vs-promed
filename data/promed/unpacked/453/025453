[This is a very brief formal report.]

A dairy cow over 2 years old was reported dead on 25 Aug 2021 in Rosenheim, Bavaria.

[TSIS has a map at the source URL showing the location on the southern German border. As this is a formal report, we can assume it was laboratory confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]

[The previous outbreak in 2014 in Sachsen-Anhalt involved 4 animals. The 2012 outbreak was also in Sachsen-Anhalt and involved a dozen animals on one farm. The outbreak in 2009 was in Bayern and involved soil from a building site being dumped onto a pasture where the index case occurred; overall, 2 herds were affected with 4 cases, and prior to that, nothing since 2000.

The site for this outbreak in Bavaria on the southern border is yet to be revealed. The pattern for these recent outbreaks is of soil disturbance -- in 2012 from flooding -- and so we can probably presume that this outbreak will be similar. This is the usual pattern after this disease has been eradicated, of cattle grave disturbance, or of old, buried, contaminated industrial waste, such as tannery trimmings, sheep wool, and goat and horse hair. - Mod.MHJ
