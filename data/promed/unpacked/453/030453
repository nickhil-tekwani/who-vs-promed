First Suspected Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in an Urban Area
-----------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: The Public Health Institute today [began to carry out diagnostic
tests on specimens taken from a 26-year-old youth from Coquimbo who
presumptively was infected with hantavirus. If confirmed, this will be the
first case of [hantavirus infection reported in an urban zone since the
appearance of [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Chile in 1993. The patient
was admitted to the San Pablo de Coquimbo Hospital last Thursday with a
clinical picture of atypical pneumonitis, in addition to respiratory
insufficiency, which is characteristic of hantavirus infection. According
to the epidemiologist of the Health Department of the Southern Metropolitan
Region, Sergio Alcayaga, there is a low probability that the infection had
occurred in an urban zone. He also referred to the case of a 4-year-old
child who had died of [suspected hantavirus infection in Puerto Montt,
[although [hantavirus was not detectable at the time.
Due to the fear of hantavirus infection, tourism in Cajon del Maipo has
dropped by 25 percent; commercial sales have dropped by a third in the El
Ingenio area, where the Ministry of Health had announced that a man had
been infected by the [potentially lethal virus. According to information
in the afternoon edition of La Segunda [Mon 19 Feb 2001, the same day that
the case was announced, 250 rest houses were left unoccupied and the exodus
was repeated in neighboring localities, leading to losses of millions in
commerce and tourism, the principal activities of the zone.
However, local authorities [stated that no infected mice were encountered
in the zone, and emphasized that the species of long-tailed mice
[harbouring the suspected hantavirus did not exist in the area. Because of
this, the mayor of San Jose de Maipo, Miguel Marquez, is emphatic in saying
that the man who was affected by the disease [hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome did not contract it in Cajon del Maipo.

New Cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Confirmed
----------------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO: The Public Health Institute (PHI) confirmed 2 new cases of
hantavirus infection: a 12-year-old resident of the Metropolitan Region who
had been infected in a rural areas of either Villarrica or Purranque, while
on vacation; and a 4-year-old who died, a resident of the Puerto Montt
commune. With these 2 new confirmations the number of cases of hantavirus
infection has reached 10 for this year.
With respect to the child who died as a result of the infection, the first
symptoms presented on 11 Feb 2001. The child was taken to the hospital of
Puerto Montt the following day where he died [the same day.
The Ministry of Health stated that the number of cases of [hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome encountered are within the expected range, considering
the climatic situation observed during the last winter. In addition, the 5
fatal cases are also within the case fatality rate observed with this
disease [50 percent.
[In addition, the PHI announced that there are currently 4 suspected cases
of [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome under investigation. Next week, the
[Institute will have results of [diagnostic tests on a blood specimen
from a 31-year-old woman who died on Monday in the Quilpue Hospital. This
woman had an undiagnosed illness with respiratory insufficiency, which may
have been a consequence of hantavirus infection. The Medicolegal Service of
Valparaiso was due to conduct a post mortem examination of this patient.
Since the cause of death might be hantavirus infection, aerosolized dust
particles might pose a risk to medical personnel in contact with the body.
For this reason the Medicolegal Service decided to postpone autopsy until
results of the [laboratory tests are available and preventive measures can
be taken.
The Director of Prisons from the 8th Region, who had been admitted to the
Naval Hospital of Talcahuano with hantavirus infection, will be discharged
today. [It is believed that he most probably had been infected during a
walk in the countryside with his wife, who died at the end of January from
[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

[There is some conflict between these reports with regard to the laboratory
confirmation of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome diagnosis, particularly
in the case of the 4-year-old child resident in the Puerto Montt
commune. The evidence for any case of infection within an urban area is
dubious. Infection within an urban area is inherently unlikely, since the
rodent host of the presumptive hantavirus responsible for the hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome would normally favour a rural environment. There are of
course many hantaviruses, and only a few are associated with fatal disease.
In these reports the term hantavirus is used colloquially to refer to the
agent responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which in Chile may be
the virus species called Andes virus - Mod.CP
