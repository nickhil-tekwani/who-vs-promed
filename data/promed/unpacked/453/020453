A dengue fever case and a chikungunya fever case were simultaneously detected in the same tour group returning from Cambodia by quarantine screening at Narita international airport in Japan.

The tour group participants, 8 junior high school students and a staff member, traveled to Cambodia from 2-11 Aug [2013]. Each member stayed with a host family in a village of Kampong Cham province from 4-8 Aug 2013. The participants used mosquito repellent but could not avoid some bites. On 12 Aug [2013], returning from Cambodia to Japan, a 12-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy visited the health consultation room of Narita quarantine station because of fever. They were examined and blood samples were tested for dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and malaria.

Case 1: a girl (12 years old) had fever, headache, arthralgia, general fatigue, and postorbital pain on 9 Aug 2013 and diarrhea on 12 Aug 2013. From the blood sample, dengue NS-1 antigen was detected by immunochromatographic test [Bio-Rad Dengue NS1 Antigen Strip test] and virus specific gene by RT-PCR (TaqMan; both types 1 and 4 dengue virus). Chikungunya virus or malaria microparasite were not detected. Diagnosed as dengue fever, suspected type 1 and 4 virus coinfection, she was immediately hospitalized and received supportive care. She recovered on 17 Aug 2013.

Case 2: a boy (14 years old) got sick with fever, headache, arthralgia, and general fatigue beginning 10 Aug [2013]. He also had an episode of diarrhea and abdominal pain on the previous day. From his blood sample, chikungunya virus gene was detected by TaqMan RT-PCR, but neither dengue nor malaria was negative [positive?] He responded to outpatient therapy.

In Japan, both dengue fever and chikungunya fever are quarantinable and notifiable diseases because the potential vector, _Aedes albopictus_, is ubiquitous in the country. In 2012, 220 cases of dengue fever and 9 cases of chikungunya fever were reported among international travelers. This is the 1st report of simultaneous detection of both infections in a tour group in Japan.

[This is an excellent example of long distance movement of pathogens, where there is a risk of ongoing transmission. It is fortunate that these 2 cases were detected early in their infections and quickly diagnosed. It would be of interest to know the opinion of the Japanese authorities concerning the risk of viremic incoming travelers initiating an outbreak in Japan.

ProMED-mail thanks Yasuko Honma MD for this first-hand report. Reports from the field are very valuable.
