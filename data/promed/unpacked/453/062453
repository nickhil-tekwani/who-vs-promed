Foot and Mouth Disease in Argentina: Confirmation of Diagnosis
Translation of information received on 5 Sep 2003 from Dr Jorge Nestor
Amaya, President, National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA),
Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food, Buenos Aires:
Report date: 5 Sep 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 28 Aug 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: at least 30 days before the initial
detection of the animal health incident.
Location: Las Tranquitas locality, San Martin Department, Salta Province.
Description of affected population: various categories of pigs, showing
signs of malnutrition, lameness, and limb lesions.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: 39
cases: 18
Deaths: 32
destroyed: 2
slaughtered: 0
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Central Laboratory of SENASA.
Diagnostic tests used:
- VIAA (detection of antibodies to structural and non structural proteins
of FMD virus);
- typing ELISA;
- virus isolation.
Causal agent: foot and mouth disease virus serotype O.
Source of agent / origin of infection: investigations are under way.
Mode of spread: investigations are under way.
Other epidemiological details:
- establishment located near a municipal abattoir, 10 km from the town of
Tartagal and 40 km from the border with Bolivia.
- zone characterised by its low livestock density, mainly with subsistence
producers, and no production link with other regions.
Control measures:
- quarantine and movement control inside the country;
- vaccination;
- stamping out;
- zoning.
(1) VIAA: virus infection associated antigen.

[The outbreak is due to a type O FMD virus, the same virus type that was
isolated from cattle in a community production system in Chuquisaca,
Bolivia in July 2003. The good news is that animal health authorities have
been giving special emphasis to border control because of recent FMD
activity in the areas close to Bolivia and Paraguay (see references
below). Furthermore, this is not an area where a great deal of commercial
production can facilitate explosive spread. The bad news is that this
outbreak, now confirmed, will require an effective eradication program; it
will be a while before Argentina regains it status as an FMD-free zone with
vaccination. - Mod.PC]
