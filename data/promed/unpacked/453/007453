Mysterious virus appears in wheat fields throughout western Kansas
------------------------
An unidentified wheat virus has agricultural scientists in Kansas
scratching their heads. The pathogen causes wheat leaves to yellow
and die, but it's not caused by wheat streak mosaic, head death or
freezing.
"We're pretty sure it's a virus," said wheat breeder Joe Martin, who
works at the Kansas State University research station at Hays. "It
showed up early and, at first glance, we thought it was wheat streak
mosaic. But it's not. It kills the oldest leaves of the plant and
finally kills the head." Researchers don't know what the virus is,
where it came from, or how it spreads.
Martin said he's seen evidence of the virus in almost every field
he's checked in western Kansas, but it hasn't taken over the crop. He
encouraged farmers to be on the lookout when checking their fields.
Dallas Seifers, a plant pathology professor at Fort Hays State
University, is trying to determine how the pathogen works, and what
it might be.
"It's possible that this is something that has been identified
somewhere else in the world, even something that has shown up in a
different crop, corn or rice or something," Seifers said.
Seifers, with the help of some virologists in Winnipeg, Canada, is
trying to identify the protein that causes the virus' symptoms. That
work is complicated by the fact that most affected plants found in
the field are already dead. Seifers is trying to grow his own supply
of infected plants to study, but the effort hasn't been as successful
as he hoped.
Once researchers identify the protein's genetic sequence, they can
compare it to known pathogens to find a match, or one that is in the
same family.
Seifers said it's possible that the virus is showing up now because
of recent unusual weather patterns, and that it wouldn't show up in a
normal year.
"We're just happy that it is not in large enough numbers to have an
economic impact this year, and we hope it will be spotty if it shows
up next year," he said.

plants. More research is needed to determine the mode of spread of
the pathogen. Also needed is more information about the protein and
its relationship to disease expression. - Mod.DH]
