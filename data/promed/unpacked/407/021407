[1] Maryland (Montgomery County): horses exposed, quarantined

A horse in Montgomery County, Maryland, was euthanized earlier this month [March 2022] due to complications from equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1). Two additional horses from the same barn tested positive for the virus, and a total of 44 horses are potentially exposed, according to information provided by the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC).

EHV-1 most often causes mild-to-moderate respiratory illness (rhinopneumonitis), but the infection occasionally leads to the life-threatening neurologic disease equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The mechanisms through which EHV-1 produces neurologic disease are not yet understood.

According to the EDCC, the farm "has been placed on a hold order by the MDA [Maryland Department of Agriculture], prohibiting movement on or off the farm until any exposed horses have been cleared for release. The veterinary practitioner and stable are providing follow-up care to the horses on the farm. Possible links to the positive EHV-1 equine are actively being investigated. Owners are cautioned to monitor horses carefully and should contact their private veterinarians to arrange for EHV-1 testing if a horse exhibits significant temperature elevations or neurologic signs."

[2] Maryland (Montgomery County): deceased horse, farm quarantine

The Maryland Department of Agriculture has confirmed 3 cases of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) with 44 horses exposed on a farm in Montgomery County.

The index horse was sent to the Equine Medical Center (EMC) in Leesburg, Virginia, for treatment and was later euthanized due to complications. Two other horses from the same barn were sent to EMC for diagnosis and isolation and are currently under treatment.

The Montgomery County farm has been placed on a hold order by the department, prohibiting movement on or off the farm until any exposed horses have been cleared for release.

The horse was previously housed in an isolated barn with 44 other horses. The veterinary practitioner and stable are providing follow-up care to the horses on the farm. Possible links to the positive EHV-1 equine are actively being investigated.

Owners are cautioned to monitor horses carefully, and they should contact their private veterinarians to arrange for EHV-1 testing if a horse exhibits significant temperature elevations or neurologic signs.

Veterinarians are required to report equine neurologic syndrome to the department by calling the Animal Health Program. For more information about EHV-1 read this fact sheet at https://equinediseasecc.org/Content/ContentDocs/DiseaseFactsheet-%20EHV.pdf.

[The vaccine for EHV-1 does tend to decrease the severity of the neurological signs, but thus far there is no vaccine that prevents the neurological form of the disease.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals against EHV and use other core vaccines, such as those for eastern and western equine encephalitis (EEE, WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), tetanus, and rabies. Most of these are annual vaccines, except EEE, which needs revaccination approximately every 3-4 months in areas where the disease is prevalent.
