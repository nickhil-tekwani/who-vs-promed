First Report of Tomato infectious chlorosis virus in Spain

Torino, Italy. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 696, published online as
D-2002-0326-02N, 2002. Accepted for publication 1 Mar 2002.
During the summer and autumn of 2001, symptoms of interveinal yellowing,
bronzing, brittleness, and rolling of lower leaves were observed in
greenhouse- and field-grown tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) ... in
Castellon Province in eastern Spain. Symptoms resembled those caused by
whitefly-transmitted criniviruses (1,2).
Total RNA was extracted from 28 samples of symptomatic leaves collected in
3 greenhouses and 1 field and analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) ... using primers specific for tomato chlorosis
[crini]virus (ToCV) (1) and tomato infectious chlorosis [crini]virus (TICV)
(2).
[A] 501-bp TICV-specific DNA fragment was amplified in 4 samples collected
during the summer in 3 greenhouses and 1 field, and [a] 439-bp
ToCV-specific DNA fragment was amplified in 15 samples collected during the
autumn in the same 3 greenhouses; no mixed infections were found.
The DNA fragments amplified from TICV were sequenced and showed 99 to 100
per cent identity with the TICV isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. U67449 and
AY048855) from the United States and Italy, respectively, confirming the
diagnosis. 1 sequence was deposited as GenBank Accession No. AF479662.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of TICV in Spain and the second
in Europe.

[Other criniviruses that infect food crops in the purview of ProMED-Plant
are cucurbit yellow stunting disorder, lettuce chlorosis, lettuce
infectious yellows, and sweet potato chlorotic stunt. According to the
authors of this report, use of either RT-PCR or dot-blot hybridization
procedures results in rapid and reliable detection of ToCV from field
samples. ToCV is transmitted by the greenhouse whitefly (_Trialeurodes
vaporariorum_), the banded-wing whitefly (_T. abutilone_), and by _Bemisia
tabaci_ biotypes A and B. TICV is transmitted only by _T. vaporariorum_.
TICV has the potential to cause severe losses to both fresh market and
greenhouse-grown tomatoes, but it generally causes minor crop losses. - Mod.DH]
