A strain of virus best known for causing colds and "stomach flu" is
becoming more common and more dangerous, US researchers report. They said
that adenovirus 21 was surprisingly common and was causing an unexpected
level of severe disease and deaths. The researchers used a new test
developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
said the wider use of such tests might help doctors and health officials
better understand what diseases are making people sick. "It makes the case
that if you did survey regularly and routinely for adenoviruses you would
get more information and a little advance information on where the bad ones
are likely to pop up and to be ready," said Dr Catherine Laughlin of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which paid
for the study.

Adenoviruses cause colds, bronchitis, and stomach upsets, but can also
cause chronic airway obstruction, a heart infection called myocarditis, a
sometimes-deadly bowel condition called intussusception, and sudden infant
death at birth. Gregory Gray of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases
at the University of Iowa and colleagues were trying to get a handle on
which types of adenoviruses were most common and which were causing serious
outbreaks of disease. This had not been easy to do because the old
diagnostic tests were slow and could not differentiate easily among the
different strains of adenovirus. And doctors rarely test patients to see
what infection they have. "The new test is very elegant and specific,"
Laughlin said in a telephone interview. Gray's team used the test on 2200
samples from 22 US medical facilities, including 8 military sites. Military
personnel are especially susceptible to outbreaks of all kinds of disease,
including adenoviruses.

Adenovirus 21 was found in 1 per cent of specimens in 2004, but in 2.4 per
cent in 2006. And it was making people much sicker than the other strains,
killing 50 per cent of bone marrow transplant patients, for instance. These
patients are at extra risk from infections as their entire immune systems
are destroyed before they get transplants of new bone marrow tissue. "For
both populations, we observed a statistically significant increasing trend
of adenovirus type 21 detection over time," Gray and colleagues wrote in
their report. And half of them were sick enough to be hospitalized. "The
high prevalence of hospitalization among the patients with adenovirus
infection was surprising," Gray's team wrote in their report, published in
the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Laughlin said the test would need to be commercialized, but having it
available might encourage companies to develop better drugs and vaccines
against adenoviruses. "I think there will also be more effort in drug and
vaccine development, especially because the numbers of immunosuppressed
people that we have around really has been increasing," she said --
including cancer patients, organ recipients, and people infected with the
AIDS virus.

The Department of Defense has also contracted for a new vaccine against
adenovirus types 4 and 7.

[The paper by Gregory C Gray and colleagues, and upon which the report
above is based, has been published in the November issue of Clinical
Infectious Disease 2007; 45: 1120-31,
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/CID/journal/issues/v45n9/51088/brief/51088.abstract.html>.
It is titled "Genotype Prevalence and Risk Factors for Severe Clinical
Adenovirus Infection, United States 2004-2006".

The Abstract is reproduced below:

"Background
----------
"Recently, epidemiological and clinical data have revealed important
changes with regard to clinical adenovirus infection, including alterations
in antigenic presentation, geographical distribution, and virulence of the
virus.

"Methods
-------
"In an effort to better understand the epidemiology of clinical adenovirus
infection in the United States, we adopted a new molecular adenovirus
typing technique to study clinical adenovirus isolates collected from 22
medical facilities over a 25-month period during 2004-2006. A hexon gene
sequence typing method was used to characterize 2237 clinical
adenovirus-positive specimens, comparing their sequences with those of the
51 currently recognized prototype human adenovirus strains. In a blinded
comparison, this method performed well and was much faster than the classic
serologic typing method.

"Results
-------
"Among civilians, the most prevalent adenovirus types were types 3
(prevalence, 34.6 per cent), 2 (24.3 per cent), 1 (17.7 per cent), and 5
(5.3 per cent). Among military trainees, the most prevalent types were
types 4 (prevalence, 92.8 per cent), 3 (2.6 per cent), and 21 (2.4 per cent).

"Conclusions
-----------
"For both populations, we observed a statistically significant increasing
trend of adenovirus type 21 detection over time. Among adenovirus isolates
recovered from specimens from civilians, 50 per cent were associated with
hospitalization, 19.6 per cent with a chronic disease condition, 11 per
cent with a bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, 7.4 per cent with
intensive care unit stay, and 4.2 per cent with a cancer diagnosis.
Multivariable risk factor modeling for adenovirus disease severity found
that age less than 7 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95 per cent confidence
interval [CI], 1.4-7.4), chronic disease (OR, 3.6; 95 per cent CI,
2.6-5.1), recent transplantation (OR, 2.7; 95 per cent CI, 1.3-5.2), and
adenovirus type 5 (OR, 2.7; 95 per cent CI, 1.5-4.7) or type 21 infection
(OR, 7.6; 95 per cent CI, 2.6-22.3) increased the risk of severe disease."

Advances in diagnostic procedures are extending understanding of the role
of certain adenoviruses as determinants of human disease. A recent report
in ProMED-mail identified adenovirus 14 as the etiologic agent, or at least
as a co-factor, in an outbreak of pneumonia in Oregon. Now Gray and
colleagues have identified adenovirus 21 as a significant factor in human
disease and additionally produced evidence that this virus is increasing in
prevalence. The recognition of specific adenoviruses as agents of human
disease may be one consequence of the increasing numbers of
immunosuppressed people in the general population - Mod.CP]
