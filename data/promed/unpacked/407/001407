An outbreak of anthrax that began in early July 2006, the largest
ever recorded in Saskatchewan, has now killed at least 746 farm
animals in that province and neighboring Manitoba, according to Aug 9
statistics from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
The outbreak, which has led to at least 146 farms being quarantined,
is the largest on the prairies since record-keeping began in the
1950s, said CFIA veterinarian Dr. Sandra Stephens, according to a
Canadian Press (CP) story yesterday. The vast majority of dead
animals have been in Saskatchewan, with 628 anthrax-infected animals
dying on 129 farms, according to the CFIA. In Manitoba, 118 animals
have died on 17 farms.
Canadian public health officials emphasize that the risk of anthrax
infection to people is extremely low, according to yesterday's CP
story. "It's more of an animal health issue than a human health
issue," said Dr. Huiming Yang, Saskatchewan's deputy chief medical
health officer, in the CP article. "This is field anthrax," added
Stephens in the CP story. "It's an environmental disease. This is
something that civilization has been dealing with for centuries and
we will continue to live with for years to come."
More than 250 000 animals have been privately vaccinated and 18 000
vaccinated by the Canadian government. Among affected animals are
cattle, horses, bison, sheep, and goats.
Anthrax cannot pass between people. However, in mid-July 2006,
cutaneous, or skin, anthrax, developed in a Canadian farmer,
presumably via contact with an infected animal. Cutaneous anthrax is
much less serious than inhalational anthrax (see Jul 17 CIDRAP News
story). The farmer has since fully recovered, according to
yesterday's CP story.
Meanwhile, across Manitoba's southern border, northwestern Minnesota
has seen the state's worst anthrax outbreak since 1919, according to
the Minnesota Board of Animal Health (BAH).
Since mid-June 2006, 23 farms in 4 counties have experienced anthrax
infection, resulting in 68 cattle, bison, and horse fatalities. In
1919, 42 farms were affected.
Minnesota officials are also recommending vaccination. "We see
anthrax cases throughout the summer, so producers still have time to
vaccinate their livestock," said BAH senior veterinarian Dr. Linda
Glaser in a 20 Jul 2006 BAH press release.

[In response to my query about the horse in Brokenhead, Sandra
Stephensen replied: "The case has occurred on a "new" pasture. It
has been very dry in the area and a stream off the Brokenhead River
that had dried up was used as a new pasture area and -- voila --
horse dies of anthrax!" She also put me onto the District VM Kevin
Millar, who added: "No bones or excavation. The horses did have
access to the exposed mud which was usually under water. We got a
culture positive yesterday." He then added more details. - Mod.MHJ]

This one is a puzzle to me also. I originally wondered if we had a
false positive on PCR, but the culture came back positive.
The clinical veterinarian who saw the horses originally diagnosed a
Clostridial problem, as the horse had a malignant edema-like swelling
on one of the legs. He completed a post mortem, not thinking
anthrax, and observed that the spleen was enlarged. He talked to me
and we decided to ask for anthrax PCR because of the sudden death,
the enlarged spleen, and having the amount of anthrax in Manitoba,
however about 100-150 km away.
The rest of the horses (5) were removed from the pasture immediately
and the clinical vet treated all with penicillin based on the
tentative Clostridial diagnosis. They were vaccinated on the 8th, 10
days post treatment; all were healthy.
There are 18 bovines on the farm that were pastured away from the
river. They were vaccinated at the time of diagnosis, and all are healthy.
This area has a large number of white-tailed deer. I have not heard
of any die-off, but will talk to Manitoba Conservation.

[From what Kevin describes, this is a typical swelling seen with
horsefly bite-related anthrax, the equine version of cutaneous
anthrax. If I am right, the fly had to have contaminated its
mouthparts somewhere and probably within a kilometer. Females can
easily fly 8 km between snacks -- but 100 km? I would put my money
on it being in the background there somewhere. I would not be
surprised if there were a dead animal there in the scrub.
The veterinary response was spot on, and clearly very successful.
Horses remember when they get a painful injection and respond
accordingly when you next come near them. Many thanks to Kevin for
the details. - Mod.MHJ]
