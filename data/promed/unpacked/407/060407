1st report of Plum pox potyvirus in Argentina
---------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Argentina has officially notified the IPPC Secretariat of the
1st finding of Plum pox potyvirus (PPV) (EPPO A2 list) on its territory.
Identity of the virus was confirmed by DAS-ELISA and electron microscopy in
January 2005. PPV was detected in one property on plums and apricots
(_Prunus domestica_, _P. armeniaca_), in the Province of San Juan
(Departamento Pocito). The property and its vicinity were placed under
quarantine and all plants were destroyed.

The situation of Plum pox potyvirus in Argentina can be described as
follows: Present, first reported in 2005 in one location (Province of San
Juan), under eradication.

[Plum pox, also known as sharka, is the most devastating viral disease
worldwide of stone fruit including peaches, apricots, plums, nectarines,
almonds, and sweet and tart cherries. The disease significantly limits
stone fruit production in areas where it is established. More than 100
million stone fruit trees in Europe are infected. First described on plums
in Bulgaria in 1915, plum pox has spread to a large part of Europe, the
Mediterranean, the Middle East (Egypt and Syria), India, and Chile. In
1999, plum pox was detected for the 1st time in North America in a
Pennsylvania orchard, and has subsequently spread to several provinces in
Canada.

4 PPV groups have been described to date: PPV-D in apricot trees from
southeastern France, PPV-M in peach trees from Greece, PPV-EA in apricot
trees from El Amar, Egypt, and PPV-C in sour cherry trees from Moldova. PPV-
M isolates are more aggressive in peach, are aphid-vectored more
efficiently, and spread more rapidly in an orchard. PPV-M has been reported
to be seed-transmitted, while other PPV strains are known not to be
transmitted through seeds. Both PPV strains M and D infest peach, plum, and
apricot.

The strain present in Pennsylvania has been determined to be PPV-D. PPV-C
infects sweet and tart cherry naturally and has infected other _Prunus_
hosts experimentally. To date, no other PPV strains have been reported to
infect cherry naturally. Scientists use several techniques to distinguish
PPV strains, monitoring the behavior of host trees, ELISA and molecular
tests such as PCR, and sequencing of PCR products or cutting PCR products
with enzymes at locations in the DNA sequence that are unique to each strain.

Control and prevention measures for PPV include field surveys, use of
certified nursery materials, use of resistant plants (when available), aphid
control, and elimination of infected trees in nurseries and orchards.
Sources of resistance exist in _Prunus_ but are not abundant. A team of
scientists from the United States and France has genetically engineered a
PPV-resistant plum (otherwise known as C5), and the resistance can be
transferred through hybridization to other plum trees. This provides a
unique source of germplasm for future breeding programs worldwide. There
has been no similar success in attempts to genetically modify other _Prunus_
species. - Mod.DH]
