Authorities in Peshawar, in the north west of the country, detained 471 people and charged them with "endangering public security". The local government says they will only be freed once they have pledged in writing to vaccinate their children. The Taliban prohibit vaccinations and have attacked health workers. The Pakistani government has declared "war" on the disease. "We have decided to deal with the refusal cases with iron hands. Anyone who refuses will be sent to jail," said Riaz Khan Mehsud, deputy commissioner of Peshawar.

Pakistan accounts for the vast majority of polio cases globally and is 1 of only 3 countries [Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. Nigeria has not reported a case since July 2014. - Mod.MPP] where it remains endemic. In 2014, polio cases in the country reached a 14-year high of 306. Nine new cases have been detected so far this year [2015].

In June 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that all international travellers from Pakistan be administered polio drops at airports to prevent its spread.

The Taliban have claimed that the polio vaccination drive is a front for espionage or a conspiracy to sterilise Muslims. In November 4 polio vaccination workers were shot dead in the southwest city of Quetta.

[2] Pakistan, security concerns - media report

http://www.dawn.com/news/1166886/polio-campaign-postponed-in-quetta-due-to-inadequate-security


A scheduled polio campaign in Quetta was postponed owing to lack of security for vaccination teams on Monday [2 Mar 2015]. The 2nd phase of the vaccination drive was scheduled to be launched in Quetta in order to administer polio drops to children below the age of 5 years.

Sources in the Balochistan Health Department told Dawn that the provincial administration had failed to provide timely security to polio vaccination teams in Quetta, the capital city of Balochistan. "Without security guards, we cannot move our teams in the city," he said.

Security of polio teams has been tightened in the aftermath of attacks at polio team in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan. Militants had killed a polio worker and driver of polio team in custody [in February 2015] in Zhob district of Balochistan.

Up till now, 2 polio cases have been reported from Killa Abdullah and Chagai districts of Balochistan during the year 2015. The provincial government of Balochistan has declared an emergency in Quetta and other high-risk districts of the province to eradicate the paralysing disease and for this purpose emergency drives are being launched.

Pakistan's 1st case of polio virus for the year 2015 was reported from Balochistan's Chagai district on [1 Jan 2015]. During the year 2014, a total of 23 polio cases were reported from Balochistan. Most of the cases were reported from Balochistan's Killa Abdullah, Pishin and Quetta districts.

Pakistan is 1 of only 3 countries in the world where polio remains endemic, the other 2 countries being Afghanistan and Nigeria, but efforts to stamp it out have been badly hit in recent years by attacks on immunisation teams. The World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared that Pakistan is responsible for nearly 80 per cent of polio cases reported globally. To prevent the possible spread of the polio virus from Pakistan to other countries, WHO imposed strict travel restrictions on the country.

Militant groups often attack polio teams as they see vaccination campaigns as a cover for espionage. There are also long-running rumours about polio drops causing infertility. Anti-polio campaigns in Balochistan were suspended and rumours of WHO ending operations had emerged after deadly attack on vaccinators in Quetta in November 2014 which had claimed the lives of 4 workers. Later in December [2014], the Balochistan government had suspended its anti-polio campaign in the province in the aftermath of attacks on polio workers in Karachi and Peshawar.

[3] 4th IHR Emergency Committee meeting - WHO
Date: 27 Feb 2015
Source: WHO press release 27 Feb 2015 [edited]
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/polio-27-february-2015/en/


The 4th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the international spread of wild poliovirus in 2014 - 15 was convened via teleconference by the director-general on [17 Feb 2015]. The following IHR States Parties submitted an update on the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations since the Committee last met on [13 Nov 2014]: Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Pakistan and the Syrian Arab Republic.

The Committee noted that the international spread of wild poliovirus has continued with one new exportation from Pakistan into neighbouring Afghanistan documented after [13 Nov 2014]. Although there is seasonal decline in the number of reported cases in Pakistan, transmission is ongoing in each of the 4 provinces and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The Committee assessed the risk of international spread from Pakistan to be sustained. The Committee appreciated that Pakistan has prepared a new robust 'low-season' vaccination plan, established national and provincial emergency operations centres, and resumed campaigns in South and North Waziristan. Nonetheless, the principal factors underpinning the international spread of wild poliovirus from Pakistan have not yet changed sufficiently since the date of the 3rd meeting of the Emergency Committee on [13 Nov 2014].

There has been no other documented international spread of wild poliovirus since March 2014. Although the risk of new international spread from the 9 other infected member states appears to have declined, the possibility of international spread still remains a global threat worsened by the expansion of conflict-affected areas, particularly in the Middle East and Central Africa. Furthermore, countries affected by conflict inevitably experience a decline in health service delivery that leads to deterioration of immunization systems in a number of such at-risk countries.

The Committee assessed that the spread of polio still constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and recommended the extension of the Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The committee considered the following factors in reaching this unanimous conclusion:

1. The continued international spread of wild poliovirus through 2014;

2. The risk and consequent costs of failure to eradicate globally 1 of the world's most serious vaccine-preventable diseases;

3. The continued necessity of a coordinated international response to stop the international spread of wild poliovirus and to prevent new spread with the onset of the high transmission season in May/June 2015;

4. The serious consequences of further international spread for the increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been disrupted by armed conflict and complex emergencies. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to infection and outbreaks of polio which are exceedingly difficult to control;

5. The importance of a regional approach and cooperation as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.

The Committee sincerely appreciated the efforts that all countries have made in response to the temporary recommendations and reviewed the progress against the criteria previously established by the Committee for countries to respond to under the IHR. The Committee remains concerned that implementation of the Temporary Recommendations is incomplete in all affected countries, many of which are affected by regional conflicts.

The Committee provided the director-general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of wild poliovirus, based on an updated risk stratification of the 10 countries that had earlier met the criteria for 'States currently exporting wild poliovirus' or 'States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting '. A 3rd risk category has been added by the Committee for 'States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread'. The committee also noted the feedback from the 4 exporting countries that highlighted the challenges of implementing polio eradication measures in situations where there is significant cross-border population movement, often across long borders and common epidemiological blocks. The committee therefore recommended that countries apply a regional approach and develop joint immunisation strategies with neighbouring countries.

States currently exporting wild poliovirus:
Cameroon (until [11 Mar 2015]), Equatorial Guinea (Until [4 Apr 2015]), Syrian Arab Republic (until [17 Mar 2015]) and Pakistan.

States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting:
Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, Ethiopia (until [16 Mar 2015]), Iraq (until [19 May 2015]), and Israel (until [28 Apr 2015]
The Committee noted that by [16 Mar 2015, 28 Apr 2015 and 19 May 2015], 12 months would have elapsed since the detection of wild poliovirus in Ethiopia, Israel and Iraq respectively. Should there be no further detection of wild poliovirus up to these dates, Ethiopia, Iraq and Israel will meet the criteria for 'States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread.'

States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but which remain vulnerable to international spread:
Should there be no further detection of wild poliovirus in Ethiopia by [16 Mar 2015, in Syria by 17 Mar 2015, in Israel by 28 Apr 2015, and in Iraq by 19 May 2015] these countries will meet the criteria for this category of risk.

Based on this advice, the reports made by affected States Parties and the currently available information, the director-general accepted the Committee's assessment and on [27 Feb 2015] decided to extend the declaration of the international spread of wild poliovirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General endorsed the Committee's recommendations for 'States currently exporting wild polioviruses', for 'States infected with wild poliovirus but not currently exporting' and for 'States no longer infected by wild poliovirus, but remain vulnerable to international spread' and extended them as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005) to reduce the international spread of wild poliovirus, effective [27 Feb 2015]. The Director-General thanked the Committee Members and Advisors for their advice and requested their reassessment of this situation within the next 3 months, particularly the Committee's advice whether the Temporary Recommendations should continue beyond the World Health Assembly in 2015 or Standing Recommendations would be required to more effectively reduce the risk of international spread of polio at that time.

Highlights of this week -- as of 18 Feb 2015
--------------------------------------------
- On [27 Feb 2015] the director general accepted the recommendations made by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations concerning the international spread of wild poliovirus. [see section [3] above - Mod.MPP]
- The polio legacy is being demonstrated in action through the work of 26 surveillance experts from the National Polio Surveillance Programme in India who have been deployed to Sierra Leone to support the Ebola outbreak response.

Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2015] in Reg district of Hilmand province. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 remains 28, and 1 for 2015. Most of the cases from 2014 were linked to cross-border transmission with neighbouring Pakistan.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned for [15 - 17 Mar 2015] using trivalent OPV in most areas, and combining inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) with bivalent OPV in some high-risk areas of Hilmand, Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces.

Nigeria
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Nigeria's total WPV1 case count for 2014 remains 6, compared to 53 in 2013. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [24 Jul 2014], more than 6 months ago, in Sumaila Local Government Area (LGA), southern Kano state.
- No new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported this week. The most recent such case had onset of paralysis on [16 Nov 2014], in Barde Local Governmental Area of Yobe state. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 in Nigeria remains 30.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are scheduled for [14 - 18 Mar 2015] using trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV).

Pakistan
- A total of 4 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. Of those, 2 cases were reported in Khyber agency, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, 1 in Killa Abdullah district of Balochistan province (previously uninfected in 2015) and 1 in Tank district, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2014 remains 306, and 13 for 2015. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [3 Feb 2015] in Balochistan.
- No new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [13 Dec 2014]. The number of cVDPV cases reported in 2014 remains 21.
- A panel of experts was convened in February [2015] for a consultation to review the current epidemiological situation and the status of implementation of the existing 'low-transmission season' polio eradication plan. With 8 weeks remaining until the end of the low season, the panel urged that Emergency Operations Centres continue strengthening the roll-out of the plan and that, at the provincial level, teams more completely and accurately track its implementation.

Central Africa
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the last week. In 2014, 10 cases were reported in central Africa: 5 in Cameroon and 5 in Equatorial Guinea. Over 7 months have passed since the last WPV1 case had onset of paralysis in central Africa (in Cameroon, onset of paralysis on [9 Jul 2014]).
- In March [2015], National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in Chad and Gabon, and Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in the Central African Republic and Cameroon in March [2015]. In April [2015], NIDs are scheduled in Equatorial Guinea and SNIDs are in the Central African Republic, Chad, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Horn of Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the last week. The most recent case, which had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2014], was from Hobyo district of Mudug province, central Somalia. The total number of cases that were reported in the Horn of Africa in 2014 was 6: 1 WPV1 in Ethiopia (date of onset of paralysis on [5 Jan 2014]) and 5 WPV1s in Somalia.
- No cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) have been reported in the last week. The most recent case of cVDPV2 had onset of paralysis in South Sudan on [12 Sep 2014]. In 2014, 2 cases were reported in South Sudan.
- National Immunization Days (NIDs) are planned in South Sudan from [24 - 27 Mar 2015]. Supplementary Immunization Activities are planned in Somalia and Yemen in March [2015] with dates to be confirmed. Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) are also planned in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda in March [2015] and in Kenya in April [2015].

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has not been detected in environmental samples in Israel or the West Bank and Gaza Strip for more than 10 months. The most recent WPV-positive sample was collected in southern Israel on [30 Mar 2014]. All environmental samples collected since April [2014] have been negative for WPV.

Middle East
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the last week. In 2014, 3 cases of WPV1 were reported in the Middle East - 2 in Iraq and 1 in Syria.
- The most recent case reported from Syria had onset of paralysis on [21 Jan 2014], while the most recent case in Iraq had onset of paralysis in Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, on [7 Apr 2014].
- Phase III of the Middle East outbreak response is continuing to further strengthen vaccination services for vulnerable populations and to strengthen surveillance for polioviruses across the region.

West Africa
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in West Africa in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case in the region occurred in Tahoua province, Niger, with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- Even as polio programme staff across West Africa help to control the Ebola outbreak affecting the region, efforts are being made in those countries not affected by Ebola to vaccinate children against polio to create a buffer zone surrounding the affected countries. The Ebola crisis in western Africa continues to have an impact on the implementation of polio eradication activities in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. For 3 months, 22 experts from the National Polio Surveillance Programme (NPSP) in India have been deployed to strengthen surveillance systems and data collection for the Ebola response, demonstrating the polio legacy in action.
- From [27 to 31 Mar 2015], National Immunization Days (NIDs) will take place in Mali and Niger using trivalent OPV. On [10 - 13 Apr 2015], NIDs are planned in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal, with Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs) in Niger on the same dates. Two rounds of NIDs are scheduled on [27 - 31 Mar 2015 and 10 - 13 Apr 2015] for the 3 Ebola-affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

[Reading through the reports included in this update, the picture that one gets is one of cautious improvements in the eradication efforts in Africa and the Middle East, but persistent problems in Pakistan, in spite of an increased commitment on the part of the government both nationally as well as provincially. Of the 14 cases of wild poliovirus (WPV)-associated disease since the beginning of 2015, 13 were confirmed and reported by Pakistan. The 14th case thus far in 2015 was reported by Afghanistan, neighboring Pakistan. The media reports above show "good news" and "bad news". The good news is that action is being taken against vaccine refusers in Peshawar located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where there have been cases. The bad news is that security for the vaccinators is still very much an issue, and a lack of security guarantees is accompanied by cessation of vaccination activities.
