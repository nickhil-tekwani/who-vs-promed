A rabies alert continues for North Escambia after one person was
bitten by a rabid fox and 2 raccoons that bit dogs tested positive for
rabies.

Robert Merritt, director of environmental health for the Escambia
County Health Department, said that a dog was bitten by a rabid
raccoon on Crabtree Church Road in Molino in May [2009], and a dog was
bitten by a rabid raccoon on Handy Road in Cottage Hill last month
[August 2009]. He said a fox that bit a person somewhere in North
Escambia last month also tested positive for rabies, but, due to
patient privacy laws, he was not able to identify in which community
the incident occurred. [This means that the people most at risk may
not know there is a rabies problem in their area. Protecting one
person's privacy leads to a potentially higher risk for everyone else.

The dogs bitten by the rabid raccoons were quarantined, while the
person bitten by the rabid fox is undergoing treatment. Dr John Lanza,
director of the Escambia County Health Department today [13 Sep 2009]
issued a rabies alert for the central to northern geographical region
of Escambia County, Florida. This is in response to 3 wild animals
that tested positive for rabies.

Escambia residents should be aware that rabies is present in the wild
animal population and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated.
The public is asked to maintain a heightened awareness that rabies is
active in Escambia County. Alerts are designed to increase awareness
to the public, but they should not give a false sense of security to
areas that have not been named as under an alert. This rabies alert
will last for a total of 60 days and covers all of central and
northern Escambia County from Muscogee Road north to the Alabama State
line. [It is not clear why an alert lasts only 60 days when according
to the report rabies has been present there since May. - Mod.JW]

An animal with rabies could infect other wild or domestic animals that
have not been vaccinated against rabies. All domestic animals should
be vaccinated against rabies and humans should avoid all wildlife
contact, especially with raccoons, bats, and foxes.

Rabies is a disease of the nervous system and is usually fatal to
warm-blooded animals and to humans. The only treatment for human
exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies
immunization. Appropriate treatment started soon after the exposure
will protect an exposed person from the disease.

The following advice is issued
- all pets should have current rabies immunizations;
- avoid contact with all wildlife, especially raccoons, bats, and foxes;
- all persons with any unusual exposure incident, or bites, with a
wild animal should be evaluated by a physician to determine their need
for treatment;
- secure outside garbage in covered containers to avoid attracting
wild animals;
- do not leave pet food outside as this practice also attracts wild animals;
- for questions regarding the health of an animal, contact a veterinarian;
- veterinarian staff and animal control staff should be alert for
animals encountered with signs suspicious for rabies and contact the
Escambia County Health Department's Environmental Health Division at
(850) 595-6700.

[Residents should be reminded that rabies changes an animal. Nocturnal
animals may be found in the daylight. Docile animals may be more
aggressive while energetic animals may be more quiet and cuddly. The
veterinary community has an opportunity to offer low cost rabies
drives in association with county public health awareness campaigns.

Cats, dogs, and horses need vaccinating. Cattle, sheep, and goat
producers should vaccinate their animals, as they are susceptible to
the virus. It takes only one rabid skunk or raccoon biting one of the
production animals to cost a producer more than the cost of the
vaccines. Rabies in cattle mimics other diseases and cattle can expose
a number of people before the disease is diagnosed. - Mod.TG]
