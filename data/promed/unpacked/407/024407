The coronavirus has killed an estimated 1300 babies in Brazil since the beginning of the pandemic, even though there's overwhelming evidence that COVID-19 rarely kills young children.

While data from the Health Ministry suggest that over 800 children under age 9 have died of COVID-19, including about 500 babies, experts say the real death toll is higher because cases are underreported because of a lack of widespread coronavirus testing, according to the BBC, which first reported the story [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56696907].

Dr Fatima Marinho of the University of São Paolo, a leading epidemiologist who is a senior adviser to the international non-governmental organization Vital Strategies, estimated that the virus has killed 2060 children under 9, including 1302 babies. Her estimate is based on the number of excess deaths from an unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic.

There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for COVID-19, Marinho told the BBC after she found that there have been 10 times more deaths from an unexplained respiratory syndrome over the past year compared to previous years.

Marinho added that, throughout her research, she has seen a rise in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome among Brazilian children. The rare syndrome is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with the virus that causes COVID-19 infections. It tends to affect children up to 6 weeks after they are infected with the coronavirus.

Brazil has become the country with the 2nd highest number of COVID-19 deaths, more than 361 000 since the pandemic began, the most in the world after the United States.

[Christos Christou, president of Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières], said Thursday [15 Apr 2021] that the government's "failed response" to the pandemic had led to thousands of avoidable deaths.

Last week [week of 5 Apr 2021], more than a quarter of the world's coronavirus deaths were in Brazil. Christou said he expects the situation to worsen in the coming weeks if nothing changes.

Experts in Brazil say low coronavirus testing rates, lack of contact tracing efforts, and a shortage of vaccines have contributed to rises in cases and deaths. These factors have also increased the risk of exposure and potential death among more Brazilian babies and children.

"The response in Brazil needs an urgent, science-based and well-coordinated reset to prevent further avoidable deaths and the destruction of the once prestigious Brazilian health system," Christou said in a statement Thursday [15 Apr 2021].

"Dear Editor,

"As COVID-19 continues to spread in Brazil and other countries, the impact of the disease among children, initially considered less important,/1 will increasingly be more relevant. The role of children in viral transmission and its impact in epidemic expansion, as well as the extent of the diversity of clinical presentation, are still unclear. At the end of April [2021], the United Kingdom South Thames Retrieval Service alerted on a new clinical picture manifesting as a hyper-inflammatory syndrome, with multi-organ involvement similar to Kawasaki disease and with potential evolution to a shock syndrome. This represented a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection./2 This multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs weeks after infection and may evolve unnoticed./3 This is however a new and potentially life threatening condition that many pediatricians may not be aware of."

"This child recovered with only supportive care, no longer requiring intensive care after a few days and showing complete recovery. Although a severe illness, with 68% requiring intensive care,/4 few deaths have been reported in other countries, often resulting from complications related to therapeutic intervention./6 This is an important point to be observed when exploratory therapy is considered. Children have been treated with anti-inflammatory treatment, including parenteral immunoglobulin and steroids/3,11 and a few received TNF-alfa inhibitors, IL-1 and Il-6 receptor antagonists./3 However, a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of the disease may help defining the appropriate interventions for specific cases. Although some authors have described MIS-C as a type of cytokine storm, important differences from the prototype antibody chimeric reactions, observed with some monoclonal therapeutic agents, have been highlighted,/11 and different immunopathogenic mechanisms may be expected. Moreover, high serum IL-6 is also common in some systemic juvenile arthritis/6 and the role of cytokines and other features of MIS-C still lack proper understanding to guide therapy. There is also an urgent need to standardize data describing clinical presentations, severity, outcomes, and epidemiology./13"

See the URL above for the full text and references.

It is not clear how often this syndrome is seen in other countries, including the US, with an even higher overall infection rate. But Brazil is experiencing a surge in virus infections with the P1 SARS-CoV-2 variant, which may be contributing to the increased infection rate in younger people. See next item. - Mod.LK]

Brazil grapples with massive COVID-19 surges
--------------------------------------------
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) today [15 Apr 2021] called on the Brazilian government's leaders to muster the political will to respond to the threat, which it said is killing people by the thousands.

MSF said last week [week of 5 Apr 2021], intensive care units (ICUs) were at capacity in 21 of 27 states, and hospitals across the country are struggling with shortages of oxygen for treatment and sedatives needed for intubation. It also said the country has a critical need for rapid antigen tests to quickly confirm infections in an effort to limit spread.

Pierre Van Heddegem, who coordinates MSF's emergency response in Brazil, said, "The devastation due to shortages and high demand for care that MSF teams first witnessed in the Amazonas region has become the reality across the majority of Brazil." He added that a lack of coordination between federal health officials and those in states and cities has led to life or death consequences, with patients dying from lack of healthcare access and medical staff exhausted and experiencing emotional trauma.

An overwhelming amount of misinformation is complicating Brazil's outbreak response, with masks, physical distancing, and other measures shunned or politicized and unproven treatment such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin touted by politicians and prescribed by doctors, MSF said.

In a related development, scientists from Brazil's Fiocruz Institute warned that the P1 SARS-CoV-2 variant, which is currently fueling the country's massive outbreak, is evolving in ways that would make it more able to evade antibodies, according to Reuters [see comment below]. Researchers said the changes are similar to the B1351 variant, first seen in South Africa, which has already been shown to evade some vaccines.

[Wed 14 Apr 2021. Brazil's P1 coronavirus variant mutating, may become more dangerous - study
[Reuters, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-variant/brazils-p1-coronavirus-variant-mutating-may-become-more-dangerous-study-idUSKBN2C11XX

Brazil's P1 coronavirus variant, behind a deadly COVID-19 surge in the Latin American country that has raised international alarm, is mutating in ways that could make it better able to evade antibodies, according to scientists studying the virus.
Research conducted by the public health institute Fiocruz into the variants circulating in Brazil found mutations in the spike region of the virus that is used to enter and infect cells.

Those changes, the scientists said, could make the virus more resistant to vaccines -- which target the spike protein - with potentially grave implications for the severity of the outbreak in Latin America's most populous nation.

"We believe it's another escape mechanism the virus is creating to evade the response of antibodies," said Felipe Naveca, one of the authors of the study and part of Fiocruz in the Amazon city of Manaus, where the P1 variant is believed to have originated.

Naveca said the changes appeared to be similar to the mutations seen in the even more aggressive South African variant, against which studies have shown some vaccines have substantially reduced efficacy.

"This is particularly worrying because the virus is continuing to accelerate in its evolution," he added.

Studies have shown the P1 variant to be as much as 2.5 times more contagious than the original coronavirus and more resistant to antibodies.

On Tuesday [13 Apr 2021], France suspended all flights to and from Brazil in a bid to prevent the variant's spread as Latin America's largest economy becomes increasingly isolated.

The variant, which has quickly become dominant in Brazil, is thought to be a large factor behind a massive 2nd wave that has brought the country's death toll to over 350 000 - the 2nd highest in the world behind the United States.

Brazil's outbreak is also increasingly affecting younger people, with hospital data showing that in March more than half of all patients in intensive care were aged 40 or younger.

For Ester Sabino, a scientist at the faculty of medicine of the University of Sao Paulo who led the first genome sequencing of the coronavirus in Brazil, the mutations of the P1 variant are not surprising given the fast pace of transmission.

"If you have a high level of transmission, like you have in Brazil at the moment, your risk of new mutations and variants increases," she said.

Fiocruz researchers including Naveca also recently described a novel variant descended from a different lineage to P1, and detected in the northeast of the country, that carried 14 defining mutations including the E484K change first noted in the South African variant (http://bit.ly/2RBhLKD).

So far vaccines, such as those developed by AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac, have proven effective against the P1 Brazilian variant but Sabino said further mutations could put that at risk.

"It's a real possibility," she said.

More measures, limited oxygen in India
--------------------------------------
Surges in India and Brazil are fueling a steady rise in global cases, given that they are among the world's most populous countries: India the 2nd, and Brazil as the 6th.

India reported a record single-day high of 200 739 cases, and the burden of cases has pushed the country's oxygen production to full capacity over the last 2 days, with the health ministry announcing that it now needs to import 50 000 metric tons, according to Reuters. Media reports describe patients waiting for hospital beds to open up and even patients on oxygen being placed 2 to a bed.

Mumbai, India's financial capital, began a lockdown last night, and officials today [15 Apr 2021] announced a weekend curfew for Delhi, the country's capital region, according to https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56731801.amp

The new wave of lockdowns is raising fears in India again of a mass exodus from cities, heightening the risk of people carrying the virus to more rural areas that aren't equipped to handle the virus, according to the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/15/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases#as-india-logs-200000-daily-infections-a-new-exodus-from-cities-has-begun]

[B] Chile
Date: Thu 15 Apr 2021

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-56731801.amp


The number of daily cases reached a new record high on [9 Apr 2021], going over 9000 for the first time since the pandemic began and considerably higher than the previous peak of just under 7000 cases in mid-June [2021].

"It's worrying," he said last Friday [9 Apr 2021]. "We're going through a critical moment of the pandemic... I urge you to take care of yourselves, of your loved ones, of your families."

Intensive care units are again overwhelmed, the country has for a 2nd time closed its borders to everyone who is not a resident and most of its 18 million inhabitants are back in lockdown.

"It feels like we're going backwards," says Santiago resident Sofía Pinto. "We need to download special permits online to be allowed out just twice a week for essential things like food shopping or doctor's visits."

What went wrong?
Like governments across the world, ministers here faced difficult choices.
Chile's borders had been closed -- bar for a few exceptions -- from March to November 2020. But after a strict lockdown had driven the rolling 7-day average down to 1300 cases in November [2020], the decision was taken to reopen them, including to international tourists.

Chileans were also given special holiday permits to travel more freely around the country during the southern hemisphere summer holidays after some experts argued it was important for people's mental health.

Restaurants, shops, and holiday resorts were opened up to kickstart the faltering economy.

Fast, but not in time for the holidays

And while the vaccination rollout has been fast, it only started in late December [2021], with front-line healthcare workers, those over 90, and teachers first in line.

So the vast majority of Chileans would not yet have been vaccinated by the time they met up with relatives and friends for their summer holidays in January and February [2021].

Add to that the spread of new, more easily transmittable variants of the virus such as the P.1 variant, which is thought to have emerged in Brazil's Amazonas state in November [2020].

Dr Susan Bueno, a professor of immunology from the Pontifical Catholic University, says the recent surge is "a multi-factor issue", but that she thinks the new variants are having a "huge impact".

She says the message about how to prevent contagion, such as wearing masks and washing your hands, was also somewhat neglected during the summer months in Chile. That, she explains, "is probably one of the causes of the outbreaks we are seeing now."

[3] Role of ring vaccinations?
Date: Thu 15 Apr 2021
From: KJ Seung (Twitter) https://mobile.twitter.com/kj_seung/status/1382800595422183425 via [via Kristian Andersen retweet


Buried in the middle of [Zeynep Tufekci's] excellent article a few weeks back [30 Mar 2021] was "ring vaccination". She was talking about it generally, as in surging resources towards certain states. But could it actually work on a smaller scale, to snuff out outbreaks?

Zeynep Tufekci: I understand why we did an each-state-does-their-own-thing policy until now. But the administration should immediately implement a national strategy of geographic prioritizing. We already have federal sites in many states, and we have the vaccine supply (https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/fourth-surge-variant-vaccine/618463):

"The solution is obvious and doable: We should immediately match variant surges with vaccination surges that target the most vulnerable by going where they are, in the cities and states experiencing active outbreaks--an effort modeled on a public-health tool called 'ring vaccination.' Ring vaccination involves vaccinating contacts and potential contacts of cases, essentially smothering the outbreak by surrounding it with immunity. We should do this, but on a surge scale, essentially ring-vaccinating whole cities and even states.

A vaccination surge means setting up vaccination tents in vulnerable, undervaccinated neighborhoods -- street by street if necessary -- and having mobile vaccination crews knock on doors wherever possible. It means directing supply to places where variants are surging, even if that means fewer vaccine doses for now in places with outbreaks under control. It doesn't make sense to vaccinate 25-year-olds in places with very low levels of circulation before seniors and frontline workers in places where there is an outbreak."

[4] Breakthrough cases

https://www.wsj.com/articles/cdc-identifies-small-group-of-covid-19-infections-among-fully-vaccinated-patients-11618490232


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified a small cohort of approximately 5800 cases of COVID-19 infection among more than 66 million Americans who have completed a full course of vaccination.

These so-called breakthrough cases, which are defined as positive COVID-19 test results received at least 2 weeks after patients receive their final vaccine dose, represent 0.008% of the fully vaccinated population.

Officials said such cases are in line with expectations because the approved vaccines in the US are highly effective but not 100% foolproof. They are a reminder that even vaccinated people are at risk and should continue to take precautions such as masking and social distancing in many circumstances.

The CDC earlier this year [2021] asked state health departments to track and report breakthrough cases to the federal government. So far, the cases that have been reported come from about 40 states.

Separately, The Wall Street Journal contacted health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to ask how many breakthrough cases had been identified. Twenty-three states responded, reporting a total of 4172 breakthrough cases.

[It is important to remember that it takes time for the body to build protection after any vaccination. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their 2nd shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, or 2 weeks after the single-dose J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

While several COVID-19 vaccines appear to have high levels of efficacy, no vaccine is 100% protective. As a result, there may be a small percentage of people who do not develop protection as expected after COVID-19 vaccination.

In addition to a vaccine's specific characteristics, several factors such as a person's age, their underlying health conditions, or previous exposure to COVID-19 may have an impact on a vaccine's effectiveness. We also do not yet know how long immunity from different COVID-19 vaccines will last (https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/coronavirus-disease-(covid-19)-vaccines-safety).

Meanwhile, all the tools available to protect oneself and others should be employed including precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet (2 m) apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing your hands often.]
