China found fungus in Canadian canola cargo
--------------------------------------------
China, the world's largest oilseeds importer, found a fungus in a
Canadian canola cargo last week, the state-owned China National Grain
and Oils Information Center said. The cargo of 54 300 metric tons of
canola from the port of Vancouver was found, at the port of Xiamen
[Fujian province], to have _Leptosphaeria maculans_. The fungus may
cause blackleg disease in the crop.

China requires canola imports from Canada to be certified free from
blackleg. The importer of the cargo, a company in Jiangsu province,
was ordered to unload the cargo in a non-producing area to avoid
contact with local species of similar crops, the report said. The
importer has already leased a processing plant to process the cargo.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the
fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of
oilseed rape (including canola varieties) with a possible yield loss
of 50 percent or more. It can also affect other species in the
_Brassicaceae_ family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds) which
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may
include lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, with stem cankers leading
to premature ripening or collapse of the crop. However, symptomless
infections may also occur.

The fungus is seedborne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal,
mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment), and
infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble which is therefore
often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the
risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease
management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise
inoculum, fungicides, and planting of resistant cultivars.

However, the pathogen can be expected to adapt to new resistant crop
varieties quickly since it is extremely diverse and has overcome
major resistance genes in the past. New strains evolve frequently and
have also been reported earlier in 2010 from Canada (ProMED-mail post
20100103.0033). Strict quarantine regulations are therefore warranted
even for regions where older strains of the fungus may already be
present. Processing of the contaminated load in China (rather than
burning it), even outside oilrape producing areas, may nevertheless
carry a risk to national rape and vegetable producers since
brassicaceous weeds are widespread and could serve as 1st hosts for a
new incursion in the country.
