New Caledonia is introducing new measures to stop the spread of the
mosquito-borne disease [virus] chikungunya. 26 cases have been
reported so far, with the most of those in and around the capital
Noumea itself.

The new measures include emptying all the water from the flower vases
left on tombstones in a number of cemeteries, in an effort to reduce
the possible breeding ground for mosquitoes. Many parts the city have
also been sprayed with insecticide.

This is the 1st outbreak of chikungunya in the Pacific region.

Simon Reid is an epidemiologist and the leader of the Surveillance
and Operational Research team within the Public Health Division of the
Secretariat of the Pacific Community. He says that the outbreak
remains localised, but regional authorities are keeping a close eye on
developments.

[The number of reported cases of chikungunya virus infections on New
Caledonia has increased from 17 on 6 May 2011 to the 27 reported
above, nearly 3 weeks later. Text of an extensive interview with Simon
Reid follows the report above.

In the previous ProMED post on the chikungunya virus outbreak in New
Caledonia (ProMED-mail archive no. 20110511.1446), Dr Myrielle
Dupont-Rouzeyrol and colleagues stated, "In New Caledonia, the
putative vector of CHIKV is _Aedes aegypti_ since _Ae. albopictus_ has
never been described there. Sequence analysis of E1 gene of the 1st
New Caledonian autochthonous isolate of CHIKV has been conducted by
the National Reference Centre of Arbovirus, WHO collaborating Centre,
Institut Pasteur, Paris. The New Caledonia/2011 CHIKV strain has
alanine at position E1-226. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that
this viral isolate belongs to the Asia lineage, which corroborates the
Indonesian origin of the imported cases (ProMED-mail archive no. 20110226.0631)."
