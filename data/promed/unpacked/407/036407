Current situation
-----------------
H7 avian influenza virus has been confirmed in a flock of 50 000 layer hens in the lower Hunter Valley, near Maitland. The property has been quarantined and the birds are being culled. DPI and the Livestock Health and Pest Authority are continuing surveillance and tracing to confirm the virus has not spread.

This is not the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that has gained worldwide attention, nor is it closely related to that strain. Australia has previously had a small number of outbreaks of AI viruses and all were quickly and successfully eradicated.

The NSW Food Authority has further details and advice. To prevent the spread of avian influenza, a range of restrictions now apply within a 10 km [6.2 mile] radius around the quarantined egg production flock.
