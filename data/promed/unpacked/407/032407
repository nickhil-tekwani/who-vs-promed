A cholera outbreak in Kisangani affected 150 people between 5-30 September,
with 23 deaths attributed to the disease, humanitarian sources told IRIN.
Some 139 cases were reported in the Lubungu area on the left bank, while 11
cases were recorded on the right bank within Kisangani health zone.
Humanitarian agencies were supporting cholera treatment services and
undertaking prevention activities in affected areas, the sources said. But
water-treatment chemicals were in very short supply in the town, raising
concerns that the outbreak could spread, they added.

A new upsurge of cholera in the Chidzolomondo area of Macanga district in
the western Mozambican province of Tete has claimed five lives between its
onset 19 September, the Noticias daily reported Wednesday. Tete provincial
chief doctor Francisco Xavier told reporters that 49 cases were diagnosed
by 27 September, and expressed fear that the situation may worsen during
the next few days. The grounds for Xavier's fears were the lack of clean
drinking water in the area, and the approaching rain season. Local district
administrator Evaristo Wezulo said that the government has dispatched a
medical team to deal with the situation, and was doing its best to solve
the water shortage problem. He said that laboratory analysis proved that
all patients who came to health units complaining of acute diarrhoea and
vomiting were indeed suffering from cholera. "The results of the samples we
collected from the Chidzolomondo health centre confirmed that it is
cholera," Wezulo explained. He also noted that many people from various
places across the country go to Chidzolomondo to buy maize, beans, and
other products which is another reason for fearing the spread of the
disease. "We are directing our attention to other places that have frequent
contacts with Macanga district, particularly Tete city, to take the
necessary preventive measures," he said. He lamented that the fact that
there were five deaths in just four days, and the approach of the rain
season, made the health authorities aware of the seriousness of the
situation, and prompted them to take emergency measures. The last outbreak
of cholera in Tete early 1999, registered 4725 cases and 148 deaths.

Monrovia (Star Radio, 5 Oct 1999) - A disease suspected to be diarrhea has
killed two persons in Buchanan, Grand Bassa County. Reports from Buchanan
says 38 more persons are undergoing treatment for the disease. Our
correspondent there said 16 of the patients were at the Liberia Government
Hospital. He said 22 others were at the St. Peters Claver Health Center in
Buchanan. The administrator at the Government Hospital said most of the
patients were suffering from running stomach. Mr. Augustine Nagbe said many
of the patients were infants and the elderly. He said the main cause of the
disease has not been established. Mr. Nagbe said health authorities however
suspect that contaminated food and pollution are the cause of the disease.
He said more drugs were needed to help the victims. The Health Ministry in
Monrovia said it was not aware of the disease outbreak in Buchanan.

At least 40 people have died in northern Sierra Leone in the past 10 days
from an epidemic linked to the inadequate burial of hundreds of civil war
victims, a community health officer said Thursday. Clifford Gamanga told
reporters that more than 200 people a day, mostly children and the elderly,
were being treated in Port Loko district for the disease, which had all the
hallmarks of cholera but had yet to be formally identified. ``The reasons
for the epidemic are the hurried and unhygienic burial of hundreds of
bodies in and around the town after rebels attacked the town late last year
and this year,'' Gamanga said in the capital Freetown. ``The rains, which
are coming to a close, have washed many of these bodies to the surface and
exposed them to surface water, flies and dogs,'' he added. International
aid workers operating in the area confirmed the epidemic and appealed for a
concerted effort to halt its spread. Sierra Leone's president, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah, signed a peace deal in Togo in July ending the conflict and giving
his rebel foes seats in government. A fragile truce has held but
implementation of the deal has been slow.

Two persons died as victims of cholera in Guatemala, elevating to 12 the
number of deaths as a direct or indirect consequence of the strong rain
falls in the last two weeks, informed the Ministry of Health this
Wednesday. The two mortal victims were reported in the municipality of
Cahabon, Department of Alta Verapaz, 292 km to the north of the capital, in
where last week they detected an outbreak of cholera which infected 16
persons, said the press officer of the Ministry of Health, Patricia Lepe.
Another two cases of cholera were reported in the Departments of Jutiapa
(east) and two more in Totonicapan (west), as a result of the copious
rainfalls and flooding, which contaminate the waters, favoring the spread
of diseases, explained the spokesperson. The Ministry of Health detected a
general increase in respiratory infections, which went from 10 percent to
40 percent of the population affected. In order to avoid the expansion of
cholera and other diseases such as dengue, malaria and skin infections, the
health authorities have declared a red alert (maximum) in 14 of the 22
departments of the country, and a yellow [alert] (prevention) in the
remaining [departments]. The Ministry of Health assigned at high
availability, 27 health teams, each composted of a physician
epidemiologist, a district physician, a nurse, an environment health
inspector, and a nursing auxiliary [paramedical]. Between January and the
beginning of September in Guatemala there were 158 cases of cholera
reported, with 5 deaths, in addition to 61 cases of classic dengue and two
[cases] of dengue hemorrhagic [fever] (which can be fatal if not treated in
a timely manner). Nevertheless, between 5 and 11 September only, when the
strong rains began, there were 11 cases of cholera and 104 of classic
dengue, according to the official figures. Because of ongoing conditions,
since 10 persons have died having been buried by landslides or flash
flooding of overflowing rivers. Also, there were 2860 persons reported at
risk, 4263 evacuated, 11 injured, 753 homeless (with total loss of
materials), 4826 affected, according to the count of the National Disaster
Reduction (CONRED) institution. In addition, 105 houses were destroyed, 435
at risk, 937 houses with moderate damage and 7 bridges with partial damage,
indicated the institution. The Ministry of Communications informed that
they had allocated approximately 2 million dollars for the reparation of
bridges and highways damaged by the floods and avalanches of mud and trees.

An epidemic of dysentery has been localized in the town of Prokopyevsk in
South Siberia. For the first time in fifteen days, no fresh case of the
disease has been registered in this mining town. The outbreak of the
disease was due to low quality drinking water and one of the measures to
suppress the infection consisted in the emergency replacement of the old
water mains. A total of 336 people, including 217 children, have required
medical assistance.
