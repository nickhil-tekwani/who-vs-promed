As of 22 May 2014, a total of 574 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg have been reported from 27 states and Puerto Rico since 1 Mar 2013. Most of the ill persons (77 percent) have been reported from California.

Since the last update on 9 Apr 2014, a total of 50 new ill persons have been reported from 8 states: Arizona (1), California (42), Georgia (1), Montana (1), Nevada (1), Oregon (1), Texas (1), and Utah (2). Since the last update, an average of 8 new ill persons have been reported each week to CDC.

Among 560 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 1 Mar 2013 to 1 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 93 years, with a median age of 18 years. 51 percent of ill persons are male. Among 478 persons with available information, 178 (37 percent) reported being hospitalized. 13 percent of ill persons have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, approximately 5 percent of persons ill with salmonellosis develop blood infections. No deaths have been reported.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 310 (86 percent) of 361 ill persons interviewed to date report consuming chicken in the week before becoming ill. Among those who had brand information available, 119 (74 percent) of 161 ill persons reported that they had consumed Foster Farms brand chicken or another brand likely produced by Foster Farms.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials indicate that consumption of Foster Farms brand chicken is the likely source of this outbreak of _Salmonella_ Heidelberg infections. The outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg are resistant to several commonly prescribed antibiotics. Although these antibiotics are not typically used to treat _Salmonella_ bloodstream infections or other severe _Salmonella_ infections, antibiotic resistance can be associated with increased risk of hospitalization in infected individuals.

It is not unusual for raw poultry from any producer to have _Salmonella_ bacteria. CDC and USDA-FSIS recommend consumers follow food safety tips to prevent _Salmonella_ infection from raw poultry produced by Foster Farms or any other brand.

[This prolonged chicken-borne outbreak continues, now over an almost 15-month period. As with ground beef tainted with _E. coli_ O157:H7, adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene should prevent this foodborne illness. 15 months is past the usual freezer life of chicken in my freezer. It is unclear over what period of time that chicken was distributed. - Mod.LL
