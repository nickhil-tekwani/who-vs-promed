The Washoe County Health District has confirmed a 5th case of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, at Bishop Manogue High School.

After 4 previous cases were reported, Bishop Manogue H.S. agreed to close from 22-27 Oct 2019 to reduce the transmission of the disease. School has since resumed, and there have not been any changes announced in class schedules or sports and activities.

Student athletes participating in fall sports must meet 3 requirements:
1. They cannot exhibit any signs or symptoms of pertussis.
2. The students must be up to date on pertussis vaccinations.
3. The athletes must complete a course of physician-prescribed antibiotics prior to their competition date.

Unvaccinated students will not be allowed on campus until the families provide proof of a TDAP vaccination and 7 days have passed since the vaccination was received. If a student declines to be vaccinated, they will not be allowed to return to school until after 21 days following the last reported case.

"Whooping cough" cases have spiked among Fauquier County children in the last 6 weeks, according regional health officials. The Rappahannock-Rapidan Health District "has investigated a total of 25 reports of pertussis illness in children, with ages ranging from under 1 to 17 years" since mid-September [2019], spokeswoman Lorrie Andrew-Spear said Wednesday [30 Oct 2019]. Last year [2018], the health district reported a total of 10 cases in its 5 counties.

"Fauquier County Health Department staff are working closely with local health care providers, Fauquier County schools and daycare centers to identify, treat and exclude cases from group activities," Ms. Andrew-Spear wrote in a press release. "It is important to keep ill children away from others when necessary to prevent the spread of illness. "Additionally, the Fauquier Health Department has sent letters home with all children/students who attend daycare centers or schools with identified cases of pertussis."

Most of the recently-diagnosed children "have been previously vaccinated, so it is important to be aware that you can still get pertussis if you have been vaccinated in the past, she said. "The effectiveness of the vaccine varies and may decrease over time. "This does not mean that you should not get the vaccine. The current vaccine prevents illness for the majority who receive it and also helps to prevent severe respiratory illness, hospitalizations and or death in infants and immune-compromised or elderly patients." Ms. Andrew-Spear urged anyone with pertussis symptoms to "seek medical evaluation and avoid public or group settings."

For more information, call Fauquier Health Department at 540-347-6400 and ask to speak with a public health nurse or contact RRHD District Epidemiologist Daniel Ferrell at 540-316-6278.

Three cases of whooping cough were discovered at Tualatin High School recently. Those cases add to one at Northeast Portland's Grant High School, where a student was diagnosed with the illness earlier this week.

Washington County has seen 36 confirmed or suspected cases of the illness so far this year [2019], county health department spokeswoman Wendy Gordon told The Oregonian/Oregon Live.

According to the Oregon Health Authority, 93% of Washington County children between the ages of 13 and 17 have received booster shots for whooping cough, also known as pertussis, which also guards against diphtheria and tetanus.

In all of 2018, officials say, Washington County tracked just 24 cases. In 2017, Washington County saw 41 cases, more than twice as many as the 20 that were reported in 2016. Health officials say the up-and-down yearly pattern is typical of the disease. The previous year, 2015, saw a whopping 107 cases of whooping cough in Washington County, a sharp spike over the previous year's 37.

In Multnomah County, health officials have documented 61 suspected or confirmed cases of pertussis since the beginning of the year. Last year [2018], 38 cases had been discovered by Halloween.

There is a vaccine for the disease, which children are required to receive at least 4 times before beginning kindergarten, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Starting at age 7, kids should get at least one booster shot, the agency says.

A Jefferson County school district has an outbreak of whooping cough. So far, more than a dozen cases have been reported.

Pertussis or whooping cough began to appear at the Festus High School and Intermediate School around mid-October [2019]. District officials say 59 students have reported symptoms: 15 have tested positive for whooping cough, while 22 tested negative, and 22 were waiting for results. 14 of the students attend the high school and one student at the intermediate school.

The district was asked whether unvaccinated students were the cause of the outbreak. The district says that's not the case. Less than half a percent of the student population is unvaccinated. None of those who tested positive to pertussis displayed symptoms.

A medical problem is getting attention in area classrooms, as reported this week by at least 3 area public school districts. "It has come to our attention that you (or) your child may have been exposed to a person who has pertussis (whooping cough)," said a letter sent out Tuesday [5 Nov 2019] by Penns Manor Area Superintendent Daren Johnston.

"The Indiana School District has been notified of a few confirmed cases of pertussis (whooping cough) in our district," Director of Education Robert J. Heinrich Jr. confirmed Thursday [7 Nov 2019] in an email to the Gazette.

As letters posted on Marion Center Area and Penns Manor Area websites point out, in rare cases, especially in infants less than one year of age, whooping cough can be fatal.

A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Health said several cases have been reported in Indiana County. "We have been working closely with the (Indiana County) school districts and other school districts in the area to prevent the spread of illness," department Press Secretary Nate Wardle said Thursday [7 Nov 2019] afternoon. "Department of Health template letters with recommendations have been provided to area school districts for distribution to faculty and families of students."

In online postings by Weimer and Johnston, the letters hew closely to what Wardle's department has sent out.

"If you (or) your child is coughing, promptly contact your (or) your child's doctor," the Penns Manor superintendent posted. "(The) doctor may obtain a nasopharyngeal culture to test for pertussis. In addition, if the doctor suspects pertussis, an antibiotic will be given to your child to lower the chance of spreading the disease to others." Johnston stressed in his letter that the child continue taking that antibiotic even after he or she is back in the classroom, something that is allowed to happen 5 days after the child began taking it.

"The department encourages everyone to check and make sure they are up to date on all immunizations, which include the DTaP vaccine for children under 7, and the Tdap vaccine for older children and adults," he said. As noted in department talking points quoted in the Penns Manor and Marion Center letters, both vaccines combine diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine. "If you are not sure your child is properly immunized, promptly contact his or her doctor," both superintendents included in their letters. Both letters referred parents and physicians to a toll-free Department of Health number, (877) 724-3258.
