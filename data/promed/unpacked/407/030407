[1] Delta variant
[A] UK lockdown
Date: Sun 6 Jun 2021
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/06/data-on-delta-variant-splits-scientists-on-lifting-final-covid-restrictions


Health experts remain divided over the dangers posed by the new Delta variant of Covid-19 and the risks it poses to the nation as ministers consider whether or not to lift lockdown later this month [June 2021].

Some argue that the new variant, 1st identified in India, is a significantly increased threat to the UK and have urged that delays be imposed on the total removal of social restrictions, due on 21 Jun 2021.

"By the government's own criteria, it would be foolish now to proceed on the data that we've got. The risk would be very great indeed," said Professor Stephen Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (SPI-B) which advises the government. Reicher said the current assessment of the risks not being fundamentally changed by the appearance of the Delta variant was "not upheld".

This view was backed by scientists of the Independent Sage group, who argued that data indicated the Delta variant had higher infectivity and was more likely to cause disease and hospitalisations. "That makes it very difficult to justify progressing with the last stage of lockdown," the group said last week.

Other scientists believe such calls are premature. While urging caution, they say fears that the Delta variant poses a significant new threat - both in terms of infectivity and as a cause of serious illness - are premature. "The suggestion that the India variant is more pathogenic needs to be taken with a big dose of salt," said Ian Jones, professor of virology, Reading University.

This view was supported by Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia. "We need to be a little cautious in assuming that the Delta variant is intrinsically more virulent than the Alpha variant [1st identified in Kent]," he said.

Virologist Julian Tang, of Leicester University, added: "There was an initial belief that the Alpha was more transmissible, which turned out to be true, and more clinically severe, which turned out to be false."

The head of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, said last week the number in hospital with the Delta variant was rising but not "very significantly". Many of those in hospital in Bolton -- the area worst hit by the variant -- were younger, with "very few" fully vaccinated patients. This appeared to show vaccines had "broken the chain" between infection and serious illness, he added.

A key issue is whether the new variant is more infectious and more likely to trigger serious illness. Tang said that from an evolutionary viewpoint, if a virus is more transmissible, it tends to be less severe. "Those infected still have to be well and mobile enough to spread the infection to others," he added.

Researchers argue that over time, viruses tend to trigger less severe symptoms in those they infect. "From a virus's point of view, there is an advantage in being more transmissible, you reach more people, but there is no advantage in making people sicker."

But Professor Rowland Kao of Edinburgh University, sounded a note of caution. "Yes, the long-term trajectory of a virus is that it tends to become less pathogenic over time but we are only in the early stages of Covid-19," he told the Observer . "This virus spread virtually instantaneously round the world in early 2020. Then lockdowns were imposed. So we have essentially set up hundreds of individual laboratory experiments all around the world, a mix that is conducive to producing variants - and some could be more pathogenic than others. However, in the longer term, in a couple of years I expect the virus to become less dangerous."

Scientists say it should become apparent very soon if the Delta variant is more pathogenic than its predecessors. Hospitalisations are likely to increase although that might just reflect rising case numbers.

"However, if increased numbers of people have to go to hospital because of the seriousness of their condition, and we discover it is not just because there are more infected people but because it is being caused by the Delta variant triggering more hospitalisations per infection, then it would be a very bold move to release all restrictions at that point," added Kao.

Last week, a government spokesperson said "no decision" had been made on whether to ease all coronavirus restrictions on 21 Jun, amid reports Boris Johnson could delay the move by at least a fortnight.

[B] Delta variant: transmissibility
Date: Sun 6 Jun 2021
Source: RTE [abridged, edited]
https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/2021/0606/1226306-global-coronavirus/


The Delta (India) variant of the coronavirus is estimated to be 40% more transmissible than the Alpha (UK) variant that caused the last wave of infections in the UK, Britain's health minister has said.

But people who have received 2 doses of vaccine, should be equally protected against either variant, Matt Hancock added.

"That figure, around 40% more transmissible, is indeed the latest advice I have," he told Sky News.

The Delta variant is now the dominant strain in the UK, according to Public Health England figures.

It was the Alpha variant that forced the UK into lockdown in January.

Mr Hancock said the 40% figure came from the government body of scientific advisors, SAGE.

Concern is mounting over whether the emergence of the Delta variant threatens the government's provisional 21 Jun 2021 deadline for lifting virus restrictions.

Mr Hancock acknowledged that the Delta variant "does make the calculation more difficult for 21 Jun 2021".

"We'll look at the data for another week and then make a judgement," he told the BBC, stressing that the government was "absolutely open" to delaying the lifting of restrictions.

The minister nevertheless stressed that those who have had 2 doses of vaccine should be protected against illness from the Delta variant.

Public Health England said last month [May 2021] that research showed double vaccination was similarly effective against both the Alpha and Delta variants.

"The best scientific advice I have at this stage is that, after one jab, it's not quite as effective against the new Delta variant, but after both jabs, it is," Mr Hancock told the BBC.

So far, hospitalisations are "broadly flat", with very few hospitalised after receiving both vaccine doses, he added.

The UK has so far given more than 27 million people 2 doses -- more than 50% of adults -- while more than 40 million have had one dose.

Mr Hancock said the government was "taking clinical advice" on whether to extend the vaccination programme to children over 12, who are believed to be playing a major role in spreading the virus. But this would not be mandatory, he added.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to "defeat Covid" by vaccinating the world by the end of next year, as he pushes for a global watch system to catch new variants before they can plunge countries back into lockdown.

He is set to stress the importance of the global vaccine programme when he meets with world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, on Fri [11 Jun 2021] in Cornwall for the 1st face-to-face G7 meeting since the pandemic hit.

Setting the scene before their gathering in Carbis Bay, Mr Johnson is calling on his counterparts to "rise to the greatest challenge of the post-war era" by "vaccinating the world by the end of next year [2022]", in a move he said would be the single greatest feat in medical history.

No. 10 said Mr Johnson will tell his counterparts that the world's biggest economies must lower barriers to the international distribution of vaccines and share surplus doses with developing countries bilaterally and through Covax, the United-Nations backed scheme aiming to supply low and medium income countries with jabs.

Meanwhile, a global health expert has said that eradicating coronavirus from the world is not currently a "reasonable target".

People will have to learn to live with the disease, World Health Organization special envoy on Covid-19 Dr David Nabarro said.

His comments were echoed by the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, who said the aim will be to minimise the amount of severe disease the virus causes.

Dr Nabarro told Sky News: "Humanity is going to have to learn how to co-exist with this virus, preventing it from spiking and then surging and causing hotspots of disease, and we're going to have to be able to do this for the foreseeable future.

"Eradication is not currently a reasonable target for the world."

"Each time there is a sudden surge, it does stimulate in one's mind the thought that there might be a new variant appearing. That wouldn't be surprising."

He said that will be "the pattern for the future", adding: "This virus isn't going away any time soon; there will be variants emerging."

Bernal JL, Andrews N, Gower C et al. Effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the B.1.617.2 variant . medRxiv 2021.05.22.21257658; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.22.21257658

"Abstract
Background. The B.1.617.2 COVID-19 variant has contributed to the surge in cases in India and has now been detected across the globe, including a notable increase in cases in the UK. We estimate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 [Pfizer] and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 [Oxford-AstraZeneca] vaccines against this variant.

"Methods. A test negative case control design was used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease with both variants over the period that B.1.617.2 began circulating with cases identified based on sequencing and S-gene target status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of COVID-19 in England was used to estimate the proportion of cases with B.1.617.2 compared to the predominant strain (B.1.1.7) by vaccination status.

"Results. Effectiveness was notably lower after 1 dose of vaccine with B.1.617.2 cases 33.5% (95%CI: 20.6 to 44.3) compared to B.1.1.7 cases 51.1% (95%CI: 47.3 to 54.7) with similar results for both vaccines. With BNT162b2 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 93.4% (95%CI: 90.4 to 95.5) with B.1.1.7 to 87.9% (95%CI: 78.2 to 93.2) with B.1.617.2. With ChAdOx1 2 dose effectiveness reduced from 66.1% (95% CI: 54.0 to 75.0) with B.1.1.7 to 59.8% (95%CI: 28.9 to 77.3) with B.1.617.2. Sequenced cases detected after 1 or 2 doses of vaccination had a higher odds of infection with B.1.617.2 compared to unvaccinated cases (OR 1.40; 95%CI: 1.13-1.75).

"Conclusions After 2 doses of either vaccine there were only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness with the B.1.617.2 variant. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked with dose 1. This would support maximising vaccine uptake with 2 doses among vulnerable groups.

[2] WHO: vaccination of children
Date: Fri 4 Jun 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/4/vaccinating-children-not-a-high-priority-amid-shortage-who


The World Health Organization's top vaccines expert has said that immunising children against COVID-19 is not a high priority from a WHO perspective, given the extremely limited global supply of doses.

During a social media session on Thu [3 Jun 2021], Dr Kate O'Brien said children should not be a focus of COVID-19 immunisation programmes, even as increasing numbers of rich countries authorise their coronavirus shots for teenagers and children.

"Children are at very, very low risk of actually getting COVID disease," said O'Brien, a paediatrician and director of the WHO's vaccines department.

She said that the rationale for immunising children was to stop transmission rather than to protect them from getting sick or dying.

"When we're in this really difficult place, as we are right now, where the supply of vaccine is insufficient for everybody around the world, immunising kids is not a high priority right now."

O'Brien said it was critical to ensure health workers and the elderly, or those with underlying conditions, were inoculated ahead of teenagers and children.

Canada, the United States and the European Union have all recently given the green light to some COVID-19 vaccines for children aged 12-15 as they approach their vaccination targets for adults.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has urged rich countries to donate shots to poor countries rather than immunise their adolescents and children.

Fewer than one percent of COVID-19 vaccines administered globally have been used in poor countries.

O'Brien said it might be appropriate to immunise children against the coronavirus "in due course, when the supply increases much more substantially".

She added that it was not necessary to vaccinate children before sending them back to school, as long as the adults in contact with them were immunised.

"Immunisation of children in order to send them back to school is not the predominant requirement for them to go back to school safely," she said.

"They can go back to school safely if what we're doing is immunising those who are around them who are at risk."

[It is a sad commentary on global cooperation to combat this pandemic that "fewer than one percent of COVID-19 vaccines administered globally have been used in poor countries." While children contribute to transmission of the virus, they can wear masks to help decrease transmissibility, and their parents should be vaccinated. With vaccine in short supply, high risk individuals including health care and other frontline workers should have priority in all countries, followed by the elderly and other high risk individuals. - Mod.LK]

[3] VITT & Ischemic stroke

Al-Mayhani T, Saber S, Stubbs MJ, et al.Ischaemic stroke as a presenting feature of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry Published Online 1st: 25 May 2021. doi: 10.1136/jnnp-2021-326984.

"A syndrome of vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has recently been reported following the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine encoding the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.1-4 Previously described patients developed thrombosis, mainly affecting cerebral venous sinuses, with thrombocytopenia and antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4), but the characteristics of VITT with arterial thrombosis have not previously been described. Here, we report 3 patients with VITT who presented with ischaemic stroke.

"Patient 1, a 35-year-old Asian woman, developed episodic right temporal and periorbital headache 6 days after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Five days later, she awoke with left face, arm and leg weakness, right gaze preference and drowsiness. Non-contrast CT and CT angiography (CTA) revealed occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) distal M1 segment with extensive ischaemia and haemorrhagic transformation (figure 1A-C)).

"Patient 2, a 37-year-old White female, presented 12 days after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine with diffuse headache, left visual field loss, confusion and left arm weakness. CTA showed occlusion of both internal carotid arteries (figure 1E) and left transverse sinus thrombosis (figure 1F).

"Patient 3, a 43-year-old Asian male, presented 21 days after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine with dysphasia. CT and magnetic resonance (MR) showed an acute left frontal and insular infarct corresponding to the anterior cortical territory of the left MCA, with a small volume of haemorrhagic transformation within the infarct.

"Our observations suggest that, in addition to venous thrombosis, the neurological spectrum of VITT can include arterial occlusion. Young patients presenting with ischaemic stroke after receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine should urgently be evaluated for VITT with laboratory tests (including platelet count, D-dimers, fibrinogen and anti-PF4 antibodies) and assessment for co-existing venous thromboses; they should be managed by a multidisciplinary team (haematology, neurology, stroke, neurosurgery and neuroradiology) for rapid access to treatments including intravenous immune globulin, methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis and non-heparin anticoagulants, for example fondaparinux, argatroban, or direct oral anticoagulants. Endovascular therapy or decompressive hemicraniectomy may also be indicated in carefully selected patients.1 3 5
