Last week, 9 new West Nile virus [WNV infection] cases were recorded, raising the total to 26.

What mainly seems to worry experts is that cases of patients with symptoms involving the central nervous system have more than doubled, while 3 other municipalities are under quarantine by the National Blood Center due to an increased possibility of virus transmission by mosquitoes.

Regarding the patients' ages, according to KEELPNO [Hellenic Center for Disease Control & Prevention], the youngest patient is 17 years old and the oldest is 100 years old.

Of the last 9 cases, 4 of them were recorded in Attica (2 in Agia Paraskevi, one in Pallini, and another one in Vrilissia), 2 in the municipality of Nestos in Kavala and one in Chalcedon of Thessaloniki, one in Topeiros, and the last one in Abdera of Xanthi.

The good news is that out of the 26 patients, 21 of them have been discharged, while the other 5 remain hospitalized.

[It is becoming increasingly clear that WNV has become endemic in Greece and probably in nearby countries as well. With the transmission season now ongoing, more cases of WNV infection can be expected. It would be of interest to know whether there have been equine cases in this area as well.
