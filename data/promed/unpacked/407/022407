[2] VEE - Belize: news report

Horse infections detected in Belize
-----------------------------------
The Belize Agricultural Health Authority, BAHA, has confirmed that
equine encephalomyelitis viruses are circulating in Belize. These
viral diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes and alternate infection
of birds or rodents. Outbreaks have been detected in the Belize,
Stann Creek, and Cayo Districts. Love News spoke to Doctor Miguel
Depaz, who is a veterinary officer for BAHA at central Farm.

Doctor Miguel Depaz: veterinary officer, BAHA
"Normally we have a few cases of equine encephalomyelitis every year;
sporadic cases. The reason why we are making this report is because
we are having an increase in the number of cases but more so in Cayo.
We are having cases in horses; the name of the disease is Venezuelan
equine encephalomyelitis and it is transmittable to humans because
the vector is mosquitoes. We say it is a zoonotic disease because it
can be transmitted to humans. It affects the nervous system so you
have incoordination, the horses don't seem to know where they are; we
refer to that as stupor. They also have tremors but basically it is
the nervous system that is affected. It would be transmitted by
mosquitoes to humans, you would get flu like symptoms."

Doctor Depaz says that the risk of infection can be reduced if horse
owners vaccinate their horses, a move that BAHA is strongly
recommending. He also gave some advice to other Belizeans.

Doctor Miguel Depaz: veterinary officer, BAHA
"Because it is transmitted by mosquitoes you want to keep water
ponds, containers, and tires far away. So if you can do some spraying
to get rid of the mosquitoes we know that at this time of the year
there is an increase of mosquitoes and because mosquitoes are the
vectors you want to get rid of the mosquitoes."

Additional information can be obtained from BAHA at telephone number 824-4899.

[The location of the outbreaks reported from Liberia, Guanacaste, can

[Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) has caused widespread outbreaks
in Central America in horses with mortalities occurring at higher
rates than presented in these reports. It is also zoonotic, although
case fatality rates in humans are generally less than for EEE
(eastern equine encephalitis). These reports indicate that VEE has
occurred recently on the West Coast of Costa Rica and on the
Caribbean Coast of Belize. There have been no reports from the 4
interspersed countries, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, and
Guatemala.

While we have no current information indicating the disease has taken
off in epidemic form as occurred in 1995 or 1969-71, progress of the
disease should be monitored closely and official reports filed
regularly. ProMED-mail would like to know of any information
indicating that the current level of the disease and any increase
from the levels reported here. I would also like to apologize for not
getting these reports out earlier in the month.

A good summary of the disease in animals, current conditions favoring
rapid spread, and its impact on humans has been prepared by Dr
Belloto at the Veterinary Public Health Program, PAHO. I have copied
the information below (see
<http://www.paho.org/english/dd/PED/te_equi.htm>).

"Equine encephalitides are viral zoonoses that occur episodically and
cause outbreaks in equines and, less frequently, in humans. The
etiological agents are viruses belonging to the genus _Alphavirus_ in
the _Togaviridae_ family. Infection is maintained in natural foci
between wild reservoirs and mosquitoes. Three viruses are important:
Western equine (WEE), eastern equine (EEE) and Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis (VEE). A 4th member, Highlands J virus, occurs in
the eastern United States, primarily in Florida.

In Central America, a growing activity of syndromes compatible with
equine encephalitis has been observed in horses during the last 3
years, particularly in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama.
Laboratory isolations of the virus and/or serological typing have
shown EEE and VEE viral infection. These 2 agents are known to cause
high morbidity and mortality among horses, donkeys and mules that, in
turn, become amplifiers of the infection that eventually spreads to
human by mosquito bites.

The VEE virus has caused major epidemics in the Americas. In 1969, an
outbreak started in Ecuador and spread through Peru, Colombia,
Venezuela, Central America, and Mexico reaching finally Texas in
1971. Close to 50 000 equines died. In Ecuador, alone, 31 000 human
cases were reported and 310 deaths.

In 1995, an outbreak occurred in Venezuela and Colombia that affected
7 states in Venezuela and the department of La Guajira in Colombia.
This outbreak registered more than 40 000 human cases and 46 deaths.
The outbreak was associated with one period of unusually intense rain
with a subsequent increase of mosquito populations, vectors of VEE
virus and the lack of vaccination among the equine population.

The current situation in Central America is similar:
- The existence of natural foci where viral infection persists in
wild reservoirs. The reservoirs include rodents: wild birds and bats.
- An increase in the population of mosquito vectors. Stagnant waters
in flooded lands favors an increase in mosquito breeding sites, and
consequently, the growth of their population and a greater exposure
of the domestic animals and humans to mosquito bites and infections
carried by them.
- A susceptible equine population. With the exception of a few areas
in Guatemala and Belize, registries of horse vaccinations against VEE
and/or EEE in the last 4 years are non-existent in the countries
affected by Hurricane Mitch. This can translate into a population
that is entirely susceptible to the infection can be implied. The
displacement of humans and this congregation in vulnerable areas,
such as overcrowded refugee camps, surrounded by infected domestic
animals, stagnant waters, and poor hygienic conditions, will be part
of the scenario of a possible epidemic.

We are alerting the health authorities in these areas to improve
surveillance of neurological syndromes compatible with equine
encephalomyelitis in equines and to strengthen coordination among
sectors for this purpose. Special consideration should be given to
high-risk areas where there are larger numbers of horses, mules and
donkeys (late predictors of equine encephalitides epidemics) and no
history of vaccination against EEE and/or VEE exists in order to take
timely and adequate preventive and control measures such as:
1. Immediate vaccination of horses mules, and donkeys.
2. Detection and treatment of mosquito breeding sites, especially
those close to permanent and temporary human settlements (refugees).
3. Equine case monitoring and reporting, characterized by:
- Fever, anorexia and depression accompanied by nervous signs such
as: deep depression, difficulties with equilibrium, resting the head
on objects, insomnia. Several animals might show hypersensitivity to
touch and sound, excitation, walk in circles, blindness, and bumping
into obstacles. They often fall and are unable to get up.
4. Monitoring of probable human cases, characterized by:
- Fever headache, nausea, vomiting, muscular and pains in the joints,
chills, photophobia and prostration, convulsions or alteration of the
state of conscience, somnolence, hyperacusia, and coma.
- In people under 3 years of age: fever, alterations of the state of
conscience or convulsions". - Mod.PC]
