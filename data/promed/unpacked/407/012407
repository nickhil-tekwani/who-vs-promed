Further investigation of the human rabies case by the New York State
Department of Health with Ghana revealed the biting dog was one of 6
puppies. The mother dog and 5 puppies died shortly before the bite
incident; the biting puppy died after the incident--none were tested for
rabies. Preliminary tests indicate African dog variant of rabies. The
patient was from Ghana and had a history of being bitten by his own puppy
two and one-half months prior to symptom onset. The puppy had been
unvaccinated (we are uncertain of its precise age), and bit the victim on
his thumb and leg. In addition to the victim who died in New York, 3 others
were bitten by the dog during the same time period. No wound care or PEP
(post exposure prophylaxis) was sought at the time of the incidents.
In our contacts with Ghana, we have verified one of the 3 other bite
victims was located over the past weekend and recommended for PEP, in hopes
that if virus transmission occurred, he may be experiencing a longer
incubation period and rabies treatment may still be effective. The other 2
bite victims have still not been located.
