Malaria Taiwan - First Local Transmission in 38 Years
-------------------------------------------------
The CDC [Taipei] is concerned the disease may continue to spread, after a
Taitung County man who has not traveled abroad contracted the illness. The
Department of Health's Center for Disease Control (CDC) [Taipei] said
yesterday that tests had confirmed that a man in Taitung has malaria.
The CDC is concerned that, according to World Health Organization
standards, it is the first case of the disease contracted locally. "We
know this is an introduced [domestically transmitted] case because the
patient never traveled abroad," said Shih Wen-Vi, deputy director-general
of the CDC. "We are still in the process of investigating and more
information will be forthcoming. But we believe that this man was infected
by people who had traveled abroad recently."
According to Shih, since the WHO declared Taiwan malaria-free in 1965,
Taiwan has continued to see isolated cases of malaria each year. 19 cases
have been reported so far in 2003. 18 of these were result of people being
infected abroad, while the most recent case was contracted in Taiwan. "One
case of malaria is not a big deal, but if it begins to spread to more
people, then we have a problem," Shih said.
The CDC stated that of the roughly 17 types of mosquitoes in Taiwan, only
the _Anopheles minimus_ spreads the disease. These mosquitoes inhabit
Pingtung, Tainan, Taitung, Hualien, and Kaohsiung counties. The mosquito
can be identified by its 5 black and white stripes and a body angled upward.
The infected patient, a 57-year-old Aboriginal man from Taitung County, has
been receiving treatment in the Mackay Memorial Hospital since he began
showing symptoms on Tuesday.
Shih warned the public to stay away from mountainous areas and to avoid
going out at night. He also said that those planning to travel to areas
where malaria is common should visit the CDC before leaving.
According to Shih, some 3 million people die of malaria each year
worldwide. He said, however, that given modern medical knowledge,
identified cases of malaria are easily treatable. Symptoms of the disease
include fever, headache, excessive sweating, nausea, and diarrhea. Because
the incubation period ranges from 11 to 28 days, CDC officials are
investigating the places the infected man visited over the past month. The
Taitung City Government has established a group to cooperate with the CDC
in its investigations.

[Although it is not mentioned, we presume that the patient was infected
with _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria. Malaria was previously endemic in Taiwan,
but a control program was established in 1946 with a grant from the
Rockefeller Foundation. In 1952 1.2 million cases were reported, and Taiwan
was officially declared malaria-free by the WHO in 1965. The present case
shows that transmission potential still exists. With tracing of cases and
mosquito control, larger outbreaks are highly unlikely, and travellers to
Taiwan need not take malaria chemoprophylaxis. - Mod.EP]
