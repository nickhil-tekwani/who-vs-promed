Rafael Rangeli National Hygiene Institute in Venezuela reports for
the epidemiological week ending 22 May 2004 the results of
investigations performed on a probable animal outbreak notified in
the 8th epidemiological week dated 1 Mar 2004 in Maturin district,
Monagas state, specifically in the Salto del Morichal area. The
results were reported as positive for [YF] virus isolation in one
howler monkey [_Alouatta_ spp.] of 17 tested. Consequently, the case
is defined as a laboratory-confirmed viral outbreak.
The Salto del Morichal area is a jungle zone located in the southern
part of Maturin district.
Taken together with the occurrence of the outbreak in the Cedeno
district in the same Monagas state, it can be inferred that the
disease in primates is following a northward course within the state
heading towards Anzoategui and Sucre states; which corresponds to the
typical behavior of the disease in [Venezuela], especially
considering the activity of the Guyana focus implicated in this case.
For this reason, and taking into account that the speed of movement
of primates is around 2km per day, and knowing the course of this
outbreak [is heading] towards Guarico, Miranda, and Aragua states; it
was decided to include the former 2 states as places at risk, for
[the purposes of] epidemiological surveillance of yellow fever.

[42 howler monkeys were reported dead from YF in this state in April
2004 -- see first ref. below. It is remarkable that no human cases
have yet been recorded. Nevertheless, the monkey deaths should have
been reported to WHO within 24 hours.
This report refers to "the activity of the Guyana focus implicated in
this case." Guyana borders Venezuela on the east. If anyone has any
information on current YF activity in Guyana, ProMED would be very
interested to receive it. - Mod.JW]
