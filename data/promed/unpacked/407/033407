A highly pathogenic strain of the H5N1 bird flu was responsible for the
deaths of 6000 poultry on a South Korean farm, the nation's agriculture
ministry says. It has ordered the slaughter of 236 000 nearby animals to
stem the spread of the disease.
The farm in the south western town of Iksan housed 13 000 head of poultry.
Almost half of the brood have died since 19 Nov 2006, the Seoul-based
agriculture ministry said in a statement today. All animals within 500
meters (1640 feet) of the farm will be culled, it said. "The H5N1 strain was
verified as highly pathogenic," the ministry said.
This is the first time H5N1 bird flu has reappeared in South Korea since the
1st outbreak almost 3 years ago.
Japan is temporarily suspending poultry imports from South Korea because of
bird flu concerns. The imports constituted 0.2 per cent of Japan's total in
2005, according to Kenichi Takemoto, head of the Japanese ministry of
agriculture's meat and egg division.

South Korea said on Saturday [25 Nov 2006] that a poultry farm had been hit
by bird flu, saying it found the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in the
country's 1st outbreak in 3 years of the virus that is potentially fatal for
humans.
The agriculture ministry said earlier this week it suspected that a highly
virulent strain of bird flu killed 6000 chickens at a farm in the southwest
part of the country that lies on a path for migratory birds.
"It is the H5N1 strain," the agriculture ministry official said by telephone
of test results. It was too early to say whether the strain found at the
farm was highly pathogenic, he added. The virus virulence could be known
later on Saturday, he said. [But see information in the previous item,
confirming the high pathogenicity. This is also apparent from the reported
mortality rates. - Mod.AS]
The remaining 6000 or so poultry at the farm in North Cholla province have
been culled, South Korean news reports said.
Between December 2003 and March 2004, about 400 000 poultry at South Korean
farms were infected by bird flu. During that outbreak, the country culled
5.3 million birds and spent about 1.5 trillion won [USD 161 million] to
prevent the disease spreading, officials said.
Subsequent testing in the United States indicated at least 9 South Korean
workers involved in the mass cull had been infected with the H5N1 virus, but
none of them developed any major illnesses, South Korean health officials
have said.
Since the virus re-emerged in Asia in 2003, outbreaks have been confirmed in
around 50 countries and territories, according to data from the World
Organisation for Animal Health. [For a list of the affected countries, see
commentary in posting 20061118.3304].
North Korea had an outbreak of bird flu at poultry farms near the capital,
Pyongyang, in February 2005, which caused it to cull more than 200 000
chickens and vaccinate 1.1 million poultry. [An analysis made by the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory for HPAI)
showed that the AI strain which caused the March 2005 outbreak of avian
influenza in chickens in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK,
North Korea) was H7N7. - Mod.AS]
The World Health Organization says that, as of 13 Nov 2006, there have been
258 cases of human infection of the H5N1 strain since 2003, killing 153
people. Many of the victims have been Asians, with 98 deaths in Vietnam and
Indonesia, WHO says.
