[1] News report

A Manitoba farm has been quarantined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
[CFIA] after several turkeys tested positive for a strain of bird flu.

Located north of Winnipeg in the rural municipality of Rockwood, the farm
houses roughly 8200 birds, all of which will need to be destroyed to
prevent the spread of the flu.

Provincial officials stressed Wednesday [24 Nov 2010] that there is no
evidence this is the potentially dangerous Asian H5N1 strain. "We have
confirmed that it's H5," said Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health
officer, who noted further testing is needed to determine the exact strain.

Kettner said the risk of impact on humans is very low at this time. There
are no human illnesses associated with the infected poultry or linked to
the farm, he said.

Manitoba's chief veterinary officer, Wayne Lees, said there is no need to
worry about infected meat getting into the food supply, as the farm is an
egg-producing operation whose eggs are shipped to turkey growers. Turkeys
from the farm are not sold as food.

The outbreak was discovered after the egg production of several turkeys
decreased -- a sign of influenza. The birds were tested, and the flu was
detected. Results were determined Tuesday [24 Nov 2010].

Officials said it's highly unlikely that the strain is the deadly H5N1, as
it has never appeared in North America, but preventative action is being
taken nonetheless. "We're being cautious, because we're in an atmosphere of
change and we can't predict what this ... strain will be," Kettner said.
"We have to complete the testing to establish that this isn't the 1st (H5N1
case)."

The CFIA will now be tracing eggs from the farm, and will attempt to find
where the outbreak originated -- a difficult task. Workers at the turkey
farm are being offered anti-viral medication as a precaution. There have
been 302 reported H5N1 deaths around the world since 2003 and 20 deaths out
of 40 reported cases so far this year [2010], according to the World Health
Organization.

Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Canada
------------------------------------------------
Information received on 25 Nov 2010 from Dr Brian Evans, chief food safety
officer/chief veterinary officer, Office of the President, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, Ottawa, Canada

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 17 Nov 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 23 Nov 2010
Report date: 24 Nov 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 25 Nov 2010
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 11 Mar 2009
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (NAI-2010-MB-001): Rockwood municipality, Manitoba
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species: Birds
Susceptible: 7400
Cases: 3000
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: turkey breeders farm, with 4 barns on site. Barn 1 is
empty, barn 2 contains about 600 toms, barn 3 contains about 3000 hens, and
barn 4 contains about 3800 hens. The hens in both barns 3 and 4 are 44
weeks old and were lethargic with a 45 per cent decrease in egg production
but the egg production has improved since the start of the event. No
respiratory disease was observed. The mortality in the flock has not increased.

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics:
Species: birds
Apparent morbidity rate: 41 per cent
Apparent mortality rate: 0 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate: 0 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: 0 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: this is the 1st outbreak of notifiable avian
influenza (NAI) detected in the province of Manitoba.

The farm has been quarantined by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)
and investigation will be conducted in compliance with Canada's Notifiable
Avian Influenza Hazard Specific Plan. A stamping out policy will be applied.

Preliminary results from the National Center for Foreign Animal Diseases in
Winnipeg indicate the presence of a H5N2 subtype avian influenza virus (PCR).

Sequence analysis of the PCR products indicates that the cleavage site is
consistent with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H5. Closest matches
(99 per cent identity) in Genbank are to North American H5N2 viruses from
wild birds. Virus isolation is under way and additional testing is to come,
including the intravenous pathogenicity index test.

NAI surveillance has been in place in domestic poultry in Canada for many
years and this outbreak is limited to the province of Manitoba.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as
per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code
(2010).

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
screening; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: stamping out; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives
Veterinary Diagnostic Services (local laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 23 Nov 2010 / positive

Laboratory name and type: CFIA - National Center for Foreign Animal
Diseases (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / nucleotide sequencing / 24 Nov 2010 / positive
Birds / real-time PCR / 24 Nov 2010 / positive

Future reporting: the event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be
submitted.

[Indeed, this does not appear to be good news for Canada, and potentially
for its neighbors. Certainly the Canadian officials will be very busy
locating the source of this disease. It is appropriate that they are
protecting the workers.

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by type A influenza virus. The signs can
vary from a mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal,
rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza) depending on
the infecting virus strain, host factors, and environmental stressors.
Signs of avian influenza are extremely variable. In some flocks the only
evidence of the infection is seroconversion, that is, the birds develop a
detectable antibody titer to AI. AI can also be manifest as respiratory,
enteric, reproductive, or nervous system disease. Decreased food
consumption and drops in egg production are among some of the earliest and
most predictable signs of disease.

Signs including coughing, sneezing, ruffled feathers, swollen heads,
nervous signs like depression, and diarrhea may occur together or singly.
In some cases, birds die rapidly without clinical signs of disease.

Wild birds and their excreta should be considered a major source of avian
influenza. Preventing direct contact with free-flying birds and protecting
domestic poultry from contact with the feces of wild birds is an important
way to prevent avian influenza.

Influenza viruses are very sensitive to most detergents and disinfectants.
They are readily inactivated by heating and drying. However, flu viruses
are well protected from inactivation by organic material and infectious
virus can be recovered from manure for up to 105 days. Complete removal of
all organic material is part of any effective disinfection procedure.

Contaminated houses are heated for several days to inactivate virus.
Organic material is removed followed by complete cleaning and disinfection
of all surfaces. Contaminated litter and manure is problematic and should
be composted or buried to ensure that it does not spread infectious virus.

Neither of these articles tells us how the birds became infected. Was it
from the workers? Was it from poor biosanitation? It should be getting cold
in Canada, meaning these turkeys are not likely to have access to wild
birds, which are likely to have migrated south already.
