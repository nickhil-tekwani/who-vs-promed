A comment on some political issues affecting rabies control in Andhra
Pradesh
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some political issues involved in this situation, which in
themselves have little directly to do with rabies, but are
contributing to the difficulty of controlling the Andhra Pradesh
rabies outbreak.

The big issue in the background, again having nothing to do with
rabies but everything to do with who funds whom to do what, is the
movement toward splitting Andhra Pradesh into 2 different states. One
state would still have Hyderabad as capital. The other would have
Visakhapatnam as capital. The folks in Hyderabad are, however, not
eager to cede administrative authority, jobs, and economic influence
to the upstarts in Visakhapatnam, which has quadrupled in size in only
20 years.

The major dog vaccination programs in India are adjuncts of the
national Animal Birth Control [ABC] program, begun in 2003. The
primary participants are local humane societies and for-profit
veterinary clinics who contract with their communities to do ABC
according to a protocol set forth by the Animal Welfare Board of India
[AWBI]. Federal subsidies for ABC are distributed by the AWBI, which
is headquartered in Chennai, not in New Delhi with the rest of the
government.

The original ABC service providers in the part of Andhra Pradesh
where the present rabies outbreak is occurring were the Kakinada SPCA
(Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), the Visakha SPCA,
and the Blue Cross of Hyderabad, founded by actress Amala Akkineni.

I am not sure the Kakinada SPCA program ever advanced beyond
paperwork. Founded in 1896, the organization had become moribund by
2008, when according to The Hindu [newspaper] of 3 Dec 2008 it "had
its working committee abolished by the district collector...owing to
detection of irregularities in its functioning." It has been
reconstituted, I understand, but meanwhile Kakinada has to this day
apparently never had any functional ABC and canine rabies vaccination
program.

The Blue Cross of Hyderabad withdrew from doing ABC, including
high-volume vaccination of other than its own dogs, after becoming
caught between political factions who each sought to control the
allocation of the federal ABC money. There was some violence toward
Blue Cross of Hyderabad employees, and Amala Akkineni said, in effect,
"If you can't conduct yourselves in a civilized manner, we don't want
to be involved. We will not allow ourselves to be used in a partisan
dispute."

An outside contractor, Animal Help of Ahmedabad, was brought to
Hyderabad to take up ABC and vaccination after the Blue Cross of
Hyderabad withdrew, but also discontinued work in Hyderabad as result
of personnel being injured in factional violence. (Animal Help
continues to provide ABC service to many other cities in India and
Bhutan.)

Some ABC work is being done in Hyderabad by private contractors, but
there is a great deal of skepticism within the Indian animal welfare
community about the efficacy of the programs.

The Visakha SPCA persevered, despite encountering probably more
trouble from various directions than the other original Andhra Pradesh
service contractors combined. The Visakha SPCA sterilized and
vaccinated more than 70 000 dogs between 1998 and 2008, eradicating
rabies from inner Visakhapatnam (the original city) and pushing
outward into the Visahka Circle (the surrounding villages, which have
now been absorbed as suburbs.) This was among the major successes in
the history of Indian humane work. In 2010, however, a different
political faction won control of the Visakhapatnam municipal
government, and immediately severed the ABC contract with the Visakha
SPCA. A projected city-run program is still not up and running, almost
a year later, meaning that high-volume dog sterilization and
vaccination has been neglected all this while.

I was advised just last night [22 May 2011] that the Visakha SPCA
stands ready to take up where they left off, and feels capable of
again eradicating rabies from their service area, given municipal
cooperation.

Meanwhile, though, the Visakha SPCA is being prominently blamed in
local media by some politicians for not continuing the work that they
were ordered by the municipal government to stand down from doing.
