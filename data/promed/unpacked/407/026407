Cholera scare in Eastern Cape
-----------------------
A possible outbreak of cholera has led the Eastern Cape health department
to step up the provision of clean water and sanitation. The death of 2
infants and an outbreak of diarrhea in Nogaya village in Qumbu has forced
the Eastern Cape's department of health to step in and deal with issues of
sanitation, lack of clean water and poor diets.
"We don't want to say it is cholera, but the possibility is there," said
departmental spokesperson, Sizwe Kupelo, on Sun, 13 Mar 2005. Residents
relieved themselves in the bushes which washes into the river when it
rained, then they used that water for drinking and washing.
Upon receiving reports on Saturday that 7 children between the ages of 3
and 8 were suffering from mild diarrhea, the health department dispatched
officials and 4 ambulances to the village. While the cases of diarrhea were
mild, one child was found to be passing blood. They also discovered that 2
babies had died during the last week.
"The department discovered a lack of clean water and sanitation in this
village as well as poor diets," said Kupelo. He said while it was not the
function of the health department to intervene in cases like this, "we are
stepping in because we don't want people to die".
The department would send water tanks and portable toilets to the
village. "We have summoned health environmental officials to test samples
of food and water," said Kupelo.
There are many villages in the Transkei without water and sanitation and,
according to Kupelo, they had been battling outbreaks of cholera over the
past year. The health department has embarked on an awareness campaign to
teach people about proper hygiene and give advice such as boiling water
before drinking it to rid it of germs.
