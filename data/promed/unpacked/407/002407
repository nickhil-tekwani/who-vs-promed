For the 2nd day in a row, a Jacksonville student has been diagnosed
with tuberculosis. On Thu 8 Feb 2007, a student at an Eastside
school, RL Brown Elementary School, was diagnosed with TB.
School officials sent letters home to parents about the case.
According to officials, the student is an 11-year-old who has been
treated and released from the hospital. School officials said next
week they plan to test 25 classmates and others who have come into
contact with the 11-year-old.
The health department said it's not clear if the latest case is
connected to the TB case confirmed the day before at Stanton College
Preparatory School. A student there also has active TB, which was
confirmed less than a year after an outbreak at a daycare center
located directly across the street from the high school. Stanton
College Preparatory School is less than a one-tenth of a mile from
Stanton Pre-School, the daycare center that closed shortly after a TB
outbreak there in April 2006 left 4 young children sick. The 2
schools are not affiliated.
The health department tested 180 students and faculty at the Stanton
College Preparatory as a precaution, and found that 16 of them had
come in contact with the disease. Testing on the 16 students and
adults exposed to TB continued on Thu 8 Feb 2007.
"We've evaluated a number of them today, and we're continuing that
evaluation. The ones I've seen today have been started on therapy,"
said Dr. Jeff Lauer of the Duval County Health Department.
The health department said it is taking the proximity of both schools
into consideration as they look into the high school's TB case.
Doctors with the health department said Duval County is the 5th
highest in the state for active TB cases, and that there are
currently 86 active cases of the disease in the county.

[Except for issues relating to drug-resistant tuberculosis, ProMED
has not posted extensively on _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ disease.
The proximity of the cases mentioned here, however, is interesting
and suggests the possibility of common exposure, which can be
determined microbiologically by DNA fingerprinting the isolates from
the recent cases and from the daycare center from 2006.
Time-wise, the interval from exposure with conversion of the TB skin
test to positive and the development of active tuberculosis can be
years to decades. Statistically, only about 10 percent of those
exposed significantly enough to develop tuberculin skin test
reactivity will develop active infection in their lifetime. It is
important to note, however, that about half of these will manifest
within the first 2 years.
It is also important to be aware that treatment of individuals who
have recently become reactive to the tuberculin skin test can
decrease the risk of the development of active TB by about a factor
of 10. Treatment is classically administered with a single drug,
isoniazid. Treatment of the active disease, however, involves the use
of 4 agents. The success of either of these depends on adherence to
the treatment and the preexisting resistance profile of the infecting organism.

bacillus can be seen at:
