Killer disease in Banke was malaria, not dengue
-----------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests in the epidemic areas of Banke district identified
falciparum malaria [_Plasmodium falciparum_] instead of dengue, which
was suspected earlier.
A total of 32 people have died and several hundred suffered from
fever, headache, cough and chills in the 10 VDCs [Village Development
Corporations] of the district. Around 1200 people were affected by
malaria in 4 VDCs, and 521 people were tested positive for falciparum
malaria and the rest for vivax malaria. Twelve serious cases have
been referred to Bheri Zonal Hospital.
When no medical facility was available locally, many suffering took
medicines prescribed by fake doctors coming from across the border.
[A 30-year-old male] of Piparhawa said he took medicines prescribed
by doctors coming from the border of India. The fever is controlled
for a few days, and then starts again. He has been suffering from
fever and headache for the last 10 days. [He] has been taken to Bheri
Zonal Hospital. It took a lot of time for the team coming from
Kathmandu to convince him to go to the hospital.
Piparhawa is the worst affected VDC, with small children to old
people suffering from the disease; 11 people died in the VDC alone,
and all of the 25 huts in the village have at least one or 2
suffering from the disease.
A medical team [headed] by Dr. Mahesh Maskey, advisor for the
Minister for Health and Population, Amik Serchan, a local team from
Banke district, and a team for laboratory testing from Hetuda have
been mobilized in the area to assess the situation and provide
services. The team found that the cause was falciparum malaria.
Those affected were brought to the health camp organized by the
Epidemiology and Disease Control Unit (EDCU) under the MoHP,
Nepalgunj Nursing Hospital and the World Health Organization (WHO).
Six teams from different organizations have been mobilizing in the area.
Dr. Suman Thapa, who was involved in the treatment and test, said
that there was no death from malaria after the mobilization of the
team. There was one death, and it was from diarrhea. The team
carried out regular lab testing and checked everyone in the VDCs.
Although more cases were found, there were no more deaths. Doctors
said that the outbreak was due to the recent flood.
Thapa said the doses of the medicines prescribed and distributed by
the quacks were incomplete. They were also not authorized to
prescribe the drugs, and they charged heavily. Still, people prefer
them than to go to the health post or the hospital. They were even
unwilling to come to the camp. "The doctors visited their homes and
convinced them before they were willing to come to the camp or to go
to the zonal hospital, "said Dr. Thapa.
Around 10 VDCs in remote parts of the district, including Gangapur,
Fattepur-Piparhawa, Narainapur & Holia VDCs, have been affected by
falciparum for the last week, with 32 deaths.
Dr. Maskey said that the major cause of death was malaria, but there
are also deaths from other diseases. If it were only malaria, the
toll would not have been so high.
Dr. Soe Aung, epidemiologist of WHO Nepal, said that there are only a
few new cases of malaria and that there would be no new epidemic in
the area. He said it would take at least 2 weeks to control the
disease. He said no case of dengue was found and there was no risk of
dengue in the area.
A health worker at the Banke Health Post Narayan Sharma said there
was a similar epidemic in the area about 2 decades ago, but the death
was not so high. He said controlling the spread in such a small area
was a challenge.
Sharma said that 1st people suffer from fever, stomach ache,
diarrhea, and headache, and then the patients faint. He said that
there is no doctor in any of the 9 VDCs of the area. He said more
than 300 people became sick in Sonbarsa VDC alone.
There has been a spraying program in the affected VDCs to control
malaria. There are 292 houses in the Sonbarsa VDC, and there is a
plan to complete spraying in all the houses within 2 days, and then
start in another VDC.
The epidemic had started on18 Oct [2006], but the information about
the outbreak had reached the district headquarters only after 10
days. A health worker at the Fattepur Health Post Durga Sharma said
people were not aware of the epidemic and that the locals do not take
any initiative to control the disease. The death toll would not have
been so high if the epidemic had been reported earlier.

[As mentioned in an earlier posting, malaria is endemic in the Terai
region of Nepal along the border with India. The affected area in the
above newswire is in this known malaria endemic zone (see
<http://www.fitfortravel.scot.nhs.uk/Country/Nepal_Malaria_Map.htm> and
<http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Malaria_in_the_SEAR_NEp_ende_dist.pdf>
for maps of Nepal malaria zones and juxtapose this with the map of
Banke, Nepal to see how it fits perfectly into the known malaria
endemic zone found at
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Sa.nsf/luFullMap/C56204714E324A2A852571F500593C44/$File/ocha_FL_npl050906.pdf?OpenElement>.
Of note, according to the WHO district malaria indices
<http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Malaria_nepapi9799.pdf>,
Bardiya is one of the high parasite indices districts, and Banke
district is adjacent to Bardiya).
A review of the malaria situation in Nepal can be found at the WHO
Southeast Regional Office (SEARO) website
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section21/Section340.htm>.
Increased mortality is generally seen when there is increased
incidence of _Plasmodium falciparum_ cases or when there is increased
drug resistance. According to the SEARO information, _Plasmodium
vivax_ has been the predominant organism, with _Plasmodium
falciparum_ indices at 10 to 13. In the above newswire, it appears as
though there is a significant proportion of cases in which the
organism identified was _Plasmodium falciparum_. That, combined with
the scarcity of health services in the area most likely led to the
high absolute numbers of deaths seen (the newswire states there were
32 deaths with 521 laboratory confirmed cases of _P. falciparum_,
representing a case fatality rate of 6.1 percent).
As this district was not one of the districts identified as having a
high index of _P. falciparum_, one suspects that now that this event
has occurred, it will be targeted for more intensive malaria control
activities. (For those who are interested in reading the planned
strategies for malaria control activities in the region, see
<http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section21/Section335.htm> for
more detailed information). - Mod.MPP]
