Northern Province Spends R4,5 M On Foot And Mouth Disease
Bushbuckridge, South Africa, Northern Province has spent R4,5 million
trying to curb foot and mouth disease (FMD) which broke out in the
Bushbuckridge area in February.
The disease struck the deep rural Mhala and Mapulaneng areas, but
because most of the cattle owners are not commercial farmers, the
government agreed not to destroy the animals. Spokesman for the
provincial department of agriculture Thembi Makhubela, said the
animals were instead placed in quarantine. Roadblocks are manned by
soldiers 24 hours a day to ensure infected meat is not taken out of
the quarantined areas.
All cattle are being vaccinated and, so far 46 000 of 80 000 cattle
have been vaccinated, said Makhubela.

has
affected them or what they are vaccinating with. However, their
election
to use the meat and to not do wide spread slaughter is interesting. -

Fifty tonnes of beef affected by the foot & mouth disease (FMD) has
been brought into Ukraine. The beef was dug out of from a burial place
in a European country where animals affected by foot & mouth disease
(FMD) and hydrophobia [rabies] were buried.
The contaminated meat was destined to be sold in Kiev and Kharkiv
markets. The cargo was escorted by people armed with Kalashnikov
submachine guns. Despite bans on meat imports, 2 lorries [trucks] with
beef crossed the border without any problem. At the customs, the cargo
owners produced documents allegedly issued by a standardization center
in Kharkiv and were allowed to pass. However,
their plans were foiled when an elite unit of the Security Service,
called Alfa, conducted a special operation to check all goods imported
into Ukraine. They found out that the documents had never been issued
in Kharkiv and the cargo had not been checked by the veterinary
control. As of this writing, Ukrainian authorities have been unable to
determine who owns the cargo."

eat, because post-mortem acidification kills the virus. It is the
bone that is infectious -- to other livestock. - Mod.JW]
