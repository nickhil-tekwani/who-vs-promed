The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 5 Sep 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 3069, of which 2958 are confirmed and 111 are probable. In total, there have been 2057 deaths (1946 in confirmed and 111 in probable cases) and 918 people have recovered. [See updated numbers in Dashboard above]
- 415 suspected cases under investigation;
- 2 new probable cases in North Kivu: including 1 in Butembo and 1 in Biena;
- 13 new confirmed cases, including: 10 in North Kivu -- 4 in Kalunguta, 2 in Beni, 2 in Kayna, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Katwa; 3 in Ituri -- 2 in Mandima and 1 in Mambasa;
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths -- 1 in Kalunguta, 1 in Katwa [North Kivu]; 1 ETC [Ebola treatment centres] in Mabalako [North Kivu].
- 4 new recoveries released from North Kivu ETCs, including 3 Beni and 1 in Butembo.
- no health workers are among the newly confirmed cases. The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 156 (5% of all confirmed/probable cases), including 41 deaths.

Description of probable cases
-----------------------------
- The case of Butembo is a girl, 2 weeks old infant, who died on 20 Mar 2019 at the "Tout est Grace" CH [Hospital Center] in the Vuvatsi Area (Vuthawa/Matembe) in Butembo, North Kivu. She was a contact of her mother's, not followed for refusal and not vaccinated, who was confirmed as an EVD case on 14 Mar 2019 and who died on 15 Mar 2019 at the ETC. This child was hospitalized at CH "Tout est Gr√¢ce" on 19 Mar 2019 following the onset of fever, but without success. The alert was launched the same day by Community Relays (ReCo). There is reluctance for dignified and secure burial (EDS). 25 contacts, including 16 family members, 3 hospital workers, and 6 others were listed around this case.
- The case of Biena is a 22-year-old woman, unvaccinated, who died on 16 Dec 2018 at the home of a traditional healer, who was followed on an outpatient basis, but without success since 9 Dec 2019. This is an unlisted contact of her mother's, confirmed Ebola case on 24 Nov 2018. The 22-year-old woman, accompanied by her older brother, had traveled by motorbike on 10 Dec to Biena. She remained in Biena until 15 Dec 2019 and her condition worsened with haemorrhagic signs. The alert was launched by the Vuvo IT, while the body was already buried before the arrival of the investigation team and EDS. 10 contacts, all members of his family, were listed around this case.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 213 814 people have been vaccinated;
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring at entry points
--------------------------
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature measurement) at the sanitary control points, until 4 Sep 2019, is 91 667 203;
- To date, a total of 98 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[UN OCHA, ReliefWeb, abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/who-and-partners-help-government-boost-health-facility-defences

WHO and partners to help the Government boost health facility defences against Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To strengthen health practitioners' proficiency in preventing the spread of Ebola virus disease in health facilities, the Commission for Prevention and Biosecurity of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) launched on [5 Sep 2019] a guideline and training package on infection prevention and control that targets at least 3000 nurses, doctors and other health care workers.

During the current Ebola outbreak, working in or transiting through health facilities present a high risk of exposure to the virus. With the ongoing heightened attention to equipping health facilities with Ebola-specific response units, the Government of the DRC is intent on covering all potential weak points by training staff on infection prevention, using standard guidelines recently revised by a team of technical specialists from the Health Ministry, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations Children's Fund and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

As of [25 Aug 2019], nearly 18% of the total cases registered were hospital-acquired infections. At least 155 health care workers have been infected with the Ebola virus disease since the beginning of this 10th outbreak.

WHO is supporting the Commission for Prevention and Biosecurity in boosting infection prevention and hygiene training.

"I salute the progress being made in saving lives from Ebola virus disease," said WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, "But the situation remains critical, and a number of challenges remain. As part of our commitment to strengthening the health system of the DRC, we want to ensure that health facilities are not contributing to the spread of infectious diseases and this includes Ebola."

With funding from the United States Agency for International Development, the UK Department for International Development and the World Bank, the training package provides a standardized approach to practices and procedures for health facilities and integrates measures related to water management, sanitation and hygiene, which are essential for preventing the spread of infectious disease.

The guidelines and training package will be rolled out over the next 3 months, beginning in Goma and targeting health care workers and other actors involved in primary response. This will enforce the universal application of infection prevention and control standards throughout the health care chain.

The revised guidelines will not only improve the infection prevention and control measures for Ebola but also serve as a broader health systems strengthening tool for preventing the spread of other infectious diseases within health facilities.

The training course and application of the prescribed standards will be monitored over the coming year in order to evaluate their effectiveness and possible impact on health facility-acquired Ebola virus disease.

[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The intensity of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission in the North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri provinces remains substantial, with 57 new cases reported since the last EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo Disease Outbreak News Update on [29 Aug 2019]. While hotspots such as Beni Health Zone show signs of easing, new hotspots are emerging elsewhere. During the past 21 days, from 14 Aug 2019 through 4 Sep 2019, a total of 186 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (17%, n=31), Kalunguta (15%, n=28) [North Kivu], Mandima (13%, n=24), and Mambasa (12%, n=22) [Ituri]. Given the limited access and insecurity in the emerging clusters within Kalunguta, Mandima, and Mambasa health zones, the response activities have been somewhat hindered.

Likewise, sustained local transmission in Mutwanga and Kayna health zones [North Kivu], on the shores of Lake Edward and Ugandan border, pose added risks of regional spread. This risk was highlighted last week [week of 26 Aug 2019] by the confirmation of a case on 29 Aug 2019 in a young child who was exposed and developed symptoms in Mutwanga Health Zone before she was identified at the Mpondwe-Kasindi border point of entry (PoE) when travelling with her mother to seek medical care. The child was immediately transported to an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC) in Bwera, Uganda, where she was provided with care but unfortunately died shortly after arrival. While a limited number of potential contacts are currently under surveillance, there have not been any further cases confirmed in Uganda to date.

As of 4 Sep 2019, a total of 3054 EVD cases were reported, including 2945 confirmed and 109 probable cases, of which 2052 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%) [see updated numbers above]. Cases have been reported from 29 health zones since the beginning of this outbreak, of which 17 health zones reported new cases in the last 21 days (Table 1, Figure 2). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 58% (1772) were female, 28% (865) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (156) were health workers.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/drc-srp4-9august2019.pdf], the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July-December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 6 Sep 2019, USD 45.3 million have been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Current available funds will close the financing gap up until the end of September 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019, and WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding.

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Ebola cases rise by 13, with spread in insecure and border areas
----------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola transmission in the affected Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) region is still substantial, with new hot spots emerging in areas with limited access and security problems, posing more challenges for response teams, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [6 Sep 2019] in its weekly snapshot of the outbreak.

Meanwhile, the country reported 13 new infections today, boosting the overall outbreak total to 3069 cases.

Signs of easing in Beni, clusters emerging elsewhere
----------------------------------------------------
Overall, the DRC's outbreak still faces several challenges, including continued insecurity, unrest, pockets of community resistance, and funding shortfalls, the WHO said. It added that it expects more transmission chains in affected areas owing to a host of factors, including a high proportion of community deaths, a relatively low proportion of cases involving known contacts, delays in detection, nosocomial exposure, and problems accessing some communities.

Double-digit increase in cases
------------------------------
Today [6 Sep 2019] the WHO's online dashboard showed 13 new confirmed Ebola cases in the DRC, as well as the addition of 2 more probable cases, boosting the overall total to 3069 cases. Investigations are still under way into 405 suspected Ebola cases [see updated numbers above].

Also, 2 more people died from their infections, putting the outbreak's overall fatality count at 2052.

The DRC's multisector Ebola response committee (CMRE) posted a few more details today [6 Sep 2019] on the 5 cases reported yesterday, once each in Butembo, Kalunguta, Mutwanga, Mambasa, and Mandima. And of 2 deaths reported yesterday, one occurred in a community setting, which increases the risk of virus transmission.

[3] Response
- Fri 6 Sep 2019. Stretched health systems
[The Telegraph, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/fighting-ebola-ending-tb-stretched-health-systems-need-new-partners/
[Byline: Peter Sands and Achim Steiner]

The people of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are painfully familiar with the way disease, poverty, and conflict combine to cause misery and death. The Ebola outbreak authorities are struggling to control is a powerful illustration of this fact.

Efforts to stem Ebola, which has already claimed more than 2000 lives over the past year, are being hampered by security problems and attacks on health workers.

The response is being further hindered by the profound weaknesses of a health system already overstretched by diseases like malaria, which killed nearly 50 000 people across DRC last year [2018] alone, as well as a severe measles epidemic.

This interaction of deadly pathogens, insecurity, and extreme poverty is by no means unique to this latest Ebola outbreak. We have seen time and again that diseases thrive in conflict and chaos.

Diseases are fuelled by poverty, as people with little to live on often lack proper nutrition, sanitation and access to even the most basic health services, making them much more likely to catch infections and much more likely to die if they do so.

The interaction works both ways. Disease often makes social instability and poverty much worse. The fear and rumours that accompany infectious disease outbreaks can foster distrust and spark social disorder. Communities afflicted by heavy disease burdens find it extremely difficult to escape poverty: sick children don't go to school; sick adults can't work.

The future of disease prevention -- and global health security -- depends on our ability to improve health for the most vulnerable populations, including those living in war zones or fleeing fighting. This is especially challenging given that the number of people fleeing war and persecution exceeded 70 million worldwide last year, a record high.

The experience of the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which work together in some of the world's most challenging operating environments, has shown that fighting diseases in such environments requires sustained efforts and strong partnerships.

Such cooperation draws upon the expertise of a wide range of actors including governments, civil society, the WHO, other parts of the United Nations System as well as bilateral development agencies.

We learned many lessons from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014. One is how quickly weak health systems can be overwhelmed. Another is the vital importance of community engagement. A 3rd is the importance of shoring up defences to other diseases when something like Ebola strikes.

During the 2014 outbreak, there were at least many deaths from malaria as there were from Ebola itself. Prevention programmes were disrupted and those falling sick from malaria were too scared to seek treatment.

Perhaps the most fundamental lesson is that the best protection from infectious disease outbreaks is a resilient health system.

Without the ability to rely on key capacities -- such as health workers, a functioning supply chain, diagnostic labs and a disease surveillance system -- an infectious disease outbreak is hard to prevent, difficult to detect and extremely challenging to control.

Without established arrangements for community engagement, it is much more difficult to sustain the trust that is so vital to any emergency health response.

Moreover, the most effective way to build and sustain such capabilities and infrastructure is to invest in fighting the diseases that are already killing vulnerable people.

Oicha IDPs [internally displaced persons] at risk of Ebola contamination

In Oicha, the capital of Beni, several hundred people displaced by the insecurity created by armed groups are exposed to the Ebola epidemic. These IDPs share classrooms with students.

One of the main settlements that host these IDPs is the Mwangaza Primary and Secondary School that Koma Ebola visited. Arriving in this makeshift camp, we immediately see critical hygiene conditions. Hand washing kits hardly exist. However, the Ebola virus disease that has been raging in the province for more than a year is not ignored despite the difficult living conditions. It worries these displaced people.

"We wash our hands with soap or ashes after big needs. We want to return to our respective environments, our children suffer here"; said a displaced person encountered on the site.

"In the fight against Ebola, we try to maintain our latrines, but we do not have appropriate materials. We need support in that direction. (...). We use the same basins to wash the latrines, wash our clothes and wash our bodies, it is serious one is exposed to diseases," says another displaced person.

Mwangaza School has not been occupied by IDPs for several years. During the school year, as it has been since Monday, students and displaced persons alternate. In the morning, the displaced people take their belongings out to leave the classrooms free for the students. And in the evening, they go back there.

For the head of this school, protection kits against Ebola are crucial to saving lives. Kambale Musiene Janvier. "These IDPs do not take care of sanitation to protect children (...). We have a deficiency if we can equip kits like washbasins, gloves and beaks, he wished.

It must be said, these displaced have been forced to live miserably for over 5 years now. They are waiting for the pacification of the Beni area to recover their natural environment and take care of their fields, source of their income. But in the meantime, they face a 2nd enemy, the Ebola virus disease.

The United States, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing more than USD 21 million in additional humanitarian assistance to help end the ongoing outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This brings total USAID funding for the Ebola response efforts to nearly USD158 million since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2018, including for regional preparedness activities in neighboring countries.

With this funding, the United States is working with partners to provide life-saving assistance, including measures to prevent and control infections in health facilities, enhanced disease surveillance, training for health care workers, communities, promotion of safe and dignified burials, and food to support people and efforts to engage communities affected by Ebola.

The United States is also supporting regional preparedness efforts in the Republic of Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda. The funding announced today [4 Sep 2019] is in addition to contributions from other US Government Departments and Agencies and the US private sector.

- Fri 6 Sep 2019. mAb114
[Cision PR Newswire, abridged, edited]
https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ridgeback-biotherapeutics-lp-announces-receipt-of-breakthrough-therapy-designation-from-fda-for-mab114-300913398.html

Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP, a closely held biotechnology company, today announced that the Food and Drug Administration has recently granted mAb114, an experimental treatment for Ebola, Breakthrough Therapy designation.

Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. The criteria for Breakthrough Therapy designation require preliminary clinical evidence that demonstrates the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. Breakthrough Therapy designation was based on interim data from the Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM [together save lives]) study.

"The FDA's decision to grant mAb114 Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of Ebola reflects a recognition of the promising efficacy and safety data that has been collected to date for this investigational drug. We plan to work closely with the FDA as we continue to advance our development program for mAb114. The substantial survival improvement seen with mAb114 in the PALM trial catalyzed this important regulatory milestone. We are grateful to our PALM partners for all of their help in advancing treatments for Ebola patients and our ultimate gratitude goes to the study's participants and their families. Their trust and support will change the course of this disease," said Wendy Holman, CEO of Ridgeback Biotherapeutics.

About Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM):
-----------------------------------
The PALM study is co-sponsored and funded by the INRB (Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the US National Institutes of Health and carried out by an international research consortium coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Ebola treatment centers in the PALM trial have been overseen by staff from the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB); the DRC Ministry of Health; and 3 medical humanitarian organizations: the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), the International Medical Corps (IMC), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

About mAb114:
mAb114 is a monoclonal antibody -- a protein that binds to a single target on a pathogen -- isolated from a human survivor of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, a city in the DRC. Nancy Sullivan, PhD, chief of the Biodefense Research Section in NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC), and her team, in collaboration with researchers from the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) in the DRC and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.'s subsidiary Humabs BioMed, both based in Bellinzona, Switzerland, discovered that the survivor retained antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection. They isolated the antibodies and tested the most favorable ones in the laboratory and non-human primate studies, and selected mAb114 as the most promising. Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of INRB and one of the scientists involved in the original detection of the Ebola virus in 1976, played a key role in discovering mAb114.

New treatments for Ebola virus disease

Editorials
Effective in early disease but more research is needed for late disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The expanding epidemic of Ebola virus disease in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has entered its 2nd year despite courageous efforts by Congolese and international colleagues.[1] By the end of August [2019], 3000 cases and 2000 deaths had been reported.[2] Although the 1st Ebola outbreaks were recognised in DRC and Sudan in 1976, there has never been an effective treatment.

A breakthrough was announced in August 2019.[3] A randomised controlled trial was stopped early after a strict statistical criterion for decreased mortality was met by one of the monoclonal antibody treatments being tested (REGN-EB3).[4] This benefit was especially strong in patients with early stage disease. A second monoclonal antibody (mAb114) appeared nearly as effective as REGN-EB3.

The new treatments are given as single dose intravenous infusions, and both are being made available to all patients in the DRC.[4] They have been given orphan drug status by the US Food and Drug Administration and should receive prompt review for licensing. The other 2 treatments in the 4-arm trial, ZMapp (the control) and remdesivir (the only non-antibody agent) were stopped.[3] Optimised care, including intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte abnormalities, was provided to all participants and will continue.

Early diagnosis
---------------
To maximise delivery of these new antibody treatments, community engagement and trust must be enhanced. Success will be measured by an increase in earlier diagnosis of Ebola virus disease and a decrease in death rates. Now that early diagnosis can be linked to virus specific therapy, action is needed to improve availability of rapid diagnostic tests, particularly at point of care in the community.[5] Ebola virus disease can be misdiagnosed as malaria and other common diseases, leading some adults and children to seek help from traditional healers. Once they are aware of the benefit of these new treatments, traditional healers, who are trusted by their communities, can help persuade patients to be tested earlier for Ebola, which will also reduce the risk of spreading the infection to other patients. A fall in the number of deaths from Ebola virus disease among people who have never sought diagnosis or care at an Ebola treatment unit will be another marker of improved community engagement and trust around these new treatments.

Preliminary trial findings for each of the four investigational products were released at an international press conference on [12 Aug 2019] and reported widely, including in The BMJ.[4,6] Overall mortality among the 499 participants analysed was 49% for those who received ZMapp, 53% for remdesivir, 34% for mAb114, and 29% for REGN-EB3.

Patients were also analysed according to whether they had early (41% of patients) or late (59%) stage disease. This stratification was based not on the number of days of illness but on viral load in the blood [4] estimated by PCR.[7] Preliminary death rates among the 41% of patients with early disease were ZMapp (control) 24%, remdesivir 33%, mAb114 11%, and REGN-EB3 6%.

Although death rates for late disease were not reported, they are likely to be substantially higher than those for early disease. Extrapolation from available data on overall mortality and early disease mortality suggests that both REGN-EB3 and mAb114 are less beneficial for patients with late disease than early disease. No doubt these important analyses will be available in the full trial report, which is expected later this year [2019]

Reaching the brain
------------------
Ebola virus can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause severe neurological disease,[8,9,10,11,12] but the new monoclonal antibodies cannot. Further trials are urgently needed and should include evaluations of treatments combining one or more monoclonal antibodies with an agent that can target Ebola in the brain. Remdesivir is one candidate, although data for this agent remains limited. A nurse who was repatriated to the UK from west Africa had a relapse of Ebola that presented as meningoencephalitis nine months after an apparently full recovery from the initial infection. She recovered for a 2nd time after treatment with remdesivir and corticosteroids.[10] Remdesivir seemed to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier in one study of non-human primates,[13] but the relevance to humans remains unknown. The researchers detected remdesivir in the brain, eyes, and testes of the primates, all sites thought to be reservoirs of Ebola virus in humans.[13]

Ideally, a future randomised trial would have 5 arms: a control group treated with REGN-EB3 alone and 4 arms comparing REGN-EB3 plus mAb114, REGN-EB3 plus remdesivir, mAb114 plus remdesivir, and REGN-EB3 plus mAb114 plus remdesivir. It will be important to identify the best combinations for early and later disease. Trials should also consider whether the new monoclonal antibody treatments help to clear reservoirs of virus that may give rise to late relapses.

This trial identifying the 1st effective treatments for early Ebola is a tribute to everyone involved. The high ethical and scientific standards for a randomised trial were met despite the challenging and dangerous conditions of this epidemic. The trial should serve as a precedent for future randomised trials for Ebola and the many other epidemic pathogens that still lack effective treatments.
