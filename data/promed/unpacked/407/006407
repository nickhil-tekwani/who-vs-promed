Ukraine: 12 More Hepatitis A Cases in Luhansk
-------------------------------------------------
The number of people admitted to hospital with hepatitis A in the city of
Luhansk in Ukraine has increased by 12. According to the Emergency
Situations Ministry (ESM) of Ukraine, 8 adults and 4 children were admitted
to hospital. At the present time 293 people are [receiving hospital]
treatment. The cause of the epidemic was consumption of "unclean" water due
to contamination of the water supply following rupture of a waste water pump.
