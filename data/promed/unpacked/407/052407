It appears that mumps is continuing to spread in chareidi yeshivas in
Eretz Yisrael [the Land of Israel], with signs of infection beginning
to appear in Chevron Yeshiva. YWN-Israel reported that the illness
has already infected many bochrim in Ohr Shmuel (Yerushalayim) and a
Bnei Brak yeshiva, in which 100 of 160 talmidim were diagnosed.

Cases of mumps have also been detected in Yeshiva Maynei Shel Torah.
In the case of the latter, as well as Yeshivas Chevron, roshei
yeshiva have informed talmidim that if they detect the earliest signs
of the illness, or suspect they may have it, they are to immediately
leave the beis medrash and seek medical attention and/or prophylactic
treatment.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The students at these educational institutions are presumed to be
males, teen-agers and young adults. The incidence of mumps among
students at these institutions seems extraordinarily high (100 out of
160 in one instance) and suggests that few have been vaccinated or
perhaps received only a single dose of vaccine. Further information
would be welcomed verifying the extent of this outbreak, the
relationship between these institutions, and the vaccination status
of the pupils.
