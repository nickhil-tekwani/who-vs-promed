The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD in the UK as of Mon 5 Nov 2012 remains 176. No definite/probable patients remain alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead) remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, despite an unexpected increase in 2011. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and none so far in 2012.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2012
---------------------------------------------------
During 2012 so far [as of 5 Nov 2012], there have been 96 referrals, 60 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 8 cases of genetic CJD [cases of familial CJD and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease are now included in this single category], 3 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and no cases of vCJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2987 referrals, 1363 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 148 cases of genetic (familial + GSS), and 71 cases of iatrogenic CJD.

[Ref: Diack AB, Ritchie D, Bishop M, et al: Constant transmission properties of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 5 countries. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012 Oct; 18(10): 1574-9. doi: 10.3201/eid1810.120792]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has been reported in 12 countries. We hypothesized that a common strain of agent is responsible for all vCJD cases, regardless of geographic origin. To test this hypothesis, we inoculated strain-typing panels of wild-type mice with brain material from human vCJD case-patients from France, the Netherlands, Italy, and the United States. Mice were assessed for clinical disease, neuropathologic changes, and glycoform profile; results were compared with those for 2 reference vCJD cases from the United Kingdom. Transmission to mice occurred from each sample tested, and data were similar between non-UK and UK cases, with the exception of the ranking of mean clinical incubation times of mouse lines. These findings support the hypothesis that a single strain of infectious agent is responsible for all vCJD infections. However, differences in incubation times require further subpassage in mice to establish any true differences in strain properties between cases."

Background
----------
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is an acquired transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, that results in a fatal neurodegenerative condition in humans. vCJD was first reported in the United Kingdom in 1996 (1) and was most likely caused by dietary exposure to contaminated products from cattle that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The similarity between BSE and vCJD was shown by experimental transmission of the 2 diseases into standard panels of inbred wild-type mouse lines (RIII, C57BL, and VM [1,2]) and into FVB mice (3).

The strain properties of vCJD and BSE have been extensively characterized in these sets of mice by using a combination of the order in which each strain of mouse dies of disease (incubation period rankings), distribution of brain vacuolation at the terminal stage of disease (lesion profiles), distribution pattern of abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain, and glycosylation pattern of PrPSc as assessed by Western blot analysis. BSE and vCJD produce highly reproducible and similar incubation period rankings and neuropathology, which indicates that they are the same strain in the RIII, C57BL, and VM mice, whereas in the FVB mice, both diseases exhibit the same pattern of PrPSc deposition (3-5).

During 1996-2011, a total of 176 cases of definite or probable vCJD were reported in the United Kingdom; the number of deaths peaked at 28 in 2000. Since 2006, deaths from vCJD have leveled off to 2-5 per year (6). Although vCJD was originally restricted to the United Kingdom, 49 cases have been reported in 11 other countries, including some outside Europe, bringing the worldwide total number of cases to 225. Most cases outside the United Kingdom have occurred in France, which is believed to be related to the large volume of beef imports; approximately 60 percent of UK beef exports to Europe were destined for France (7). This possible relationship is borne out by a peak in vCJD cases in France 5 years after a similar peak in cases in the United Kingdom, which fits in well with the timing of an increase in beef imports from the United Kingdom during 1985-1995 (7).

More recently, comparative studies of vCJD cases from France and the United Kingdom have shown evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, pathologic, and biochemical analyses that a common strain of agent may be responsible for vCJD infection in both countries (8). In Europe, active surveillance to monitor BSE cases was implemented in 2001 (6,9). Although it appears that exports of meat, cattle, or both from the United Kingdom may have played a major role in the incidence of vCJD cases in other countries (10), indigenous BSE from before 2001 or another unidentified source may have caused some vCJD infections.

To determine whether vCJD cases in different countries have been caused by the same infectious agent, samples from 4 vCJD case-patients from the Netherlands, Italy, France, and the United States were made available for strain typing analysis using a standard panel of wild-type mouse lines. Each sample was methionine homozygous at codon 129 of the prion gene (Table -- available at the source URL above). None of the patients had received blood or organ donations. 2 patients (from Italy and the United States) were treated with quinacrine. All case-patients showed classic clinical characteristics of vCJD; postmortem examination confirmed the diagnosis. We conducted transmission studies in mice using brain samples from these 4 vCJD case-patients and compared transmission characteristics of all 4 cases to those of 2 historical cases of vCJD in the United Kingdom.

Extracts from the authors' Discussion:

We used transmission studies with wild-type mice to define the strain characteristics of geographically distinct cases of vCJD to establish whether a common strain of agent is responsible for vCJD cases from 5 different countries. Transmission properties such as TSE-associated vacuolation, PrPSc deposition, glycosylation profile, and mobility of PrP all show strong similarities between vCJD cases from the Netherlands, Italy, France, and the United States and with reference cases from the United Kingdom.

The infectivity titer of the inoculum may have played a role in alteration of the incubation periods. However, Ritchie et al. (14) suggested that changes in titer would affect all mouse strains and would not result in a change in the ranking of the mouse strains. Experimental transmission of vCJD from the case from the United States, in which lower volumes were inoculated, shows the same temporal pattern as the cases from the Netherlands and Italy.

Variability in incubation time is often associated with the primary transmission of a TSE agent between species but often stabilizes on subsequent mouse-to-mouse passage, while variability within groups decreases. Therefore, variations observed in this study do not necessarily point to strain variation between the cases of vCJD. However, to rule out this possibility, further transmission studies will be conducted. Moreover, passage of cases of vCJD occurring during the past 15 years will be undertaken in a comparative study to establish whether genetic drift in mouse lines or strain variation in vCJD underlies the differences observed in this study. 2 of the brain isolates inoculated (from Italy and the United States) were from patients who had been treated with quinacrine. However, this treatment appears to have had no effect on incubation periods, vacuolation profiles, PrPSc deposition patterns, or the glycosylation and mobility of PrP.

The similarities in lesion profiles, biochemistry, and immunohistochemistry between this series of vCJD transmission studies support the hypothesis that a single strain of infectious agent is responsible for all vCJD cases, regardless of geographic origin, which would suggest that current diagnostic criteria for vCJD are sufficient to detect cases in all countries at this time. Still to be determined is whether the differences in incubation period rankings in some cases represent changes in strain phenotype over time, which could affect future diagnosis.

These findings are reassuring in that they are consistent with the interpretation that all diagnosed human cases of vCJD have been caused by the same agent responsible for the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the UK beginning in 1996, and that the agents responsible for all known cases of the disease did not originate as independent events. - Mod.CP]

[3] sCJD: differential diagnosis

[Ref: Paterson RW, Torres-Chae CC, Kuo AL, et al: Differential Diagnosis of Jakob-Creutzfeldt Disease. Arch Neurol. 2012 Sep 24:1-5. doi: 10.1001/archneurol.2013.79. [Epub ahead of print]
-------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objectives: To identify the misdiagnoses of patients with sporadic Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease (sCJD) during the course of their disease and determine which medical specialties saw patients with sCJD prior to the correct diagnosis being made and at what point in the disease course a correct diagnosis was made.

Participants: 163 serial patients over a 5.5-year period who ultimately had pathologically proven sCJD. The study used the subset of 97 patients for whom we had adequate medical records.

Main outcome measures: Other diagnoses considered in the differential diagnosis and types of medical specialties assessing patients with sCJD.

Results: 97 subjects' records were used in the final analysis. The most common disease categories of misdiagnosis were neurodegenerative, autoimmune/paraneoplastic, infectious, and toxic/metabolic disorders. The most common individual misdiagnoses were viral encephalitis, paraneoplastic disorder, depression, vertigo, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, unspecified dementia, central nervous system vasculitis, peripheral neuropathy, and Hashimoto encephalopathy. The physicians who most commonly made these misdiagnoses were primary care physicians and neurologists; in the 18 percent of patients who were diagnosed correctly at their 1st assessment, the diagnosis was almost always by a neurologist. The mean time from onset to diagnosis was 7.9 months, an average of two-thirds of the way through their disease course.

Conclusions: Diagnosis of sCJD is quite delayed. When evaluating patients with rapidly progressive dementia with suspected neurodegenerative, autoimmune, infectious, or toxic/metabolic etiology, sCJD should also be included in the differential diagnosis, and appropriate diagnostic tests, such as diffusion brain magnetic resonance imaging, should be considered. Primary care physicians and neurologists need improved training in sCJD diagnosis.

[4] Prions, zinc uptake, and disease

Mad cow protein linked to memory
--------------------------------
A brain protein named as the chief suspect responsible for mad cow disease [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] provides a vital function linked to learning and memory, research has shown. Prion protein regulates zinc levels in the brain by assisting its absorption by cells, a study has found. The mineral is thought to play an important role in nerve signalling. But too much zinc build-up between cells has been associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Scientists have long wondered what the purpose of prion molecules is. All that was clearly known about them was their apparent terrifying ability to transmit "spongiform" brain diseases in both animals and humans. In the cow disease BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and its human form, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), misshapen rogue prions leave the brain riddled with holes, as in a sponge. They also seem to transmit disease by causing other prions they encounter to become misshapen, in a chain reaction. Disease-causing prions can cling to surgical instruments, or contaminate blood and tissue. Those responsible for vCJD are believed to have spread from cattle to humans through the consumption of infected meat.

Scientists writing in the journal Nature Communications said prion protein helped neurons take up zinc through channels in the cell surface. Professor Nigel Hooper, from the University of Leeds, said: "With ageing, the level of prion protein in our brains falls and less zinc is absorbed by brain cells, which could explain why our memory and learning capabilities change as we get older."

The conclusion that the loss of PrPC-mediated zinc uptake may in part contribute to the pathogenesis of prion disorders and other neurodegenerative diseases may create a market for design of zinc delivery drugs. - Mod.CP]

Abstract
--------
Avian scavengers, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_), have potential to translocate infectious agents (prions) of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases including chronic wasting disease, scrapie, and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. We inoculated mice with fecal extracts obtained from 20 American crows that were force-fed material infected with RML-strain scrapie prions. These mice all evinced severe neurological dysfunction 196-231 days postinoculation (mean = 198; 95 percent CI: 210-216) and tested positive for prion disease. Our results suggest a large proportion of crows that consume prion-positive tissue are capable of passing infectious prions in their feces (proportion = 1.0; 95 percent CI: 0.8-1.0). Therefore, this common, migratory North American scavenger could play a role in the geographic spread of TSE diseases.

[In their introduction the authors set their work in context as follows:

"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are most likely caused by pathogenic isoforms (PrPRes) of prion proteins that naturally occur across many classes of animals, including mammals and birds]. A number of livestock and wildlife species in North America are susceptible to TSE diseases. Mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_), white-tailed deer (_O. virginianus_), elk (_Cervus elaphus_), and moose (_Alces alces_) are susceptible to chronic wasting disease (CWD); domestic sheep and goats are susceptible to scrapie; and domestic cattle are susceptible to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (although this disease is rare in North America). These TSE diseases are always fatal to infected animals, and upon death, carcasses allowed to remain in the environment can be scavenged by an array of avian and mammalian scavengers.

Mechanisms for the spread of TSE in wild and domestic ungulates are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that avian scavengers have potential to translocate PrPRes in their feces. American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) are significant avian scavengers of deer carcasses, they are migratory, and their overall range includes most areas where TSE diseases occur in North America. Crows forage in groups, traveling up to 80 km/d from communal roosts. Thus, crows have opportunity to encounter PrPRes-infected carcasses, consume infected tissue, and move long distances before depositing feces. Once in the soil, PrPRes may persist longer than 2 years, [8], potentially enabling increased site contamination over time. For example, residual contamination of soil with PrPRes caused recurrence of CWD in confined mule deer in Colorado and lateral transmission via environmental contamination is likely an important route of infection.

Insects, poultry, and scavengers, including crows, have been suggested as passive carriers or dispersers of infectious prions. We found no studies that evaluated passage of PrPRes through avian digestive systems, though several studies have evaluated resistance of PrPRes to mammalian digestive fluids. Ruminant digestive fluids used during in-vitro trials have shown substantial to no reduction in Western blot signal after incubation periods of approximately 13-24 h. Shorter incubation times (15-210 min) resulted in intermediate levels of Western blot signal loss. Studies that investigated effects on PrPRes from full passage through rodent digestive systems found scrapie and BSE PrPRes present in mouse feces and scrapie PrPRes in hamster feces (ca. 5 percent of original dose excreted 24 h postinoculation). Thus, it appears that mammalian digestive fluids and processes can reduce PrPRes concentration but are unlikely to eliminate it.

Proteolysis occurs in the avian digestive system due to the presence of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and the proteolytic enzymes pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and various peptidases. Although experimentally induced hypoacidity was associated with reduced scrapie infection rates in mice, it is unlikely that gastric HCl would fully degrade PrPRes in the crow digestive system given extreme temperature and concentration required and mild conditions present in the avian gut. Although early investigations suggested that trypsin reduced scrapie titer under certain circumstances, subsequent studies found pepsin and trypsin were not effective for reducing infectivity of scrapie and BSE PrPRes [25] or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease PrPRes. Thus, there is little evidence to suggest that the crow digestive system would eliminate PrPRes infectivity prior to excretion of feces. Similar arguments can be made for non-ruminant mammals because of similarities in endogenous enzymes in vertebrate digestive systems, yet PrPRes was substantially reduced by passage through hamster digestive systems.

Little is known about effects of avian digestive systems on infectivity of PrPRes. As a 1st step in understanding the potential role of avian scavengers in TSE transmission, we tested the hypothesis that readily available mouse-adapted scrapie PrPRes can remain infectious after passage through the digestive tract of crows. Results of our study support this hypothesis."

Merritt Clifton also forwarded the following additional comment. "John Maday in 'Drovers CattleNetwork' of 19 Oct 2012 (http://www.cattlenetwork.com/cattle-news/Could-carrion-birds-help-spread-prion-diseases-174842671.html, includes the observation that the phrase -- a murder of crows -- (the collective term referring to a flock of these birds), could have a quite literal meaning. - Mod.CP]
