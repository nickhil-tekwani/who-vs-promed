Over the past few weeks, all kiwi orchards [in Italy] have experienced a return of bacteriosis, caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (PSA). This caught both producers and technicians by surprise, especially as there had been no prolonged rainy periods.

This phenomenon is probably due to the cold temperatures in winter [2016/17]. A study actually showed how PSA is favoured by cold. It is mainly an endophytic bacterium that cannot be easily reached by common plant protection products. Frost favours its multiplication and protecting the orchards when plants are not undergoing physiological activity is not easy.

[Bacterial canker of kiwifruit (_Actinidia_ species and hybrids) caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _actinidiae_ (Psa) was originally described in Japan in 1989, but its area of origin is uncertain. Symptoms include discolouration of buds and vascular tissues, leaf spots, wilting, stem and twig cankers with characteristic red exudate, fruit collapse, and eventually death of the plant. The disease is favoured by cool temperatures and high humidity, thus symptoms are usually seen in spring and autumn. Psa has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Data on Psa epidemiology are still lacking, but infection is thought to occur via natural leaf openings and wounds. The pathogen is suspected to be spread by heavy rain, strong winds, mechanical means (including animal and human activities) and infected plant material. Spread with pollen is strongly suspected. Spread with infected fruit cannot be excluded until conclusive data become available. Alternative hosts have also been reported (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160225.4050698), and these species can be expected to serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management of Psa (and other bacterial diseases) may include cultural practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation (including both crop and weed plants) to prevent spread, use of clean planting and propagating material (including pollen) and resistant crop varieties. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) is used to control Psa, but resistant pathogen strains have emerged. For example, a new streptomycin resistant strain is emerging in New Zealand (ProMED-mail post 20150430.3332617).

An outbreak of Psa in central Italy in 2010 on yellow fleshed ('gold') kiwi varieties (ProMED-mail post 20100414.1207) was found to be due to the emergence of a new, very virulent strain, Psa-V. In New Zealand, 2 separate pathogen strains have been identified including the virulent Psa-V. Strains from China and New Zealand appear to be more similar to each other than to strains from Italy. A less aggressive strain of Psa has been reported from Australia (ProMED-mail post 20110722.2206).
