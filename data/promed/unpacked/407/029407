Japanese encephalitis (JEV) has been found for the 1st time in feral pigs in far north Queensland. The discovery of the mosquitoborne disease follows an outbreak across 4 states that is linked to the deaths of 5 people so far this year [2022].

Biosecurity Queensland said a small number of feral pigs in the Skardon River area in western Cape York Peninsula had tested positive for the disease following routine testing.

The Indigenous community of Mapoon is the closest population base to Skardon River. Health authorities said the risk of transmission to humans was very low.

The virus is transmitted to people and animals -- primarily pigs, horses and migratory birds -- through mosquito bites. It cannot be transmitted directly from human to human nor from animal to human.

Tropical Public Health Unit director Richard Gair said JEV had not been detected in any people in the area. "It is an isolated area and the mosquito numbers are very low," Dr Gair said. "It is only quite rarely that humans will get the disease, and if they do get it, they aren't infectious. Most human infections of JEV cause no symptoms or mild symptoms such as headache or fever. A person with severe disease may present with inflammation of the brain, characterised by sudden onset of vomiting, high fever and chills, severe headache, sensitivity to light, neck stiffness and nausea and vomiting."

Five people, including one in Queensland, are reported to have died of the disease this year [2022] with more than 40 human cases detected across the country. Dr Gair said that, while there was a vaccine available for the disease, the best defence was to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, through applying insect repellent and wearing loose clothing to cover up.

The disease is endemic in southern areas of Asia, as well as India and is detected seasonally in China.

Dr Gair said it could not be transmitted by eating pork or pig products. In a statement, Biosecurity Queensland said landholders in the area had been contacted by the department about the positive samples detected in feral pigs.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) positive feral pigs were found in the Northern Territory earlier this year (2022). The JE positive pigs in the above report are in Queensland state. It is not clear if the small number (numbers not given) of pigs in Queensland were found positive by antibody test, PCR identification of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) RNA sequences, or virus isolation. If they were IgM positive, that would indicate recent infection as would paired acute-convalescent samples, although paired samples from individual wild pigs are unlikely. Single positive IgG samples would indicate infection sometime in the past, assuming that there were no cross-reactions with other flaviviruses. If prospective studies indicate new JEV infections in wild pigs, that would raise the question about the long-term maintenance of JE virus in the Northern Territory and northern Queensland. Should that be the case, there is the possibility of the virus moving southward in the future into the 4 states (Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria) where it has been circulating currently in times of vector abundance.

The open question now is if JEV will become established in any or all of the 4 affected states irrespective of what is going on in the Northern Territory. Ongoing surveillance of piggeries and mosquitoes should provide evidence of the continuing presence of the virus in the 4 states. Providing adequate surveillance over the very large geographic 4-state area of the outbreak will be a challenge for surveillance efforts. One hopes that the virus will disappear in the affected area and transmission will cease permanently. We shall see. - Mod.TY
