The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) has confirmed a single case of measles in an unvaccinated teenager from the Kenai Peninsula who recently traveled out of state to Arizona via Seattle, Washington. This makes Alaska the 29th state to have a confirmed case of measles in 2019. The DHSS Public Health Laboratory in Fairbanks confirmed the diagnosis today [17 Jul 2019].

Some people may have been exposed to measles through this confirmed case. A list of possible exposure locations, including dates and times, is posted on the DHSS measles webpage and will be updated regularly as more information becomes available. Known exposure locations during the infectious period when measles can spread to other people [are listed at the source URL above]. The patient has been isolated at home since then and is recovering.

DHSS epidemiologists and Kenai Public Health Center nurses have informed restaurant management and healthcare professionals at those facilities [visited by] the confirmed measles case so those who may have been exposed and are not already protected can take the necessary preventative measures.

Epidemiologists have also been in contact with health officials in Arizona and Washington. It's not yet known specifically where the exposure occurred.

The last confirmed case of measles in an Alaskan patient was diagnosed in 2015 in Fairbanks. That was after almost 15 years with no measles cases. In August 2018, a measles case was confirmed in an out-of-state cruise ship passenger that was bound for Alaska. Fortunately, that case did not lead to any additional cases of measles in Alaska.

The Los Angeles (LA) County Department of Public Health is investigating 2 additional confirmed measles cases in county residents. These cases are linked to 2 cases reported earlier this month [July 2019], which together account for a 4-case outbreak involving a close social group. Public Health has not identified any public exposure locations associated with these cases at this time.

With ongoing measles outbreaks in the USA and internationally, there is an increased risk when traveling to these locations at this time. Public Health urges residents, especially those who have not been fully protected against measles and those who travel internationally, to get measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization to protect themselves and prevent the spread of measles.

Currently, there have been 14 measles cases among LA County residents in 2019, in addition to 8 non-resident measles cases that traveled through the county. The majority of cases to date were unvaccinated.

This outbreak is not connected to the outbreak that occurred in April [2019].

A 3rd toddler has been diagnosed with measles, marking El Paso's 4th confirmed case of the virus. The City of El Paso Department of Public Health confirmed a toddler boy had tested positive for measles in a news release on Wed [17 Jul 2019]. This is the 4th case in 2 weeks after 25 years without one case in El Paso.

"We need our community to focus on making sure that they are up-to-date with their measles or MMR vaccine," said Robert Resendes, public health director in a release. "When we vaccinate ourselves and our children we are not only protecting ourselves and our family, but also reducing the chances of the disease spreading to others in our community."

According to the release, the virus is "very contagious" and 90% of people not vaccinated will be infected if they are exposed to someone with measles.

"The announcement [of the 3rd case] comes just days after a woman and another toddler also tested positive for the virus -- the city's first 2 cases in more than 25 years.

"'Because El Paso's immunization rates are so high, we don't expect to see a huge number of cases emerge,' public health director Robert Resendes said. 'We know that the effectiveness of the vaccine, especially after the recommended 2 doses, is about 97%.'

"Health officials say the 2nd toddler is not believed to have exposed the public to the measles, but anyone experiencing said ailments is encouraged to visit a doctor." - Mod.LK

[4] Germany: mandatory vaccination
Date: Wed 17 Jul 2019

Parents in Germany who fail to vaccinate their children could face hefty fines after the German government backed a bill requiring all children to receive a measles jab before entering school or kindergarten. If the German parliament approves the bill, parents will be required to provide evidence that their child has been vaccinated before they are enrolled, and will face fines of up to EUR 2500 (USD 2800) if they fail to do so.

"Whether in kindergarten, at the childminder or at school -- we want to protect all children against measles infection," health minister Jens Spahn said in a statement. The move comes as Germany reported one of the highest numbers of measles cases in Europe between March 2018 and February this year [2019], at 651, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. In 2019, 429 cases were registered in Germany by mid-June, the Health Ministry said, suggesting the problem is escalating.

Measles has seen a wider resurgence around the world -- in high-income countries in the Americas and Europe and lower-income nations in Asia and Africa -- fueled in part by fear of and lack of access to vaccines, and complacency. And while numerous studies have debunked claims that measles vaccinations cause autism, widespread fear persists.

Under the policy, parents would have to present a certificate proving their child has received both vaccinations. Unvaccinated children will be excluded from kindergartens, the ministry said. WHO has deemed vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- a top 10 threat to global health in 2019.

Among high-income countries, the USA topped the list of children not vaccinated with the 1st dose, according to WHO. There have been 1123 [cases] there as of Fri [12 Jul 2019], according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the greatest number reported in the USA since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000, meaning it was no longer continuously transmitted in the country.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1814921/Davao/Local-News/DOH-records-1069-measles-cases-in-Davao-region


The Department of Health (DOH)-Davao recorded 1069 measles cases in the region, wherein 65% have no history of vaccination. DOH National Immunization Program officer Janis Olavides yesterday [17 Jul 2019] said the number is not significant to declare a measles outbreak because it has, in fact, reduced to 13% from last year [2018].

Meanwhile, the current data show Davao City has [had] 444 confirmed cases. The 2019 data also show reduction of death cases of 14, from last year's [2018] 33 from the same period.

Olavides said among the measles hotspots in the city are areas of Talomo Central, Talomo North, Buhangin and Agdao districts. "There is no reason to declare a measles outbreak because it wasn't able to surpass last year's [2018] figure wherein the city declared a measles outbreak," she said during the iSpeak media forum at the City Hall of Davao. She said DOH, together with the City Health Office (CHO), is intensifying its vaccination campaign, wherein they are now tapping all public schools. She, however, said there is no trend in the cases of measles. "For as long as there is intensified vaccination, then we will be able to end the transmission of the virus," Olavides said. Although, she said, they also target to include adult[s] in their vaccination program.

Meanwhile, CHO national immunization program coordinator Eldy Sombilon said they are targeting to immunize all 250 217 students from kindergarten to grade 7 in the city before the year [2019] ends. Sombilon said the Dengvaxia scare had no longer hindered the parents to have their children vaccinated. But he said the office will continuously intensify their campaign to totally eradicate the virus.

As the world anxiously monitors the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), health officials note that a measles outbreak declared last month [June 2019] in the country has killed more people -- mostly children -- and faster.

Since January 2019, officials have recorded over 100 000 measles cases in the DRC, mostly in children, and nearly 2000 have died. The figures surpass those of the latest Ebola outbreak in the country, which has tallied not quite 2500 cases and 1665 deaths since August 2018. The totals were noted by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a speech today, [15 Jul 2019], at the United Nations Office in Geneva, Switzerland.

"Frankly, I am embarrassed to talk only about Ebola," Dr Tedros said. He gave the speech in response to 2 new developments in the Ebola outbreak. That is that 2 Ebola responders were murdered in their home in the DRC city of Beni and that officials on Sun [14 Jul 2019] had identified the 1st case of Ebola in Goma, a DRC city of over one million [people] at the border with Rwanda.

"Both of these events encapsulate the challenges we continue to face on a daily basis in DRC," he said. Tedros was referring to the scattering of disease -- including Ebola and measles -- as violence hampers outbreak responses and access to medical care. Since January [2019], officials have counted 198 attacks on health responders, which left 7 dead and 58 healthcare workers and patients injured.

[The global measles situation is very discouraging, particularly in the DRC. It is the children who are most affected by this disease, as well as Ebola. It may be a long time before the children in the DRC are able to live normal lives without the weight of civil unrest, measles, and Ebola on their shoulders. - Mod.LK

[8] Israel: vaccination
Date: Mon 15 Jul 2019
From: Dr Eliana M Aaron [edited]


An Israeli expert panel sub-committee recommended vaccinating children with MMR at age 1 and age 2 years to provide an additional booster to this vulnerable age-group. Children ages 1 to 4 years remain the most affected by the measles epidemic.

Routine vaccinations of 6 year olds will continue in school-based clinics. This is in light of an ongoing epidemic in Israel affecting primarily ultra-orthodox Jewish populations and sporadic communities of anti-vaxxers. This epidemic has spread to other ultra-orthodox communities internationally.

The problem with the recommendation is that the Ministry of Health has no budget or staff to implement any additional vaccination programs, and the current public health vaccine clinics are working at maximum capacity. It is estimated that more than 2 million Israelis are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated. The current epidemic has infected 4292 people between 2018 and 11 Jul 2019.

The ultra-orthodox education system is not a public school system, and outsiders, such as government-contracted vaccine clinic nurses, are not admitted. Also, the high number of children per family, lack of easily accessible clinics or mobile vaccine clinics, logistical problems traveling to well-child vaccine clinics (that is, getting on a public bus with 4 or more small children) are all contributing factors towards the low vaccination rates in this population.

Several years ago during a passive polio scare, the community rabbinical leaders were able to encourage over one million ultra-orthodox people to get polio boosters. This leaves us hope that further cooperation and education efforts among community leaders can lead to successful vaccine campaigns.

[9] Israel: vaccination schedule

The Committee of Experts on Infectious Diseases recommends that the Ministry of Health advance the 2nd dose of measles vaccine from age 6 years to age 2 years, as a step to fight the disease and prevent the next outbreak.

The experts decided to leave the 1st dose of the vaccine at the age of one year, and not to advance it to the age of 9 months. However, implementation of the recommendation will take several years due to "logistic challenges", as noted by the experts. This means that without the addition of nurse standards and additional budget for vaccinations and the strengthening of the milk drops, the recommendation will not be implemented. Implementation of the recommendation requires the approval of the management of the Ministry of Health.

https://kafponline.org/cdc-and-who-publish-genetic-characterization-of-measles-and-rubella-viruses-detected-through-global-measles-and-rubella-elimination-surveillance/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published an article called "Genetic characterization of measles and rubella viruses detected through global measles and rubella elimination surveillance, 2016-2018" in the [5 Jul 2019] issue of MMWR (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/pdfs/mm6826a3-H.pdf). On the same day [5 Jul 2019], WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record published a similar article entitled "Genetic characterization of measles and rubella viruses detected through global measles and rubella elimination surveillance, 2016-2018". The Summary box content from the MMWR article is reprinted below.

- What is already known about this topic?
Monitoring progress toward measles and rubella elimination requires high-quality case-based surveillance, including genetic characterization of measles viruses and rubella viruses.

- What is added by this report?
During 2016-2018, the number of reported measles virus genotypes declined from 6 to 4; 2 (B3 and D8) accounted for 95% of reported sequences. Of 13 rubella virus genotypes, reported genotypes declined from 5 to 2.

- What are the implications for public health practice?
Diversity of measles and rubella viruses has decreased globally, consistent with progress toward elimination. Continued collection of specimens from all confirmed cases for genotyping and submission of wild-type virus sequences to global databases will strengthen case-based surveillance.
