Khmer Rouge chemical warfare linked to deaths
---------------------------------------------
The legacy of chemical warfare waged by Khmer Rouge's former military
commander Ta Mok is being blamed for the poison deaths of 9 people and the
sickening of 79 others in Cambodia's northern Siem Reap province.
"We've been told that Ta Mok and his men sprayed chemicals that they
obtained in Thailand in the ponds and lakes in the affected area in
1991-1992 as a battle strategy to kill advancing government soldiers," Ou
Eim, Chief of Siem Reap's Provincial Penal Department told Reuters on
Saturday.
Seven people have died and the number of those sickened has increased from
74 to 79 since 24 Jun 2000 after eating fish caught in the Strung Sreng
River, approximately 25 miles down street from Anlong Veng, the former
Khmer Rouge stronghold and home to Pol Pot until his death in 1998.
Victims are reported to have consumed the normally non-toxic tetradontus
fish and died within minutes after experiencing sudden paralysis and
vomiting.
Anlong Veng was the target of annual dry season offensives by Cambodian
military forces until the area's Khmer Rouge defected to the government in
late 1998.
Eim blamed the delayed action of the poison on recent severe flooding in
the affected area.
"It's happened this year because the ponds and lakes that were sprayed have
overflowed and spilled into the river where the fish live," Eim told
Reuters. "We are 100% sure that those people have died from eating that
kind of fish because yesterday we roasted some of the fish and gave it
chickens and they died within 30 minutes."
Director of the Siem Reap Provincial Health Department Dr. Dy Bun Chhem
expressed doubt about Eim's allegations that the poisoning was connected to
chemical warfare.
"I'm skeptical about that," Chhem told Reuters on Saturday regarding Eim's
allegations. "Villagers in the affected area have told my medical team that
the poisoning could be the result of fish eating a kind of poisonous fruit
which falls on the water."
Chhem told Reuters that he was hoping for a definitive conclusion regarding
the source of the poisoning after he takes a sample of fish flesh to the
Ministry of Health for analysis on Monday.
Local authorities in the stricken area say the need for medical assistance
for the victims is urgent.
"We are calling on international humanitarian assistance for the victims so
far no one help them," said Eim.
The much-feared Ta Mok was arrested by Cambodian military forces near the
Thai border on 6 Mar 1999 and is expected to be tried for genocide pending
final agreement between the UN and the Cambodian government regarding the
composition of a Khmer Rouge tribunal.
