A Correction
------------
The New York Times Online report of Sun 15 Jul 2001 [see West Nile virus,
crows - USA (Florida) (02) 20010715.1369 saying that West Nile virus has
been found in South Carolina is incorrect.
I am not aware of any human, equine, or avian cases in South Carolina, nor
have there been any West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools.

As a comment to [yesterday's ProMED-mail posting, West Nile virus has not
been isolated in South Carolina to date, either in 2001 or in previous
years, despite the operation of intensive human, avian, mosquito, and
equine surveillance programs to monitor for its appearance.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Drs. Wozniak and McNeill for making this
correction. There
have been no reports of positive test results from South Carolina since the
first appearance of West Nile virus in North America, apart from the case
of a 71-year old man from South Carolina, who died on Staten Island on 19
Jul 2000; his was for a brief period a suspected case of West Nile virus
infection. The error in the New York Times article is curious because the
statement is attributed to Dr Ostroff (CDC) and South Carolina is
identified as one of the 12 states reporting West Nile virus-positive
results. - Mod.CP
