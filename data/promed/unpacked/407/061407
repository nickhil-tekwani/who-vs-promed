The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), working with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has found poliovirus in sewage samples collected from the London Beckton Sewage Treatment Works.

As part of routine surveillance, it is normal for 1 to 3 'vaccine-like' polioviruses to be detected each year in UK sewage samples but these have always been one-off findings that were not detected again. These previous detections occurred when an individual vaccinated overseas with the live oral polio vaccine (OPV) returned or travelled to the UK and briefly 'shed' traces of the vaccine-like poliovirus in their faeces.

Investigations are underway after several closely-related viruses were found in sewage samples taken between February [2022] and May [2022]. The virus has continued to evolve and is now classified as a 'vaccine-derived' poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2), which on rare occasions can cause serious illness, such as paralysis, in people who are not fully vaccinated.

The detection of a VDPV2 suggests it is likely there has been some spread between closely-linked individuals in North and East London and that they are now shedding the type 2 poliovirus strain in their faeces. The virus has only been detected in sewage samples and no associated cases of paralysis have been reported -- but investigations will aim to establish if any community transmission is occurring.

The last case of wild polio contracted in the UK was confirmed in 1984. The UK was declared polio-free in 2003.

Dr Vanessa Saliba, Consultant Epidemiologist at UKHSA said, "Vaccine-derived poliovirus is rare and the risk to the public overall is extremely low. Vaccine-derived poliovirus has the potential to spread, particularly in communities where vaccine uptake is lower. On rare occasions it can cause paralysis in people who are not fully vaccinated so if you or your child are not up to date with your polio vaccinations it's important you contact your GP to catch up or if unsure check your Red Book. Most of the UK population will be protected from vaccination in childhood, but in some communities with low vaccine coverage, individuals may remain at risk. We are urgently investigating to better understand the extent of this transmission and the NHS has been asked to swiftly report any suspected cases to the UKHSA, though no cases have been reported or confirmed so far."

Jane Clegg, Chief nurse for the NHS in London said, "The majority of Londoners are fully protected against Polio and won't need to take any further action, but the NHS will begin reaching out to parents of children aged under 5 in London who are not up to date with their Polio vaccinations to invite them to get protected. Meanwhile, parents can also check their child's vaccination status in their Red Book and people should contact their GP surgery to book a vaccination, should they or their child not be fully up to date."

The UK is considered by the World Health Organization to be polio-free, with low risk for polio transmission due to the high level of vaccine coverage across the population. However, vaccine coverage for childhood vaccines has decreased nationally and especially in parts of London over the past few years, so UKHSA is urging people to check they are up to date with their vaccines.

Wastewater surveillance is being expanded to assess the extent of transmission and identify local areas for targeted action. Healthcare professionals have been alerted to these findings so they can promptly investigate and report anyone presenting with symptoms that could be polio, such as paralysis.

[ProMED would like to thank Alasdair Wanklyn for submitting the 1st alert from the official press release on this finding as well as Ryan McGinnis and Claire Smales for submitting similar reports.

Reading between the lines, I suspect the concerns are that this VDPV2 may well be a cVDPV2 [circulating VDPV], originally imported by someone vaccinated with the live attenuated vaccine (OPV - oral poliovirus vaccine) containing the type 2 virus and then had local transmission in parts of London with pockets of sub-optimal vaccination coverages. The type 2 OPV vaccine has been used in areas with identified outbreaks of cVDPV2. The UK uses the IPV - inactivated poliovirus vaccine, hence the probable importation. The press release suggests coverages have dropped in some areas creating pockets of susceptibles through which a VDPV could circulate. Reasons for lowered coverages weren't specified but based on other countries' experiences vaccinations decreased in response to the pandemic, plus the vaccine-hesitant population has been increasing.

Noteworthy is that to date, no cases of acute flaccid paralysis associated with infection with this virus have been detected.

We await further information as it becomes available.

According to Wikipedia, the "Beckton Sewage Treatment Works is a sewage treatment plant in Beckton is in the London Borough of Newham, East London. It was formerly known as Barking Sewage Works. It was built from 1864 and, now operated by Thames Water, it is the largest sewage treatment works in Europe. It treats the waste water from the Northern Outfall Sewer serving North, East and central London. The plant has been extended and upgraded several times, most recently in 2011-13, and now covers over 100 hectares (250 acres)." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckton_Sewage_Treatment_Works.
