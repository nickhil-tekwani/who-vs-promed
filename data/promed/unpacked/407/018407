A one-year-old girl from west Jakarta has died of avian influenza, a senior
health official said on Saturday [25 Mar 2006], citing the results of local
tests. If confirmed by a UN-recognised laboratory, the child would be the
country's 23rd death [and 30th case - Mod.CP] from the H5N1 virus, which is
now endemic in poultry in the world's 4th most populous nation.
"I just got information that a local test of a one-year-old girl showed
positive (for H5N1)," Hariadi Wibisono, Director general of Control of
Animal-borne Diseases at the national health ministry, told Reuters. The
girl died on Thursday [24 Mar 2006], shortly after coming into a Jakarta
hospital emergency room, he said. A sample of the girl's blood has been
sent to a laboratory in Hong Kong recognised by the World Health
Organisation for confirmation, Wibisono added.
It was not immediately clear whether the girl had been in contact with
fowl. Contact with infected birds is the most common means of transmission
of the H5N1 virus to humans. Avian influenza has killed at least 105 people
globally [106 if this case is confirmed - Mod.CP] since it re-emerged in
Asia in late 2003, according to WHO. The bird toll consists of some 200
million birds which have died from the disease or been culled.
Of Indonesia's internationally confirmed fatalities from the H5N1 virus, 11
have occurred in 2006, making it the country with the most bird flu deaths
so far this year. Most of the cases in humans have been in or around
Jakarta. But the virus has been detected among poultry in about 2/3 of the
country's 33 provinces.
Stamping out the virus is a huge, if not impossible, task in Indonesia, a
sprawling archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The
government has resisted the mass culling of fowl seen in some other
nations, citing the expense and the impracticality in a country where the
keeping of a few chickens or ducks in backyards of homes is common in
cities and on farms. Agencies have concentrated instead on selective
culling, and on public education and hygiene measures aimed at prevention,
but officials say problems with lack of transport, inadequate public
services and poor infrastructure have hindered the effectiveness of the
programmes. A sweeping door-to-door campaign to try to control the disease
in the capital Jakarta, the country's biggest city which along with its
suburbs has about 12 million people, only got underway at the end of
February. Agriculture officials estimate Jakarta alone has some 500 000 fowl.

[Jakarta, the capital city of the Republic of Indonesia, is located on the
island of Java in the centre of the archipelago of Indonesian islands. A
map and a comprehensive account of the current political and economic
status of the country are available at
<http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/id.html>. Jakarta is a
special territory enjoying the status of a province, consisting of Greater
Jakarta, covering an area of 637.44 square km. Located on the northern
coast of West Java, it is the center of government, commerce and industry
and as such has an extensive communications network with the rest of the
country and the outside world. Jakarta is Indonesia's main gateway. Jakarta
is a city of contrasts; the traditional and the modern, the rich and the
poor, the sacred and the worldly, often stand side by side in this bustling
metropolis. Even its population, gathered from all those diverse ethnic and
cultural groups which compose Indonesia, are constantly juxtaposed as an
ever-present reminder of the national motto; Unity in Diversity. - Mod.CP]
