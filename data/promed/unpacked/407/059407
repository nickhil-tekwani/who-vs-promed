Suspected Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever patient dies
-------------------------------------------------------
The 27-year-old patient, who was taken to Benazir Bhutto Hospital
(BBH) with severe bleeding disorder Saturday night [15 Nov 2008] and
was suspected of being infected with Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever
(CCHF) virus, died Sunday midnight [16 Nov 2008] at Pakistan
Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad. Sunday evening
senior doctors at the BBH suspected the patient, a native of Hazro,
Attock [district], a case of deadly CCHF due to uncontrolled bleeding
disorder. The patient was brought to the BBH from his native town
after being suspected, as a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever. "After
bleeding disorder became intense, the patient was taken to Shifa
International Hospital Sunday night but the hospital refused to admit
him," said a relative of the patient. He said that later the patient
was taken to PIMS where he was admitted but he could not survive due
to his poor condition.

"During the whole time that he spent at the BBH, his bleeding could
not be stopped, convincing doctors and surgeons to suspect him a CCHF
patient," said head of medical unit at the BBH professor Dr Shoaib
Shafi while talking to 'The News' Monday [17 Nov 2008] adding he had
informed National Institute of Health, Islamabad on the patient's
status through proper channel, however, his blood sample could not be
taken by the NIH officials for Congo serology.

According to sources, the patient died Sunday night [16 Nov 2008] at
around 1:00 a.m. and his dead body was handed over to his family
after taking precautionary measures to save his family from exposure
to CCHF virus if that was in his body. "The deceased patient was
buried in his native town, Hazro, Monday morning [17 Nov 2008] and
the World Health Organisation's guidelines were strictly followed
during his burial," said district health officer Attock Dr Sultan
Mehmood Khan while talking to 'The News'.

He added that the patient's dead body was wrapped up in plastic
sheets as per the WHO guidelines and his family was also provided
masks, gloves, and lime that they needed at the time of his burial.
"We also made family members of the deceased understand that what
preventive measures they would have to take at the time of burial,"
he responded to a query adding that all the apparent signs were
hinting strongly that the patient was infected with CCHF virus.

The patient was a resident of Mohalla Muslim Gunj in Hazro city.
"Residual spraying has already been done in and around his house and
we have established a medical camp in the area for surveillance,"
claimed Dr Sultan adding staff of his office has also started
educating residents of the area on the subject. He added that the
main reason behind suspecting tat the patient had contracted CCHF was
his severe bleeding disorder and his involvement in extensive cattle handling.

"We have incinerated the patient's clothes and other belongings, as a
precautionary measure," said Dr Sultan adding the NIH should perform
CCHF serology on the patient's blood sample after taking it from the
BBH. "Another main reason for taking matter more seriously is that we
had witnessed a confirmed case of CCHF in the village of Mararia
adjacent to Hazro city in 2004," said Dr Sultan.

To a query, he said he had notified in written to secretary health,
Punjab, DG Health Punjab and concerned officials at the NIH of the
patient's death and its apparent reason, as CCHF is a notifiable
disease. He said that his office also informed district officer,
Livestock Attock of the incident and asked him to take necessary
precautionary measures including spraying for elimination of ticks in
cattle farms.
