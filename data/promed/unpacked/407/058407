Cali is one of the cities most affected by dengue. The latest reports
by the Secretariat of Health indicate that in the course of the year
[2010], there have now been 218 cases of classical dengue registered,
a number 4 times higher than the same period in 2009, when only 54
cases were registered.

But most worrying is that in the 1st 24 days of 2010, in the
University del Valle Hospital (UVH), 4 dengue deaths have been
registered. The UVH infectious disease physician, Yolanda Caicedo,
explained that these deaths relate to patients who arrive at the
hospital in very serious condition because they have not received
adequate attention in other [health] centers. Because of this, the
recommendation for physicians is that when they see patients in bad
[condition], it is better to immediately hospitalize them and not
confuse dengue with a simple viral infection.

This year [2010], there are 22 DHF cases in the Valle capital which
relate to patients with hemorrhage and being in serious condition.

The Secretary of Health, Alejandro Varela, stated that Cali, together
with Palmira [near Cali] and Baranquilla [on the Caribbean coast],
have been the cities most affected by dengue outbreaks, since they
have tropical climates and are near rivers [dengue mosquitoes do not
breed in rivers. - Mod.JW]. [He] reminded us at the time that they are
aware of the risk that the city faces, and for that reason are
increasing control [measures], mainly [focusing] on breeding sites of
the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ that causes dengue [transmits dengue
viruses]. Homes must avoid stored water, where the mosquitoes are
[breeding], and be alert for symptoms such as fever, body ache,
vomiting, loss of appetite, among others.

Up to now, Commune 17 in Cali (south) is the [area] most affected by
this disease; this year [2010], there are 25 cases.

Meanwhile, in Palmira there is a considerable threat, since there is
now a death registered from [dengue]. On 5 Jan [2010], a girl of 4
years died of DHF.

[The total numbers of classical dengue cases through 27 January in
this report, 218, are less than those reported through 21 January, 282
(see ProMED archive no. 20100125.0277). This discrepancy may be due to
inclusion of DHF cases in the previous week's total or to inclusion of
cases from a larger geographic area. In any case, with 22 cases of DHF
& 4 deaths already -- an extraordinarily high rate (10 per cent) --
Cali is going through a serious dengue outbreak currently. During
2009, through epidemiological week 46, Colombia reported to PAHO a DHF
rate of 14 per cent, double that of any other country in the Americas
except Suriname, but did not identify what the epidemic strain was.

Belo Horizonte now has 208 confirmed dengue cases just since the
beginning of this year [2010]. The situation is considered serious and
led the health authorities to reinforce prevention measures. The
measures are being adopted because the numbers of cases of dengue
fever will tend to greatly increase from now on. Officials said the
infestation by the mosquito that transmits dengue [virus] in Belo
Horizonte has reached worrying rates. According to the Ministry of
Health, _Aedes aegypti_ larvae should be found, at most, in one
percent of the residences. In the capital, the average is 4.2 percent.
The [_Aedes aegypti_] infestations also are of concern to
municipalities in the metropolitan region.

In Igarape, the [household infestation] index reached 4.3 percent. In
addition to house inspections, the city is applying insecticide and
collecting blood samples from the population to investigate the type
of dengue virus that is circulating at the beginning of year [2010].
[To date], 9 cases were confirmed in the city.

Confirmed dengue cases in Ribeirao Preto reached 506 in the 1st 29
days of the year [2010]. The city also has 858 suspected [dengue
cases] that await [laboratory] tests; only 73 have been discounted [as
negative] up to now.

The city is on the path to an epidemic because it needs to have 300
[dengue] cases per 100 000 inhabitants [to be classified as in
epidemic status], according to the state Secretariat of Health.
According to IBGE [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica;
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics], the city has 563 000
inhabitants. Taking these data into consideration, the municipality
needs to register 1689 dengue cases to have a confirmed epidemic. If
all the cases awaiting results are positive, Ribeirao now is close to
this number, as it would have 1364 cases in just this month of January
2010.

Sao Paulo [city] neighborhoods neighboring Taboao da Serra are in a
state of alert due to dengue. Campo Limpo, Butanta and Morumbi are
among the risk areas where hundreds of [dengue] cases have now been
recorded this year [2010]. According to the Zoonoses Coordinator in
our city, Clovis Jose de Sa, help by everyone is needed to avoid an
outbreak that could be a problem in Taboao.

Taboao da Serra is considered to have been infested [by _Aedes
aegypti_?] since 2002, and we have transmission sporadically in the
months of January - May annually, due to the arrival of imported cases
from other municipalities and states in the holiday months. In order
to identify the localities having the greatest risk of an outbreak of
this disease, the state government uses an indicator called the
Breteau index when it is above one; this is to say mosquito larvae
were found in more than one house for each 100 houses inspected [the
areas are at risk].

Dengue in Sao Paulo state has field work centralized though
coordination by SUCEN, Superintendencia de Controle de Endemias
[Superintendency for Endemic Control]; in accordance with a regular
survey of the level of infestation by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_,
the municipalities are classified into 4 groups: (1) with a dengue
epidemic; (2) infested [by _Ae. aegypti_] with dengue [virus]
transmission; (3) infested without transmission and; (4) not infested.

Dourados has now registered a dengue epidemic. The Epidemiological
Surveillance Nucleus of the municipal Secretariat of Health received,
as of yesterday [28 Jan 2010], notification of 379 dengue cases, which
represents an increase of 1805 percent in relation to last year
[2009]. The number of notified cases [over those] that are expected
for the period increased by 1263 percent, which characterizes the
municipal situation as an epidemic according to the statement by the
Nucleus. The incidence of the disease is 199.7 [dengue] cases per 100
000 inhabitants.

The majority of the cases are pending, awaiting the completion of
specific [laboratory] tests. Dengue virus serotype 2 was isolated,
which has circulated in the municipality since last year [2009].
According to the monitoring report, there is a growing predominance of
women among reported cases and concentration of those aged 20-49 years
(53 percent of the reported cases). The occurrence of cases in the age
group of children 14 years of age (44 cases, 12 percent of reports) is
showing a shift in age of occurrence of the disease.

Of the reported cases, about 40 percent were concentrated in 8
neighborhoods, but there have been reports of the disease in the
entire municipality, reinforcing the city's situation as epidemic. It
has been verified that the highest case indices have been displaced
from the Jardim Maracana region (1st half of 2009) to Grande Florida
(2nd half of 2009 and 1st half of 2010) and to Jardim Água Boa.

of dengue. - Mod.LJS]

[In December 2009 in Dourados, 118 cases were reported, of which 40
were confirmed, and 58 were awaiting results of laboratory tests (see
ProMED archive no. 20100111.0131). The above report indicates that
there were 379 cases so far this year (2010) as of 29 Jan 2010. So the
outbreak continues and intensifies.

At least 17 residents of Malang died of dengue fever in 2009,
according to a local health official here on Monday [25 Jan 2010].

A total of 1073 people had been infected with dengue fever during
2009, and 17 of them had died, Mursyidah of the Malang district health
service, said. "Most of the fatalities were children. We expect that
the peak season of dengue fever this year will be in February 2010.
Therefore, we urge the community to be on alert by practicing 3M,
which directs the public to drain tubs, close containers that can hold
water, and bury the things that can harbor mosquito larvae," she said.

Of the 33 sub districts in Malang District, 3 sub districts have been
given special attention, namely Turen, Pakist and Dau. "Residents in
those 3 sub districts must be serious in implementing 3M, because a
number of people have suffered from dengue fever in those 3 sub
districts, and some of them died of this disease," she said.

The Health Ministry has reported that in the current rainy season, the
dengue fever cases have increased in the provinces of Riau, Jakarta,
West Java, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, South Kalimantan, West
Sulawesi, and North Maluku. Dengue cases have also been reported in
Bangka Belitung, East Kalimantan, Gorontalo, and Palu.

Last year [2009], 7 residents of Bangka Belitung (Babel) died of
dengue fever. Fogging had been conducted in 20 houses to prevent the
further spread of the disease, Helmi Soefie, head of the Babel health
service's disease control section, said last December 2009.

In Bangkalan, East Java, the number of patients suffering from dengue
fever in the current rainy season at Syarifah Ambami Rato Ebu (RSA)
hospital was also on the rise, the hospital's director said last 11
Jan 2010.
