Murray Valley Encephalitis Virus Activity in Western New South Wales (NSW),
Australia: the NSW Arbovirus and Mosquito Surveillance Program
---------------------------------------------------
Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE) is a potentially serious infection caused
by a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. Only 1 in approximately 1000
persons infected will develop symptoms, which include headache, neck
stiffness, fever, tremor, weakness, confusion, fitting, and sometimes coma
and death. It occurs at low level endemicity in north-western Australia,
and is rare in New South Wales (NSW). The last occurrence in NSW was in
1974, as part of a nation-wide outbreak that led to 58 reported cases, 5 of
whom were infected in NSW. In total, 13 cases are reported to have died.
Following the 1974 outbreak, an early-warning system for detecting the
presence of flaviviruses was developed, using sentinel chickens placed at
various locations in inland NSW, and trapping for identification,
quantitation and virus isolation from mosquitoes. The chickens' blood
samples are tested weekly for antibodies to flaviviruses, including MVE
virus and Kunjin virus. Until last week, MVE virus had never been
identified in NSW chickens, or isolated from mosquitoes since the program
began 12 years ago, or from people with encephalitis since 1974.
On Thu 15 Feb 2001, testing (at the ICPMR, Westmead Hospital, and also at
the University of Western Australia) confirmed that MVE virus had been
detected in chicken flocks in remote western NSW: in 2 chickens from
Menindee, 2 from Macquarie Marshes and 1 from Wanaaring. Other chickens in
the affected flocks also seroconverted to Kunjin virus. On Wed 21 Feb 2001,
further chicken testing indicated ongoing flavivirus activity in the
Macquarie Marshes, and also detected activity at Bourke (also in western NSW).
In response, Public Health Units in affected areas provided advice to local
hospitals to report suspected human cases. No human clinical cases of MVE
or Kunjin virus infection have been identified to date. NSW Health provided
a media warning that MVE virus is likely to be present in NSW and that
people in those areas should take personal protection measures.
Surveillance continues.
