On 26 Mar 2015, a 12-year old boy died of furious rabies during treatment at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital [in Kathmandu, Nepal]. The patient was bitten by an unknown stray dog (puppy) in the tip of the index finger. The wound was unnoticeable and hence the boy did not inform his parents about the incident. Signs of furious rabies appeared 20 days after the bite. He died one day after his admission to this hospital. It was the 2nd fatal case of rabies in this hospital within a week. Rabies, a zoonotic disease, continues to remain the most neglected but major public health and economic burden in Nepal.

[Yet again we owe it to Dr Pun for his report of a 2nd rabies case in Kathmandu. He is a lesson to all of us. Thank you!

Until they can initiate an effective dog vaccination programme these case will continue. As I wrote before: "If the Nepal government could mount an effective canine rabies control programme it would have significant impact both on human risk and on village livestock. Canine rabies control -- and eradication -- is straightforward and uncomplicated, and has immediate significant social and community benefits. Preventing human rabies through control of domestic dog rabies is a realistic goal and is justified financially by the future savings of discontinuing post-exposure prophylaxis for people. The problem in Nepal is a consequence of inadequate provision of rabies vaccine for both pre and post human exposure vaccination, no doubt ultimately due to financial constraints. Vaccinating dogs is a lot easier and cheaper." And to be frank, canine rabies control is to veterinary public health what mastitis control is to livestock veterinary medicine. Straightforward and a mark of competence.
