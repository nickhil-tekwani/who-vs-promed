Regarding [the query about vectors of __Leishmania donovani_ in Nepal, I'll
quote the following summary:
"No systematic study in Phlebotominae sandfly fauna including the
incrimination of vector of leishmaniasis has been carried out in Nepal so
far. Only preliminary studies of seasonal distribution of Phlebotomine
sandflies were conducted in limited areas of Dhanusha and Morang districts
and eight species (three under Genus Phlebotomus and five under
Sergentomyia) were reported. During the training session of the staff of
Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, MoH, which was conducted in three
rural villages in the vicinity of Janakpur city (Dham), Dhanusha district,
approximately 5000 specimens of sandflies representing three species (_P.
argentipes_ 21%; _P. papatasi_-68%; and _S. babu babu_-11%) were collected
by several methods. Of the total, 2,250 female specimens (i.e. _P.
argentipes_-550 & _P. papatasi_-1700) were dissected and infections with
leishmania like flagellates of _L. donovani_ in two specimens of _P.
argentipes_ (0.4%) were confirmed by hybridization with whole
kinetoplast-DNA probes. This is the first time, the vector of visceral
Leishmaniasis
(Kala-Azar) was incriminated in Nepal."
This summary appears in the article "Phlebotominae sandflies of Nepal
(Diptera: Psychodidae) and notes on their biology and distribution" by
Shreedhar P. Pradhan, Medical entomologist, Local Consultant, EHP, Nepal.
The original study (Lawyer, PG; Pradhan, SP; Faidya, RG; Stiteler, JM,
Wirtz, RA & Parkins, PV), was presented in the Annual Meeting of the
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene by Senior author Dr.
Phillip G. Lawyer in 1993.
