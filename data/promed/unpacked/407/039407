Two North Carolina Quarter Horses were euthanized this month [July 2012] after contracting eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), a mosquito-borne disease that is largely preventable in equines by vaccination.

The unvaccinated horses -- a 2-year-old Robeson County mare and a 7-year-old stallion from Bladen County -- exhibited signs of generalized weakness, stumbling, depression, and inability to stand or eat. The Robeson County horse's condition deteriorated so quickly that she was euthanized within 24 hours of 1st exhibiting clinical signs. The Bladen County stallion displayed signs for several weeks before being euthanized earlier this month [July 2012]; testing at Rollins Laboratory in Raleigh confirmed EEE this week. They are the 1st reported cases of EEE in North Carolina horses this year [2012]. Last week, New Hanover County officials reported that EEE was found in a sentinel chicken flock.

"If your horses exhibit any signs of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately," said State Veterinarian David Marshall, DVM. "Several serious contagious diseases, such as equine herpesvirus and rabies, have similar signs and should be ruled out."

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Its fatality rate in horses is 75-95 percent. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurological problems.

Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

Marshall recommends that equine owners talk to their veterinarians about an effective vaccination protocol to protect horses from EEE and another mosquito-borne disease, West Nile virus (WNV). The EEE and WNV vaccinations initially require 2 doses for horses, mules, and donkeys that have no prior vaccination history.

Mosquitoes can breed in any puddle that lasts for more than 4 days, so removing any source of standing water can reduce the chance of exposing animals to WNV or EEE. Keeping horses in stalls at night, using insect screens and fans, and turning off lights after dusk can also help reduce exposure to mosquitoes. Insect repellents can be effective if used according to manufacturers' instructions.

People, horses, and birds can become infected from a bite by a mosquito carrying the diseases, but there is no evidence that horses can transmit the virus to other horses, birds or people through direct contact.

[It is important to note that horses cannot pass this virus to humans or other horses. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes.

Human can acquire the disease from mosquitoes and should take protective precautions, such as wearing long sleeves and using DEET-based repellants.

Vaccination is not available for people but is available for horses. Horses should have this vaccine about every 4-6 months. The vaccine protects against several viral diseases, such as EEE and WNV.
