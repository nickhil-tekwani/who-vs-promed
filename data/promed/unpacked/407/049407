A case of tuberculosis in cattle has been again reported in Allgeau [Southern Bavaria], in a farm in Oberstdorf, from which milk had been supplied to Vorarlberg [in neighbouring Austria].

All 17 animals will be slaughtered on Friday [23 Nov 2012] as ordered by the district administration in Oberallgaeu. There is no risk to consumers: the milk was delivered to a plant in Vorarlberg, which produces exclusively hard cheese; the tuberculosis bacteria are destroyed during this production process.

[The detection of the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in south Bavaria, Germany, described above, has been reported by a newspaper in the neighbouring Austrian province of Vorarlberg; an official confirmation from the German authorities is anticipated.

Sporadic cases of bTB have been reported during recent years also from cattle farms in the 2 Austrian provinces bordering Bavaria, Tyrol and Vorarlberg (details in ProMED-mail post 20121125.1423321). This may be indicative of the presence of a wildlife bTB reservoir which is common to both countries.

Germany, similarly to Austria, belongs to the countries that were recognised officially as bTB-free by the end of 2001.

Since 2005, Germany has reported a low number of bTB outbreaks, totalling 65: 2005 - 5, 2006 - 5, 2007 - 13, 2008 - 18, 2009 - 17, 2010 - 7, 2011 - 0. Such a low incidence allows Germany to maintain its official bTB-free status. - Mod.AS
