Hundreds of cows have come down with a paralyzing disease since early
August. Affected cows can not stand up because their hind limbs are
weakened. At the early stage of the disease, the affected cows limp, and
later, they can not stand up from sitting position. Then, they develop a
a fever, and die in a month.

As of 6 Sep 2000, the disease has been reported from 231 farming houses,
which are scattered in 5 Provinces (Kyongki, Kangwon, Choongbook,
Choongnam, and Chonbook Provinces). The total number of affected cows,
thus far is 477. However, the etiology is still unknown.

infection from the animals being down. If some one has some ideas or has
seen related cases, we would be interested. - Mod.TG]
