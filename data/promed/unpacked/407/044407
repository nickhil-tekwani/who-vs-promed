Abstract
Guinea worm (GW) disease, caused by _Dracunculus medinensis_, is an almost eradicated waterborne zoonotic disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) currently lists GW as endemic in only 5 African countries.

In July 2020, the Vietnamese public health surveillance system detected a hanging worm in a 23-year-old male patient, who did not report any travel to Africa or any country previously endemic for GW. The patient was hospitalized with symptoms of fatigue, anorexia, muscle aches, and abscesses, with worms hanging out of the skin in the lower limbs.

The worms were retrieved from the lesions and microscopically examined in Viet Nam, identifying structures compatible with _Dracunculus_ spp. and L1-type larvae. A section of this parasite was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, United States, for confirmatory diagnosis of GW.

The adult worm had cuticle structures compatible with _Dracunculus_ parasites, although the length of L1 larvae was about 339 micrometers [0.0133 in], substantially shorter than _D. medinensis_. DNA sequence analysis of the 18S small subunit rRNA gene confirmed that this parasite was not GW and determined that the sample belonged to a _Dracunculus_ sp. not previously reported in GenBank that clustered with the animal-infective _Dracunculus insignis_ and _Dracunculus lutrae_, located in a different clade than _D. medinensis_.

This study highlights the importance of effective public health surveillance systems and the collaborative work of local public health authorities from Viet Nam with the WHO and CDC in efforts to achieve the eradication of GW.
