The Egyptian health authorities have announced a new human case of bird flu
in a central Egyptian governorate, the official MENA news agency reported
on Wed 17 May 2006. Health Ministry spokesman Abdel-Rahman Shahin was
quoted as saying that a 75 year old woman from the governorate of Minya,
some 220 km south of Cairo, had contracted the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza virus due to direct contact with backyard poultry. The woman was
hospitalized on 11 May 2006 and has been treated with the anti-viral drug
Tamiflu (oseltamivir), said the spokesman.
It was the 14th human case since the [appearance] of the deadly disease in
Egypt in March 2006, he said. Out of the 13 cases reported before the new
case, 5 have died and the other 8 have recovered.
Egypt reported its 1st human bird flu case on 18 Mar 2006 after the country
[discovered] its 1st outbreak in poultry on 17 Feb 2006. The Egyptian
government has since taken tough measures to curb the spread of the fatal
disease, which has killed over 100 people worldwide since its [appearance]
in South East Asia in late 2003.
Most victims were infected after close contact with sick birds. The virus
currently can only jump from birds to humans, but scientists fear that it
could mutate into a form capable of passing easily among humans and thus
spark a global pandemic.

[The same report was forwarded to ProMED-mail by Nati Elkin. This case has
not yet been confirmed by an independent WHO-reference laboratory and
should be regarded as suspected until confirmation has been received. The
location of the Al Minya governorate can be found by accessing the map of
Egypt at <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>. It lies
some 250 km to the south of Cairo. Most of the previous confirmed human
cases in Egypt have been located in the Nile Delta region to the north of
Cairo. - Mod.CP]

Egypt: avian influenza situation - WHO update 8
-----------------------------------------------
As of Thu 18 May 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has confirmed the
country's 14th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
The case occurred in a 75 year old woman from the Al Minya governorate. She
developed symptoms on 11 May and died on 18 May 2006.
As with all other cases in Egypt, her infection has been linked to exposure
to diseased birds. Of the 14 cases in Egypt, 6 have been fatal.

Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 12
----------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 18 May 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an
additional 7 cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus,
6 of which have been fatal.
One fatal case, in a 38 year old woman, occurred in the city of Surabaya,
in East Java. She developed symptoms on 2 May, was hospitalized on 7 May,
and died on 12 May 2006. The case is the first reported from this area.
The remaining 6 cases are from the village of Kubu Sembelang in the Karo
district of North Sumatra. All 6 are members of an extended family, and all
but one lived in neighbouring houses. Associated with the Kubu Sembelang
outbreak is a 7th family member, a 37 year old woman. She developed
symptoms on 27 Apr and died of respiratory disease on 4 May. No specimens
were obtained before her burial, and the cause of her death cannot be
confirmed. She is, however, considered the initial case in this family cluster.
The 6 confirmed cases in Sumatra include the woman's 2 sons, aged 15 and 17
years, who died on 9 May and 12 May, respectively. The 28 year old sister
of the initial case died on 10 May. This sister had an 18 month old
daughter, who died on 14 May. The 5th confirmed case, who is still alive,
is the 25 year old brother of the initial case. The 6th confirmed case is
the 10 year old nephew of the initial case. He died on 13 May.
One additional family member, who had been hospitalized, has subsequently
been ruled out based on both negative laboratory results and the absence of
clinical symptoms compatible with H5N1 infection.
This is the largest cluster of cases, closely related in time and place,
reported to date in any country and is being carefully investigated by
Indonesia's Ministries of Health and Agriculture and by WHO
epidemiologists. The source of exposure for the initial case is still under
investigation, with exposure to infected poultry or an environment
contaminated by their faeces considered the most plausible source.
The likely source of infection for the additional cases has not yet been
determined. Multiple hypotheses are being investigated. Apart from living
in close proximity to each other, the cases in this cluster are known to
have participated in a family gathering around 29 Apr. The cases may have
acquired their infection from a shared environmental exposure yet to be
identified. The possibility of limited human-to-human transmission cannot
be ruled out at present.
Investigators at the outbreak site have found no evidence that infection
has spread beyond members of this single extended family. No influenza-like
illness has been identified in health care workers or other persons in
close contact with the patients. If human-to-human transmission has
occurred, it has not been either efficient or sustained.
The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Indonesia to 40. Of these
cases, 31 have been fatal.

[The investigation proceeds, but it is not yet clear whether this large
cluster of cases in a single extended family is a consequence of
person-to-person transmission of infection or infection from a common
source. It is also not clear why a 7th family member, a 37 year old woman
associated with the Kubu Sembelang outbreak who provided no diagnostic
specimens for confirmation of avian influenza virus infection, is
considered the initial case.
It should be noted that the cluster of 6 extended family members and the
7th undiagnosed family member reside in North Sumatra, whereas the 7th
diagnosed case resided in Surabaya (East Java) and is not part of the
cluster. - Mod.CP]
