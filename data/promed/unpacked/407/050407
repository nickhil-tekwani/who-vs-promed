Veterinarians in Russia's Far East have begun slaughtering cattle infected
with FMD -- see map at
<http://www.jebcoseis.com/images/fsu_russia_regions.jpg>.
The cattle with the Asia-1 strain of the disease are being given lethal
injections and will be buried in special burial grounds in strict accordance
with relevant sanitary requirements, the Maritime Territory administration
said.
The disease was first reported in the village of Krasny Kut on 26 Aug 2005,
and has since been contained [sic] in the neighboring Spassky, Pozharsky, and
Kirovsky districts.
In all, 211 animals have been infected.
The territory has received 300 000 vaccine doses and more than 70 000 cattle
have been vaccinated already. The vaccination campaign will continue until 3
Sep 2005.

[In the absence of an official update, the above information remains to be
verified. If accurate, it indicates a decision by the Russian authorities to
apply a "modified stamping out" policy. Stamping out means the immediate
destruction of all infected, suspected and contact animals, accompanied by
severe quarantine measures and followed by disinfection of the affected
premises. Usually, stamping out is applied without vaccination, but it is
possible to combine them ("stamping out with vaccination"). However, in the
Russian Far East, while mass vaccinations are being carried out, some of the
animals are destroyed; however, the basis upon which they are being selected
remains to be explained. Killing some of the animals several days after the
onset of clear, multiple clinical cases (thus, most probably, at least several
weeks after the initial introduction of the virus) might not be effective in
eradicating FMD. - Mod.AS]
