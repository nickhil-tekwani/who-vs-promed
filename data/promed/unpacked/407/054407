Let's assume that everything is correct with this account of Japanese
encephalitis (JE) infection. The assumption is that a 10 year old girl was
exposed to vectorborne JE shortly after arrival to a very modern urban area
in China. Indeed, vectorborne transmission there would be highly
improbable. Another assumption is that both the illness that led to the
initial hospital admission and the secondary illness that developed after
she was discharged was from the same virus.

Another way to look at this case is that the initial illness was not from
JE virus. The exposure to JE virus could have occurred in the hospital
through any one of many percutaneous or parenteral exposures. Hospitals in
Shanghai in July could easily have other patients with JE infection
acquired in endemic areas of China. Indeed, a hospital would be one of the
few places in Shanghai where the virus would be present. This also explains
the negative serologic tests for JE done during the initial illness. A wide
range of bloodborne pathogens, including malaria, have been transmitted in
hospitals through minor lapses in technique even in the most highly
developed countries. Exposure in the hospital explains the initial negative
serology, the prolonged "biphasic" illness, and infection in a modern urban
area.

Lastly, there is one other remote possibility. She may have been infected
from a vector at or near the international airport, which is outside urban
Shanghai. However, the airport is a new modern air conditioned facility.

[Dr Fontaine's suggestion that this case might be an iatrogenically
acquired case of JE is intriguing and merits investigation. Viewing the
reported case as having 2 independent neurologic illnesses -- the 1st, a
mild illness that resulted in hospitalization within 2 weeks of arrival in
Shanghai, the 2nd occurring 2-3 weeks following hospitalization (within the
incubation period for JE) -- might explain the negative serology for JE
during the 1st hospitalization. It would be interesting to know whether any
JE cases were admitted to the same hospital in Shanghai concurrent with
this patient. Nosocomial transmission of pathogens occurs in health care
settings in all types of environments, as in outbreaks of hepatitis C
associated with health care setting transmission in the USA in recent
years. - Mod.MPP

In view of the fact that the 10 year old girl was released from the
hospital with some neurologic sequelae already from the 1st hospitalization
with admission in mid-July in Shanghai (according to Dr Fons Van Gompel's
general description in the 1st posting, "Japanese encephalitis - Belgium ex
China (Shanghai) RFI 20050413.1017") and with the worsening neurologic
symptoms in mid-August, when it was decided to repatriate her to Belgium
for further medication, the neurologic disorders seem progressive and
consistent with her having viral encephalitis. Furthermore, the lab testing
results from Shanghai and Belgium do not seem to be discrepant,
qualitatively. Rather, the results point to a quantitative matter (serology
for JE when in Belgium: 24 Aug 2004: IgG = 32 and IgM = 256; 2 Oct 2004:
IgG = 256 and IgM = 32; but a negative result of JE serology from Shanghai
in July 2004), implying that, along with the progress of the disease, more
overt symptoms and pronounced immunological outcomes will normally appear
in due course.

The purpose of creating this thread is to solicit further discussion about
how to prevent JE infections in travelers to endemic and seasonal epidemic
areas of JE. Commentaries from various experts in epidemiology, tropical
medicine, nosocomial infections, virology, entomology, and vaccinology are
welcomed. - Mod.RY]
