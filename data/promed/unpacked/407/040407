A man died as a result of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a sometimes fatal viral disease contracted from a tick bite, in the Black Sea province of Tokat on Sat 27 Apr 2013. He had been bitten by a tick while taking care of his animals in the fields on 17 Apr 2013. He extracted the tick by himself and did not immediately seek professional attention. He was taken to Tokat State Hospital and later transferred to the Gaziosmanpasa University Research and Treatment Hospital when his condition deteriorated.

Doctors at the Gaziosmanpasa hospital stated that the man is the 1st person to die due to CCHF this year [2013] in Turkey; however, there are some patients who are currently receiving treatment for the disease in other hospitals. According to data released by the Ministry of Health, 174 people died as a result of CCHF in Turkey between 2002 and 2012.

The number of tick bite cases increases as the weather gets warmer and people engage in more activities outdoors. Experts say people who come into contact with a tick should be carefully monitored for 10 days following contact and seek professional medical care if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea present themselves.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_). CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asian countries south of the 50th parallel north -- the geographical limit of the principal tick vector.

The following information has been extracted from a recent review in The Lancet by Talha Khan Burki (Lancet 2012; 380(9857): 1897-8. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62097-2). In its immature form, the tick feeds on small mammals. Later, the adult tick attaches itself to cattle, sheep, goats, or human beings. Livestock show no overt signs of disease, and farmers and slaughterhouse workers have little idea they have been infected until they start expressing symptoms: dizziness, muscular pain, and stiffness, and of course the signature bleeding. Whereas infection in birds mostly tends to be abortive, ostriches are important hosts. In the mid 1990s, South Africa saw a CCHF outbreak at an ostrich abattoir. About 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have reported CCHF. The tick ventures no further than 50 deg north latitude, which cuts across Russia, Ukraine, central Europe, and France; the latter 2 regions are not considered to be at any immediate risk, the _Hyalomma_ spp ticks are present but there is no serological evidence of CCHF. The distribution of known cases across the Middle East and Africa is patchy -- ticks are present in the whole of this region but in many countries it seems harmless. In Africa, only South Africa, and from time to time Mauritania, face ongoing outbreaks; countries such as Tanzania and Uganda have not reported any recent outbreaks; and countries such as Angola and Algeria seem not to be at risk.

Changing patterns of agriculture and flood control may also have played a part. In Turkey affected parts of central Anatolia had been more or less abandoned in the late 1990s due to terrorist activity. Hunting and farming resumed in 2001, and ticks were able to fasten onto the influx of cattle and sheep. The following year [2002], Turkey confirmed its 1st case of CCHF and numbers have steadily increased ever since (which may simply be due to the increased surveillance).

Only 4 countries report more than 50 cases per year: Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (although, it could easily be the case that these countries simply have particularly efficient surveillance systems backed by proper diagnostics). A few other nations report 5 to 49 cases per year. Most of the time, CCHF outbreaks affect a small handful of people. Turkey is responsible for most of the burden. According to the Turkish Ministry of Health, 2008 and 2009 both saw in excess of 1200 cases of CCHF; numbers dropped in 2010, but exceeded 1100 last year (no figures for 2012 have been released). Turkish mortality from CCHF hovers at around 5 per cent. But it can be considerably higher, particularly if there are delays in obtaining treatment (and this is a disease that mainly affects rural areas). There is a good deal about the vector, the virus, and its expression that remains unclear. Variation in mortality is just one of these issues -- it could be related to the alacrity with which supportive therapy and treatment are started, but viral properties (there are several distinct strains of CCHF virus) and genetics may also play a part.

Only one drug is used to treat CCHF: ribavirin. "It's a good treatment option but it needs to be given early on -- as soon as the disease is diagnosed -- I don't think there's much hope once the clinical picture is dominated by the host inflammatory responses," according to one authority.

For now, the best way to minimise infection would be to ensure at-risk communities take precautions. Wearing protective clothing, insect repellent, and spraying livestock with insecticide would be very effective and could have a knock-on effect on other diseases. Health professionals must be assiduous in ensuring that safety measures are adhered to within hospitals, most crucially when they encounter haemorrhaging patients.

Meanwhile, experts need to be enlisted to map the behaviour of the tick. In studying this, Turkey should be expected to lead the way. If it can be established why its burden of CCHF is higher than elsewhere, whether it is the environment, the virus, a genetic factor, or something to do with the tick, then other countries might be able to draw conclusions relevant to their own experience. - Mod.CP
