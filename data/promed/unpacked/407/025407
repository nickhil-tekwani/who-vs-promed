Queensland officials have confirmed an outbreak of an exotic virus in
tomato crops near Brisbane. Yellow leaf curl virus has never before been
found in Australia and has the potential to cut production significantly.
Chris Adriaansen, from the Department of Primary Industries, says up to 40
small farms could be affected, but says seedling nurseries that supply
growers in other parts of the state are so far clear. "Yellow leaf curl is
quite a serious virus of tomatoes," Mr Adriaansen said. "In other parts of
the world where it has attacked before it's been responsible for very
significant losses, in some cases up to 100 per cent. "Any part of the
plant above the infected site will not produce flowers or fruit properly."

[The crop plant tomato, _Lycopersicon esculentum_, is susceptible to the
disease yellow leaf curl, caused by the tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) (family: _Geminiviridae_, genus: _Begomovirus_). TYLCV can cause
serious fruit loss and is the main limiting factor in tomato production in
many parts of the world. It frequently enters new areas on transplants, a
concern expressed in the above article.
The whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_ is the efficient vector of the virus; once
spread has begun, management is very difficult. The need to post this
article is clear, since this is the first report of a virus that has caused
serious disease losses wherever is has been reported.
Tomato leaf curl virus (TLCV-Aus) is a begomovirus that has caused disease
in tomato in Australia since 1971 (see ProMED-mail posts referenced below)
and is described and mapped in the A2 list of EPPO for TYLCV and similar
viruses. TLCV-Aus is known to be very similar to a strain of TYLCV from
Thailand (TYLCV-Thai). It remains to be seen which of the multiple strains
of TYLCV this new Australian isolate resembles. A summary of the Australia
begomoviruses and a set of diseased tomato photographs can be found in the
final link below. Recent outbreaks of begomoviruses causing severe disease
in tomato in Indonesia, Uganda and South Carolina USA were also the subject
of a recent post (20060304.0702), which should be consulted for additional
information and multiple references.
