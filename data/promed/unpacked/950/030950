[1] Preliminary sequencing results
Date: 23 Aug 2009
From: Julio Garcia <jgarcia@ispch.cl>


Preliminary genetic study of 1st transmission of A(H1N1) 2009 virus
from human to birds.
--------------------------------------
During this week, Chile communicated to WHO the 1st isolation of
A(H1N1) swine flu virus in turkeys. The finding was done by the
Chilean farming agency SAG.

The 1st case in Chile of human A(H1N1) 2009 infection was confirmed
by the Institute of Public Health (national reference laboratory) on
17 May 2009; from then on, we have reached a total of 12 175
laboratory confirmed cases with 116 deaths.

Two days ago, the Institute of Public Health confirmed the virus
finding in 2 private turkey plants in Valparaiso (Chile). These
turkeys were not for consumption but for production of eggs. As with
pigs, there is no risk to people from meat consumption. This
situation was detected only because of behavior changes and lower egg
production. There is no record of previous infection in workers of
these 2 farms (3 countries had previously detected A(H1N1) 2009 virus
transmission from humans to pigs).

Yesterday [22 Aug 2009], the Institute of Public Health (ISP)
analyzed the genetic and antigenic characteristics of the
hemmaglutinin (HA) gene of the viruses of the turkeys in the
outbreak. These strains showed 99.5 to 98.9 percent similarity in
nucleotides and amino acids to the A/California/4/2009 strain. At the
same time, they were 100 percent similar in nucleotides and amino
acids to the strains circulating in Chile in human cases. This week,
we will analyze the complete genome, and we will send the results to
ProMED.

Our point is that for the 1st time, it has been proven that
transmission of the new virus from humans to birds has occurred. This
is a concern vis a vis the possibility that this may happen in Asia
or Africa under conditions of co-infection with H5N1 virus.

Ministerio de Agricultura, Santiago, Chile

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 23 Jul 2009
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 20 Aug 2009
Report date 21 Aug 2009
Date submitted to OIE 21 Aug 2009
Reason for notification: Emerging disease

Morbidity 61.4 percent
Mortality 0 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Influenza A Virus
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks - Total outbreaks: 2

Valparaiso (Las Palmas, Quilpue, Valparaiso; Pucalan, Quillota, Nogales)

Species Birds
Susceptible 29 782
Cases 24 337
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population: The birds are breeding turkeys which presented a
drop from 70 percent to an average of 31 percent and a reduction in
the quality of the shell. Neither respiratory signs nor increased
mortality were observed. Necroscopy of the affected birds showed
salpingitis, peritonitis and an interruption of follicular
development. No other lesions were observed. Samples of embryonated
eggs collected from the incubation building gave negative results
with real time PCR. 20 days after the beginning of the event, a
recovery in the laying rate was observed.

Outbreak 2 (Foco 2) Pucalan, Quillota, Nogales, Valparaiso

Date of start of the outbreak 29 Jul 2009
Outbreak status Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm

Species Birds
Susceptible 29 772
Cases 12 248
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population The birds are breeding turkeys showing an
abnormal decrease in laying rate. Neither respiratory signs nor
increased mortality were observed.

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 2
Outbreak statistics
Species: Birds
Susceptible 59 554
Cases 36 585
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Species Birds
Apparent morbidity rate 61.43 percent
Apparent mortality rate 0.00 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 0.00 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 0.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection -
Unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: The affected farms are turkey breeding
premises belonging to the same company, vertically integrated, where
appropriate biosecurity measures are applied.

Outbreak no. 1 is composed of 5 breeding premises. The outbreak
started in premises no. 1 and through horizontal transmission, it
reached 3 other premises.

In the outbreak n. 2 of 5 existing sectors are affected [the meaning
of this is unclear. Perhaps: "In outbreak no. 2, 2 of 5 existing
sectors are affected" - Mod.LM]

Prior to the appearance of clinical signs, some birds were exposed to
people showing respiratory symptoms.

The affected premises were systematically monitored through
serological testing with negative results until 28 Jul 2009.
Serotyping allowed exclusion of the presence of H5 and H7 viruses and
allowed confirmation of the detection of A/H1N1 2009 pandemic
influenza virus 2009.

Samples were sent to the Public Health Institute of Chile (ISP),
Ministry of Health. The ISP confirmed the presence of A/H1N1 2009
pandemic influenza virus 2009 using real time PCR. The RT-PCR for
seasonal H1 and H3 influenza gave a negative result. Samples will be
sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory.

Control measures - Measures applied: Quarantine, Screening,
Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), Vaccination
prohibited, No treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Communicated by several ProMED readers

[The 2 reports taken together advance, to some degree, our knowledge
of H1N1 pandemic potential. Dr. Julio Garcia has most kindly provided
us with preliminary analysis indicating that the virus that infected
the birds is indeed the current novel, pandemic strain of H1N1.
ProMED-mail is very appreciative of Dr. Garcia and the Public Health
Institute of Chile's quick communication, underscoring a central
tenet of ProMED-mail, that rapid sharing of information among the
world's emerging disease specialists is one of the most valuable
assets in combating the current or any pandemic emerging disease.

The 2nd important pieces of new information are quantitative details
on the magnitude of production losses, which then appear to be the
main clinical finding, as neither respiratory signs nor mortality
were observed. However, post mortem lesions affecting the
reproductive tract were observed as well. While the production losses
were striking, and the morbidity was greater than 50 percent, the
effect on the grandparent stock only lasted for some 20 days or so
before they appeared to recover, according to the OIE report.
Obviously, the associated economic losses will be significant;
further details from knowledgeable individuals in agriculture would
be appreciated.

Two clues are revealed as we learn more about this unusual event in
Chile. 1st, the current pandemic strain continues to be, as Jim
Steele would say, adventurous, by moving from humans into turkeys.
Secondly, the H1N1 pandemic virus has not been highly lethal when it
comes out of humans and infects farm animals, since neither swine in
Canada nor turkeys in Chile have exhibited a high mortality rate
comparable to the devastation in farms experiencing H5N1. Overall,
this event should serve as a warning to agricultural and public
health sectors to prepare well for the fall [2009], as the current
pandemic influenza virus is active in its ability to spread across
species.

Finally, Dr. Garcia Moreno's comments about co-circulation of this
virus with H5N1 are insightful, given that we now have further
evidence that this particular H1N1 virus can move into animal
populations without too much clinical disturbance in animal
populations. Therefore, crossing the species appears to occur in a
somewhat unobtrusive and, therefore, potentially unobserved fashion
in some parts of the world. This observation should serve to alert
animal health officials in Africa and Asia, where H5N1 control and
surveillance efforts should be intensified. It also underscores the
value of all the hard work in controlling H5N1 done by countries like
Nigeria or by long standing global control programs, which were
established in 2005. The payoff for these programs happens every time
an H1N1-infected human steps onto a poultry farm which could have
been harboring H5N1 if not for the effectiveness of the "on the
ground" control program efforts developed by dedicated local, state,
national and international teams.
