Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Slovenia: confirmation
--------------------------------------
Reported on 21 Nov 2001 by Dr Zoran Kovac, chief veterinary officer,
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ljubljana (see Disease Information,
14 [46, 270, dated 16 Nov 2001 for report period ending 13 Nov 2001).
Outbreak: Nova Stifta, Gornji Grad municipality. The affected cow comes
from a small, extensive dairy farm in the mountains.
Total number of animals in the outbreak*:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 10 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
* There are also 2 pigs and 4 chickens on the farm.
On 12 Nov 2001, the Veterinary Administration of the Republic of Slovenia
(VARS) was notified by the National Veterinary Institute (NVI) of positive
results to the Western blot (Prionics Check) test for BSE in a 5 year old
cow. Immediately after having been notified by the NVI, the veterinary
authorities isolated the affected farm and banned the movement of animals
to and from the farm.
On 16 Nov, the NVI confirmed the suspicion of BSE with histopathological
and immunohistochemical examinations. The sample was also sent to the
Institute of Animal Neurology, University of Bern, Switzerland (OIE
Reference Laboratory), where the diagnosis was confirmed on 20 Nov.
The source of agent/origin of infection is under investigation. The farmer
concerned stated that cattle on the farm graze during the summer and are
fed with grass silage and hay during the winter. The affected cow had
remained on the farm all its life, as had its offspring.
Control measures during reporting period:
- ban on animal movement to and from the farm;
- epidemiological inquiry (determination of cohorts);
- offspring cull;
- routine monitoring at slaughterhouses of all animals over 24 months.
BSE has been a compulsorily notifiable disease in Slovenia since 1995. In
order to avoid the occurrence of BSE, Slovenia introduced a ban on the use
of meat-and-bone meal (MBM) and compound feeding stuffs containing
mammalian tissue in the nutrition of ruminants in 1996.
The importation of consignments of bovine animals, bovine meat, and meat
products has been banned from:
- the United Kingdom (an administrative ban came into force in 1996, but,
since 1991, the issuing of import licences for the above-mentioned
consignments has been banned);
- France, Ireland, Portugal, and Switzerland (since 1996);
- Belgium and the Netherlands (since 1998);
- Denmark, Germany, and Spain (since 2000);
- the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Slovakia (2001).
In December 2000, Slovenia issued an Order on preventive measures relating
to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), specifying animal
tissues involving specific risks, the relevant procedures and a ban on
imports of MBM and certain other products obtained by the processing of
animal waste and animal carcasses. A preventive measure was established
requiring the breeder or the owner of animals to certify, by signing the
animal health certificate, that since the day the above-mentioned Order
came into force, the animals had not been fed with MBM. Another Order was
issued in December 2000, establishing a new system of surveillance for BSE
and banning the use of processed animal protein in the nutrition of all
species of animals intended for the production of food, as well as the
marketing, trade, and import and export of such protein.
Routine testing for BSE for all cattle presenting nervous signs has been
compulsory since 1992. Since 1996, routine surveillance of animals older
than 36 months intended for slaughter has been enforced. To this effect,
random samples are taken in slaughterhouses.
Since 1 Feb 2001, all bovine animals older than 30 months slaughtered for
human consumption have to be tested for BSE using the Prionics Check test.
Number of animals tested for BSE between 1992 and 2000
Year / Routine slaughter / Clinical signs /** Routine necropsy / Total
tested / Positive
1992 / 0 / 9 / 9 / 0
1993 / 0 / 30 / 30 / 0
1994 / 0 / 13 / 13 / 0
1995 / 0 / 21 / 21 / 0
1996 / 153 / 26 / 25 / 204 / 0
1997 / 111 / 21 / 48 / 180 / 0
1998 / 106 / 23 / 14 / 143 / 0
1999 / 102 / 14 / 6 / 122 / 0
2000 / 0 / 29 / 8 / 37 / 0
[** For 1992-1995, only one figure is presented for both clinical signs and
routine necropsy; for years thereafter there is a separate figure for these
categories. Thus, there are 5 figures for years 1992-1995 and 6 thereafter.
A total of 24 893 animals were tested for BSE from 1 Jan 2001 to 31 Oct
2001. The reasons were as follows: sick animals 1856, euthanised 301,
clinical signs 1, dead animals 1062, routine slaughter 20 653, sanitary
slaughter 4, emergency slaughter 895, and unknown 121.
Import conditions:
Imported consignments of live animals must fulfill certain conditions:
- in the place of origin and in the surrounding area, no cases of BSE have
been discovered in the previous 6 years;
- in the exporting country, the feeding of ruminants with MBM and feeding
stuffs which contain mammalian protein is prohibited;
- the animals are less than 30 months old.
For the importation of bovine meat and products, the official veterinarian
in the exporting country must certify that:
- in the place of origin and in the surrounding area, no cases of BSE have
been discovered in the last 6 years or at the time of slaughter;
- in the exporting country, the feeding of ruminants with MBM and feeding
stuffs which contain mammalian protein is prohibited;
- the animals are less than 30 months old.

[This is a detailed report and gives a good picture of the surveillance
system in place. It appears, however, that there is not much insight into
how the cow got the disease. Of course, the cow is much older than the
import feed ban instituted in 2000, and that may be all the explanation we
need. - Mod.PC
