Since December 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture has confirmed several cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 in the Pacific, Central, and Mississippi flyways (or migratory bird paths). The disease has been found in wild birds, as well as in a few backyard and commercial poultry flocks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections to be low. No human cases of these HPAI H5 viruses have been detected in the United States, Canada, or internationally.

Although officials believe the H5N2 virus was brought to the Midwest by wild birds, a wide-ranging sampling program in Minnesota has failed to find any wild birds infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) so far, according to Michelle Carstensen, PhD, wildlife health program supervisor for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR).

The DNR has been collecting fecal samples from waterfowl within 10 kilometers [about 6.2 miles] of outbreak sites in 5 counties, aiming to gather enough to provide 95 percent confidence of finding the virus if present in 1 percent of birds. For control sampling, the agency is also collecting similar numbers at wildlife management areas that are not close to any outbreaks.

Carstensen reported on 25 Apr 2015 that the DNR (Department of Natural Resources) has submitted 2314 fecal samples for testing, including 1740 from waterfowl in areas near infected farms and 574 from control sites. Test results on 915 of these revealed no HPAI viruses and just 7 low-pathogenic viruses, she said.

The DNR also has submitted samples from 21 wild birds that were found dead or sick, including raptors, wild turkeys, and other species, she reported. 8 results have come back, and all were negative for HPAI.

Testing of samples from hunter-killed wild turkeys is just beginning, Carstensen said. A 1st batch of 18 samples was submitted for testing 23 Apr 2105 and more will be submitted this week.

Preliminary testing is done by the USDA's National Wildlife Disease Laboratory in Ft Collins, Colorado, according to the DNR's surveillance plan. Any samples that are positive for H5 or H7 viruses then go to the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, for confirmation and further typing.

A 7th case of the deadly bird flu virus has been detected in Wisconsin.

The latest case as reported [Tue 28 Apr 2015] by the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection is in a 108 000 turkey flock in Barron County. That is the 3rd reported case in Barron County.

All 7 cases have been reported over a 15-day period beginning on 13 Apr 2015. About 1.3 million birds are affected.

There are 2 outbreaks in Jefferson County, and one each in Chippewa and Juneau counties.

The virus is lethal to birds, but is not expected to be a risk to people or the food supply.

A ban on poultry movement to shows, exhibitions, and swap meets in the 4 affected counties remains in effect.

The deadly bird flu virus was found in an egg-laying flock with 3.7 million chickens in northwest Iowa in addition to 4 more poultry farms, state agriculture officials said [Mon 27 Apr 2015].

The virus will now cost Iowa egg producers about 1/6 of the state's 60 million hens, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey said, or nearly 9.8 million chickens that have either been or will be euthanized.

Initial tests indicated the presence of the H5N2 virus on the large farm in Sioux County. The other probable cases, affecting more than 2 million chickens combined, are at 2 farms in O'Brien County, one in Osceola County, and another in Sioux County.

Final confirmation is expected later [Mon 27 Apr 2015] or [Tue 28 Apr 2015] on the latest farms, Northey said.

Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer and has seen a rapid increase in the number of chickens affected by the virus since the 1st case was announced a week ago. The virus has also been found on 2 Iowa turkey farms involving 80 000 birds.

Nationally, the H5N2 virus has cost Midwestern turkey and chicken producers almost 13 million birds since early March [2015].

The impact on consumer egg and turkey prices depends on how much more the virus spreads, according to Dr TJ Myers, a veterinary administrator with the US Department of Agriculture. So far, nearly 7 million turkeys have been culled out of a total US turkey population of 240 million.

"I don't think it's to the point yet where there's a huge market impact. The real question is what comes later this week, next week, and the following week," he said.

The virus typically dies in the warmth of spring and summer, and the Midwest is approaching the season where temperatures in the 1970s and more ultraviolet rays should halt the virus.

The federal government has an indemnity fund that pays turkey and chicken producers for the birds that remain alive on the farm but must be killed to eliminate the risk of spreading the disease. The fund also helps farms compost the birds and clean up the farm so it can be used again.

So far, the government has spent USD 60 million, Myers said.

The Iowa counties involved are concentrated in the northwest corner of Iowa but so far officials say they do not believe the virus is traveling from farm to farm.

Here are some questions and answers about how wild birds remain healthy even when carrying the virus and spread it to backyard and commercial flocks of chickens and turkeys.

How did the virus arrive stateside?
Disease experts believe a portion of it came from European and Asian strains of bird flu that readily cause illness and death in birds and mixed with a North American strain that was less likely to cause severe illness as birds from different regions crossed migratory paths.

The US Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey have reported 3 versions of bird flu in 57 cases confirmed since December [2014], starting 1st with domestic backyard flocks, wild captive birds and wild aquatic birds in California, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Additional cases surfaced in January and February [2015] on the West Coast, and by March [2015], cases emerged in the Midwest.

Which wild birds carry the virus?
Bird flu has been found in more than 100 species of wild birds, but most are low pathogenic viruses -- present, but don't sicken or kill it. The virus can be left behind in wild birds' feces, on feathers and on the bodies of dead birds. Birds confirmed to have carried the virus currently spreading infection in the United States include ducks, Canada geese, and predatory birds.

How does the virus get into commercial barns?
USDA Chief Veterinary Officer Dr John Clifford has said it's not entirely clear how the virus gets into commercial barns, which are mostly enclosed, but there are likely several ways. In some cases, the virus may enter on clothing or shoes of workers, although commercial operations have strict biosecurity guidelines for changing clothes and disinfecting items. Clifford also speculates wind could be carrying the virus in on dirt particles or feathers through barn ventilation openings. Officials are exploring all possibilities in an effort to identify and eliminate identified pathways, Clifford said.

Is it the 1st outbreak in the US?
It's the 1st widespread one that's affected millions of commercially raised chickens and turkeys, but there have been sporadic cases of low pathogenic versions before. In 2004, an outbreak of H5N2 was found in a flock of 7000 chickens in Texas, marking the 1st outbreak of a high pathogenic strain in 20 years, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

What do the numbers and letters mean when identifying virus strains?
The numbers specify proteins on the flu virus surface. One set has a long scientific name starting with an H numbering 1-16 and the other has a long name starting with an N and number 1-9. The protein mixture determines whether the virus can attach only to bird cells, infect other animals or attach to human cells. In all, there are 144 ways the proteins can mix to create different versions of the bird flu, ranging from H1N1 to H16N9.

Could bird flu sicken Americans?
There have been no confirmed cases of illness in humans associated with the current H5N2 bird flu virus, leading scientists to believe it cannot easily attach to human cells. There is an increased chance of human infection, the CDC says, because bird flu viruses have been known to mutate into versions that can jump to humans.

What can I do to avoid the bird flu?
The CDC recommends observing wild birds only from a distance and avoiding contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with bird feces. Also, avoid contact with domestic poultry that appear ill or have died and properly handle and cook poultry products.

Flocks housing as much as 16 percent of egg-laying chickens in Iowa, the biggest US egg producer, may be infected with the bird flu sweeping through US poultry farms.

Flocks with some 9.5 million egg-layers are confirmed positive for the virus or are presumed to have it, Bill Northey, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, said on a conference call with reporters on [Mon 27 Apr 2015]. The state has 59.5 million layers, according to the US Department of Agriculture.

With millions of birds ravaged by the disease this year, US farms are stepping up clean up efforts and Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton declared a state of emergency.

At stake is the roughly USD 44 billion made from poultry and eggs produced in the US, the latest government figures show. The outbreak, the worst in 3 decades, has prompted poultry buyers from Europe to Asia to place restrictions on American shipments.

Avian flu has been found primarily in commercial turkey flocks, particularly in Minnesota, where abundant waterways attract wild geese and ducks, suspected of carrying the disease. Egg-laying hens in neighboring Wisconsin have also been infected.

Highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza was confirmed in 6 more flocks in Iowa, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, the USDA said in a statement Monday.

Health officials today [28 Apr 2015] confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2 wild birds in McCracken County, Kentucky, a day after 5 outbreaks were reported at commercial poultry farms in Iowa. A new outbreak of the H5N2 strain was also confirmed in a flock of 27 000 turkeys in Stearns County, Minnesota, the biggest turkey producing state.

Four of Iowa's latest cases were reported in newly affected counties -- 2 egg-laying operations in O'Brien County, one laying facility and a turkey farm in Sioux -- with a 5th case found in Osceola (the county's 2nd outbreak) on a pullet farm raising layer chickens. All told, the operations were raising about 5.8 million birds, all of which are being euthanized to slow the spread of the virus. Combined with previous outbreaks, Iowa will be depopulating almost 10 million chickens and turkeys.

Iowa Agriculture Department officials have not confirmed the subtype of avian flu in the latest cases, but said the results will likely be positive for the H5N2 strain; the most common variant of bird flu found in the U.S. since December [2014].

Today's [28 Apr 2015] confirmation of a new case in Minnesota means that about 3.4 million birds have been affected in the state, almost all of them turkeys.

The USDA has been lending a hand to poultry farmers through its indemnity fund, which will pay up to 100 percent of the purchase price and the cost of disposal of poultry required to be destroyed, either due to contamination or exposure to highly pathogenic avian flu. Since December, the agency has paid out USD 60 million to poultry farmers.

In ProMED-mail post 20150419.3307106, my comment was: "It may be helpful to look at a map to try and understand some flyways of wild birds http://f.tqn.com/y/birding/1/S/H/G/-/-/north-america-migration-flyways.jpg. Wild birds may well have brought the disease and may have started the cycle, but the current cycle seems to be maintaining itself and spreading through some other mechanism, and perhaps currently the spread is not by wild birds, but by some other mechanism."

According to the report from Minnesota (item 2 above), apparently it was not the wild birds in this particular area. So, what brought this virus with such a nasty punch to the heavily populated avian area? The wind? I am not inclined to believe it is solely responsible. A number of things come to mind, such as trucking it in feed, or litter disposal, or tracking by employees, or some on intestinally bringing it?

One thing is clear: this disease is on a rampage and is taking a toll on producers, government and consumers. Oh, and let's not forget the birds themselves. In addition to the producers losing their birds, they then must clean the houses in an unbelievably thorough fashion to attempt to avoid a disease that reached them in an as yet unidentified method. What a cost! And what a cost and likely shortage will be passed onto the consumer. - Mod.TG]
