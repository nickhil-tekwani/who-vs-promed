2 new outbreaks of H7N7 low pathogenic avian influenza have affected commercial ostriches in the Western Cape this year [2014]; in the more recent case, more than 200 birds are reported to have died.

The veterinary authority sent follow up report no 3 dated 13 Jun 2014 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) [submitted 13 Jun 2014; see at http://tinyurl.com/mnj3v88. - Mod.AS]

It describes 2 new outbreaks of low pathogenic H7N7 virus in commercial ostriches in the same area of Western Cape Province.

The 1st outbreak started at the end of January 2014, with 38 birds out of 467 affected; no birds died. This outbreak is described as 'resolved'.

With the 2nd outbreak, however, 215 birds died; 306 of the 465 ostriches showed symptoms [see comment]. This outbreak started on 1 Apr 2014 and is continuing. Weekly reports will be published.

[During 2013, LPAI (in poultry) was reported in South Africa, predominantly on ostrich farms in the Western Cape province, followed by smaller outbreaks in Eastern Cape and Free State provinces. The new outbreaks were caused by LPAI serotypes H7N7 and H7N1; a continuing outbreak has been caused by serotype H5N2.

The new LPAI H7N7 event in ostriches started on 28 Feb 2013, reported for the 1st time on 13 Jun 2014, so far causing 12 outbreaks. The latest outbreak described above has, reportedly, caused high morbidity (306/465) and case fatality (215/306) rates; is it indeed a low pathogenic strain?

For the immediate notification and the 3 follow up reports, as well as an interactive map showing the 12 outbreaks, please se http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13707.

Another new event, caused by LPAI H7N1, reportedly started on 20 Oct 2013 and was reported to the OIE on 24 Dec 2013. This outbreak is regarded as "continuing". The report, including a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14564.

An epizootic caused by LPAI H5N2 started 1 Jun 2012, causing a total of 19 outbreaks. This epizootic has recently been declared as resolved in follow up report no 5 submitted 13 Jun 2014; see reports on all 19 outbreaks and an interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=12152.
