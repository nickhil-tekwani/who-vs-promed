Bird flu reappears in Thailand, Japan investigates deaths of more than 100
chickens
----------------------------------------------
A new case of bird flu has been discovered in Thailand, and more than 100
chickens were found dead in Japan, where initial tests came up negative for
the disease, authorities said Thursday.
In Thailand, Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob said a laboratory
test confirmed the presence of bird flu in a poultry sample taken in Chiang
Rai province, 420 miles north of Bangkok.
The results were dated 26 Feb 2004. Newin did not say how many samples were
taken or why it took so long to announce the results.
Thailand declared itself free of bird flu on Monday, saying no active cases
had been reported in poultry since 25 Feb 2004. It was not immediately
clear whether the government would rescind that announcement or postpone
plans to resume chicken breeding in affected areas in April 2004.
On Wednesday, 2 Thai newspapers said the virus may have reappeared, citing
laboratory tests and farmers' accounts, causing Newin to order an
investigation by the Livestock Department.
The government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra denied for weeks that
bird flu was spreading in the country before acknowledging an outbreak on
23 Jan 2004.
In Thailand, the disease has killed at least 7 people who had close contact
with chickens and has devastated the country's poultry industry. More than
30 million chickens in Thailand have died of the disease or been culled in
an effort to stop its spread.
Newin said Thursday that farmers in Chiang Rai had reported the dying
chickens to the livestock department, and were dissatisfied when its tests
showed negative for the virus.
The samples were then sent to Kasetsart University, the country's leading
agricultural research institute, which confirmed the chickens had the
virulent H5N1 strain of the disease, which has hit 10 Asian countries.
Newin said he was skeptical about the source of the new outbreak, citing
several unconfirmed reports of farmers having infected their own chickens
to gain compensation. He said the matter would be investigated.
In Japan, authorities in the southern state of Fukuoka were investigating
the possibility of a new case after a poultry farm there reported that 126
chickens had died overnight. Initial tests on some of the animals were all
negative, the state said in a brief statement. Kyodo News service quoted
unnamed officials as saying they suspected the birds may have died of heat
stroke.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization on Thursday warned affected
countries not to restock flocks too quickly to avoid the disease flaring up
again.
"In the battle against the disease, there are definitely some
improvements," the Rome-based group said in a statement quoting its Animal
Health Service chief, Joseph Domenech. "But we fear that the virus may
continue to circulate in the environment even without an outbreak or any
clinical signs in animals."

China Cancels Soccer Game Against Myanmar
--------------------------
China has called off an exhibition soccer match with Myanmar because of the
bird flu outbreak.
The match was a warmup for China's national squad before its World Cup
qualifier against Hong Kong in 3 weeks, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Wednesday.
"There are restrictions for Myanmar players to enter China since they are
from a bird flu-hit area," Xinhua said, citing state-run media.
The organization has already canceled friendlies against Syria and Viet
Nam, Xinhua said.

Dead chickens test negative for bird flu in Japan
--------------------------------------------------
More than 100 chickens were found dead Thursday in western Japan, but
following tests almost ruled out the possibility of fresh bird flu outbreak.
The case took place at a slaughterhouse in Kitakyushu, Fukuoka Prefecture,
where 126 among 930 chickens were found dead, Kyodo News quoted local
government as saying. But the tests on 10 dead chickens proved negative for
bird flu, the report said.
Further tests are expected to be conducted, and a veterinarian said the
chance of avian flu infection was "extremely low," Kyodo reported. Japan
has seen 3 bird flu outbreaks since January 2004. In the latest hit in late
February, around 250 000 chickens died either from virus or slaughter. The
67-year-old farm owner and his 64-year-old wife committed suicide Monday
amid accusations the husband was attempting to cover up the death of chickens.
Some chicken and eggs from that farm have reached restaurants in
neighboring areas. However, no human infection has been found in Japan's
first bird flu outbreaks over 79 years.
The Japanese authorities are now concerned about the disease being spread
by birds after some crows tested positive for the disease.

Bird flu: Chiang Rai outbreak confirmed; Upsets plan to declare country
disease free
--------------------------------------------
Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob's plan to declare Thailand free
of bird flu by early next week has collapsed after an outbreak in Chiang
Rai was confirmed.
The minister revealed the outbreak yesterday, 2 weeks after the bird flu
was detected in the province.
Mr Newin was forced into the confirmation after a Thai-language newspaper
published a test result on bird flu-infected chicken from Chiang Rai.
The lab result was dated 26 Feb 2004, a day after the government lifted all
red alert zones.
An affected poultry farmer said he repeatedly told the Livestock Department
about the outbreak, but was ignored.
Mr Newin claimed the department tested a chicken carcass from an infected
farm earlier, but the result was negative.
"Unconvinced, the poultry farmer sent the chicken carcass to Kasetsart
University's lab, which confirmed the fowl was infected with H5N1 virus
strain of bird flu on Feb 26," said Mr Newin. ''Livestock officials
immediately culled the chickens within a [specified] radius of the farm.
The operation ended on 2 Mar 2004, and the area is now under 21-day
surveillance."
If no there were no more cases the area would be downgraded to a green zone
on 23 Mar 2004, he said.
Mr Newin said officials were also testing suspicious chicken carcasses from
Chachoengsao's Phanom Sarakham district. Mr Newin said on Monday that with
no more reports of mass chicken deaths since the mass culling operation
ended on 25 Feb 2004, the country could be declared bird-flu free under
International Organisation for Animal Health rules on 16 Mar, if no new
case of bird flu emerged. The Chiang Rai outbreak means a change of plan,
with the ministry declaring bird flu-free zones area by area, rather than
for the whole country.
