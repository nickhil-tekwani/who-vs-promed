Dr. Gratz has provided a very useful list of references documenting _Aedes
albopictus_ naturally infected with dengue viruses. There is an additional
reference not included in his list, that is:
Gould, D.J., T.M. Yuill, M.A. Moussa, P. Simasathien, and L.C. Rutledge.
1968. An insular outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever III. Identification
of vectors and observations on vector ecology. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg.
17(4): 609-618.
This paper reported the recovery of 4 strains of dengue-2 virus from
1,392 _Ae. albopictus_ females tested in 141 pools from collections on Koh
Samui Island in southern Thailand.

[The finding of infected _Ae. albopictus_ during a dengue outbreak needs
to be interpreted in the context of more information. Were they freshly
fed, so that the virus could have been in their blood meal, rather than in
their salivary glands? Were _Ae. aegypti_ also present and infected, and
if so, what was the rate of infection in the 2 species? Perhaps Bruce or
Norm can clarify for us what their references say, to save us going to the
trouble of looking them up! - Mod.JW
