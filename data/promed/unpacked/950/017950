[Dengue] cases quadrupled in comparison with last year [2009]. The
state's challenge was to end this year [2010] without deaths caused
by this disease.

The dengue outbreak continues actively in Jalisco since the end of
2009, but this is not to say that the actions taken do not have
impact, stated the Secretary of Health of Jalisco, Alfonso Petersen
Farah. As for deaths, there is a reduced trend but an increase among
the number of infected individuals. The increase is considerable; up
to epidemiological week [EW] 20 of 2009, which included 17-23 May
2009, the health agency confirmed 131 cases, 11 of these DHF.
However, in the same [EW] of 2010, there are 502 infected
individuals, 77 of which have the most severe type of the disease
[DHF]. This signifies that there are 4 times more infected
individuals than in 2009.

Petersen Farah warns that the increase in infected people is due to
the strengthened epidemiological surveillance system, with the
reporting of more cases. According to the Center for Epidemiological
Surveillance and Disease Control (CENAVECE), of the federal
Secretariat of Health, there are more than 2000 probable [dengue]
cases in the state. That is to say that 2000 persons presented with
symptoms related to the virus [infection] but were not confirmed by
laboratory tests.

Last year [2009], the federal Secretariat of Health closed [the year]
with almost 60 000 probable cases of the [dengue] virus [infection],
with 5000 confirmed in Jalisco.

However, to have a continuous outbreak during the 1st half of the
year [2010] with [only] one recorded death indicates that the trend
is not so negative as one might think. For 4 months of the year and
with an active outbreak, to have one death leads us to a trend
infinitely less than that of the past year [2009]; however, we do not
cease to be worried.

Despite the actions against the virus, the state's challenge was to
finish the [current] year with zero deaths.

An outbreak of classical dengue and DHF affects children and elderly
people in the city [Santo Domingo] in a way so alarming that the
physicians are greatly worried because of the high morbidity rate in
the Public Health Centers and private [health care facilities].

The President of the Santiago branch of the Dominican Medical
Association, Dr. Antonio Jose Checo, said that the authorities are
aware of the situation. He said, as an example, that in the Union
Medical Clinic's intensive care unit, there are 10 children admitted
under care. He cited the Arturo Grullon Hospital as another of the
centers where there are many [dengue] admissions. He said that
although he does not have the statistics at hand, there are reports
of various deaths due to the disease.

Dr. Checko attributed the dengue outbreak to the lack of a good
educational campaign to orient the citizens about the necessity to
fumigate and eliminate mosquito breeding sites and the use of bleach
in containers of clean water.

According to the Epidemiological Bulletin 22 issued by the Ministry
of Health, the dengue epidemic has been declared throughout the
national territory, since in all states the trend of occurrence of
cases is rising and numerous. The report states that up to 5 Jun this
year [2010], there is a cumulative [total of] 41 573 dengue cases in
the entire country. During the last 10 weeks, likely cases of dengue
in the Capital District increased from 90 reported in the 1st week to
315 reported in the 10th, an increase of 350 percent in occurrence.

Of the 41 573 reported cases of dengue, 4136 are DHF. This week
across the country, 3399 cases were reported compared with same
period last year [2009], representing an increase of over 500 percent.

The states with most cases reported during the week of 30 May-5 Jun
[2010] are: Tachira (435 [cases]), Miranda (425), Merida (423),
Capital District (315) and Zulia, (295).

The state of Rio [de Janeiro] may have a dengue epidemic next summer,
fear [health] authorities, who are running against time to reduce the
number of _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites and the return of [dengue]
virus type 1, which this year [2010] was isolated in Rio [de Janeiro
city], and in Paraty, Angra dos Reis, Campos and Natividade.

This [dengue] virus [serotype], which caused an epidemic in 1986, has
not circulated since the beginning of the 1990s decade. Because of
this, all those who were born after this period do not have any
immunity against it. Since January 2010, the reintroduction of dengue
[virus] types 1 and 2 now cause epidemics in 20 of the 92
municipalities in the state with 21 confirmed deaths.

"We are working based on the worst scenario, which was the epidemic
of 2008 caused by [dengue] virus type 2. But we hope this does not
happen. [Dengue virus] type 1 was identified in the metropolitan
region and, because of this, we intensified preventive work to avoid
the occurrence of an epidemic in the state. This possibility worries
us because the number of people susceptible to this virus type is
very large, now that we have past nearly 20 years without it
circulating," said the Superintendent of Environmental and
Epidemiological Surveillance of the state Secretariat of Health and
Civil Defense, Alexandre Chieppe, who is in Brazilia discussing
strategies against dengue.

The dengue vector mosquito normally reproduces when it is hot. But,
despite cold weather, cities such as Campos, Macae, Angra dos Reis
and Cabo Frio have recorded a significant increase in illnesses in
April and May 2010, a period when generally a decline is registered.
"This year [2010], the epidemic curve has changed in some
municipalities. The dengue cases have extended into colder months.
Possibly, this occurred due to the reentry of dengue [virus] type 1.
This is an association, but we have not reached a conclusion," said Chieppe.

The Coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance of the state, Rita
Vassoler, said on Monday [14 Jun 2010] that 20 municipalities in Rio
de Janeiro are facing a dengue epidemic. "In these localities, the
incidence is greater than 300 cases per 100 000 population." In
Itaperuna, for example, the index in 2010, according to the state, is
1168 per 100 000 population. The city registered 388 cases of dengue
in April and 605 in May [2010]. Last year [2009], there were 11 cases
in April and 15 in May [2009]. Chieppe, however, stated that Rio does
not face an epidemic scenario. "These cities had epidemics, but today
the number of cases is falling," he said.

Rio has 2 characteristics that, according to specialists, are
worrying: people who are susceptible to the virus and a large
quantity of mosquito vectors. In the state, 55 percent of the
municipalities are in an alert situation for outbreaks and epidemics,
according to the latest household infestation rates released in March 2010.

"We have until November to maximally reduce the numbers of mosquito
breeding foci. We are intensifying out work. The prospects were to
have more than 2000 fire fighters to help municipal officials," said
Chieppe. "Today, there are 3000. For the 1st time, the dengue
situation room, an interdisciplinary group against the disease,
continued [to function] after summer ended. The population needs to
collaborate, since the majority of the [mosquito] breeding sites are
within residences."

In February [2010], the Ministry of Health had alerted the states in
the country to be attentive to the possibility of the reintroduction
of [dengue virus] type 1. Children and adolescents born after the
decade of the 90s could be the majority [of cases].

Minas Gerais has 17 deaths and 195 640 [dengue] cases with 110 DHF
cases in 2010 according to a bulletin released by the state
Secretariat of Health. Another 61 deaths are under investigation; in
addition to these, there are another 29 deaths from dengue with
complications. Deaths from DHF have increased to 17 this year [2010]
in Minas Gerais.

The deaths occurred in the municipalities of Belo Horizonte, Juiz de
Fora, Carangola, Santa Luzia, Arcos, Frei Inocencio, Paraopeba,
Vespasiano, Dores do Indaia, Pirapetinga, Ponte Nova, Cana Verde and
Nova Lima. Just in Belo Horizonte, there were 52 254 dengue cases
registered. The cities of Betim and Contagem have 15 776 and 6181
cases, respectively.

Worried by the dengue advance in Alagoas, the representatives of the
Committee for Mobilization Against Dengue met in the morning this
Wednesday 16 [Jun 2010] with various community leaders to plot
strategies to curb the number of cases. The objective, according to
the Director of Health Promotion, Fatima Lima, is to discuss the
situation with community leaders and institutional representatives
beyond their own communities to train multiplier agents [health
agents who train other agents].

According to the numbers presented by Lima, the number of registered
dengue cases up to the present is 26 000. Some await confirmation.
However, if compared to the same period last year [2009], the number
is frightening, because in 2009, there were nearly 3000.

According to the spokesperson of the state Secretariat of Health,
they are already taking action to combat the proliferation of the
dengue mosquito, in addition to assessing strategies. The increase in
the number of cases in 2010 was more than 900 percent compared to
last year [2009].

The simplest way to prevent dengue is to avoid reproduction of the
mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, because just one mosquito can infect 300
people [Although not every dengue virus-infected mosquito infects
nearly this many people, one or 2 is enough to keep the virus
circulating. - Mod.TY]. Because of this, it is necessary to eliminate
the places that they seek for reproduction; it is imperative to not
let clean water accumulate in any type of container.

Activities continue in outbreak areas; assistance services have been
strengthened for control actions by provincial and national technical
and health teams. Control actions include trash cleanup, destruction
of mosquito breeding sites and application of larvicides, fumigation
of blocks adjacent to homes of infected people, spatial mapping and
search for febrile patients with dengue symptoms.

It seems that the efforts of the East Jakarta government to combat
dengue fever have not run optimally. The sluggish outcome is clearly
indicated by the absence of urban villages categorized as green
zones, or areas free from dengue fever.

The East Jakarta Health Agency revealed that during this year [2010],
there have been 4622 dengue fever cases recorded, with none of the
total 65 urban villages in the municipality declared as a green zone;
while the red zone covers 32 urban villages, and the yellow zone
includes the rest of 33 urban villages.

The highest number of dengue fever cases is reported to be in
Durensawit sub-district (892 cases), followed by Cakung sub-district
(763 cases, 4 fatalities), Jatinegara (480 cases), Pulogadung (450
cases), Kramatjati (431 cases), Cipayung (384 cases), Matraman (354
cases), Ciracas (302 cases), Makasar (300 cases), and Pasarrebo
sub-district with (266 cases).

The acting head of East Jakarta Health Agency, Ariani Murti, explains
that to succeed in combating dengue fever, the government really
hopes for public participation, particularly from East Jakarta
residents, in the implementation of mosquito-breeding site
eradication programs (PSN [deplete and close breeding sites, bury
trash]) on Fridays. "We conduct PSN routinely, and we admit that it
has yet to be able to reduce the number of dengue fever cases.
Therefore, I hope the program not only will be undertaken by the
officers, but the residents should also take part," said Ariani Murti
on Tuesday (22 Jun [2010]), adding that in order to obtain maximum
results, PSN must become a lifestyle for residents.
