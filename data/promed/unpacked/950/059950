A sharp rise in the death toll from the human form of "mad cow" disease is
being investigated by British government scientific advisers, with 67
people in Britain now thought to have [acquired the disease from infected
beef. The number of deaths from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease(vCJD or
nvCJD) the human equivalent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad
cow disease), is up 25 from last year, although comparisons are difficult
because of changes in the way the inevitably fatal condition is diagnosed
and confirmed.
Seven more people are believed to be suffering from the condition. The
scientific advisers will consider the latest figures at a meeting tomorrow,
but it will be another 2 weeks before they announce whether there is cause
for further public concern.
--
[The 31 for the year includes suspected cases. The actual numbers are 101
referred for investigation, 9 vCJD confirmed, 12 sporadic CJD cases. If
the 67 cases referred to in this article are suspected vCJD, this is a
major increase. The number of referrals in 1999 was 169 as compared with
the 101 for this year as of 30 June, so there is an increase in referrals.

A village has become the centre of a major investigation into new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD). Lord Hunt, the junior health minister,
said there had been 4 definite cases and one probable case of nvCJD, the
human form of mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), in
Leicestershire. Three deaths in 12 weeks appeared to be linked to
Queniborough, which has a population of less than 2500, health authority
officials said.
Research in the village, which extends along the line of a brook from the
main Leicester to Melton Mowbray road, will help to determine whether
people in the area are more susceptible to the disease than elsewhere in
the country. Lord Hunt said in a Lords written answer the cluster of 4
confirmed cases linked to Leicestershire compared disfavourably with the 75
known or probable cases throughout the country. Statistical experts had
said it was unlikely this high proportion could have happened by chance.
The investigation into the circumstances of "this apparent cluster"
includes a large team of officials from bodies such as the national CJD
surveillance unit and the communicable diseases surveillance centre of the
Public Health Laboratory Service. The officials will work closely with the
Department of Health, the local health authority, the Ministry of
Agriculture and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

The government is investigating the statistically unlikely occurrence of 4
cases of nvCJD occurring in the same village. Experts from the National CJD
Surveillance Unit and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have
joined the local health authority to investigate the concentration of cases
and say they are keeping an open mind about the reasons behind it and
whether or not they are linked by Queniborough. They will be particularly
concerned to look at whether any contaminated beef has entered the food
chain in the area, particularly since the implementation of new controls in
1989.
Figures released by the CJD surveillance unit this week showed that there
were 12 confirmed vCJD deaths in the first six months of this year compared
with 13 for the whole of last year. In total, there have been 75 confirmed
and probable cases throughout the UK. The rise in cases is to be discussed
at a meeting of the Government's main BSE advisers on Monday, but they are
expected to await the August and September figures before taking any policy
decision.

When the first cases of the new variant disease came to light in 1995,
there were three cases, followed by 10 in both 1996 and 1997 and 18 in
1998, [a spokesperson said. The human form of BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) claimed three lives in Leicestershire within 12 weeks in
1998.
