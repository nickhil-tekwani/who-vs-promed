The H5N1 bird flu virus can pass through a pregnant woman's placenta
to infect the fetus, researchers reported on Thursday [27 Sep 2007].
They also found evidence of what doctors had long suspected -- that
the virus not only affects the lungs, but also passes throughout the
body into the gastrointestinal tract, the brain, liver, and blood cells.
"The work helps us to understand H5N1's high fatality rate, as well
as serving as model for global collaboration in the field of emerging
infectious diseases," said Dr. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in
New York, who directed the study. Lipkin and a team at Peking
University in Beijing studied tissue taken from 2 people killed by
H5N1 in China -- a 24-year-old pregnant woman and a 35-year-old man.
The study is the 1st to come out of the Infectious Disease Center at
Peking University in Beijing, established after the epidemic of
severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, a new virus that spread
out of China in 2003, killing 800 people and infecting 8000 before it
was stopped.
The center is now looking at victims of H5N1 avian influenza. The
virus mostly infects birds, but occasionally infects people and has
killed 200 out of 328 infected since 2003. Because experts fear it
could cause a pandemic that would kill millions, they are studying it
in great detail. Jiang Gu and colleagues at Peking University looked
at tissue samples from throughout the bodies of the victims. They
found genetic material from the virus in the lungs, as expected, but
also in the brain, the placenta, the intestines, and in immune system
cells in the blood and the liver.
The 4-month-old fetus, which died with its mother, was also infected,
the researchers reported in the Lancet medical journal. Their
findings support the theory of a "cytokine storm" -- the idea that
the immune system overreacts to the virus in some cases, and sends
out an overwhelming swarm of signaling chemicals that end up killing
the patient.
"Many people have talked about cytokine storm," Lipkin said in a
telephone interview. "Here the lung findings are that the amount of
damage appears to be disproportional to the number of cells that were
infected. This supports the hypothesis that there might be indirect
methods of damage." They also found evidence the virus had damaged
immune cells including macrophages, which they said suggests the
virus not only overstimulates parts of the immune system but can also
suppress other parts.
Previous studies of H5N1 victims have produced evidence the virus may
have evaded their immune systems's defenses by suppressing them. The
researchers noted that no one had thought human influenza could cross
the placenta and affect unborn babies. "But there just isn't that
much information," Lipkin said.
