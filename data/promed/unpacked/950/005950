Six persons were being treated for suspected anthrax in Laxmipur area of tribal-dominated Koraput district in Odisha, health officials said today [27 Jun 2014].

"The affected persons have been admitted to Podagoda hospital. The teams collected blood samples of suspected anthrax patients for laboratory testing and distributed medicines among them," Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) Koraput Laxmi Dhar Kabi said.

Medical teams from Laxmipur and Kakrigumma have been visiting the anthrax-affected village since Wednesday [25 Jun 2014], he said. The villagers have been asked not to consume rotten beef, the CDMO said. It seems the affected people had consumed meat of a dead animal a few days ago, and it could have led to the outbreak, said an official.

Four anthrax cases were reported from villages in Semiliguda and Lamatapur blocks in the district nearly a week ago, the health officials said.

[It is very clear that this livestock anthrax problem is not just from sporadic cases but reflects an epidemic status that is resulting in multiple human cases when affected stock in scattered tribal villages are slaughtered and butchered.

Koraput is the southernmost district of Odisha state; see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput_district and http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/21/Koraput.html. - Mod.MHJ
