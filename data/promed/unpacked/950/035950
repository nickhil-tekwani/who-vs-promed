Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Ramokgwebana, Selibe-Phikwe, Central [district]
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 May 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 213 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: on 25 May 2011, 2 animals were reported by a
farmer at Ramokgwebana crush [enclosure for cattle or other livestock]
with a history of salivation and lameness. On investigation by the FMD
Emergency Alert Team, lesions were confirmed to be consistent with
foot-and-mouth disease lesions

Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate /
Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 2.35 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: transboundary
spread
Epidemiological comments: the outbreak occurred in a communal area in
Selibe-Phikwe district (zone 7). Cases were confirmed based on foot
and oral lesions normally associated with the disease.
Zone 7 is an OIE stand-alone zone (FMD-free without vaccination) from
the rest of other zones in Botswana; therefore, an outbreak of FMD in
zone 7 does not have effect on the movement of cloven-hoofed animals
in the rest of the country.
Movement of cloven-hoofed animals and their derived fresh products
out of zone 7 was under restriction.
A complete movement ban of all cloven-hoofed animals and their fresh
products has been instituted with immediate effect within and into
zone 7. All cattle slaughter or abattoirs in zone 7 are closed with
immediate effect.
Extensive surveillance is ongoing to determine the extent of disease
spread in the district. Farmers and general public have been made to
be vigilant and report any cattle with suspicious lesions to nearby
veterinary authority. Biosecurity measures have been put in place.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; zoning;
disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no
treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE's reference
laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 1 Jun 2011 /
positive
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 1 Jun 2011 / positive
Cattle / virus isolation / / pending
Cattle / virus sequencing / / pending

Future reporting

[The suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in
northeastern Botswana has compounded further the troubles bedevilling
the cattle and beef industries in the Southern African beef exporter.
Still fresh from a confirmed outbreak of FMD reported on 5 May 2011 in
the Matsiloje area, which is in the neighboring veterinary disease
control zone 6 (eastern Botswana), the shocking news that the disease
has now surfaced in zone 7 (north-eastern Botswana), around the
Botswana-Zimbabwe border at Ramokgwebana broke on Tue 30 May 2011.
Speaking in an interview on Wed 1 Jun 2011, the Director of veterinary
services in the Ministry of Agriculture, Kgosietsile Philemon-Motsu,
said the recent outbreak is indeed a major setback for the country's
cattle industry.

The veterinary disease control zones 6 and 7 seem to be sharing a bad
omen as they were hit by FMD outbreaks in 2002 and 2003. The
government during that time spent about 19 million Pula (over USD 3
million) in compensation payments, re- stocking, and logistical
operations during outbreak control. This follows an outbreak of FMD in
2006 in the area which shares the border with the neighboring
Zimbabwe. Since 2006, the area was isolated from the lucrative
European Union (EU) markets.

Botswana's Ministry of Agriculture is still battling to contain the
recent outbreak after Cabinet had approved a budget of USD 5 million
to contain the disease within veterinary zone 6. Veterinary officers
recently blamed the outbreak of FMD on illegal trafficking of animal
products across the border.

Botswana's cattle industry has already suffered major setbacks this
year after being ravaged by lumpy skin disease in February 2011. Still
in the same month, the industry suffered again when a team of EU
inspectors expressed dissatisfaction with operational standards at the
country's abattoirs following random inspections. This resulted in
immediate closure of the abattoirs and a halt on exports to EU (see
http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/indepth/2011-06/02/c_13906858.htm).
