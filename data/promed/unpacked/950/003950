[After 9 consecutive days with no reports of newly confirmed cases, in the past 2 days, there have been 2 newly confirmed cases, one on each day. In both instances, the cases were expat females in their 20s from Riyadh, and possible high risk exposures were under review at the time of report. One wonders whether these cases are related to the hospital associated outbreak that was ongoing in Riyadh during August and September 2015.

The total number of cases reported from Saudi Arabia is now at 1253, including 539 deaths.
