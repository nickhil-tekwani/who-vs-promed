The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the US FDA [Food and Drug Administration] to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Reading and _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Abony infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.

30 people infected with the outbreak strains have been reported from 9 states. Of those ill people, 24 were infected with _S._ Reading, 1 was infected with _S._ Abony, and 5 were infected with both.

Total 30

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 21 May 2016 to 20 Jul 2016. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 72, with a median age of 30. 53 per cent of ill people are female. 5 ill people have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence available at this time indicate that alfalfa sprouts supplied by Sprouts Extraordinaire of Denver, Colorado are the likely source of this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of the 27 ill people who were interviewed, 17 (63 per cent) reported eating or possibly eating alfalfa sprouts in the week before illness started. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a 2006 survey of healthy people, in which 3 per cent reported eating sprouts on a sandwich in the week before they were interviewed. Ill people in the current outbreak reported eating raw alfalfa sprouts on sandwiches from several different restaurants.

Federal, state, and local health and regulatory officials performed a traceback investigation from 5 restaurants where ill people reported eating alfalfa sprouts. This investigation indicated that Sprouts Extraordinaire supplied alfalfa sprouts to all 5 of these locations.

On 5 Aug 2016, Sprouts Extraordinaire recalled its alfalfa sprout products from the market due to possible salmonella contamination. These products were sold in 5 pound [about 2.3 kg] boxes labeled "Living Alfalfa Sprouts". CDC recommends that restaurants and other retailers do not sell or serve and consumers do not eat recalled alfalfa sprouts supplied by Sprouts Extraordinaire. Read the Advice to Retailers and Consumers [http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reading-08-16/advice.html].

This investigation is ongoing, and we will update the public when more information becomes available. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview those people about foods they ate before they got sick.

[A variety of enteric pathogens has been linked to transmission from a variety of sprouts, as can be seen in the "see also" list below, including listeria, enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, and various of serotypes of salmonellosis. We await the scope of this newly reported outbreak. - Mod.LL
