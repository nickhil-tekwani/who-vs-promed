ProMED-mail has learned from a reliable source that Nipah virus has
been identified as the etiology of the unidentified encephalitis
outbreak in Kushtia Bangladesh (see Undiagnosed deaths, encephalitis
- Bangladesh (Kushtia): RFI 20070412.1221).

[Since 2001, there have been reports of encephalitis outbreaks due to
Nipah virus/henipavirus in Bangladesh (see prior ProMED-mail postings
listed below). There was an outbreak in Tangail in 2005, outbreaks in
Manikganj, Rajbari, Faridpur, Jaipurhat (Joypurat) and Golpagonj in
2004, an outbreak in Naogang in 2003 and the 1st reported outbreak in
Meherpur in 2001 (for a good description of the 1st 2 outbreaks in
2001 and 2003, see the ICDDR,B report Outbreaks of Encephalitis Due
to Nipah/Hendra-like Viruses, Western Bangladesh available at
<http://www.icddrb.org/pub/publication.jsp?classificationID=56&pubID=4673>).

All areas affected have been in the western portion of the country
(see map of Bangladesh available at:
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/bangladesh_pol96.jpg>.

Prior outbreaks have been associated with ingestion of fruit
contaminated by fruit bats, known to be carriers of the
Nipah/henipavirus (see ref. 1 below). Person to person transmission
of close contacts has also been postulated in a published study of a
prior outbreak (see ref. 2 below).

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the epidemiology of
the current outbreak in Bangladesh and further follow-up as to
whether there have been cases identified in neighboring district(s)
in India (in ProMED-mail posting Undiagnosed deaths - Bangladesh,
India: RFI 20070420.1300, there was mention of possible cases in
neighboring district(s) in India).
