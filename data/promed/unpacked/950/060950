The McHenry County Department of Health (MCDH) is reporting a foodborne illness outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness caused by _Salmonella_. The illness has been linked to El Sombrero [restaurant] in Fox River Grove. The business has voluntarily closed and is cooperating with McHenry County health officials during the investigation.

Those who ate at the food establishment from [23 Aug 2021] to [3 Sep 2021], regardless if they develop symptoms or remain well, are asked to complete a survey to assist MCDH in collecting data to conduct a comprehensive investigation of this illness outbreak to eliminate the public health risk. The survey is a secure webform that is HIPAA compliant, no personal and/or medical information will be released. The MCDH is advising anyone who ate food prepared at the food establishment to seek medical attention and testing if they experience or develop symptoms.

_Salmonella_ is a food-borne bacterium that cannot be detected by sight, taste or smell. Once consumed it can result in symptoms of illness including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, chills, fever or blood in the stool. Symptoms usually start within 6 hours to 6 days after infection and last 4 to 7 days. Most individuals can recover on their own in 3 to 5 days, but the infection can be more severe in children, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems.
