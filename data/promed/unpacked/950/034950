115th human case of avian influenza
-----------------------------------
[According to local sources] the Egyptian Ministry of Health has
announced the discovery of the 115th case of bird flu [avian
influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection] in Egypt.

Dr. Abdel Rahman Shaheen, official spokesman of the Ministry of
Health, reported the discovery of a new human case of bird flu. The
case is an 11-year-old child resident in Luxor governorate. He added
that this case is the 115th in Egypt since the outbreak of the
disease in Egypt [in 2006].

Dr. Shaheen said the girl had entered a hospital in Luxor governorate
suffering from high fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and
pneumonia. She had been exposed to birds suspected to have been
infected with avian influenza. The girl had received immediate
Tamiflu treatment and was placed on a respirator. Her condition is
now critical.
