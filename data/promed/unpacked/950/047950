Anthrax kills park's bison
--------------------------
An anthrax outbreak among plains bison at Prince Albert National Park
forced the closure of 2 trails Monday [25 Aug 2008]. The Canadian
Food Inspection Agency confirmed 4 cases of anthrax among 13
carcasses found in the remote southwest corner of the park, about 40
kilometres from the Waskesiu townsite. The bison were part of a
free-roaming herd, which is now being monitored by Parks Canada.

"There is no threat to any of the visitors that are using the park,"
said Norm Stolle, resource conservation supervisor with Parks Canada.

Anthrax in wildlife is a naturally occurring disease, often breaking
out when the right weather conditions align. "What you need is
basically a flooding period with a drying period and hot weather with
high humidity," said Stolle. "If you meet all those characteristics,
there's a chance it might happen."

The West Side Trail and Amyot Lake Loop were closed because of the
potential for human-wildlife conflict as predators are drawn to an
area flush with buffalo carcasses, Stolle explained. "It's like a
dog. You take its food-bowl and what does it do? It gets angry."

As the authorities learned of the outbreak, they searched the park by
helicopter and on ground patrols for infected carcasses.

Parks Canada wants to remind the public to not touch any dead animal
they come across in the park. Instead, they should leave immediately
and report the location to the Parks Canada office at 306-663-4532.

Anthrax was confirmed as the cause of death of 7 bison in a
Paddockwood herd last month [July 2008].

[Previously bovine cases were reported (20080812.2500) 11 Aug 2008 in
the Rural Municipality of Big River, about 130 km [80 miles]
northwest of Prince Albert, and on 9 Aug 2008 in the RM of Harris,
about 80 km [50 miles] southwest of Saskatoon; previously
(20080727.2297) 7 bison in a Paddockwood herd on 24 July 2008. The
year started (20080726.2286) with 13 cattle dead in May in Swift
Current and in mid-July 2008 a cow near Saskatoon. A typical sporadic
pattern of cases fortunately constrained by adequate vaccination.

Closing off the affected area is wise as this will keep visitors
away from the carcasses and the contaminated mess associated with
them. Studies around such carcasses have demonstrated a heavily
contaminated area of at least 10m radius around an anthrax carcass
full of shed hair, bloody soil, and carcass bits; some visitors would
be tempted to "rescue" a skull, which is illegal. Foxes, wolves &
bears soon get stuffed with feeding on the carcasses and leave fresh
ones. Experience in the Wood Bison National Park shows that
carcasses should be sprayed with 5 percent formaldehyde to discourage
scavengers and then burnt, if possible, but this necessitates an
experienced crew if it going to be done expeditiously and efficiently.
