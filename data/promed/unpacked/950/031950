West Nile Virus Surveillance Data as of Tue 30 Sep 2003
-------------------------------------------------------
Human - cumulative data
-----------------------
As of Tue 30 Sep 2003 there have been a total of 1059 probable or confirmed
cases of human infection in Canada and 7 deaths (an increase of 317 cases
and 3 deaths since Mon 22 Sep 2003). Saskatchewan remains the most severely
affected province with 621 probable or confirmed cases (and 3 deaths)
followed by Alberta with 224 probable or confirmed cases (increases of 203
and 41 respectively):
Province/No. probable cases/No. confirmed cases/No. of deaths/
Nova Scotia / 0 / 1* / 0 /
Quebec /12 / 2 / 0 /
Ontario / 66 / 1* / 2** /
Manitoba / 108 / 8/ 2 /
Saskatchewan / 603 / 18 / 3 /
Alberta / 196 / 28 / 0
British Columbia 14* / 1* / 0 /
Yukon 1* / 0 / 0 /
Total 1000 / 59 / 7
*Linked to travel outside of province
** 2 probable cases; death due to other causes
[The probable cases in British Columbia and Yukon, and the confirmed cases
in Nova Scotia and Ontario, are considered to be travel-related and not
indigenous cases. Since the last update on Mon 22 Sep 2003 the number of
probable or confirmed cases has increased from 742 to 1059. Most of the new
cases occurred in Saskatchewan (203) and Alberta (41). In all, 79.8 percent
(845/1059) of the cases have occurred in the prairie provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile
virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the
deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to
the situation in 2003 when few cases have been reported from Ontario and
Quebec, and overall considerably fewer fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Equines - cumulative data
-------------------------
As of Mon 30 Sep 2003, 411 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Quebec (7), Ontario (42), Manitoba (53), Saskatchewan (154),
Alberta (155).
[The number of presumptive or confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus
infection has increased by 99 since Mon 22 Sep 2003. There have been no
extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Mosquitoes - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Tue 30 Sep 2003, 491 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(80), Ontario (87), Manitoba (259), Saskatchewan (34, Alberta (31).
[This represents an increase of 37 West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools
since Mon 22 Sep 2003. In contrast to the data for other animals, the
greatest number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools was found in the
province of Manitoba (52.7 percent), whereas relatively few were found in
Saskatchewan (6.9 percent) and Alberta (6.3 percent). There have been no
extensions of range. - Mod.CP]
Wild Birds - cumulative data
----------------------------
As of Mon 30 Sep 2003, the following test results by province have been
reported:
Province/ No. submitted for testing/ No.tested/ No. confirmed positive /
Newfoundland and Labrador/ 69 / 64/ 0 /
Prince Edward Island/ 262 / 243 / 0 /
Nova Scotia/ 868 / 814 / 9 /
New Brunswick/ 844/ 780 / 6 /
Quebec/ 2472 / 2341 / 625 /
Ontario*/ 1680 / 1452 / 227 /
Manitoba/ 923 / 825 / 132 /
Saskatchewan/ 1196 / 956 / 157 /
Alberta/ 1500 / 1483 / 232 /
British Columbia/ 1887 / 1858 / 0/
Yukon/ 14 / 13/ 0 /
Northwest Territories/ 23/ 21 / 0 /
Nunavut/ 2/ 2 / 0 /
*Note that in the Ontario count; after the 4th confirmed positive bird, no
further testing is carried out and the birds are listed as presumed positive.
[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 11 740 birds submitted for
testing, 10 852 birds tested, and 1223 confirmed West Nile virus-positive.
In addition there were 3631 sightings of dead birds. This represents an
increase of 332 birds tested and 165 more birds confirmed West Nile
virus-positive; with most of the new virus-positive birds reported from the
central provinces of Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba). There has been no
extension of range. - Mod.CP]

Saskatchewan: West Nile Virus Infection Death Toll Now 6
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Saskatchewan reported on Tue 23 Sep 2003 that 3 more
deaths have been linked to the West Nile virus infection, bringing the
total number of deaths to 6.
The Cypress Health Region in southwestern Saskatchewan confirmed that a
woman in her 50s died in hospital Sunday from neurological complications
from the virus. "The complications related to West Nile virus infection
were what led to her death, although she had other underlying medical
conditions that contributed to the severity of her illness," said Dr.
Shauna Hudson, acting medical health officer for the Cypress Health Region.
West Nile virus has also been associated with 2 recent deaths in the Five
Hills (Moose Jaw area) Health Region this past week, said Hudson, who is
also the acting medical health officer for the region. On Friday a man in
his 70s died in hospital from complications associated with West Nile
neurological syndrome. The 2nd victim, a man in his 80s who was suffering
from West Nile fever, died in hospital Saturday from a respiratory
condition. West Nile virus was not the immediate cause of his death, but
was considered a contributing factor, Hudson said.
Earlier in September 2003, health officials reported West Nile was linked
to the deaths of 2 elderly men in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region and
another man in the Heartland (Rosetown area) Health Region. Dr. Eric Young,
Saskatchewan's deputy medical health officer, explained the number of
deaths in Saskatchewan is proportionate to the number of West Nile fever
and neurological syndrome cases being reported in the province. "You would
expect out of whatever number of cases any particular province or state has
of West Nile neurological syndrome a mortality rate of around 10
percent. So we have 43 cases of West Nile neurological syndrome -- 42
probable and one confirmed. So 6 out of 43 is about 14 percent, which is
just above 10 per cent, but because we are dealing with smaller numbers you
can get wider variations," Young said.
As of Tue 23 Sep 2003, the province was reporting a total of 509 probable
or confirmed human cases within the province. Of these, 164 cases have been
identified in the Five Hills Health Region.
Additional human cases are expected throughout the province as blood
samples taken in late August and early September 2003 continue to be tested
and reports are returned from physicians, Hudson said. "The risk of
infection with West Nile virus has declined dramatically since the
beginning of September, with the cooler weather resulting in lower numbers
of mosquitoes. However, people should continue to take preventative
measures -- use insect repellents, wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts,
and hats, especially on warm days," Hudson said.

[The 3 deaths in this press report of Wed 24 Sep 2003 are additional to the
most recent surveillance data compiled by Health Canada, as of Tue 30 Sep
2003 (see [1] above), possibly because the deaths could be attributed to
other ailments. - Mod.CP]
