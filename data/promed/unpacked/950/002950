Mystery of "vaccinated" chickens dying of bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
Chickens that are vaccinated against bird flu are supposed to be immune to
the disease. But hundreds of chickens at a poultry farm in southern Viet
Nam have died of avian influenza -- even though the farm owner had earlier
reported that the birds were vaccinated against the disease, an official
said yesterday [17 Jul 2008].

Since late last month [June 2008], several hundreds of the 3000 chickens in
the flock have died at the farm in Tan Lan commune in Long An province, 50
km [31 miles] west of Ho Chi Minh City.

Last week, they were tested positive for the H5N1 avian-influenza virus,
said Mr Dinh Van The, head of the province's Animal Health Department. The
farm owner reported to the department that all birds in the farm had been
vaccinated against bird flu, he said. "We suspect that he was not honest in
his report, or that the vaccine used at the farm was of bad quality," he
added. "We are investigating the case."

H5N1 affects mainly poultry and wild birds, but can infect humans who have
close contact with sick fowl. Scientists fear that, if it spreads
unchecked, the disease could mutate into a form that could be transmitted
between humans, leading to a worldwide epidemic.

Bird flu has killed 5 people in Viet Nam since the beginning of this year.

[Viet Nam has opted for vaccination of poultry (including waterfowl) since
2005, with quite satisfactory results. However, it is known that
vaccination cannot achieve disease eradication unless it is combined with
effectively applied, severe biosecurity measures.

The outcome of the investigations of the current event, in particular the
allegations that vaccinated birds have been clinically affected, is
anticipated with concern and great interest. Subscribers are referred to
David Swayne's review on poultry avian influenza vaccines in posting
20050307.0680.

The recent 15 outbreaks in Viet Nam have been reported to the OIE in
follow-up report No 20, submitted 14 Jul 2008. Out of a total of 14 216
animals, 6841 were clinically affected ("cases") of which 6081 died. All
remaining 8135 birds were destroyed. The report includes a map which
demonstrates the dissemination of the disease in 9 provinces, namely Son
La, Long An, Aghe An, Ha Tinh, Can Thio City, Quang Agai, Vinh Long, Tra
Vinh and Kien Giang. It also includes the following statement: "The event
is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted," and is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7188>.


In our posting 20080710.2106 of 10 Jul 2008, we referred to an OIE
follow-up report of 4 Apr 2008 addressing HPAI H5N1 in Viet Nam, which
included the statement that "the event is resolved. No more reports will be
submitted." It should be clarified that the said report related to another,
different epidemiological event in Viet Nam, namely an outbreak of HPAI
H5N1 in civets ("reason for notification: change in epidemiology: New
host"). The said event has indeed been resolved, while the epizootic in
poultry (including waterfowl), which started on 19 Dec 2006 (with 20
follow-up reports so far), is continuing.

We are grateful to Dr Karim Ben Jebara, head of the Information Department,
OIE, who kindly forwarded to us the said clarification. - Mod.AS]
