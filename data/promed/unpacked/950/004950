Abdoulaye Diabate, with the West African country's Research Institute for Science and Health, said the objective of Target Malaria is to develop a genetic control tool specifically applied to mosquitoes to be able to drastically reduce or eliminate the density of mosquitoes.â€¯The scientists are genetically modifying mosquitoes so their offspring will be only male, and any females they mate with after release will also produce just males. Since only female mosquitoes spread malaria, the disease should drop off quickly along with their population.

In the village of Bana, where the genetically modified mosquitoes were first tested in 2019, locals were initially worried about the experiment. A Bana village elder said that, at first, people thought the survey would release mosquitoes in the village that could cause more diseases. But since working with Target Malaria, they've come to understand exactly what the purpose is and now even help them with tasks like collecting the mosquitoes.

Genetically modified mosquitoes are just one malaria solution that has been tested in Burkina Faso. The country also pioneered pesticide-infused mosquito nets. Target Malaria said climate and environment play a large part in the country's cutting-edge malaria research.

The West African Organization for Coordination and Cooperation in the Control of Major Endemic Diseases was set up in the 1960s and headquartered in Burkina Faso. The institute's Diabate points out that its scientists are the third generation of malaria researchers. When you grow up in Burkina Faso's environment, malaria becomes part of your daily life, and it can make you think it's inevitable that you will have it, Diabate said. But he said that when he went to school, his mind opened up, and he soon realized what the source of the problem was. Thanks to researchers' hard work, said Diabate, Africa's deadly malaria problem is closer to being solved.

[Genetically modified mosquitoes promise control of vectorborne diseases without the use of insecticides. In the beginning of May 2021, engineered _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were released for the 1st time in the United States (Waltz E. First genetically modified mosquitoes released in the United States. Nature. 2021; 593: 175-176. doi: 10.1038/d41586-021-01186-60; https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01186-6.

Target Malaria, the Kenya Medical Research Institute, and the Pan African Mosquito Control Association co-organised a workshop with researchers and practitioners on this topic to question the model proposed by Target Malaria in its research so far that involved the release of genetically modified sterile male mosquitoes and how this could be adapted to future studies involving gene drive mosquito releases for them to offer reflections about potential best practices. The paper shares the outcomes of that workshop and highlights the remaining topics for discussion before a comprehensive model can be designed (Thizy D, et al. Proceedings of an expert workshop on community agreement for gene drive research in Africa -- Co-organised by KEMRI, PAMCA, and Target Malaria. Gates Open Res. 2021; 5: 19. doi: 10.12688/gatesopenres.13221.2. eCollection 2021; https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/5-19/v2).

The prize is high not least for malaria control in tropical Africa. Impregnated bed nets, in use for over 30 year, have probably done all they can, and there is always the risk of emergence of resistance to the artemisinins, the key drug used for treatment. - Mod.EP
