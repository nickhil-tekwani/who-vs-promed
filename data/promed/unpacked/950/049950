[In Pendang district], 4 people said to be suffering from a mysterious
illness are suspected of having contracted chikungunya [virus infection].
Kedah Health Department director Datuk Dr Hasnah Ismail said the victims
were from Kampung [village] Bendang Raja, Kampung Perupuk, Kampung Banggol,
and Kampung Charok Tok Min in the Pendang district. She said the viral
disease was suspected of also having infected several residents in the
Padang Terap and Kota Setar districts.

"Health teams had been sent to the affected villages to investigate the
reports received, with 4 people said to be suffering from a mysterious
illness suspected of contracting chikungunya," she said in a media
statement today [10 May 2009].

Chikungunya was first detected in Pokok Sena, Kedah in March this year
[2009] when more than 200 people were affected by the symptoms.

Dr Hasnah urged the public to cooperate in stamping the disease by ensuring
cleanliness of their surroundings and destroying all mosquito breeding
grounds, while the Health Department would carry out fogging. She advised
those having fever, joint aches, and rashes to immediately seek medical
treatment.

The previous ProMED-mail report of chikungunya virus infections in Malaysia
(ProMED archive no. 20090218.0676) indicated that there had been 109 cases
earlier in 2009, but did not specify where in Malaysia the cases had
occurred. This report (above) indicates that there have been 200 cases in
Pokok Sena, Kedah. It appears that chikungunya virus transmission is
continuing in northern peninsular Malaysia.

Songkhla province (tinh) is located in southern Thailand, adjoining the
Malaysia border. There have been recent cases of chikungunya virus
infection in Kedah state in northern Malaysia (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20081217.3963) adjoining the Thailand border, so it is not surprising that
there is an outbreak of chikungunya virus infection across the border in
Songkhla province. - CopyEd.MJ
