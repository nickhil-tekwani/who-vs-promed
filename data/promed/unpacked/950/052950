Surrey's North Ridge Elementary [School, Metro Vancouver, Canada] is hosting a mass immunization clinic on Monday, 16 Mar 2015, after several students and staff developed hepatitis A in recent weeks.

The Fraser Health Authority released a letter to parents, students and staff at the school, saying: "Because students and staff may have been exposed, we are recommending that all students and staff ... be aware and get testing if you have symptoms of hepatitis A [and receive] a hepatitis A vaccine from Public Health to prevent illness."

The school has about 350 students, but Fraser Health is not saying how many people are infected. They're asking anyone who hasn't had 2 doses of the vaccine in the past, or been infected with the virus, to get immunized. "It's mostly been within the students. Why we are vaccinating at this point in time is that it's spread beyond the cluster we began with," says Dr. Helena Swinkels with the Fraser Health Authority.

"Usually when we have a student with hepatitis A, we don't tend to immunize the school, but we know in this case it has been spreading a little bit, so we are proactively vaccinating everybody to make sure it doesn't go further."

Surrey School District spokesperson Doug Strachan says the school has been fully cleaned and they're deferring to Fraser Health on how to combat the spread of the virus. He says because of the nature of hepatitis A, there could some students spreading the virus who haven't developed symptoms yet.

"That's part of the issue. [Fraser Health] don't know and want to conduct this immunization to address that," he said. "They would prefer that everyone there be immunized as a precaution."

Though it's not believed the general public is at risk, Fraser Health is urging anyone who develops symptoms over the next 6 weeks to be tested.

The hepatitis A vaccine can prevent infection from the virus when given within 14 days of exposure. However, people who have had hepatitis A in the past, or previously received 2 doses of the vaccine, are protected and do not need further vaccination.

[The following is extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/A/aFAQ.htm#overview):

"Hepatitis A is usually spread when the hepatitis A virus is taken in by mouth from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the feces (or stool) of an infected person. A person can get hepatitis A through:

Person to person contact
- when an infected person does not wash his or her hands properly after going to the bathroom and touches other objects or food
- when a parent or caregiver does not properly wash his or her hands after changing diapers or cleaning up the stool of an infected person
- when someone has sex or sexual contact with an infected person (not limited to anal-oral contact)

Contaminated food or water
- Hepatitis A can be spread by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with the virus. (This can include frozen or undercooked food.) This is more likely to occur in countries where hepatitis A is common and in areas where there are poor sanitary conditions or poor personal hygiene. The food and drinks most likely to be contaminated are fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water. In the USA, chlorination of water kills hepatitis A virus that enters the water supply.

Who is at risk for hepatitis A?
Although anyone can get hepatitis A, in the USA, certain groups of people are at higher risk, such as those who:
- Travel to or live in countries where hepatitis A is common
- Are men who have sexual contact with other men
- Use illegal drugs, whether injected or not
- Have clotting-factor disorders, such as hemophilia
- Live with someone who has hepatitis A
- Have oral-anal sexual contact with someone who has hepatitis A."

The attack rate of students and staff in the school is not stated. Hepatitis A virus has an incubation period of approximately 28 days (range: 15-50 days). HAV replicates in the liver and is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2 weeks before to one week after the onset of clinical illness, and the peak virus titers in the stool are usually prior to the onset of illness. Person-to-person transmission does not generally occur in a school setting, and if a hepatitis A cluster does occur, it is likely related to contaminated food or water. Secondary cases from the students could then occur in the home.

An epidemiologic chart of the cases over time could indicate whether this was a point-source exposure in time or a continuing risk situation. Many cases of hepatitis A infection are totally subclinical (asymptomatic) or anicteric (nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort but no jaundice), so it would be quite interesting to perform hepatitis A IgM and IgG antibody screening on the cohort population. Finding detectable IgM anti-HAV antibody in someone who has not just been immunized implies recent or ongoing infection even with minimal or no elevations of liver aminotransferase enzymes in the blood (the enzyme rise occurs with hepatic cell damage). IgG anti-HAV alone suggest remote infection or immunization.

Universal immunization for HAV in childhood could have prevented this outbreak.

Surrey is a city in the province of British Columbia, Canada. It is a member municipality of Metro Vancouver, the governing body of the Greater Vancouver Regional District. It is the province's 2nd-largest city by population after the city of Vancouver.

[Why only students & staff? As Mod.LL says above "Secondary cases from the students could then occur in the home." What about immunizing families? - Mod.JW]
