Classical swine fever is suspected in an outbreak in the Turrucares
district of Alajuela Province, Costa Rica. Indirect immunofluorescence
testing of a tonsil smear done by the College of Veterinary Medicine was
positive for the virus. Other samples have been sent to the U.S. [Plum
Island? for confirmation.
Out of 2,400 pigs susceptible in the outbreak that probably began
mid-April, there have been 21 cases and 15 deaths. The last previous
outbreak of CSF was in October 1997.

Description of affected population: pigs of an imported breed. The affected
establishment is a high technology pig farm that complies with the rules on
biosecurity.

[While the suggestion that the CSF virus was imported is interesting, AND
PCR fingerprinting can confirm whether this virus is similar to those seen
currently in Europe or identical with the previous 1997 Costa Rican
outbreak, AND modern biosecurity can be excellent, it would be appreciated
if our informed Costa Rican members can keep us informed of the
investigations as they progress. This would increase the efficiency of
alerting neighbouring countries as to the risks, real or otherwise, posed
by this outbreak. - Mod.MHJ
