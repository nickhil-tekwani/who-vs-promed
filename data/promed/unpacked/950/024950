[Southern India is rife with anthrax. If treated in time, ruminants recover
well from this disease, which certainly results in more human preventative
success, and less bother and expense than treating humans directly.
Unfortunately, all anthrax outbreaks in livestock start with unexpected
deaths. - Mod.MHJ]
