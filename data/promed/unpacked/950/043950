Fungus attack on paddy fields is discolouring the crops in [Gaibandha district, Rangpur division], much to the worry of the farmers. Their fields have turned white in 2 weeks. The attack is spreading to adjoining fields, which will have an adverse affect on production.

"The ears turned white and there is no rice inside the husk," said a farmer. [An official said,] "Adverse weather affected cultivation and I am being informed about the attack by fungal disease from different areas every day. We have requested the agriculture department to take measures."

Experts advised farmers to spray pesticides and anti-fungal chemicals. Farmers were not prepared for the fungal attack, and the disease spread in some areas as timely action was not taken.

[A range of fungi have been reported previously to affect rice crops in Bangladesh and the region. The symptoms of bleached and empty ears described above may refer to several fungal diseases known to occur in the area, for example rice blast (_Pyricularia oryzae_) or sheath blight (_Thanatephorus cucumeris_; for more information on both diseases see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved will be needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies for the reported problems.
