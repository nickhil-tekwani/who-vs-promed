Toxic algae bloom blamed for massive fish kill
----------------------------------------------
Officials believe a toxic algal bloom was responsible for the deaths of up
to 20 000 grizzard shad last week at Lake Meredith. Charlie Munger, a
district supervisor for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, said
golden algae, a water-dwelling organism that can release a toxin fatal to
fish, is the likely reason behind the mass fish kill.

Munger said low water levels at Lake Meredith are likely to have increased
salinity and PH levels in the lake, where water levels are dwindling. That
chemical imbalance, along with cold temperatures, is likely to have been
enough to affect the algae's ability to survive and trigger its defense
mechanism -- releasing toxin to kill other organisms to provide nutrients.

The toxin damages the gills of fish but is not believed to be hazardous to
humans or other animals, the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal quoted officials as
saying.

While the fish kill prompted Lubbock officials to add powdered-activated
charcoal to that city's water supply to help prevent a possible fishy odor,
something they'll continue for the next 2-3 weeks, Plainview officials did
not have to consider treating water here since no Lake Meredith water was
being received at the time. Brian Gallaway, the city's well field and lab
technician, said this morning that Plainview cut off its Meredith supply 28
Dec 2010, a day or 2 before the fish die-off.

"We usually shut down at the end of the year anyway to do general
maintenance," Gallaway said, adding that when they do that the city
receives water exclusively from local wells. Gallaway isn't sure when
Plainview will begin receiving lake water again. "We're kind of waiting on
them," he said, adding, "Sometime this month they're not going to be
sending us lake water any more, just well water in Roberts County" as
officials work to restore the lake level.

In recent years Lake Meredith, a major source of water for Plainview,
Lubbock, Amarillo and other Panhandle-South Plains communities, has seen
some of its lowest water levels on record.

According to the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority, on Thursday the
lake was at a record-low level of 38.31 feet -- more than 60 feet below its
record depth of 101.85 feet set in April 1973.

[Golden algae are estuarine-based (saltwater-tolerant) organisms that are
very small (10 um long x 5 um wide). They are generally oval shaped with 2
cup-shaped golden plastids running the length of each side of the cell.

These tiny organisms, when in great number, can cause water to be
discolored, ranging from yellow to coppery brown. They may be present in
mud and cause problems with inland- or pond-raising of fish. Golden algae
do not seem to go away as does red tide.

Large concentrations of golden algae (blooms) can often be toxic to fish.
The toxins affect the gills of the fish, which are the breathing system,
thus limiting the fishes' ability to take in oxygen. Death is from
asphyxiation, just as it is with red tide. - Mod.TG
