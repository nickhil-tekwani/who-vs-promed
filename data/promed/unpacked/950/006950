In addition to the more than 20,000 cases of cholera reported since 1 July
in Kenya and Tanzania, with fatality rates of 13 and 5 per cent
respectively, the epidemic may have another worry.
Researchers from the African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF) reported
in a paper presented in Nairobi in August that cholera bacteria in
specimens provided AMREF show reduced sensitivity to chloramphenicol and
cotrimoxazole - the 2 drugs that succeeded tetracycline, which has now
become "totally ineffective". Sensitivity to the replacement antibiotics
fell from 85 (in 1994) to less than 10 per cent (1996). Because of this,
health officials fear higher fatality rates if the epidemic is not contained.
Health officials from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania met in Arusha the week of
27 Oct to start mapping out a coordinated approach to the epidemic.
Kenya's director of medical services Dr. James Mwanzia said that the
"epidemic ... required the combined effort of the three countries to
overcome at the regional level." In supplement to East African
governmental efforts, the International Red Cross, World Vision, the
Italian government and Medecins Sans Frontieres have been at work to
provide treatment and drugs.
