Planting expert warns of new palm disease
-----------------------------------------
An expert has warned that growing demand for
Moroccan date palms could expose the GCC [Gulf
Cooperation Council -- Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait,
Oman, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates] to
a disease that can decimate date palm
populations. Trends to import species of palms
from Morocco were increasing the likelihood of
the fusarium fungus disease coming into the
region. The fungus triggers bayoud disease, which
causes the leaves on one side of the palm to dry,
followed by the death of the tree. First
discovered around 100 years ago in Morocco, there
is no known treatment for the disease.

"[The fungus] has destroyed more than half of the
palm groves in Morocco and has spread easterly
through the trade of offshoots to Algeria and
reached the east of Africa," said Franck
Marionnet, general manager of palm nursery at
Wathba Marionnet. "There is nowadays a trend to
plant in the Gulf a variety from Morocco called
medjool, and it is risky to import offshoots."

Previously, the Gulf has been safe from the
fungus because the medjool has had limited appeal
for the local date market. However increasing
numbers are being imported commercially because
medjool dates are favoured for export to the more
lucrative European and US markets. [Bayoud
disease] could potentially destroy palm trees in
the Gulf region. According to Marionnet, palms
tend to be selected on the basis of cost, meaning
'safeÂ’' palms grown from tissue cultures are
rarely used.

[2] Maize smut - Yemen

Ministry issues warning on maize smut
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI)
has warned farmers about a fungus known as "maize
smut" and asked them to use seeds that do not
contain the fungus. The warning comes as the
maize cultivation season gets under way.

Mansour al-Aqel, director-general of the MAI's
agricultural information department, said maize
smut appeared in Yemen many years ago due to
farmers not selecting clean seeds. The fungus
only attacks maize. "The spread of the disease
depends on the farmers themselves," he told IRIN,
adding, "there are improved seeds that are
treated in a way that can fight the fungus."

Al-Aqel said if farmers do not select improved
and clean spikes, the losses caused by maize smut
could be big. "Losses differ from one farmer to
another. The lazy farmer would lose the most. On
some farms, losses could run to 60 percent. If
the fungus is left untreated, then it causes
higher losses," he said. According to al-Aqel,
when the maize crop is infected, black spores
replace the kernels, making the plants useless.

[Dates are an extremely important subsistence
crop in most of the desert regions. Bayoud
disease is one of the most serious diseases of
this crop in North Africa and has destroyed
around two thirds of date palms in Morocco over
the last century. It is caused by the fungus
_Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _albedinis_. Symptoms
include bleaching and subsequent drying off of
fronds, followed by death of the tree. The fungus
can survive for several years on plant debris or
in the ground. Bayoud kills many of the popular
older cultivars and has led to a major decline in
production wherever it is present. Disease
management relies on exclusion, phytosanitation,
and the use of new resistant cultivars, which are
being developed. Another strain of the pathogen,
_F. o._ f. sp. _canariensis_ causes a similar
disease in ornamental date species in the USA.
Related species such as _F. proliferatum_ in
Saudi Arabia and _F. moniliforme_ have been
reported to cause similar diseases.

Maize smut is caused by the fungus _Ustilago
maydis_. Tumour-like swellings are formed which
can appear on all growing parts of the plant. If
the collar is attacked plants may die, and smut
balls on cobs replace kernels. The yield of these
cobs is very low and they may be toxic to
livestock. The fungus survives in the soil and
crop debris, and spores are rain- and windborne.
The disease is favoured by hot, dry conditions.
Several disease cycles may occur in one crop
leading to severe epidemics. Disease management
includes cultural methods, phytosanitation, and
use of resistant cultivars. Seed treatment is not
considered effective because the pathogen is not
seed-borne. If over several seasons smut-infected
plants are removed from the fields before spores
are released, the amount of infection in an area
can be reduced.
