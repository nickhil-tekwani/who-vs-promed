Health officials say a resident of western Michigan has been infected with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE virus].

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Allegan County Health Department announced [Mon 17 Sep 2018] that the person was hospitalized in late August [2018].

Eastern equine encephalitis is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the US. It can be fatal and often leaves survivors with brain damage.

Southwestern Michigan has experienced outbreaks of the disease in people and horses in the past, with the most recent outbreaks occurring in the early 1980s, mid-1990s, and 2010. Health officials say it's the 1st human case reported in Michigan since 2016, when 3 people were infected.

Eastern equine encephalitis can cause neurologic illness in horses. Vaccination can protect horses from infection [but no commercial vaccine is available for human use. - Mod.TY]

[This has been an active year for transmission of EEE virus in the eastern USA. This is the 1st human EEE case reported in Michigan this year (2018), but interestingly, no equine cases have been reported in the state this year, although there was one in the neighboring state of Wisconsin.

Human EEE cases are very rare. Only a few cases are reported by CDC each year, occurring in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and very rarely in the Upper Midwest. Most cases of EEE virus infection in humans are inapparent or mild with only 4.5 per cent of cases severe. Severe cases occur most frequently in people under 15 and over 50 years of age. There is a 33% case fatality rate in severe cases and survivors often have brain damage. There is no commercially available human vaccine, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure. Further information is available from CDC at (https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/). - Mod.TY
