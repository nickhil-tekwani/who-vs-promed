It is the 1st time since mid-January that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 100 (1st report of more than 100 newly confirmed cases was on 22 Jan 2020; see Novel coronavirus (14): China (HU), Hong Kong, Macau ex China 20200122.6907971). In addition, 28 deaths were reported, all by Hubei province. Three new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

Of note is the increasing numbers of imported cases mentioned with 24 newly imported cases (17 in Gansu, 3 in Beijing, 3 in Shanghai and 1 in Guangdong), bringing the total number of imported cases to 60. It would be of interest to know where the importations were from.

[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 483 cases and 2 deaths.

Daegu province and Gyeongbuk provinces continue to have reported the highest number of cases, 5084 and 1049, respectively. Daegu is completely surrounded by Gyeongbuk province in the central eastern part of South Korea. Daegu has been the epicenter of this ongoing outbreak. While several provinces are at or approaching 100 cases (Gyeonggi: 130, Seoul 108, Busan 96, Chungnam 92b), the rate of growth in numbers of daily new cases appears to be at a much slower pace than that seen in Daegu and Gyeongbuk.

The data show that 72.8% of cases confirmed nationwide were associated with group gatherings.

[5] Selected media reports of interest
- USA cruise ship
Date: Fri 6 Mar 2020 05:19 PM CST

Nearly half of the people initially tested aboard a cruise ship being held in waters off San Francisco have been infected with coronavirus, Vice President Pence said on Friday [6 Mar 2020]. Results for 21 of the 46 people officials tested on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] came back positive, raising fears that the virus could be spreading widely among the more than 3500 people aboard the Grand Princess. Pence said those infected include 19 crew members and 2 passengers.

The vice president said authorities plan to bring the cruise ship to a "non-commercial port" over the weekend, where all passengers and crew will be tested for the disease and quarantined as necessary. The public health crisis on the ship echoed a similar one from last month [February 2020], when 700 people aboard another Princess Cruises ship, the Diamond Princess, became infected with coronavirus while the ship was quarantined for weeks off Yokohama harbor in Japan. US officials, however, made clear Friday [7 Mar 2020] they have no intention of keeping the Grand Princess at sea and in limbo for nearly that long.

Public health experts say cruise ships are particularly dangerous places during outbreaks because of the combination of close quarters and staff members without the needed training and resources. "This is probably the least ideal environment to try and quarantine and maintain proper infection prevention measures," said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist with Honor Health, a Phoenix hospital system.

The situation with the Grand Princess is particularly fraught because authorities are also racing to track down passengers who took an earlier voyage on the ship last month to Mexico. A 71 year old man from that trip later died in California from COVID-19.

The 3533 people aboard the Grand Princess -- 2422 guests and 1111 crew representing 54 nationalities -- learned of the test results and the government's plans for the ship only as Pence spoke from the White House. In a message to passengers, the ship's captain apologized for not breaking the news to them about the positive test results, saying that "we were not given advance notice of this announcement by the US federal government."

The captain said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were discussing individual results with the ship's doctor and that the California Department of Public Health had asked everyone to remain isolated in their rooms, according to a recording provided to The Washington Post. "This is an evolving situation, and we are doing our best to tell you what we know in a timely manner."

Coronavirus continued its march across the nation and the globe on Friday [6 Mar 2020], upending economies, stretching government resources, and alarming health officials.

At least a half-dozen additional states - including Pennsylvania, Kentucky, South Carolina, Hawaii, Oklahoma and Minnesota - announced suspected cases of the virus, meaning half of all states are now wrestling with the outbreak. New York's number doubled to 44. Nationally, 17 people have now died from COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, with Florida reporting 2 deaths on Friday [6 Mar 2020]. The total number of US cases has topped 300, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

Globally, coronavirus cases have now surpassed 100 000, with the trend showing few signs of slowing. Friday [6 Mar 2020] prayers were disrupted across the Middle East, as thousands of mosques were shuttered.

New cases also surfaced across Europe, and President Emmanuel Macron urged French citizens to stop visiting the elderly.

C. Update on what has been learned
Date: Fri 6 Mar 2020
Source: STAT News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/06/were-learning-a-lot-about-the-coronavirus-it-will-help-us-assess-risk


It has been 2 months since China announced a previously unknown virus had been identified as the cause of a new outbreak in the city of Wuhan. In the weeks since then, the coronavirus -- now called SARS-CoV2 -- has raced around the globe, igniting major outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Japan and now, it seems, Seattle. There are still many, many questions about this virus and the disease it causes, COVID-19. But in a matter of mere weeks, a number of features of the disease have come into focus, through extraordinarily rapid sharing of research.

"Eight weeks into COVID-19, there's quite a lot that we are learning," Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads the World Health Organization's emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said in a recent interview. (Zoonoses are diseases that jump to people from animals.) Kerkhove spoke to STAT after returning to the agency's headquarters in Geneva after 2 weeks in China, where she was part of an international mission to learn about China's response to its outbreak.

You can read the mission's report on WHO's site [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). But interviews with Kerkhove and others help illuminate some of the most interesting findings. Of note: For now, they pertain to the outbreak in China. Some may change as the virus spreads to locations that use different approaches to try to limit its spread.

- People are infectious really early in the course of their disease.
When the world saw a SARS outbreak in 2002-2003, one of the reasons it could be contained was because people were most infectious about 7 days after they started to be sick -- by which point they were generally already in isolation and their contacts were in quarantine. The same has been true in the case of some other related viruses. But Van Kerkhove said early studies on COVID-19 suggest people who have contracted the coronavirus are emitting, or "shedding," infectious viruses very early on -- in fact sometimes even before they develop symptoms.

"We do know from shedding studies that people can shed in the pre-symptomatic phase," Van Kerkhove said, adding that while the data are still preliminary "it seems that people shed more in the early phases rather than the late phases of disease." If people can infect others before they know they themselves are ill, it makes it much more difficult to break the chains of transmission. "If you are feeling a little bit unwell and you're in your early stage of disease, you're not necessarily in hospital. It takes a few days for you to develop more severe disease and you wouldn't necessarily seek health care. So it does make sense in terms of what we're seeing with the epidemiology" of the outbreak, Van Kerkhove said.

- People can shed virus for weeks after they have recovered. But that doesn't mean they are infectious.
There have been a number of studies that suggest COVID-19 patients may shed virus in stool or from their throats for some time after they've recovered. That naturally raises concerns about whether they are still infectious. It's too soon to draw that conclusion.

Testing for these viruses is based on what's known as PCR -- polymerase chain reaction. It's a process that looks for tiny snippets of the genetic code of the virus in sputum from a throat or nasal swab, or in stool. Finding that recovered patients are emitting virus fragments does not mean they are shedding whole viruses capable of infecting others. To determine if they are, scientists need to try to grow viruses from the sputum or stool of recovered COVID-19 patients, Van Kerkhove said.

The report from the WHO mission that traveled to China concluded that viable -- that is, potentially infectious -- virus has been isolated from stool in some cases, but it questions whether that means much for spread of a virus that attacks the respiratory tract. Those mainly spread by coughs and sneezes.

Van Kerkhove said researchers should follow recovered patients over time to map out whether and how long they remain infectious, testing them at intervals of seven days, 14 days, and 21 days to see if they can grow virus from their sputum.

- Truly asymptomatic COVID-19 infections are probably rare.
An early report on a cluster of cases in Germany caused a huge stir when the authors claimed a woman from China who was asymptomatic had infected several colleagues in Germany when she visited her company's headquarters there. It was later revealed the woman had had some symptoms while she was in Germany, but sloughed them off as jet lag. Despite that, the authors continue to describe her as having infected others before she became ill.

People infected with COVID-19 who are truly asymptomatic are rare, Van Kerkhove said. Studies in China estimate that about 1.2% of confirmed cases are asymptomatic. But Van Kerkhove said when the scientists on the WHO mission to China pressed for more detail, it became clear that most of the people who were 1st described as asymptomatic actually were pre-symptomatic -- they'd been detected through contact tracing before their symptoms manifested. "So, very, very few," she said. "And [asymptomatic cases are] definitely not a major driver of transmission."

- People probably aren't being re-infected after recovery.
There has been concern on social media about reports of people getting infected, recovering, and then later developing symptoms again. Some scientists from China have suggested the virus is able to re-infect people after a very short time. Van Kerkhove said this probably is not what is happening. In fact, it would be unusual if an immune system that had just fought off a viral invader would forget how to recognize it and fend it off within a period of days or a few weeks.

What is more likely, Van Kerkhove said is this: In order for hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be released after an infection they have to test negative for the virus twice, in tests conducted 24 hours apart. In some cases, people have had the 2 negative tests -- but then tested positive again later. Van Kerkhove said those results likely reflect more about the way the tests were conducted than about the status of the patient -- how a throat swab was taken, for instance. "I don't think that they're actually truly negative and then they get re-infected again. It's likely that they're still positive for some time."

- Transmission in China happened among family members and close contacts. True "community spread" was less common.
"This virus is not circulating in the community, even in the highest incidence areas across China," Van Kerkhove insisted. What's the difference between spread among close contacts and community spread, you might wonder? Van Kerkhove said the data the mission saw in China pointed to the virus finding its way into households and transmitting there. One family member gets infected and infects others. The "secondary attack rate" -- the percentage of people in a household who got infected after someone brought the virus into the home -- was between 3% and 10%.

Van Kerkhove said true community spread involves transmission where people get infected in a movie theater, on the subway, or walking down the street. There's no way to trace back the source of infection because there's no connection between the infected person and the person he or she infects. That's not what the Chinese data show, she said.

Marc Lipsitch, an infectious diseases epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, found this claim puzzling. "I have reached out to the World Health Organization to understand the basis of some of those statements. My perception is that there is significant community transmission, especially when you aren't aware that someone is sick, because there's not enough testing," he said.

- China's COVID-19 outbreak isn't driven by spread in hospitals.
The SARS outbreak mainly occurred in hospitals. Sick people who weren't recognized as cases infected other patients nearby or the health workers looking after them. Large hospital outbreaks have also been a feature of MERS infections. With this new disease, more than 2000 health workers have become ill. But Van Kerkhove said it seems like most of them were infected at home -- something she acknowledged came as a surprise.

"Given our experience with SARS and MERS, I was expecting that there would be large hospital outbreaks," she said. "But even among the health care worker infections that have been reported to date, when they went back and did interviews with them and then looked at exposures, it's likely that most of those exposures were in the community rather than in health care facilities." That pattern may not hold. With global supplies stretched thin of N-95 respirators and other equipment needed to protect health workers, there is a real risk of shortages that could put the front line workers at risk, WHO has warned.

- China's COVID-19 outbreak isn't driven by spread in schools.
Children and teens make up a smaller proportion of China's cases than adults do, accounting for just 2.1% of nearly 45 000 cases reported in a study from the China CDC. The WHO report said that in China, about 2.5% of children and teens who became infected developed severe disease and 0.2% developed critical disease. None of the infected children 9 and younger died; only one teenager succumbed to infection.

South Korea, which is grappling with an explosive outbreak, has likewise seen small numbers of infections in children and teens and no deaths in those age groups. Of 6284 cases, only 0.7% were under the age of nine; 4.6% were ages 10 to 19. A bigger chunk of the total cases, 29.9%, were ages 20 to 29. Even in that age group, South Korea reported no deaths. "Even when we looked at households, we did not find a single example of a child bringing the infection into the household and transmitting to the parents. It was the other way around," Van Kerkhove said. "And the children tending to have mild disease."

If that pattern holds true elsewhere, it would question the value of closing schools to slow spread. But that could happen regardless, if teachers fall ill or families are worried about letting their children attend school.

- The big unknown: How deadly is this outbreak?
In order to calculate a case fatality ratio -- CFR in epidemiology speak -- you need to know how many people have been infected and how many have died. The assumption before the WHO-led team went to China was that there were probably mild cases that hadn't come to light. In the report, the team indicated it couldn't find much evidence of undetected cases. But the only way the world will know for sure is when researchers start testing the blood of people who were not confirmed cases in places where the virus has circulated.

If they find antibodies to the virus in the blood of people who never made the case list, that will change the math. This week WHO said the case fatality ratio currently looks like 3.4% -- which is not a reassuring number. Researchers have been working feverishly to develop the tests needed to do this kind of research. China has recently licensed a couple of serology tests and Singaporean researchers have developed one as well. More will come on board soon.

Any country or location that has cases should be conducting this type of research, Van Kerkhove said. "These types of studies should be conducted now," she said. "This is one of the major things that needs to be done now. And everywhere. Not just in China. In the US, in Italy, in Iran -- that would give us a better understanding of where this virus is and if we're truly missing a large number of cases," she said. "Until we have population based serosurveys, we really don't truly know."

[A very interesting read, addressing many points that have been queried. The Chinese have been collecting a wealth of data on the course of this outbreak in China and have been sharing the data with the scientific community.

Serosurveys should be a priority now that there is serologic testing available (see Mod.AS's comment about the recent papers out of China on serologic studies (COVID-19 update (30): China (Hong Kong) dog, susp, serology pending 20200306.7057595). Until these are done we are just speculating about the denominator of number of actual infections, the calculations of proportion of individuals with severe disease, and the case fatality ratio. In addition, the true rate of infection among children would be helpful to address whether school closures are effective. - Mod.MPP

[6] WHO situation report 46 (as of 6 Mar 2020*)
Date: Fri 6 Mar 2020

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CET.

Highlights
----------
- Four countries/territories/areas (Bhutan, Cameroon, Serbia, and South Africa) have reported their 1st cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, comparisons have been drawn to influenza. WHO has provided a Q&A regarding the similarities and differences between the 2 diseases. Please see the Situation in Focus below for more information.

Subject in focus: Q&A: Similarities and differences -- COVID-19 and influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve, comparisons have been drawn to influenza. Both cause respiratory disease, yet there are important differences between the 2 viruses and how they spread. This has important implications for the public health measures that can be implemented to respond to each virus.

Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?
Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.

Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection.

Q. How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?
The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the 2 viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.

Further, transmission in the 1st 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission -transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms - is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.

The reproductive number -- the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual -- is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.

Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicate that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected by adults, rather than vice versa.

While the range of symptoms for the 2 viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection.

Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.

Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care.

Q. What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?
While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19. In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection.

*The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

****"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 88. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 42 countries (including 1 territory) from the European region, 6 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 10 countries (including 2 territories) from the Americas region, and 5 countries from the African region. 39 countries are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Philippines, New Zealand, Ecuador, Ireland, and the Czech Republic newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission was also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 17 481 including 335 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
