West Nile Virus: Possible Role of Peridomestic Birds in Transmission?
--------------------------------------------------
I was wondering if anyone was evaluating the influence of
peridomestic bird populations, their influence as a West Nile virus
(WNV) reservoir, and their influence on the transmission risk to
humans. Most information concerning birds and WNV focuses on the
Corvids, which provide an end-point indicator for WNV activity. I do
not see Corvid species as the reservoir species for WNV; instead I am
interested in the numerous species which may become viremic, but
asymptomatic, as the principal reservoir. The main species I am
interested in (/concerned about) are sparrows (mixed species),
starlings, and pigeons. These species exhibit particular behaviors in
urban situations that "may" provide WNV amplification /transmission
in discrete foci (or at least the reason why foci appear).
All 3 birds tend to use communal night roosts that could provide a
concentrated population for mosquitoes (vectors) to target. From
these night roosts, birds will disperse (in groups) to areas where
food is prevalent, particularly toward residential areas where there
is an abundance of: garbage, insects associated with the landscape,
and (most important) bird feeders. During early morning foraging,
they will be targets for mosquito feeding around these sites,
allowing mosquitoes in residential areas to become infected with WNV.
(Or perhaps the reverse - birds pick up the virus during foraging
runs, making mosquito activity around night roosts a principal method
of amplification).
Based on these assumptions, I am making additional recommendations
(to municipalities I am working with) to reduce the risk of
amplification /spread to residential areas (or at least to gain
information).
1. Reduce the attractiveness of areas to gregarious bird species
(particularly sparrows): people should consider removing bird feeders
or changing feeders and food to attract less gregarious species.
2. Identifiable sites of night roosts should have additional adult
mosquito monitoring. In future years, communal night roosts may be a
sensitive site for detecting WNV activity, particularly when (if) we
start to see a degradation in the sensitivity of dead Corvid
surveillance.
Other activities may be considered pending the development of
information on these bird species and WNV transmission.
A. If justified by monitoring, local (small-scale) area adulticiding
around large night roosts may provide a focused method for damaging
WNV amplification, earlier in the season.
B. Perhaps a more aggressive strategy should be considered for
reducing/dispersing starling and sparrow activity in urban areas.
I am interested in hearing from anyone who may have additional information.
