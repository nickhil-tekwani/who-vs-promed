Dengue fever cases in Singapore near record level
-------------------------------------------------
Singapore has seen cases of dengue fever, a sometimes fatal disease carried
by mosquitoes, rising sharply to near-record levels this year, and efforts
are being stepped up to stop it, a senior official said. The wealthy
city-state has sent out teams of volunteers to scour housing estates and
parks to eliminate breeding sites in a project dubbed "mozzie attack."
Dengue fever, carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, has become a major
international public health concern, with the World Health Organization
issuing an alert on 2 Sep 2004 due to a resurgence of cases in the region,
noting outbreaks in Bhutan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka.
"There is a global upsurge in dengue cases this year [2004]," Yaacob
Ibrahim, minister for the environment and water resources, told parliament
on Tuesday, referring to WHO findings. "We are still unable to determine if
the situation has stabilized," he said. Dengue fever strikes the island
hardest during the warmer months of July to September, the minister said.
Singapore, with a population of just over 4 million, had suffered 5248
dengue cases by 18 Sep 2004 -- a 48 per cent rise over the same period in
2003, and almost equal to the highest number of dengue fever cases ever
recorded in the island republic, 5258 in 1998 [with the transmission season
not over yet. - Mod.JW].
3 people have died from the disease this year [2004]. Dengue fever killed 6
people last year [2003], when the number of cases hit a 5 year high of 4772.

New strain of dengue virus in Bangladesh
----------------------------------------
When Mahbuba Chowdhury got fever for a day, her microbiologist daughter did
not think it a cause for worry. But 70 year old Chowdhury went into shock
and died 2 days later, exhibiting typical signs of a new and deadly form of
the dengue virus that is claiming lives in the country.
Doctors warn that the virus, suspected by some to be genetically mutated,
may have either evolved or been imported into the country, Xinhua reports
quoting the New Age daily Saturday. Experts say an already known "Type 4"
dengue virus or a new form of the virus may be responsible, but it is not
possible to confirm without proper virus detection facilities.
The country's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research is
not fully equipped, they say. The virus is very difficult to diagnose, as
patients do not complain of bone-breaking pain or pain around eyeballs, the
typical symptoms of dengue fever. The flu-like symptoms have made diagnosis
more difficult. Though the degree of fever is low, accompanying
complications like haemorrhage and shock remain the same, say experts.
Patients also show signs of very low platelet count, typical of the disease.
FM Siddiqui, professor of medicine at the Dhaka Medical College, says many
dengue patients have concurrently been afflicted with diarrhoea in 2004.
"Diarrhoea and other symptoms the dengue patients displayed are unusual. A
new strain of dengue virus may have developed," he says.
[First of all, we need some lab results to show that this outbreak is, in
fact, due to a dengue virus. Arbovirus fevers are notoriously difficult to
diagnose on clinical grounds alone, and the proportion of cases with pain
in the joints or eyes, or with diarrhea, is highly variable from one dengue
outbreak to another. Speculation about dengue type 4 or a new mutant is
pointless until lab tests for dengue have been carried out. They are not
difficult -- if Bangladesh would like to send me a few frozen acute sera
from these patients, I can run real-time PCR tests on them and have the
results in under 2 hours. - Mod.JW]

[3] USA (Illinois) ex Haiti: fatal

A 24 year old woman died on Tuesday at Loyola Medical Center in Chicago,
where she was flown after developing flu-like symptoms about 3 weeks ago
that were later diagnosed as dengue fever. Fever and other symptoms usually
vanish on their own in about 10 days, but she developed a rare form of the
disease that caused internal bleeding and left her in a coma, said her
mother, a pharmacist who introduced her daughter to Haiti during a medical
mission in 1998.
The victim went back to Haiti last year [2003] for a college internship
while completing her master's degree in sustainable international
development at Brandeis University in Boston, her mother said. After
graduating, she returned last spring [2004] to help an organization of
rural workers set up a clinic that recently opened in central Haiti, where
the nearest doctor had been a 6 hour bus trip away.
[Fatal DHF is usually, but not always, the result of a 2nd attack with a
different type of dengue. In 1994-1996, 185 strains of dengue (DEN) virus
types 1, 2, and 4 were recovered from febrile United States and other
United Nations military personnel in Haiti (Halstead, et al. 2001, Haiti:
absence of dengue hemorrhagic fever despite hyperendemic dengue virus
transmission. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2001; 65(3): 180-3). Perhaps the woman who
died in Chicago had the misfortune to contract a mild case in 2003 which
complicated a severe infection with a different type in 2004. - Mod.JW]
