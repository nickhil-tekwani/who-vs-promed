Central Kalimantan reports 858 rabies cases in 2011
---------------------------------------------------
Central Kalimantan has been hit by at least 858 cases (in dogs?) of
rabies so far this year [2011], an official says, adding that public
participation is needed to control the disease.

"Until October this year, at least 858 rabies cases have been reported
with one (human?) resulting in death. Our laboratory has also
confirmed 31 dogs with rabies this year," Central Kalimantan deputy
governor Achmad Diran said on Tuesday [15 Oct 2011] during the opening
of a regional meeting on bird flu and rabies. Last year, 1118 cases
were reported with one death.

Achmad said that a case was reported [1st ?] in the province in 1978,
and it was alleged to have come from East Kalimantan [see: Rabies,
canine - Indonesia (Kalimantan) 19980415.0695].

Agriculture Ministry animal health division director Fuziatmoko, who
also attended the meeting, said all provinces in Kalimantan were prone
to the disease. "We need to work out the best strategy for how to curb
the problem with local wisdom to avoid unnecessary problems in the
future," he said. Fuziatmoko added that the government aimed to make
Indonesia rabies-free by 2020.

[Kalimantan refers to the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo,
whereas in Indonesian, the term "Kalimantan" refers to the whole
island of Borneo. The Indonesian territory makes up 73 percent of the
island by area, and 69.5 percent by population. The non-Indonesian
parts of Borneo are of Brunei (400 000) and East Malaysia (5 625 000).
The region within Indonesia is also known as Indonesian Borneo. A map
is available at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalimantan.

The text of this press report is slightly ambiguous, but it appears
that there has been a decline in the overall number of cases of canine
rabies virus infection in Central Kalimantan province. - Mod.CP]
