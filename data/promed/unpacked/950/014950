Solano stated that they are now awaiting results [of tests] on blood samples from the patients; the National Institutes of Health (INS) will confirm or [rule out] [Zika virus infections].

For now, the Secretariat of Health indicated that the people are receiving [medical] attention and management for the symptoms caused by the disease.

In parallel, the District Health Secretariat is carrying out preventive work days in certain localities in the city to inform citizens how to eradicate breeding sites in their homes of the mosquito that causes [transmits] Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses.

[The number of suspected cases of Zika virus infection in Barranquilla has increased from 3 to 10 in the past week. It would be interesting to learn whether the tentative diagnosis of Zika virus infection is laboratory confirmed. Zika virus infections have become increasingly widespread in Colombia in a relatively brief period of time. A 28 Oct 2015 ProMED-mail (ProMED-mail archive no. 20151030.3756619) post indicated that the Colombian National Institute of Health confirmed the presence of Zika virus in the departments of Bolivar, Cordoba, Norte de Santander, San Andres and Sucre.
