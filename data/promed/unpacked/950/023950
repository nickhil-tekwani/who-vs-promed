The Departmental Health Services (SEDES) of Santa Cruz yesterday morning [23 Dec 2015] confirmed the deaths of 2 people due to [a] hantavirus [infection], one reported in the San Julian municipality and the other in the Minero population. The SEDES director, Joaquin Monasterio, reported the cases in Santa Cruz department, indicating that the fatal disease has not occurred since 2013, so the affected area is declared under a health alert.

During the current year [2015], 10 cases have been registered and 2 deaths confirmed due to this disease. Last year [2014], 9 cases were reported in Santa Cruz department, although during that period there were no fatal cases.

The victim from San Julian was a boy who died after he was taken to a medical center and his condition did not improve. The deceased was [self-medicating], taking household medicines for more than a week. The deceased person in Minero was a man involved in hunting activities. One of his companions also presented with symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection] and is currently hospitalized.

Hantavirus [causes] a disease transmitted by rodents, mainly field mice (long-tailed), and causes hemorrhagic fever or pulmonary fever [hantavirus cardio-pulmonary disease].

These cases occur mostly in abandoned sites in tropical areas such as Santa Cruz and Chapare [region in Cochabamba department], in the case of Bolivia. SEDES carried out a campaign to eliminate rodents using biological rodenticides in San Julian and nearby areas. Health experts and authorities recommend that houses be maintained in clean condition and that areas under cultivation be under observation constantly. Also, they suggest using cats to drive away and eliminate the mice.
