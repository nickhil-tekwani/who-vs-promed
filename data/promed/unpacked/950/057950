UK Government Defends Smallpox Vaccine Decision
-----------------------------------------------
The UK Government has defended its choice of smallpox vaccine, dismissing
claims it bought the wrong type. A report by US researchers has cast doubts
over how effective the UK supplies would be in the event of a smallpox
attack by terrorists. [UK] Health ministers decided in April [2002] to
purchase enough vaccine to protect up to 20 million Britons from smallpox in
the event of a terrorist attack. The contract was awarded to Powderject
Pharmaceuticals, controversially without a public competition. That decision
was widely criticised after it emerged that Powderject chief executive Paul
Drayson had donated GBP 50 000 to the Labour Party just weeks before.
But now a report by the Potomac Institute in the US suggests ministers may
have opted for the wrong type of vaccine. There are a number of different
types of vaccines, and all were used by the World Health Organisation to
eradicate smallpox around the world by 1979. The UK government has opted for
the so-called Lister strain vaccine. This has been used extensively in the
UK since the 1950s. However, authorities in the US have decided to stockpile
another type of smallpox vaccine. Their version, developed by the New York
[State] Health Department, has been shown to be effective in fighting
smallpox in India. Authorities believe that if terrorists were to launch a
smallpox attack, they would use a similar strain of the disease. As a
result, the US researchers suggested the UK had bought the wrong type of
vaccine.
Steve Prior, a senior scientist at the Potomac Institute, told The Times
newspaper that there was no evidence to back up the government's decision,
describing it as indefensible. But a Department of Health spokeswoman said:
"The decision to purchase Lister strain was based on expert scientific and
medical advice available to the Department of Health, including the Ministry
of Defence, with whom we are collaborating." She added: "Lister strain is
also the strain chosen by our European partners." Professor John Oxford of
Queen Mary's School of Medicine said there was no evidence to suggest one
vaccine was better than another.

[Criticsm of the choice of vaccine by the UK Government, the political
dimension apart, is misguided. The Potomac Institute position seems to be
that strains of smallpox [variola] virus of enhanced virulence are likely to
be chosen by potential bioterrorists and that the vaccine should be matched
to such strains. This argument overlooks the fact that all vaccine strains
are derived from vaccinia virus, a different virus which does not itself
produce smallpox disease but does induce cross-protective immunity to
variola virus infection. Different strains of vaccinia virus are employed in
the production of vaccine, and though these may differ in terms of
antigenicity and inherent safety, all will provide an effective protective
response. The virulence of variola virus and the immunogenicity of vaccinia
virus are independent variables. - Mod.CP]
