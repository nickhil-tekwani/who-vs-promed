On 8 Mar 2010, a restart of the Q fever programme has been made in
the Netherlands with vaccinating the 1st goat farm in Sellingen. All
the nearly 900 animals on the organic farm were vaccinated for the
1st time. Up until now, there was not enough vaccine available.

Earlier than expected, animals in the Netherlands can now be
vaccinated against Q-fever. Already, many animals were vaccinated
last year [2009], but there was not enough vaccine available to
protect all the goats and sheep.

France has now delivered 200 000 doses of vaccine, and during March
2010, another 200 000 doses will be delivered. In total, the
Netherlands will use 1.5 million vaccine [doses] to protect all dairy
goats and sheep this year [2010].

Many farmers are anxiously waiting for an adaptation of the very
strict rules, which were introduced last year [2009]. Especially, the
farms that are free of Q fever want their animals vaccinated as soon
as possible.

[According to the official Dutch policy, milk producing plants and
breeding farms of goats and sheep must accomplish their 2010
vaccination prior to 1 Jun 2010, since those sheep and goats must be
vaccinated before being served (becoming pregnant). Those animals
which cannot be vaccinated before 1 Jun 2010 since they are younger
than the minimal vaccination age (3 months), should be vaccinated
before 1 Jan 2011. - Mod.AS]
