1st BSE case in Sweden
---------------------------
Sweden has recently detected its 1st case of BSE. The 12-year-old
beef cow of mixed Charolais breed was born on a farm of 50 cattle in
Sweden. She was in late pregnancy, had shown difficulties in rising
for approximately 2 weeks, did not respond to treatment, and was
euthanized and sent to destruction to a rendering plant.
Brain stem sampling was done in accordance with the EU legislation
for BSE testing. The sample was positive in the rapid/screening test
(Biorad TeSeE ELISA) with an OD value of 2,42 in the 1st testing,
2,76 and 2,88 in the 2nd testing of the same preparation and of 3,22
in the 3rd testing from a new brain homogenate (cut-off value for all
the runs was 0,22). The confirmatory testing, conducted at SVA
(National Veterinary Institute of Sweden), were Western
immunoblotting (TeSeE Western Blot, Biorad) and immunohistochemistry
employing F89/160.1.5 antibodies; both tests were positive. In the
immunohistochemistry, 11 pieces of brain stem were analyzed; all of
them showed diffuse granular positive immunostaining of the grey
matter, including the BSE target brain areas. All TSE testing,
including all the screening testing for Sweden, is conducted at SVA
and is quality-certified.
Since this was the 1st case in Sweden, material was sent for
confirmation to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL), the
Veterinary Laboratory Agency (VLA) in UK. The CRL confirmed the
positive BSE diagnosis based on western immunoblotting and on the
recognition of positive staining and vacuolation on a target nucleus
in the SVA immunostained sections.
In the Scientific Report of the European Food Safety Authority on the
Assessment of the Geographical BSE-Risk (GBR) in Sweden adopted in
July 2004, it is stated that the GBR of Sweden is II, i.e. it is
unlikely but cannot be excluded that domestic cattle are (clinically
or pre-clinically) infected with the BSE-agent.
The current BSE-surveillance in Sweden involves testing of all fallen
stock and all emergency slaughtered cattle above 24 months of age as
well as a yearly random sample of 10 000 cattle above 30 months of
age at normal slaughter. Between 2001 and 2005, more than 170 000
cattle were tested; out of these, 46 700 were normal slaughter and
125 000 were fallen stock and emergency slaughter. All tested
negative.
An epidemiological investigation on the possible source of infection
is currently underway. Sweden has followed the European Union's
legislation on feed banning. Since January 2001, there is a total ban
on the use of mammalian protein in feed to food animals in order to
avoid any possible cross contamination of the cattle feed at the feed
mills.

[Prof. Gavier-Widen and her colleagues are gratefully acknowledged
for this firsthand comprehensive report. The results of the
investigation into the origin of infection are anticipated with great
interest.
EFSA Scientific Report on the Assessment of the Geographical BSE-Risk
(GBR) of Sweden was updated on 8 Sep 2004 (see the full document at
<http://www.efsa.eu.int/science/tse_assessments/gbr_assessments/572_en.html>).
It is likely to be changed now from II to III.
The 4 GBR levels, pertaining to the "Presence of one or more cattle
clinically or pre-clinically infected with BSE agent in geographical
region/country," are:
Level I: Highly unlikely.
Level II: Unlikely but not excluded.
Level III: Likely but not confirmed or confirmed, at a lower level.
Level IV: Confirmed, at a higher level.
For the listed countries and their respective GBR's, see [3] in
posting 20040824.2361. - Mod.AS]
