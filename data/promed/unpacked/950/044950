This morning [Mon 9 Jan 2017] veterinarians assisted by firefighters have started the cooling of bird flu infected breeding poultry in Lazne Tousen near Prague. Over the weekend, tests have confirmed that Pomeranian geese died of the dangerous H5N8 virus. Last week, outbreaks were recorded on enclosed farms in Moravia. Several thousand chickens, geese, ducks and turkeys from small and large private farms have already been culled. The exact numbers of birds to be culled cannot be estimated yet.

[2] UK, update, prevention and control

Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset has seen about 80 birds die so far this winter, compared to a norm of 30 or 40. In most cases the cause of death is not known but 9 have tested positive for the H5N8 strain of bird flu.

Official figures show this is the highest number of birds tested positive for avian influenza in the UK so far this winter [2016-2017].

In a report for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the International Disease Monitoring Team warned: "Environmental contamination will remain as a significant hazard, especially if wild waterfowl or gulls have regular access to the site, or contaminate the local area around the houses. So personal biosecurity is key to helping prevent contamination from being brought into a poultry house."

How many cases have there been?
-------------------------------
So far, since the last 2 weeks of December 2016 there have been 10 official cases involving 29 birds testing positive. At the end of December [2016] there were cases in Carmarthenshire, Leicestershire and Somerset involving one wigeon each. A wigeon is a type of dabbling duck. The Leicestershire and Somerset cases were the 1st involving wild birds in England.

Wild birds can carry the disease around the country and infect others. A total of 5 wigeons were found to have died of bird flu in Lincolnshire in the last week of 2016. A further case involving a "small backyard flock" near Settle in North Yorkshire saw 17 birds affected, "several" of which had died from the disease.

Defra has set up a 3 km (1.9 mi) prevention zone and 10 km (6.2 mi) surveillance zone around affected sites, which is in force until 28 Feb 2017.

What is a prevention zone?
--------------------------
Chickens and other birds, whether kept for poultry, eggs or as pets, need to be kept from coming into contact with wild birds. The government's chief veterinary officer Prof Nigel Gibbens said this means bringing birds into a "suitable building" if possible. If they are brought inside into bird houses, they will still be classed as free range as the prevention zone means they can be housed for up to 12 weeks.

Other measures include making sure that feed and water cannot be accessed by wild birds, cleaning and disinfecting housing and equipment, vehicles and footwear.

Is there a risk to food?
------------------------
The UK government says the risks to public health are "very low and avian flu does not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers."

What is the cause of this strain of bird flu?
---------------------------------------------
We do not know.

According to the government's International Disease Monitoring Team: "The origin of this virus and the involvement of wild birds are not yet understood."

However, experts say finding bird flu in wild birds in Great Britain is "not surprising" given reports coming from across European countries including France, Germany, Poland, Sweden, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Cases have also been reported in Austria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, Ukraine and the Russian Federation since 3 Nov 2016.

What if I find a dead bird?
---------------------------
Anyone finding dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, can call the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77.

[3] Ukraine, backyard poultry

The State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Rights Protection of Ukraine recorded avian influenza cases in private households in Chernivtsi and Odessa regions.

The main department of the authority said that over 1000 hens and geese in private households died. The avian influenza virus was confirmed.

When monitoring private households in Chortoryia settlement of Chernivtsi region due to the death of wild swans in January, 3 hens also died. Testing samples also proved a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak.

Measures are being taken to localize the disease on the site of the outbreak and prevent the spread of bird flu virus.

[Croatia submitted to the OIE an immediate notification on its 1st HPAI H5N8 outbreak on 4 Jan 2017, involving a backyard farm on the Hungarian border. The notification, distributed by the OIE today (9 Jan 2017), is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22198 (see 20170101.4736233).

Romania has submitted to the OIE a follow-up report (No 5) today (9 Jan 2017), notifying 2 new outbreaks on its south-east; one in 3 whooper swans found dead on the Fortuna lake in the Danube Delta; the other one in a backyard farm in Tulcea including hens, turkeys and ducks. See, with map, at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22166.

Iran has submitted to the OIE a follow-up report (No 4) today (9 Jan 2017), notifying 5 new outbreaks spread throughout its north-western provinces, of which 4 in backyard holdings and one on a commercial farm. To reduce at risk poultry population, 1 862 150 birds at farms in a 3 km (1.9 mi) radius around the affected farms or villages have reportedly been slaughtered after confirming to be negative for HPAI.

A new, updated appraisal of the HPAI H5N8 situation ("Outbreak Assessment No 8") by UK's Veterinary & Science Policy Advice Team, published on Fri 6 Jan 2017, is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/581998/hpai-europe-update8.pdf.
