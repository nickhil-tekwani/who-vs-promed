Nearly 300 people sick from outbreak of shigellosis
----------------------------------------------
Nearly 300 people have gotten sick in rural Douglas County after an
outbreak of shigellosis, an illness that bears flu-like symptoms.
Community Health Services Director Dawnelle Marshall says at least
280 people attending a spiritual retreat center near the tiny
community of Umpqua reported becoming ill. 9 people were
hospitalized, and 18 of the cases have been confirmed as being caused
by the bacterium.
Marshall says most of the cases have been treated with antibiotics
with good results. The exact source of the outbreak is under
investigation.
Shigellosis is a bacterial infection acquired by consuming food or
water that is contaminated with human feces, or from direct exposure
to human waste.

[This posting is separate from the weekly Cholera, Diarrhea &
Dysentery posting because of the size of the cluster. There have
been intentional contaminations of food with _Shigella sp._ in the
past. ProMED awaits further information about this outbreak. -
