Further information to Trichinellosis - Belgium: ex Spain, wild boar meat
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the request for information we send you the following update.

Up till now we have knowledge of 14 patients who got ill after the consumption of wild boar meat in 3 different Belgian restaurants at the beginning of November 2014.

Seven patients demonstrated IgG antibodies. The National Reference Laboratory (NRL) at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, examined muscle biopsy samples from 3 patients by the digestion method. Samples, weighing between 0.24 and 0.30 g contained 0, 10 and 28 first stage _Trichinella_ larvae. Multiplex PCR performed on single larvae from 2 patients revealed a genetic profile compatible with _Trichinella spiralis_.

The wild boar meat from the 3 restaurants originated from a Spanish supplier in Girona.

The Belgian Federal Agency for the Security of the Food Chain (FASFC) has recalled the wild boar meat from all restaurants that purchased it from the Spanish supplier. Fresh and frozen meat, vacuum packed, of which some bags had already been opened, collected from 2 provinces in Flanders (Limburg and West-Flanders) were sent to the NRL for analysis. The NRL is currently examining all samples from different batches with the magnetic stirrer artificial digestion method (Commission Regulation No. 2075/2005 of the European Union). So far, all tested samples were negative. The remaining samples will have been examined by the end of the week.

Each individual carcass from pig, wild boar and horse is systematically examined for _Trichinella_ infection in all EU member states, according to the Commission Regulations. Belgium is among the 2 EU member states that has obtained the negligible risk status for _Trichinella_. Occurrence of _Trichinella_ infection in wildlife in Belgium is very rare and intensity of infection is low (Schynts et al. Vet Parasitol. 135, 191-194).

[ProMED thanks Dr Marjan Van Esbroeck for providing this important additional information. It would be interesting to have a comment from the Spanish food safety authorities. Either the meat inspection failed to find the infection in the meat or the wild boar was not submitted for the mandatory examination for _Trichinella_. - Mod.EP
