West Nile virus detected in 2 crows in Michigan
-----------------------------------------------
Michigan Department of Community Health director, James K Haveman jr, and
Michigan Department of Agriculture director, Dan Wyant, today announced
that West Nile virus has been detected in a crow found in Oakland county
and in another crow found in Macomb county.
Public health surveillance for the virus has detected no cases of West Nile
virus in humans in Michigan. "Michigan has had an aggressive surveillance
system in place for West Nile virus since this mosquito-carried virus was
first identified in North America in 1999," said Haveman. "Using a
pro-active approach to identify any presence of West Nile virus has allowed
us to take immediate steps to help safeguard the health of the citizens of
Michigan." "Now that the virus has been detected in these crows, we will
begin increased mosquito and dead crow surveillance in Oakland and Macomb
counties," said Wyant. "By increasing surveillance efforts in the area
where the diseased crows were identified, we will be able to determine if
mosquitoes in these counties are carrying the virus and if other wild bird
populations are infected."
The crows were found dead and sent by local health departments to the
Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory at Michigan State University for
testing. When this initial testing warranted advanced study, they were sent
to the Michigan Department of Community Health laboratory and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention laboratory in Ft Collins, Colorado.
These independent test results confirm the presence of the West Nile virus.
