MALARIA - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC (02)
*********************************
[see: Malaria - Dominican Republic: RFI 970707112025]

From: "Dr. Pedro Luis
Castellanos"

Regarding a message on ProMED-mail on a supposed increase in the number of
cases of Malaria in the Dominican Republic.
According to information from Malaria National Program, the number of cases
up to June 28 (epidemiological week # 26) has been 429, & 59.2% of them
were foreigners (migrants or residents). 636 cases, 1015 cases and 741
cases respectively were reported in the same periods of 1996, 1995 and
1994. Therefore, the number of cases in 1997 has been lower than previous
years.
This situation cannot be explained by failure of the surveillance system. A
total of 213,206 blood samples has been taken from suspected (fever) cases
in these 26 weeks.
The surveillance system is based on an active search for cases in persons
with fever in every one of the more than 600 rural clinics and more than 50
hospitals and health
centers countrywide.
Nevertheless, Malaria National Program asks me to say that they will be
glad to have any information that could be useful to improve the active
surveillance of rumours. They would like to have more information on areas
where this supposed outbreak of malaria is being reported.
If you would like to have more information, please let me know.
