A case [see comment] of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been confirmed in commercial poultry near Pokesdown, Bournemouth. Temporary Control Zones of 3 km (4.8 miles) and 10 km (6.2 miles) have been put in force around an area centred on Castlemain Avenue. This is the first outbreak in the south west during the resurgence of the disease that began in October [2021].

Bird flu has been confirmed in captive birds and commercial and non-commercial poultry in Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Essex, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Cumbria, Cheshire and Norfolk. An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) was declared across the whole of the country on [3 Nov 2021] to mitigate the risk of the disease spreading. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers in the UK to follow strict biosecurity measures.

Keepers with more than 500 birds will need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites, workers will need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles will need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

Backyard owners with smaller numbers of poultry including chickens, ducks and geese must also take steps to limit the risk of the disease spreading to their animals.

Avian influenza circulates naturally in wild birds and when they migrate to the UK from mainland Europe over the winter they can spread the disease to poultry and other captive birds. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said that avian influenza is primarily a disease of birds and the risk to the general public's health is very low.

[The glossary of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code includes the following definitions:
- "case" means "an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs";
- "outbreak" means "the occurrence of one or more cases in an epidemiological unit";
- "epidemiological unit" means a group of animals with the same likelihood of exposure to a pathogenic agent. In certain circumstances, the epidemiological unit may be a single animal"; and
- "animal" means a mammal, reptile, bird or bee.

The applied term "case" (and not "outbreak"), in reference to the event reported from Pokesdown and in other HPAI H5N1 events, is in need of clarification.

According to the updated (25 Nov 2021) avian influenza report published by UK's government agencies DEFRA & APH (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/avian-influenza-bird-flu#cases-in-the-uk), the recent confirmed events are the following.

In view of the concerning spread of HPAI H5N1 across Great Britain, the chief veterinary officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreed to bring in new measures to help protect poultry and captive birds. The national housing measures, applicable to all birds, whether they are part of a commercial or backyard flock, will come into force across the UK from 00:01 on Mon 29 Nov 2021. - Mod.AS
