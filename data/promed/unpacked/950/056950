FACTS ABOUT SALMONELLA AGONA IN GRAIN PRODUCTS
ST. PAUL, Minn. -- The American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) is
offering these facts about the bacterium _Salmonella agona_, recently
detected for the first time in a dry cereal grain product.
What is _Salmonella agona_?
_Salmonella agona_ is one of the more than 2,000 species of the bacterial
foodborne organism _Salmonella_, which has a widespread occurrence in
animals, especially poultry and swine. People infected with _Salmonella_
strains generally experience diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12 to 72
hours following consumption of suspect food. Most cases usually resolve in
5-7 days and do not require antibiotic treatment. According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, agona is an uncommon serotype (strain)
of _Salmonella_ which accounts for approximately 1.5% of human isolates
reported to the Public Health Laboratory Information System (PHLIS). The
first reported U.S. outbreak of Salmonella agona was traced to animal feed
made with infected imported fishmeal in 1972. This serotype, which rarely
causes infections in humans, is capable of infecting the same foods that
other Salmonella serotypes commonly do, such as meat, eggs, fish and
poultry. _Salmonella agona_ organisms maintained in a suitably dry
environment can remain viable for extended periods. When rehydrated in the
right conditions, these organisms can grow, multiply and potentially cause
infection.
Can _Salmonella agona_ survive typical food processing?
_Salmonella agona_ is heat sensitive and, in most cases, is readily
destroyed by ordinary heating and pasteurizing procedures provided the
organism is in a moist environment. However, all forms of salmonellae can
be relatively heat resistant when in dry form.
What steps is the industry taking to insure product safety?
Understanding the ways by which infection occurs is a key strategy of
prevention. Good manufacturing practices, and quality assurance programs,
are essential to preventing microbiological risks. However, in the case of
an outbreak, new techniques coordinated by the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) such as DNA "fingerprinting" on foodborne bacteria and rapid
identification through electronic laboratory-based reporting are making it
possible to quickly trace the specific cause of infectious outbreaks.
Cooperative efforts with the CDC and identification of the chain of events
that precede outbreaks is part of industry's focus to insure product safety.
AACC's 1998 Annual Meeting in Minneapolis, Minn., September 13-17, will be
featuring the symposium A New Look at Food Safety. If you have further
questions on _Salmonella agona_, contact aacc@scisoc.org.
