[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno State)

A cholera epidemic has killed no fewer than 26 people in Biu local
government area of Borno State as health workers and authorities battle to
halt its spread to other parts of the state.
The medical organization, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without
Borders), which is currently engaged in providing medical assistance and
drugs to victims of the disease, said the cholera epidemic was caused by
poor sanitation, poor toilet systems, and unclean water.
Daily Trust learnt that the disease started in Marama town of Biu local
government and a number of Fulani settlements close to Biu town before it
spread to Biu town itself. Reports indicate that Galtimari village and the
Biu Senior Science Secondary School are some of the worst-hit areas, with
several casualties as a result of the cholera epidemic.
Doctors Without Borders said they have suggested to Biu local government
authorities that primary and secondary schools in the area be temporarily
closed to halt the spread of the disease. A cholera treatment and
rehabilitation camp has since been set up in Biu town to provide treatment
and drugs to victims, with the charity saying that so far, 327 cases were
reported and admitted, while others whose condition was not serious were
given treatment but not admitted.
Medecins sans Frontieres regretted that many people suffering from the
disease had tried to avoid treatment at the camp because of fasting,
despite encouragement from religious leaders that the sick could seek
medical treatment even during Ramadan.

A cholera outbreak in Nigeria's northern State of Borno has claimed 12 more
lives from among 250 new cases, the local press reported Sat, 22 Oct
2005. The epidemic of the water-borne disease had spread from the state
capital, Maiduguri, to Biu, some 185 km to the south, where the deaths were
reported. The victims were said to be mainly children and students of the
Government Secondary School in Biu who reportedly drank contaminated water
drawn from hand-dug wells.
Health Commissioner Asabe Vilita Bashir was quoted as saying measures had
been taken by the ministry to contain the outbreak. She said half of the
dead were children below the age of 15, adding that 158 patients had been
treated and discharged from the Biu General Hospital.
The Commissioner advised local communities and the affected secondary
school community to always boil their drinking water, warning that water
from hand-dug wells was not safe for drinking. According to her, the Biu
fatalities brought to 32 the death toll from cholera in the state in 2005,
noting that in July 2005 more than 500 patients were treated for the
disease in Umrari, Jajeri and Gwange neighborhoods of the Maiduguri metropolis.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Bauchi State)

3 people have been confirmed dead and several others are critically ill at
the Bayara General Hospital following the outbreak of cholera in Bayara, a
suburb in Bauchi Local Government in the state capital. The sickness,
characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, has affected the community due to
lack of potable water in the area. Rain water is the major source of water
despite the proximity to the state capital.
The source of drinking water is a stream which usually dries up during the
dry season.
