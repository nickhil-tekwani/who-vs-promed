A 4.5 months old, previously healthy Danish girl was admitted to a
pediatric department after 6 days of passive behavior and weak suck.
Over the next days she became increasingly weak, developed bilateral
ptosis, the muscle stretch reflexes were lost, and mydriasis with
slow pupillary responses was noted. Botulism was suspected and
confirmed by testing of patient serum in a bioassay. The condition of
the patient improved following administration of botulism antiserum.

The clinical picture was suggestive of intestinal (infant) botulism.
However, botulism acquired from consumption of food with preformed
neurotoxin could not be excluded. The food history revealed
consumption of a commercially produced banana/peach puree which was
suspected as a possible source, and based on a precautionary
principle this product was recalled. The case description illustrates
a risk-management dilemma between suspected foodborne versus
intestinal botulism. Taking the potentially very serious consequences
of foodborne botulism into consideration, the measures taken were justified.

Background
----------
There are 3 forms of botulism:
1) Intestinal botulism: formerly infant botulism; i.e., intestinal
germination of spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ with subsequent in
vivo production and release of neurotoxin. It is also [rarely]
described in adults;
2) Foodborne botulism: usually seen in adults, caused by ingestion
of food contaminated with _C. botulinum_ bacteria which have grown
and produced neurotoxin; and
3) Wound botulism: wound infection with _C. botulinum_ and
subsequent release of neurotoxin.

Intestinal botulism has been verified in more than 1000 cases in
North America over the last decades, but is rarely reported in Europe
(1,2). We report a recent case of botulism in a Danish infant; the
report illustrates a risk-management dilemma between suspected
foodborne versus intestinal botulism.

Clinical picture
----------------
The patient was a 4.5 months old, previously healthy girl. She was
admitted to a pediatric department after 6 days of constipation,
passive behaviour and weak suck. She was without fever and did not
vomit, but was hypotonic with a weak cry. A plain X-ray of the
abdomen revealed signs of paralytic ileus. She was treated
symptomatically with intravenous fluids and enteric tube feeding, and
screened over the next days for a number of suspected diagnoses
(colonic enema for possible intussusception, screening for drug
intoxication, metabolic diseases, encephalitis and other infections,
cerebral abnormalities, increased intracranial pressure) without any
abnormalities detected.

Her suck and cry became increasingly weak, she developed bilateral
ptosis, the muscle stretch reflexes were lost, and mydriasis with
slow pupillary responses was noted. Respiration was not affected and
neither respiratory support nor supplementary oxygen were needed.

8 days after admission intestinal (infant) botulism was suspected and
blood was drawn for inoculation of serum in a mouse bioassay for
detection of neurotoxin of _C. botulinum_ and fecal samples were
taken for possible detection of _C. botulinum_ by culture. 2 days
later botulism immune globulin was administered. 14 days after
admission she was found to have improved significantly with
decreasing ptosis and increasing muscular tonus, cry, and oral food intake.

Toxin testing
-------------
The presence of toxin was demonstrated by applying patient serum
intraperitonally in a mouse model; presence of botulism toxin was
suspected within 18 hours. Indicative symptoms in the mice; i.e.,
wasp-like waist, spiky hair and inactivity could be neutralised by
adding _C. botulinum_ antitoxin to types A, B, E and F to the serum
prior to the intraperitoneal injection. Serum yielded no growth of
bacteria, and fecal specimens did not exhibit growth of _C. botulinum_.

Food history and source investigation
-------------------------------------
The infant was still breastfed but had started to receive
supplementary feeding during the last 3-4 weeks prior to admission. 5
days before admission the infant was fed with 3 spoonfuls of an
organic banana/peach puree from a European commercial company. The
mother had noticed that the baby food had a very pervading and
unusual smell, and the product appeared to be fermented. However, no
gas production was noticed from the glass jar and the normal click
occurred when opening it. The glass jar was thrown out afterwards.

Other supplementary foods consumed by the infant included gruel made
by the mother from organic produced corn, buckwheat flour, whole meal
with rice and millet to which grapeseed oil was added.

Based on a precautionary principle, a press release was issued
warning about the specific batch of banana/peach puree and the lot
(which was marked "best before December 2008") was recalled by the
company. Warnings were issued through the Rapid Alert System for Food
and Feed (RASFF) and the European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS).

In total, 11 jars of baby food, 4 samples of the gruel ingredients
and a sample of oil have been investigated for botulinum toxin using
a mouse model. No preformed botulinum toxin was detected in these
samples. Currently the samples are being investigated for botulinum
toxin production after spore germination, as well as detection of
botulinum toxin after trypsin activation of the samples.

Conclusion
----------
The clinical picture in combination with the positive toxin testing
confirms the case as botulism in an infant. However, it remains
unsettled if it is a case of intestinal (infant) botulism or
foodborne botulism. The clinical picture is compatible with infant
botulism, and we tend to think this is the most probable diagnosis.
However, stool samples have not shown growth of _C. botulinum_. Many
cases of intestinal botulism in infants are traditionally ascribed to
honey exposure, but there was no such history of exposure.
Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the child could have picked up
spores from other environmental or food sources. Foodborne botulism
cannot be completely ruled out, in particular because the mother
described the baby food as foul smelling and fermented and,
furthermore, high toxin contents have been detected in products which
have looked and smelled acceptable. Taking the potentially very
serious consequences into consideration the press statement and the
warning of other countries was justified. Additional cases have not occurred.

[The decision to recall the baby food given the discussion above,
even without "smoking" baby food containing toxin, seems quite
reasonable. A map showing the location of Norway and Denmark is available at
