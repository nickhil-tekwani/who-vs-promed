The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit says confirmed human cases of West Nile virus reported have jumped.

It says they have gone from one in 2014, to 20 last year [2017]. Mosquito pools that tested positive rose from just one in 2014 to 29 in 2017.

This year's West Nile virus (WNV) program is being launched on [Tue 22 May 2018]. The program includes larviciding catch basins, standing water sites, and lagoons to disrupt mosquito breeding. The campaign also educates residents on self-protection, conducts adult mosquito surveillance, and investigates human cases.

The health unit urges people to use insect repellents containing DEET, Icaridin, or other approved ingredients on clothing as well as exposed skin, wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and a hat when outdoors. Light-coloured clothing is best as mosquitoes tend to be attracted to dark colours.

The public is also asked to make sure that door and window screens fit securely and are free of holes, and remove any hazards that could become a reservoir for standing water, such as old tires, upturned wheelbarrows, animal dishes, and unused flower pots.

"West Nile virus is a potentially serious illness that is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Each year, we have to prepare and assume that mosquitoes are carrying the West Nile virus," says Dr. Wajid Ahmed, acting medical officer of health. "By taking simple precautions, residents can reduce the risk of being bitten by mosquitoes.

[Because there was a resurgence of human cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection last year (2017), Ontario health authorities anticipate that this year [2018] may have several cases as well. WNV cases in humans and equine animals occur annually across southern parts of provinces in Canada from Quebec to British Columbia, including Ontario. The launch of the mosquito control program early in the transmission season is prudent, as are public education efforts to avoid mosquito bites. Although no mention is made of immunization of equine animals, that would be a wise measure as well, and local veterinary practitioners are doubtless advising owners to vaccinate their animals.

Windsor-Essex county is located on the southeastern tip of Ontario province, and had a population of about 182 000 people in 2016.
