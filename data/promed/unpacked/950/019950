Haldimand seeing outbreak of distemper in raccoons
--------------------------------------------------
With the mild winter and early signs of spring, the migration of birds has begun, but the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Welland SPCA want Haldimand residents to be aware of other types of wildlife, specifically raccoons.

John Greer, Executive Director for the Welland and District SPCA, said he wants residents to educate themselves for the safety of the wildlife and domestic pets.

"Raccoon distemper is very much like a canine distemper and is a very hard disease to see. It attacks the central nervous system," explained Greer.

"We are not sure why, and we've been in touch with Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR), but Haldimand has been reporting many more animals in comparison to the Niagara Region. There seems to be an outbreak in the area."

Distemper does not transmit to humans like the ringworm virus found in a raccoon feces does, but Greer offers some advice to identify sick animals.

"At night, raccoons get a green film over their eyes. This is their night vision," he said. "If you shine a small light in their eyes during the day, you can see the green film over their eyes which indicates they may be sick.

"They get very slow, then as the disease progresses, it attacks the right side of their brain and will eventually cause them to walk in circles. They become lethargic and wander in circles, which is what we look for when we go to pick up a reported animal."

There is no cause for concern for domestic animals as long as they are up to date on their vaccines, Greer said.

"The only danger posed to domestic animals is if they come in direct contact with wildlife, like getting into a fight," said Greer, who advises that pet owners look over their animals for bite marks or wounds if they have been outside unattended.

"We have a wildlife rehabilitator who specializes in distemper, but because they are sick animals and not injured, it's an MNR issue more than an SPCA issue."

He said the MNR tries to treat outbreaks using monitored feed plots containing vaccines and that he is considering advocating the ministry to bring some vaccines to Haldimand.

Greer admits some residents who report animals should know the responsibilities of the SPCA under MNR regulations. "Under the ministry rules, if we pick them [wildlife] up and we don't have to euthanize, we use our rehabilitator and then they must be re-released within a one kilometer radius of where they were picked up when healthy in order to prevent the spreading of disease in the environment," explained Greer, who warns that not all raccoons are sick if awake during the day.

"With our winter and mild weather, the animals are out of whack so the whole season is thrown out," he said, adding the SPCA has already seen baby raccoons this year [2012]. "You want to look if the animal is sick or not, and if they are scurrying looking for food, it might be for their babies."

[Canine distemper virus is probably the pathogen that has the greatest impact on wild carnivore populations at the domestic-wildlife interface. Epidemic events originating in domestic dogs have been well studied and documented in several wild carnivore species. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date.
