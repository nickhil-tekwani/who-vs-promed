[re: ProMED-mail Foodborne illness - South Korea: (NJ) fast food restaurant burger, poss EHEC, RFI 20170905.5296852]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is confirmed that there was a foodborne illness outbreak attributed to consumption of hamburger at a fast food restaurant in Jeonju, Korea on 25 Aug 2017. The suspected pathogen is not norovirus but _E. coli_. There has been no report of norovirus related outbreak or cases in the past few months in Korea.
