The FDA wrote about botulism
(<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01670.html>) that "the
disease has only been seen occasionally in dogs and has not been
reported in cats.
In fact a fatal such toxicosis has been reported in cats:

cats probably caused by Clostridium botulinum type C toxin. World
Congress on Animal, Plant and Microbial Toxins, Adelaide, Australia, 2003.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Shlosberg for pointing out the misstatement in the
FDA report and indeed neurotoxin type C botulism has been reported in
cats. The citations refer to botulism that developed in a group of 8
"backyard" cats that were feed meat from a dead pelican that was
thought to have been accidentally electrocuted by a high-tension wire.
In this discussion part of the paper, the authors (including Dr.
Shlosberg) state (with citation numbers changed to be consecutive and
reformatted) that:
"The occurrence of botulism in carnivores is very rare. Several
reports of type C botulism in dogs (1), including one following
carrion consumption (2), and lions (3) have been published. To the
best of our knowledge, however, there are no reports of natural
botulism in cats, although these animals have been used as
experimental models (4). Interestingly, the cats were found to be
much more susceptible to parenteral exposure to botulism toxin than
to oral exposure (5). Attempts to elucidate the mechanism upon which
this difference in susceptibility is based using toxin neutralization
by natural antibodies, tissues, and digestive enzymes were unsuccessful (5).

Inst. Pasteur 1955;89: 354-57."
Indeed, it appears to be the case that this Israeli cat cluster was
the first natural cases of botulism in cats seen while alive.
However, Galey and colleagues reported in 2000 that a cluster of type
C botulism in dairy cattle was due ingestion of a rotten bale of oat
hay that (in retrospect!) contained a dead cat. Testing of the cat
carcass did find the neurotoxin. Of note, the toxin was not found in
the cow's milk.
