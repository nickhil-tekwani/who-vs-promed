[1] India situation
Date: 24 Apr 20201

Overwhelmed hospitals in India begged for oxygen supplies on Sat 24 Apr 2021 as the country's coronavirus infections soared again overnight in a "tsunami" of disease, setting a new world record for cases for the 3rd consecutive day.

Max Healthcare, which runs a network of hospitals in north India, tweeted that it had less than 2 hours of oxygen left, while Fortis Healthcare, another big chain, said it was suspending new admissions in Delhi.

"We are running on backup, waiting for supplies since morning," Fortis said.

India is in the grip of a rampaging 2nd wave of the pandemic, hitting a rate of one COVID-19 death in just under every 4 minutes in Delhi as the capital's health system buckles.

The government has deployed military planes and trains to get oxygen to Delhi from the far corners of the country and overseas, including Singapore.

The number of cases across the country of around 1.3 billion rose overnight by 346 786, the Health Ministry said, for a total of 16.6 million cases, including 189 544 deaths.

COVID-19 deaths rose by 2624 over the past 24 hours, the highest daily rate for the country so far. Crematoriums across Delhi said they were full up and asked grieving families to wait.

Hospitals in Delhi have gone to the city's high court this week seeking it to order the state and federal governments to make emergency arrangements for medical supplies, mainly oxygen.

"It's a tsunami. How are we trying to build capacity?" the Delhi high court asked the state and federal governments in response to this plea.

Television showed families tending to the sick in hospital corridors and streets as they waited for medical attention.

One man identified as A. who was grieving for his brother at Delhi's Jaipur Golden hospital said he had seen families running around with oxygen cylinders trying to get them refilled.

"You can't leave me in the lurch," a lawyer appearing for the Jaipur Golden hospital told the high court on Sat 24 Apr 2021, seeking its intervention.

The court asked the government to ensure supplies, as well to make security arrangements for medical centres amid people's desperation.

"We know how people react; let's not have a law and order situation," the court said in its direction to the authorities.

India surpassed the U.S. record of 297 430 single-day infections anywhere in the world on Thu 22 Apr 2021, making it the global epicentre of a pandemic that is waning in many other countries.

The federal government had declared it had beaten back the coronavirus in February 2021. Health experts said India became complacent in the winter when new cases were running at about 10 000 a day and seemed to be under control. Authorities lifted restrictions, allowing for the resumption of big gatherings.

Others said that it could also be a more dangerous variant of the virus coursing through India. It is the world's 2nd most populous country, and people live in close proximity, often 6 to a room.

"While complacency in adhering to masks and physical distancing might have played a role, it seems increasingly likely that this 2nd wave has been fueled by a much more virulent strain," wrote Vikram Patel, Professor of Global Health at Harvard Medical School, in the Indian Express.

Experts say the only way India can turn the tide is to ramp up vaccinations and impose strict lockdowns in the so-called red zones of high infection. It has opened up the immunisation programme to all adults but faces a shortage.

India is currently using the AstraZeneca (AZN.L) shot and homegrown Covaxin. It has also approved Russia's Sputnik V and has urged Pfizer (PFE.N), Moderna (MRNA.O), and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N) to provide it with vaccines.

[The situation in India appears dire, with severe shortages of healthcare capacity, including hospital beds, intensive care, and oxygen. While the daily total numbers of reported cases constitute the highest numbers seen for a single country, the incidence on a population basis of both cases and deaths has not exceeded that seen in the US or other countries during their earlier surges.

Widespread transmission in India (as anywhere) will quickly lead to the emergence of variants, which will spread globally. The variant widely reported in India has, for example, now been reported in Toronto. The B.1.617 variant seen throughout India is sometimes referred to as the "double mutant," containing spike mutations E484Q along with L452R (https://www.cp24.com/news/public-health-ontario-reports-36-cases-of-covid-19-variant-first-identified-in-india-1.5400292). - Mod.LM]

Cerebral venous thrombosis: a retrospective cohort study of 513 284 confirmed COVID-19 cases and a comparison with 489 871 people receiving a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Maxime Taquet, Masud Husain, John R Geddes, Sierra Luciano, Paul J Harrison*
*Corresponding author

Abstract
"Using an electronic health records network, we estimated the absolute incidence of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) in the 2 weeks following COVID-19 diagnosis (N=513 284), or influenza (N=172 742), or receipt of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines (N=489 871).

The incidence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) was also assessed in these groups, as well as the baseline CVT incidence over a 2-week period. The incidence of CVT after COVID-19 diagnosis was 39.0 per million people (95% CI, 25.2-60.2). This was higher than the CVT incidence after influenza (0.0 per million people, 95% CI 0.0-22.2, adjusted RR=6.73, P=.003) or after receiving BNT162b2 or mRNA1273 vaccine (4.1 per million people, 95% CI 1.1-14.9, adjusted RR=6.36, P less than .001).

The relative risks were similar if a broader definition of CVT was used.

For PVT, the incidence was 436.4 per million people (382.9-497.4) after COVID-19, 98.4 (61.4-157.6) after influenza, and 44.9 (29.7-68.0) after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273.

The incidence of CVT following COVID-19 was higher than the incidence observed across the entire health records network (0.41 per million people over any 2-week period).

Laboratory test results, available in a subset of the COVID-19 patients, provide preliminary evidence suggestive of raised D-dimer, lowered fibrinogen, and an increased rate of thrombocytopenia in the CVT and PVT groups. Mortality was 20% and 18.8%, respectively. These data show that the incidence of CVT is significantly increased after COVID-19, and greater than that observed with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines. The risk of CVT following COVID-19 is also higher than the latest estimate from the European Medicines Agency for the incidence associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (5.0 per million people, 95% CI 4.3 -5.8).

Although requiring replication and corroboration, the present data highlight the risk of serious thrombotic events in COVID-19 and can help contextualize the risks and benefits of vaccination in this regard.

[This study used a large electronic health record system to assess risk of central venous sinus thrombosis (CVST or CVT) in the UK. As has been noted previously, the rate of thrombotic events following infection with SARS-CoV2 is far higher than that following vaccination with either of the available mRNA vaccines and also much higher than that associated with the AstraZeneca adenovirus-vectored vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson (Jannsen) vaccine appears to have a similar rate of CVT (or CVST) as the AZ vaccine. - Mod.LM]

[3] Vaccine breakthrough
Date: 21 Apr 2021
Source: Medpages Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19vaccine/92204?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Weekly%20Review%202021-04-25&utm_term=NL_DHE_Weekly_Active


Real-world risks of developing COVID-19 infection and illness after full vaccination are coming into focus as more reports come in with hard numbers. Just on Wed 21 Apr 2021, 3 such publications appeared:

- In the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, health officials described 22 "breakthrough" infections diagnosed among nearly 15 000 Chicago-area nursing home residents and staff 2 weeks or more after they received a 2nd mRNA COVID vaccine dose.
- At one Kentucky nursing home, 22 out of 127 residents and staff developed infections at least 2 weeks after their 2nd mRNA vaccine dose, with virus sequencing indicating an unusual variant was responsible, according to a separate MMWR report.
- And among 417 employees and students at Rockefeller University in New York City receiving 2 mRNA vaccine doses, researchers identified 2 breakthrough infections, notable mainly for the particular virus strains involved, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Collectively, these reports provide more assurance that the phase III trial results with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines did not exaggerate their effectiveness and that breakthrough infections remain rare. They're more common, however, among older individuals, and the vaccines do not offer complete protection against serious illness or death.

The Kentucky and Rockefeller University reports also suggest that virus variants may escape vaccine-induced immunity to some extent.

Chicago-Area Investigation
---
Beginning in February 2021, officials in Chicago began a concerted effort to identify breakthrough cases in vaccinated nursing home residents and staff after one such infection was detected, in part to quell any outbreaks that could result because of such facilities' high-risk nature. Area nursing homes had been advised to test all residents at least monthly; staff were initially tested twice a week until early February 2021 and then weekly for most of the subsequent investigation period, which ended on 31 Mar 2021.

In all, 627 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were detected in 75 nursing homes, 447 of which were in residents and staff who had not been vaccinated at all. Another 145 were in individuals who had received only one dose, and 13 involved individuals who hadn't completed 2 weeks from their 2nd shot.

Among the 22 with definite breakthrough infections, 12 were in residents and 10 in staff. 14 cases were asymptomatic, 4 required hospitalization, and one proved fatal. The resident who died also had a bacterial bloodstream infection as well as a urinary tract infection, plus multiple chronic conditions known to increase risk for severe COVID-19.

The investigators, led by Richard Teran, PhD, of the CDC, did not attempt to estimate vaccine efficacy from these data.

Officials noted a burst of infections at the unidentified skilled nursing facility after a vaccination program was completed on 21 Feb 2021. At that time, 90% of the facility's 83 residents and just over half of the 116 staff members had received 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Residents had been routinely monitored for symptoms, and staff were tested twice weekly.

On 1 Mar 2021, the 1st case of what became an outbreak was detected in an unvaccinated staff member via antigen testing. Over the next several weeks, 18 residents and 4 additional staff members were found to be infected, all more than 2 weeks after their last vaccine dose. 12 of the cases among residents were asymptomatic; 2 involved hospital admission, and one resident died. Two staff members developing breakthrough infections developed symptoms that did not require hospitalization.

Investigators led by the CDC's Alyson M. Cavanaugh, DPT, PhD, sequenced virus isolates from 27 cases at the facility and determined that these were an unusual strain known as R.1. This variant "is not currently identified as a CDC variant of concern," the group wrote, but nevertheless it includes mutations such as E484K found in others known to be either more transmissible or more likely to produce serious illness than the original Wuhan strain.

Cavanaugh and colleagues did estimate vaccine efficacy for various outcomes at the nursing home:
- 66.2% for infection (including asymptomatic) in residents (95% CI 40.5%-80.8%)
- 86.5% for symptomatic COVID in residents (95% CI 65.6%-94.7%)
- 94.4% for hospitalization in residents (95% CI 73.9%-98.8%)
- 75.9% for infection in staff (95% CI 32.5%-91.4%)
- 87.1% for symptomatic COVID in staff (95% CI 46.4%-96.9%).

The researchers couldn't be certain that these figures, somewhat lower than seen in clinical studies or Israel's national experience, were because the R.1 strain is more virulent, but said it was possible.

Rockefeller University
---
Late in 2020, the school began testing all students and employees weekly with a saliva-based PCR assay. Beginning 21 Jan 2021, when 2 weeks had elapsed since the 1st vaccinees had received their 2nd doses of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, Rockefeller researchers led by Robert B. Darnell, MD, PhD, began looking for breakthrough cases, with 417 individuals considered eligible.

By 17 Mar 2021, the group found 2: both in previously healthy women, one age 51 and the other 65, who developed mild symptomatic illness 19 and 36 days, respectively, after their 2nd vaccine doses.

Viral RNA sequencing showed that both women were infected with variants differing from each other as well as from the original Wuhan strain. In "Patient 1" the virus included the E484K mutation, and another known as D614G, whereas virus from "Patient 2" had D614G plus S477N. Both were distinct from variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 known to be circulating in New York City.

Serology studies indicated both women mounted strong antibody responses from vaccination, according to Darnell and colleagues. Moreover, lab studies showed that serum taken from Patient 1 effectively neutralized the Wuhan strain, B.1.526, and the E484K mutant, suggesting "that the antibody response in Patient 1 recognized these variants but was nonetheless insufficient to prevent a breakthrough infection," the researchers said.

Darnell's group emphasized that the findings "in no way undermine the importance" of completing COVID vaccinations across the U.S. population, but they do "lend support" to the desirability of boosters targeting variants, as well as a "pan-coronavirus" vaccine.

"Our observations underscore the importance of the ongoing race between immunization and the natural selection of potential viral escape mutants," and thus "the need to maintain layers of mitigation strategies," the researchers wrote.

[So-called breakthrough cases (infection with SARS-CoV2 occurring 2 weeks or more after completion of a vaccine series) are not unexpected in the setting of widespread transmission, since no vaccine is 100% effective. Indeed, the expected protection of the highly protective mRNA vaccines are approximately 95% for symptomatic infection and approximately 90% for any infection. Transmission may occur even in populations with high rates of immunization. Herd immunity does not mean complete absence of cases, only that the expected R in this population will be less than 1.0 and that ongoing chains of transmission are unlikely to occur.

The role of variants of concern (particularly those with mutations at E484 (to K or Q) noted to diminish binding to some neutralizing antibodies) in breakthrough cases remains unclear. Thus far, systematic evaluation of breakthrough cases does not appear to support that variants pose a substantially greater risk, but this remains an area of active investigation, and the landscape of variants is constantly changing. - Mod.LM]

[In the past 24 hours, India (349 313), Brazil (70 105), the USA (53 280), and Turkey (40 596) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 13 459 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 22 Apr 2021 to late 23 Apr 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include India, Brazil, USA, Turkey, France (32 633), Germany (24 423), Argentina (21 220), Iran (18 230), Columbia (16 730), Italy (13 816), and Ukraine (12 711). A total of 61 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 32 of the 61 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 4.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 16.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 0.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily total is over 800 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours, with over 147.04 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.11 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
