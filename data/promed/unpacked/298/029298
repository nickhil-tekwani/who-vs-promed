Health District officials are investigating a suspected case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in a middle-aged Grant County resident. The individual is believed to have been exposed to contaminated deer mouse droppings while cleaning out their vehicle. According to the family, the ill individual is improving but is still hospitalized with respiratory failure from the illness that began the middle of April [2018]. Preliminary test results were positive for [a] hantavirus infection; confirmatory results are pending.

If confirmed, this case will be the 1st hantavirus [infection] case reported in Grant County in 6 years. In 2012, 2 Grant County residents died of HPS from unrelated incidents. On average, 1 to 5 confirmed cases of hantavirus infections are reported each year in our state.

What is HPS and how do people get it?
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a rare illness caused by a virus found in the urine, droppings and saliva of infected rodents. In Washington State, deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] are the only carriers of the virus. As deer mice live throughout Grant County, human cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome can occur in any part of the county.

A person can get HPS by breathing in particles contaminated with [a] hantavirus. This can happen when dust from dried rodent urine, saliva, and droppings that contain [a] hantavirus are stirred up in the air. People can also get infected by touching rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials that contain the virus, and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. It's also possible to get HPS from a rodent bite. The disease does not spread person-to-person. The greatest risk occurs when people enter enclosed areas with rodent infestation and poor air circulation, such as sheds and other outbuildings, cabins, building crawl spaces, vehicles and campers.

What are the symptoms of HPS?
HPS illness usually begins 1-6 weeks after a person breathes in the virus. Early signs include fever, muscle aches, headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting. As the disease gets worse, it causes coughing and shortness of breath and can lead to respiratory failure. People with hantavirus [infection symptoms] are usually hospitalized, and about one out of 3 people diagnosed with HPS have died. If you have been exposed to rodents or rodent infested buildings and have symptoms, see your doctor immediately and tell them about your possible rodent exposure.

How can HPS be prevented?
You can prevent HPS by avoiding wild rodents and keeping them out of the places you live, work and play. Remove their sources of food, water, and shelter and keep these areas rodent-proofed. Seal up cracks and gaps in buildings that are larger than ¼ inch [5mm], including window and door sills, under sinks around the pipes, in foundations, attics, and any rodent entry hole.

How should rodent-infested areas be cleaned?
If you do have a rodent infestation, it's important to take precautions when entering these spaces and during cleaning.
- Before entering rodent-infested spaces, "air-out" the space by opening multiple doors and windows for at least 30 minutes to allow fresh air to circulate. Leave the area while it is airing out.
- Wear rubber or plastic gloves. A dust mask may provide some protection against dust, molds, and insulation fibers, but does not protect against viruses. A properly fitted N-95 mask will offer better protection.
- Do not vacuum, sweep, or otherwise stir up dust.
- Thoroughly spray contaminated areas including trapped mice, droppings, and nests with a mixture of bleach and water:
Mix 1½ cups [0.4 l] of household bleach in 1 gallon [3.8 l] of water (or 1 part bleach to 9 parts water).
Soak area for 10 minutes, then remove all of the nest material, mice or droppings with damp paper towels and throw the paper towels in the garbage.
- Mop or sponge the area with bleach solution.
- Wash gloves with disinfectant or soap and water before taking them off. Remove the gloves, then wash hands with soap and water.
- Steam clean or shampoo upholstered furniture, carpets and car interiors, and wash any bedding or clothing in hot water if you see any mouse or rat urine or droppings on them.
- Areas with heavy infestation (piled up droppings, numerous nests and dead rodents) require extra precaution. Professional cleaning and/or pest control services may be needed.

How should dead rodents and rodent nests be discarded?
- Follow instructions above for wearing and taking off gloves.
- Spray dead rodents and nests with disinfectant and let it soak.
- Seal the dead rodent/nest and all cleaning materials in a bag, then seal that bag in a 2nd bag.
Throw the bag into a covered trash can.

How can people stay safe while hiking, camping and enjoying the outdoors?
- Do not handle or feed wild rodents!
- Air out cabins and shelters, then check for signs of rodents.
- Do not sweep out infested cabins. Instead, use the guidelines above for disinfecting cabins or shelters before sleeping in them.
- Do not pitch tents or place sleeping bags near rodent droppings or burrows.
- If possible, do not sleep on the bare ground. Use tents with floors or a ground cloth.
- Keep food in thick plastic or metal containers with tight-fitting lids!
- Handle trash according to site restrictions and keep it in rodent-proof containers until thrown away

[These precautions have been presented frequently in previous hantavirus ProMED-posts, but since this is the beginning to the recreation season, many people will be opening cabins, hiking and camping, this reminder is timely. These are activities that can lead to exposure to areas with deer mice and Sin Nombre hantavirus.

There is mention that the individual might have acquired the infection while cleaning out their automobile. Interestingly, there was a previous case last year (2017) In Washington where a woman likely acquired her Sin Nombre virus infection from an automobile air system. The hantavirus involved in the Washington case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions mentioned in the above report of those that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg

As for children [with hantavirus infections], this year [2018] cases in 3 children are registered, one a 9-year-old from Tonosi, an 11-year-old from Las Tablas and now a 13-year-old girl.

A 13-year-old girl, resident of Las Tablas in Los Santos province, was taken to a pediatric specialty hospital in Panama City for having developed [a] hantavirus [infection]

There is also a registered case in a 30-year-old young man from El Cacao in Tonosi.

Carlos Muñoz, the Epidemiology Regional Coordinator of MINSA [Ministry of Health] stated that this is the 2nd case of the disease in Panama in 18 years in which a child has developed [hantavirus] cardiopulmonary syndrome and that the other cases were just hantavirus fever.

Muñoz explained that sending the children [to other medical centers] was because the Los Santos teams that attend patients in intensive care can only attend adults; when children need attention they proceed to send them to Panama City.

He indicated that the girl was in stable condition, it was not necessary to put her on ventilation since they were able to treat her with oxygen with a facial mask.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Los Santos province this year (2018). Hantavirus infections occur in this province relatively frequently. The specific situations in which these patients acquired the infection are not mentioned.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. However, as noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva. - Mod.TY
