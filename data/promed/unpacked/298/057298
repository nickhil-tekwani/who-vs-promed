A 4th case of [listeriosis] has been confirmed in Tauranga [Bay of Plenty]. Medical Officer of Health for Toi Te Ora Public Health, Dr Phil Shoemack says the 4th case was confirmed last week [week of 27 Aug 2020].

This follows on from 3 confirmed cases last month [June 2020]. Sadly, one of the people with the disease died, prompting a warning from medical professionals. All three of those who were affected last month [July 2020] were between 70 and 90 years old. The person who died already had a terminal condition, Medical Officer of Health Neil de Wet said at the time.

He said it was possible that the cases were linked, as it's unusual to see 3 cases in 2 weeks. Following confirmation of a 4th case last week, Dr Phil Shoemack says they are continuing to work with MPI [Ministry for Primary Industries] to locate a common source of each case. "As yet, we have not managed to confirm whether there is a common source, such as a particular food." He says the latest case did require hospitalisation, and the person has now been discharged.

MPI compliance director Gary Orr says they are looking to see if there is a common food connection. "Any case of [listeriosis] is a worry for us, particularly if there is a link to food ... If it is shown to have a link to food then we will move very quickly to take that risk food out of the system or alert the public."

[Tauranga is a western coastal city in the Bay of Plenty region and the 5th most populous city of New Zealand, with an urban population of 135 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tauranga). The Bay of Plenty is a region of New Zealand, situated around a bight of the same name in the northern coast of the North Island, stretching 260 km (about 161 mi) from the Coromandel Peninsula in the west to Cape Runaway in the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty). A HealthMap/ProMED map of New Zealand can be seen at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7647773,5630 and a map showing the location of Tauranga at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tauranga,+New+Zealand.

The news report above describes a 4th case of listeriosis in the city of Tauranga, in the Bay of Plenty region. About 2 weeks ago ProMED posted a report of 3 cases of listeriosis, aged in their late 70s to 90s, that were reported between 12 and 20 Jul 2020 (Listeriosis - New Zealand: (BP) fatal 20200727.7614443). All 3 were hospitalized and one with a previously diagnosed terminal condition had died.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a Gram-positive, facultative, intracellular, foodborne pathogen that causes listeriosis, which can be fatal, particularly in elderly populations, people with weakened immune systems, and newborns.

Confirmation of a cluster of cases is based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue). A food history from patients in the cluster will then attempt to identify a possible common source. Isolates of _L. monocytogenes_, if found in the suspected food, can then undergo WGS to confirm if the suspected food is the common source.

Food items likely to be contaminated with _Listeria_ include ready-to-eat refrigerated meat products, such as smoked salmon, sushi, and cold-cut meats that do not require further cooking before eating, refrigerated pates or meat spreads, unpasteurized (raw) milk and dairy products, such as soft cheeses, and raw fruits and vegetables (such as sprouts). Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease.

Apparently the investigation of this outbreak is ongoing and no results are available as yet. ProMED would appreciate more information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
