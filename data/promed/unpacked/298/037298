Is the wheat revolution dying?
-------------------------------
The annual growth rate in wheat production dropped from a healthy 3.57
percent in the 1980s to 2.11 percent in the 1990s and below one percent in
the current decade. After hitting a peak of 76 million tons in 2000, wheat
harvest has been hovering around 72 to 74 million tons, according to the
Food Corporation of India (FCI). In fact, the erosion of FCI's stock need
not be viewed with concern, as it has been the result of a deliberate move
to shed burdensome inventories through subsidized exports and liberal use
of grains in welfare and food-for-work programs.
The relatively lower wheat procurement also should not be a cause for much
concern. It only reflects higher purchases by private trade and withholding
of some stocks by big farmers in anticipation of better prices in lean
seasons. These stocks have to, sooner or later, come out in the market.
However, the below-anticipation wheat harvest for the 5th successive year
should be a matter of real discomfiture and should make wheat scientists
and policy makers sit up.
The agriculture ministry, which had earlier reckoned the wheat harvest to
be around 74.05 million tons, has scaled it down to 73.5 million tons.
Wheat experts, who were hoping to bag a harvest of around 75 million tons,
now feel that the production would be just around 73 million tons. The
wheat trade, on the other hand, is projecting a still lower output of
around 71 to 72 million tons.
Some causes for a low wheat yield have, of course, been identified. Noted
wheat expert and Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI) director S.
Nagarajan believes that the unexpected emergence of 2 diseases so close to
ripening of the crop is responsible for yield drop.
Black rust, a dreaded plant disease, resurfaced after over 10 years,
affecting the predominant cultivar PBW-343 in Punjab and adjoining areas
when the crop was heading towards maturity. Another relatively lesser-known
disease, called head scab, struck the durum wheat (hard wheat used for
making noodles and pasta products) around the same time to cause yield
loss. This disease is endemic to North America and has not been reported in
India in the recent past.
Poor wheat yields in earlier years of this decade had been caused largely
by unfavorable climatic factors, such as untimely rains or temperature
rise. Moreover, 2 dreaded weeds, _Phalaris minor_ and wild oats, had posed
a formidable danger to wheat cultivation. But fortunately, their control
was discovered through pesticides and agronomic management.
More recently, rust diseases -- yellow, brown and black rusts -- spread
like an epidemic throughout the northwestern wheat belt. Fortunately, they
were tamed by breeding rust-resistant varieties and breaking the disease
cycle by saturating the wheat-growing southern hilly region with
rust-immune varieties. That was the region where the rust pathogen used to
survive in summer when the crop was not being grown in the plains.
Wheat, being a non-monsoon-dependent winter season cereal, is critical for
the country's food security, and any deceleration in its production growth
is unwarranted. Wheat output needs to grow annually by at least 2.5 percent
to keep pace with the rise in demand.

[The major wheat-producing countries of northern Asia are India, Pakistan,
Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar in order of importance. Most of the wheat is
produced in the Ganges and Nurmada basins of India and the Indus River
Valley of Pakistan. Much of the wheat in India and Pakistan is irrigated,
while in Nepal and Bangladesh it is mostly rain fed. White grain cultivars
are preferred and are primarily of spring habit, but are usually sown in
November and December and harvested in April and May.
Consumption is highest in Pakistan at 141 kg/caput and lowest in Myanmar at
3 kg/caput. World production as of 2004 is 624 093 306 metric tons. India
is one of the largest wheat producers in the world, with about 25 million
ha [1 hectare= 10,000 square meters] under production and averaging almost
60 million tons in recent years. More than 90 percent of the area is sown
to bread wheat, which is grown throughout the country. Durum or macaroni
wheat accounts for around 8 percent of the area. The crop is grown in most
parts of the country, but nearly 70 percent lies in the northern plains and
20 percent in central India.
A rice-wheat rotation is the dominant cropping sequence. Crops other than
rice that precede wheat are also used, particularly in the central and
southern regions. In the large wheat research and development program in
India, much germplasm is screened for important biotic and abiotic
stresses. Important biotic pests include the rusts, Karnal bunt, foliar
blight, powdery mildew, common bunt, flag smut and nematode and insect
pests. Salt, heat and drought are the major abiotic stresses. Large amounts
of NPK fertilizers are used to produce the wheat crop in India.
Over the past 3 decades, increased agricultural productivity in Pakistan
occurred largely due to the deployment of high-yielding cultivars,
increased fertilizer use and greater availability of irrigation water. By
the mid-1980s, semidwarf wheat cultivars had been adopted on almost all
irrigated land, and over 100 kg/ha on average of fertilizer was being
applied to wheat. Pakistan production averaged 16.1 million tons on 8.2
million ha each year during the period 1993-1995. Rice-wheat, berseem-wheat
and cotton-wheat are major systems of intense cropping in Pakistan.
Wheat scab (also known as Fusarium head blight) is caused by the fungus
_Fusarium graminearum_. It is a common problem in Europe, Asia, South
Africa, and the Midwestern and Eastern U.S.A. Scab severity is very erratic
and depends heavily on wet weather conditions. Scab often causes reduction
in test weight, sometimes down to near 50 lb/bu. In addition, scabby
kernels count as "damaged" in the grading process. Although scabby wheat is
often very good, it may contain the mycotoxins DON (vomitoxin) and
zearalenone (an estrogen analog). Swine are most sensitive to scabby wheat
mycotoxins, and as little as one ppm of DON can significantly reduce daily
weight gains in pigs. Higher concentrations result in feed refusal and
vomiting. Swine reproduction is also sensitive to disruption by the
zearalenone mycotoxin. Non-breeding cattle and poultry seem to tolerate
both toxins better than swine.
