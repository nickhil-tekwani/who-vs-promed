Saskatchewan reports case of anthrax on farm south west of Saskatoon
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Saskatchewan [province] government is reporting more cases of anthrax in livestock.

Agriculture officials say the deadly bacterium was confirmed in a cow this week on a farm in the rural municipality of Harris south west of Saskatoon. Anthrax is suspected in the deaths of 2 other cattle from the same herd.

In July [2015] anthrax killed 2 bison near North Battleford and another cow in the RM [rural municipality] of Harris.

Livestock are infected when they eat forage contaminated with spores. Anthrax can survive in spore form for decades in soil and changes in soil moisture can lead to a build-up of spores on pastures.

[I checked with my veterinary contacts in Saskatoon for further information as the above report was clearly just a cut-and-paste of a brief government press release. And Wendy replied:]

In response to your questions...

This latest case of anthrax is on a different premises than the previous one in the same RM. The 2 premises are approximately 8 km [about 5 miles] apart, and the latest one, from satellite imagery, appears to be adjacent to a waterway and may include a small flood plain.

The cattle are on feed (hay) but have access to almost 1000 acres of pasture. The producer has indicated that at least some of the hay bales that are being fed came from an alkali slough area, or other slough area. Snow cover is minimal, so it is possible that animals were exposed on pasture but as the primary source of feed is baled hay we strongly suspect it is a case of contaminated feed.

Anthrax has occurred in the RM previous to this year. A map of Saskatchewan RMs where anthrax has been detected is available at http://www.agriculture.gov.sk.ca/adx/aspx/adxGetMedia.aspx?DocID=268b42ae-b7c6-478c-87c8-78a29920f4be&MediaID=17473&Filename=Anthrax.pdf&l=English.

As you can see from the map, anthrax has been confirmed across much of the province. We strongly encourage all producers in Saskatchewan to vaccinate.

Let me know if you have further questions.

[For a map of Saskatchewan go to: http://www.sasksearch.com/travel/sask.htm. From the small Wikipedia map [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris,_Saskatchewan] Harris is south west of Saskatoon, and according to http://en.db-city.com/Canada--Saskatchewan--Harris-No.-316--Harris is RM 316. 316 is a "red" RM in the Saskatchewan anthrax map.

There was a province-wide epidemic of anthrax in 2006, followed by an outbreak in a new area the following February which was traced to contaminated hay [see Anthrax, bovine - Canada (SK) 20070219.0625 and Anthrax, bovine - Canada (SK)(02) 20070401.1111]. As bone meal is not used in Canada these days, I think that a working hypothesis of contaminated hay is sound. A genotypic comparison with the strains recovered will clarify the situation.
