In addition to our earlier correspondence from 11 May 1999 regarding stool
samples that were collected in the Kano region, Nigeria, we can report as
follows.
We reported earlier that two out of 10 samples cultured by the Department
of Medical Microbiology, University of Amsterdam & Academic Medical Centre,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands, contained _Vibrio cholerae_ O1, serogroup
Inaba. Besides, vibrio-like bacterial species [other organisms were found
that then could not be identified, but DNA analysis of 16 S RNA genes have
been performed by the Laboratory for special bacterial determinations of
the National Institute of Public Health & the Environment, Bilthoven, The
Netherlands.
Based on the latter analyses we report that:
1) one species has been determined as _A. ichthiosmia_, a species until now
only found in surface water in Germany. This species has a strong
resemblance with _A. veronii_, in which enteropathogenic characteristics
for humans is suspected.
2) another species has been determined as unknown _A. hydrophila_ with
difference of only 1 nucleotide.
In The Netherlands the _Aeromonas_ species are generally known as a
causative agent for diarrhoea; the now found subspecies, however, have
never been identified. Both show atypical biochemical reactions and can
only be determined by DNA sequential analysis.
_Aeromonas_ species are very often found in surface water and are known to
produce an enterotoxin that has a strong relationship with the cholera
toxin that causes diarrhoea in humans [This is true for some strains, only
- Mod.ES. However, not everybody is susceptible to it and epidemics are
not described. Most of the time it concerns patients with a compromised
immune system. Probably an epidemic due to _Aeromonas_ does progress [in a
manner similar to cholera and that might explain why amongst the samples
that were collected in Nigeria, both _Vibrio cholerae_ and _Aeromonas_ sp.
have been found.
In our opinion it should be worthwhile to consider the presence of
_Aeromonas_ species in the this region, in particular in the light of the
ongoing cholera epidemics in Nigeria.

[Of course, isolation of an organism commonly found in surface water from
diarrhea samples does not necessarily indicate participation of this
organism in the ongoing disease outbreak. It is recognized that some
strains of _Aeromonas_ sp. are capable of causing sporadic cases of
cholera-like disease from which most people will recover relatively
quickly. Note that there are significant genetic similarities between
_Aeromonas sp_. and _Vibrio cholerae. The findings reported above could
represent a less serious outbreak superimposed on a cholera epidemic, an
organism that is worsening the symptoms for patients who are co-infected,
or the isolation of an organism irrelevant to the ongoing epidemic. It is
impossible to know the significance of the isolates without
characterization of enterotoxins (if any), and even with that information
there would be a lot of unanswered questions. This is fertile ground for
additional research. - Mod.ES
