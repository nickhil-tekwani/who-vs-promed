[Outbreaks of bovine anaplasmosis are due to infection with _Anaplasma marginale_. _Anaplasma centrale_ is capable of producing a moderate degree of anaemia, but clinical outbreaks in the field are extremely rare. A 3rd species, _A. phagocytophilum_, with a primary reservoir in rodents, has been reported rarely to infect cattle, and does not cause clinical disease.

The most marked clinical signs of anaplasmosis are anaemia and jaundice, the latter occurring late in the disease. Haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria are not present, and this may assist in the differential diagnosis of anaplasmosis from babesiosis, which is often endemic in the same regions. The disease can only be confirmed, however, by identification of the organism.

_A. marginale_ occurs in most tropical and subtropical countries, and in some more temperate regions. _A. centrale_ was 1st described from South Africa. The organism has since been imported by other countries -- including Australia and some countries in South America, South-East Asia and the Middle East -- for use as a vaccine against _A. marginale_.

Anaplasma species are transmitted either mechanically or biologically by arthropod vectors.

_A. marginale_ infection has not been reported in humans.
