Experts who attended a Food Safety Summit in Baltimore [Maryland] in April 2014 should have skipped lunch. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene released a report Thu 25 Sep 2014 that says the chicken Marsala served at a buffet lunch on 9 Apr 2014 during the Food Safety Summit at the Baltimore Convention Center caused a gastroenteritis outbreak that sickened 216 attendees.

The report says of the 216 attendees who got sick, 157 ate the chicken. Symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps and, in some cases, vomiting. The report says the chicken may not have been kept at the proper temperature.

Centerplate, the convention's in-house catering company, provided the means at the summit, which attracted roughly 1300 food safety experts to Baltimore.

Centerplate did not immediately return a call for comment.

Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness where the preformed toxin is ingested, in _Clostridium perfringens_ disease, the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion is obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:
1. Organism
_Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic (but aerotolerant) Gram positive, spore-forming rod that produces enterotoxin. The bacterium is relatively cold-tolerant, and its spores are heat-resistant. Nonpathogenic _C. perfringens_ is widely distributed in the environment and is frequently found in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

Among the many isotypes of _C. perfringens_, type A almost always contains the _cpe gene_ (the enterotoxin gene, which causes food poisoning), and types B, C, D, and E sometimes contain this gene.

2. Disease
Foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_ can take 2 forms.
1) The gastroenteritis form is very common and often is mild and self-limiting. Depending on the strain, it may also develop as more severe gastroenteritis that leads to damage of the small intestine and, potentially, but rarely, fatality.
2) The other form, enteritis necroticans or "pig-bel disease" (a name reportedly derived from pidgin English, referring to the characteristic swollen bellies and other severe symptoms that resulted from feasts on contaminated pork in New Guinea), is rare in the United States, more severe than the other form of the illness, and often fatal.

Both forms of the disease result from ingestion of large numbers of _C. perfringens_, which replicates much more quickly than do most other bacteria. This raises the likelihood that, compared with other bacteria, _C. perfringens_ will more quickly reach pathogenic levels in contaminated food left unrefrigerated and that consumers who eat the food may ingest large doses of the bacterium.

- Mortality: in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, overall, _C. perfringens_ annually accounts for 26 deaths in the US.
- Common gastroenteritis form: a few deaths resulting from diarrhea-induced dehydration and other complications have been reported, and usually were among debilitated or elderly people.
- Pig-bel form (enteritis necroticans): this disease is often fatal. As noted, it is extremely rare in the US.
- Infective dose: symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (more than 1 million) vegetative cells or more than 1 million spores/g of food. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in vitro) is associated with sporulation. This disease is characterized as a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).
- Onset: symptoms occur about 16 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers (more than 1 million live vegetative cells or more than 1 million spores) of _C. perfringens_ capable of producing the enterotoxin.
- Illness/complications: complications are rare in the typical, mild gastroenteritis form of the disease, particularly among people under 30 years old. Elderly people are more likely to have prolonged or severe symptoms, as are immunocompromised people. The more severe form of the disease may cause necrosis of the small intestine, peritonitis, and septicemia.
- Symptoms:
Gastroenteritis form: common characteristics include watery diarrhea and mild abdominal cramps.
Pig-bel form (enteritis necroticans): abdominal pain and distention, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), vomiting, and patchy necrosis of the small intestine.
- Duration: the milder form of the disease generally lasts 12 to 24 hours. In the elderly or infants, symptoms may last 1 to 2 weeks.
- Route of entry: oral.
- Pathway: CPE protein usually is released into the intestines when the vegetative cells lyse on completion of sporulation. This enterotoxin is responsible for the clinical presentation in humans. The enterotoxin induces fluid and electrolyte losses from the GI tract. The principal target organ for CPE is believed to be the small intestine. Pig-bel disease involves production of beta toxin, which is highly trypsin-sensitive. Of note: consumption of large amounts of sweet potatoes, which generally contain trypsin inhibitor, could contribute to progression of the disease. The effects of low gastrointestinal levels of trypsin appear to have been demonstrated in Germany around the end of World War II and post-war, when starvation and high levels of potato consumption contributed to low levels of this enzyme in the population. These were thought to have been major cofactors in the occurrence of pig-bel disease in Germany during that period.

3. Frequency
_Perfringens_ poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the US. The CDC estimates that 965 958 domestically acquired cases occur annually in the US, 2nd only to _Salmonella_ when considering bacterial causes of foodborne illness. 34 outbreaks in 2006 (that is, not including isolated cases) included 1880 cases. At least 51 outbreaks were reported annually in the US from 2001 to 2005. Typically, 50 to 100 people are affected in one outbreak. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported, because the implicated foods and patients' feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin.

4. Food sources/potentiating characteristics of the organism
In most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by this organism is temperature abuse of cooked foods. Small numbers of the organism often are present after the food is cooked, due to germination of its spores, which can survive high heat and can multiply rapidly as a result of a fast doubling time (less than 10 minutes for vegetative cells), depending on temperature and food matrix. Therefore, during cool-down (109-113 deg F [42.8-45 deg C]) and storage of prepared foods, this organism can reach levels that cause food poisoning much more quickly than can other bacteria.

Meats (especially beef and poultry), meat-containing products (such as, gravies and stews), and Mexican foods are important vehicles for _C. perfringens_ foodborne illness, although it is also found on vegetable products, including spices and herbs, and in raw and processed foods. Spores of some _C. perfringens_ strains can survive boiling water for an hour or longer in a relatively protective medium (such as a cooked-meat medium).

5. Diagnosis
_Perfringens_ poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of the toxin in patients' feces. Bacteriologic confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the bacteria in implicated foods or in patients' fecal samples.

6. Target populations
Institutional settings (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.), where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving, are the most common circumstance in which _C. perfringens_ poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of _C. perfringens_ poisoning. As with other infections, immunocompromised people are at higher risk of severe illness than are others; such as those with HIV/AIDS or undergoing cancer chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drugs for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions.

7. Food analysis
Standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. With the introduction of PCR-based methods, toxin typing using antiserum neutralization tests in mice is no longer practical. - Mod.LL
