At least 143 wild animals have died from anthrax in and around the Chobe
National Park. The number is made up, among others, of 70 buffaloes, 37
zebras, 23 elephants. Other species that had been affected included impala,
lechwe, kudu, baboon honey [?], honey badge [badger], roan antelope, sable
antelope, and water [buffalo?].
Dr Lucas Rutina and Dr Nlingisisi Babayane from the wildlife department
told heads of departments in a meeting recently that the disease was
spreading. They said carcasses of zebras were concentrated around Simwaza
near Ngoma border gate while those of buffaloes were between Ihaba and
Serondela camping sites in the Chobe National Park. Dr Rutina expressed
fear of cross-border infections as most of the animals die on the Namibian
side.
He said anthrax was endemic and impossible to vaccinate wild animals
against it. The only possibility with vaccination was with wild animals in
ranches, as well as wild rare species as they moved in small numbers and
could be found concentrated in one area.
Dr Babayane said it was important to burn and bury the carcasses quickly
before they rot and the [bacteria] spilled onto the ground where it could
live and infect other animals.
People working in the affected area were given doxycycline tablets to take
for 30 days while in the area and 30 days after evacuation.
The last anthrax outbreak along the Chobe riverfront was in September 2004
and it killed 848 wild animals, mostly buffaloes.

[When one has deaths of this order, one is lucky to play catch-up when
trying to burn carcasses. Also one quickly runs out of firewood. The only
good news is that the scavengers get so full of food that they start
leaving carcasses, so the latter rot unopened and the acidification kills
the vegetative cells and thus significantly reduces the potential for
spores to form. Some say that such outbreaks are "normal" and should
therefore be left to run. Unfortunately, as this report indicates, the
disease regularly overflows a park's boundaries and affects the local
livestock. Plus it also reduces the tourist income from the park. The
average ecotourist and photographer tourist is not filled with wonder at
heaps of dead animals like some veterinary epidemiologists might be -- I
admit we are different, but even I greatly prefer healthy animals to sick
ones. - Mod.MHJ]
