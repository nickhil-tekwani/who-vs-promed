A doctor has reportedly died of [a] viral haemorrhagic fever, otherwise known as Lassa fever, in Ebonyi State. Some other doctors are being treated for the disease at the Federal Teaching Hospital (FTH), Abakaliki [capital of Ebonyi State].

Though no official confirmation has been made by the Ministry of Health, doctors have raised the alarm over the outbreak of the disease. Some doctors at the FTH, who spoke to our reporter, regretted the outbreak of the disease, adding that doctors are prone to it since they are exposed to infected patients. The doctors called for quick intervention by the Federal Ministry of Health to forestall the spread of the disease.

An outbreak of Lassa fever was first reported in the state in 2008. Several people died. They included 2 doctors and other health workers. Last year [2011], 4 people said to be residing at the Military cantonment, Nkwoagu, near Abakaliki also died of the disease.

The government said it has set up an emergency response team for the treatment and control of outbreaks of communicable diseases, such as Lassa fever, gastroenteritis, and meningitis, usually associated with dry season. The commissioner for health, Sunday Nwangele, said this while addressing stakeholders in Abakaliki. Nwangele said epidemiologists from the ministry had been deployed to health facilities in the state to check the possible spread of the disease. He urged the people to report any suspected case to a hospital or the epidemiology unit of the ministry. The commissioner said the ministry had procured drugs for the treatment of the disease, adding that more was still expected from the Federal Ministry of Health.

Following the death of the chief medical director of Igboji General Hospital Ikwo Ikwo LGA [local government area] of Ebonyi state by [a] viral haemorrhagic fever, the government said it has put in place an emergency response team for the treatment and control of outbreak of communicable diseases such as viral haemorrhagic fevers, gastroenteritis, meningitis associated with the dry season.

The commissioner for health, Dr Sunday Nwangele, who made the statement yesterday in Abakaliki while addressing key stakeholders in the health sector, noted that an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever, otherwise called Lassa fever, was first officially reported in Ebonyi state in 2008. According to him the disease had, in 2008, claimed the lives of some people including 2 medical doctors and other health workers and last year [2011], 4 people said to be residing at the Military cantonment, Nkwoagu near Abakaliki also died of the disease.

He said the recent case of the outbreak of the disease was being controlled by epidemiologists from the state ministry of health, who had been deployed to health facilities in parts of the state to check the possible spread of the disease. Though the commissioner said that the chief medical director was brought to the teaching hospital in a critical condition before he gave up, he urged the people not to panic but report any suspected case to a hospital or Epidemiology unit of the ministry for prompt medical attention.

The head of the epidemiology unit of the ministry, Dr Francis Onwe, said the unit had commenced the distribution of the drugs to hospitals across the state and advised people to report to hospitals if they experience symptoms such as stooling and vomiting of blood among others.

[Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks duration that occurs in West Africa. The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family Arenaviridae. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea (Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone, and parts of Nigeria, but probably exists in other West African countries as well.

About 80 per cent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. The onset of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and abdominal may follow. Severe cases may progress to show facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from mouth, nose, vagina, or gastrointestinal tract, and low blood pressure. Protein may be noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the late stages. Deafness occurs in 25 per cent of patients of whom half recover some function after 1-3 months.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, humans becoming infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat". Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces).

Humans usually become infected with Lassa virus from exposure to excreta of infected _Mastomys_ rats. Lassa virus may also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment.
