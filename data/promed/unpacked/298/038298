The Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] of the Biobio
region confirmed the 6th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the
course of this year [2011] in the area, which became the 4th fatality.


The case is a 64-year-old man from the Canete community in Arauco,
although the way in which he became infected is still being
investigated. "The exact location of the place where he might have
been infected is being investigated, but his home that was visited has
the conditions for the infection," explained the Biobio Health SEREMI
epidemiologist Cecilia Soto. "The patient went for treatment to the
Canete hospital and was immediately referred to the regional hospital,
but regretfully, he died," she added.

reported that the man collected wood [presumably in the forest], an
important piece of his history. To date, there have been 6 cases of
[a] hantavirus infection, all male, 4 of whom died].

A new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was registered in the Maule
region, this time in the Longavi community, Linares province.
Initially, the man, a 38 year old farmer, was sent to the intensive
care unit in the Curico Hospital, in stable but serious condition, but
did not require mechanical ventilation and in the coming hours will be
sent to the care center in Linares.

According to the investigation initiated by the Health SEREMI, the
risk area corresponds to the San Ramon de Bodega sector where he lives
and according to the epidemiological investigation, there is a high
risk in his work area and around the house. Currently, the health
authority is completing the analysis to confirm the specific place of
risk.

In 2010, in Maule there were there were 11 cases of hantavirus
[infections], 3 of whom died, equivalent to 27.2 percent fatality. 61
cases and 22 deaths were reported in the country, a 36 percent
fatality, within the normal range [for this disease]. This year
[2011], 4 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been registered, 3 of
which were mild and one fatal, in the Molina, San Clemente, Curepto,
and now Longavi communities. The cases correspond to 3 farm workers
and a housewife, one of whom died.

According to the Department of Public Health, in the country [Chile]
30 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been registered, with a 33
percent fatality rate.

The provincial Director of Epidemiology, Silvina Saavedra, stated
that to date, 4 positive cases of hantavirus [infections] have been
confirmed in Victoria [Entre Rios province], of whom 2 died and the
other 2 recovered and were released [from the hospital].

Saavedra commented that the laboratory results were awaited for other
cases. "These are samples that were sent some time ago," she explained
in dialog with this news agency, adding that "the results come in
continuously, and are updated."

The 1st-ever reported case in Maine of a potentially fatal
respiratory condition spread by the common house mouse was diagnosed
in Somerset County at the end of April [2011]. Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, or HPS, has a rapid onset of illness, no effective vaccine
or cure, and a fatality rate of 30 percent to 40 percent. [_Mus
musculus_ is usually referred to as the common house mouse, and is not
a reservoir for either Sin Nombre, New York, or Monongahela
hantaviruses. The mice most likely to be involved in this case are the
deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, and the white-footed mouse, _P.
leucopus_. - Mod.TY]

Mainers should not be unduly alarmed, said Dr Stephen Sears, the
state epidemiologist. There are many potentially dangerous diseases
associated with the white-footed mouse, the deer mouse, and other
common rodents, he said on Wednesday [18 May 2011], and the presence
of hantavirus in Maine comes as no surprise to epidemiologists or
other public health officials.

"This raises the issue that you really need to clean up if your
environment includes mice and other rodents," he said Wednesday.
Especially in camps and cottages where mice may become well
established during the winter months, people should be careful when
handling droppings, nests, and other sources of contamination.

Because the most common form of transmission is airborne particles,
it is important to wet down mousy areas before cleaning, he said. If
dusty conditions are unavoidable, a paper face mask can help. The
virus also can be passed if droppings or other materials come in
contact with broken skin or through a bite from an infected rodent. In
heavily contaminated areas, it would be prudent to wear rubber gloves
and use a mild bleach solution to wipe down contaminated surfaces,
Sears said.

HPS was first identified in 1993 in New Mexico, after an outbreak of
severe respiratory illness in young adults. A number of individuals
died in that outbreak. Since then, the virus has affected humans in
several states, including Pennsylvania and New York, Sears said.

It may take a week or 2 for illness to develop after exposure, Sears
said. "But once you start getting symptoms, the time to the
development of severe illness is relatively short, maybe 2 days," he
said.

Early symptoms include shortness of breath, fever, chills, and muscle
aches. Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea also may
develop. The illness can progress quickly to severe coughing and
respiratory distress as the lungs fill with fluid. Hospitalized
patients typically are placed on mechanical respirators to help them
breathe and given oxygen to help them through the crisis.

The Somerset County man diagnosed last month is in his 70s, Sears
said. "He became very ill very quickly," Sears said, and was treated
in the intensive care unit of a nearby hospital. Doctors suspected HPS
and sent a blood specimen to an out-of-state laboratory. The presence
of [a] hantavirus was confirmed at the US CDC in Atlanta.

Thanks to a quick medical response, the man survived the episode but
continues to recover in a rehabilitation facility. Sears said he
expects the man will be able to return to his own home.

State inspectors visiting the man's property found mouse
contamination in an outbuilding, Sears said.

"We take it for granted in Maine that living with mice is part of
living in the country," Sears said. But this case, he noted, shows
that Mainers should be vigilant about controlling mice and other
rodents in their homes and cleaning up after them carefully.

[The hantavirus involved in this cases is probably either New York
virus, Monongahela virus or Sin Nombre virus (SNV). All can cause
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The sigmodontine hosts of Sin Nombre
(SNV) and Monongahela viruses is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus
maniculatus_, which is widely distributed in the USA, including Maine.
The white-footed mouse, _P. leucopus_ is also a SNV reservoir. _P.
leucopus_ is the host for New York hantavirus, and is also found in
Maine.

Images of _P. leucopus_ and _P. maniculatus_ can be found at the USA
CDC site, http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/rodents/index.html.
