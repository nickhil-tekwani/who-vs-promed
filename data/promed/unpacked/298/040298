Eighteen cases of Potomac horse fever (PHF) have been reported thus far this year [2018] in Kentucky [through Tue 24 Jul 2018].

The 1st confirmed case of Potomac horse fever (PHF) diagnosed in Kentucky during calendar year 2018 was reported on [Fri 1 Jun 2018]. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR testing and compatible clinical symptoms observed.

Historically, Kentucky's PHF cases are 1st detected later in the year (mid-July), and our thought is that the early detection this year was most probably associated with abundant wet weather in April [2018] and record-breaking warm temperatures in May [2018].

Horse owners are encouraged to review the environment in which their horses are housed and consult with their veterinarians on strategies they can use to mitigate disease risk. Minimizing opportunity for horses to ingest aquatic insects by turning off lights in and around barns and other areas at night has been suggested.

Potomac horse fever is described as an acute enterocolitis syndrome that presents as mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages. The resulting illness can also cause abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent, _Neorickettsia risticii_, is a gram-negative bacterium.

Infection of the large intestine results in an acute colitis, which is one of the principal clinical signs of PHF. While the disease is often associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers, it is believed that most horses contract PHF after inadvertent ingestion of aquatic insects that carry _N risticii_ and not from the water source.

The following breakdown of the 18 horses confirmed with Potomac horse fever in Kentucky thus far this year [2018] is courtesy of the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office:
