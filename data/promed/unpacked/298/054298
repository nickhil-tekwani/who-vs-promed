FAO Statement on Rift Valley fever in Sudan
--------------------------------------------
Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks have been reported by WHO in humans
in Sudan in White Nile, Sinnar, and Gezira states on 5 Nov 2007. RVF
is a dangerous mosquito-borne zoonotic disease affecting ruminants
and humans. People contract infection through mosquito bites or
direct contact with infected biological material and liquids such as
blood during slaughtering or when handling animal abortions.

While sometimes difficult to identify, usually RVF is already well
established in animal populations by the time the 1st human cases are observed.

"The source of RVF in animals needs to be identified and veterinary
control measures put in place in order to reduce the public health
risk, to limit the impact on livelihoods and to avoid further
spread," said J. Domenech, Chief Veterinary Officer of FAO. This is
of particular importance during this time of the year given that
major trade movements of ruminants are expected because of the
upcoming Muslim religious events, the Hajj and Eid Al-Adha. [The Hajj
begins 18 Dec 2007; Eid Al-Adha is on 20 Dec 2007. - Mod.AS] He
emphasized the importance of informing population groups at risk on
measures that may be applied to protect people from becoming
infected. FAO closely monitors the developments and has offered
technical assistance to Sudan to support animal disease investigation
and animal management aspects.

[Unfortunately -- similarly to numerous past cases -- RVF has been
again detected by human rather than animal sentinels. And contrary to
the previous outbreak in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania which began at
the end of 2006, the current outbreak has not been preceded by a
warning based upon climatic-ecological analyses.

Up to now, no information (official or otherwise) from Sudan is
available on suspected clinical cases in animals (predominantly
mass-abortions and offspring mortality). In addition to the grave
public health aspects, the disease may have devastating impact upon
the livestock industry and the livelihood of animal owners.

RVF was initially recorded in Sudan in 1936 (antibodies in humans).
An extensive epizootic was described in 1973, accompanied by virus
isolations from affected animals. 1973 is the year officially
reported by Sudan's veterinary authorities as the last year of RVF
occurrence. However, a limited epizootic was reported in 1976 (Ref.
Eisa et al., 1980. An outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the Sudan
--1976. Trans.R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 74, 417-419). This epizootic
was later suspected to be a possible source of the major 1977-78 RVF
epizootic/epidemic in Egypt (Ref. Gad et al., 1986. A possible route
for the introduction of Rift Valley fever virus into Egypt during
1977. J Trop Med Hyg. 89(5):233-236). The authors concluded:
"Reintroduction of RVF or other diseases from Sudan into Egypt will
be facilitated by the construction of new roads linking the two countries."

An epizootic of RVF which occurred in Egypt between April and August
1997 was also attributed to introduction from the Sudan (Ref. Abd
el-Rahim et al., 1999. An epizootic of Rift Valley fever in Egypt in
1997. Rev. Sci. Tech. OIE 18(3):741-748). The authors concluded:
"Importation of infected ruminants, especially camels from the Sudan,
is the principal source of infection. Aswan, the nearest Egyptian
province to the Sudan, is the focus of RVF virus infection in Egypt."

The epidemiology of RVF, including the possible role of animal
movements in its spread, has been subject to past discussions.
