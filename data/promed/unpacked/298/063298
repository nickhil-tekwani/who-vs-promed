The Northern Territory [NT] has seen a rise in meningococcal infection with 17 cases so far this year [2017].

Meningococcal disease is an uncommon, life-threatening illness due to a bacterial infection of the blood and/or the membranes that line the spinal cord and brain and occasionally infect other sites, such as large joints.

Most of the meningococcal [serogroup] W infections in the NT have occurred in Aboriginal children living in Katherine, central Australia, and Barkly regions. Most of these cases are serogroup W, which has recently risen across Australia. 10 are definite serogroup W with 5 awaiting final laboratory testing but likely to be serogroup W.

There has been a rapid increase in meningococcal W disease in the month of September [2017] with 10 cases of confirmed or probable serogroup W reported.

[Katherine, with an urban population of 6094 in 2011, is a town in Northern Territory, Australia, 320 km (200 mi) southeast of Darwin and 17 km (10.6 mi) northwest of Royal Australian Air Force Base (RAAF) Tindal, which has a residential population of 742. Katherine provides education, health, local government services and employment opportunities for the families of personnel stationed at RAAF Tindal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine,_Northern_Territory).

Following the mass introduction into the population of a vaccine specific for one particular meningococcal serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, such as, serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African meningitis belt following the introduction of A vaccine, only to be replaced by emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups, such as serogroups B and W. A similar situation is apparently occurring in Australia; there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases after the introduction of conjugate meningococcal C vaccine to the National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2003. Serogroup C disease has become very rare (1.2 percent of cases with identified serogroup in 2016) (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf). See ProMED-mail posts Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (02): (SA) sg. B 20160515.4222568 and Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia: (SA) RFI 20160513.4220868.

However, serogroup W disease has increased since 2013; this is now the main serogroup causing meningococcal disease (44.7 percent of cases with identified serogroup) in Australia in 2016 (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). The news report above says that most of the serogroup W infections in the NT have occurred in Aboriginal children living in Katherine.

Because of the replacement of serogroup C by serogroup W in the UK, the UK is now offering an expanded conjugated serogroup vaccine, the quadrivalent Men ACWY, for adolescents, who are more likely to carry meningococcal bacteria than any other age group, to stop the spread of serogroup W. This is being done by replacing the routine teenage Men C booster with the Men ACWY vaccine (http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/men-acwy-vaccine.aspx).

3 types of meningococcal vaccines are now available in Australia:
- monovalent meningococcal C conjugate vaccine or meningococcal C conjugate combined with the _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) vaccine;
- meningococcal B vaccine;
- quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines.

Routine meningococcal C conjugate vaccine at 12 months of age is recommended and funded under the NIP (National Immunisation Program). The meningococcal B vaccine and the quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available through private prescription for this age group, but are not funded under the NIP.

The quadrivalent (A, C, W, Y) meningococcal conjugate vaccines are available through private prescription and also through state-funded adolescent programs in 5 states (New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia) starting in 2017, for those aged 15-19 years or school years 10-12 (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). The B vaccine is available through private prescription and in South Australia from April 2017 in a statewide 2-year clinical study for students enrolled in years 10, 11, and 12 in 2017 at participating schools (http://www.ncirs.edu.au/assets/provider_resources/fact-sheets/meningococcal-vaccines-fact-sheet.pdf). - Mod.ML
