[1] Case update
- Mon 1 Oct 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health
[in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=70b0c0d7b9

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 30 Sep 2018:
- a total of 161 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 129 confirmed and 32 probable;
- of the 129 confirmed, 73 died and 45 [have recovered];
- 9 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni [North Kivu] and 1 in Komanda (Ituri).
Beni's confirmed case is the daughter of a confirmed case who died at the Beni Ebola treatment center on 22 Sep 2018. The family had refused follow-up and vaccination. The girl has died.
The confirmed case of Komanda is a man belonging to Ndindi's [district in Beni] family who is behind the pockets of resistance in the city of Beni. Some infected members of this family had caused the spread of the virus in Butembo [North Kivu] and Tchomia [Ituri] by refusing follow-up and recommendations from the health authorities. After the death of the 1st confirmed case in Tchomia, who was his sister-in-law, he fled to Komanda [Ituri]. He was found hospitalized in a health post in Komanda. He will be transferred to the Tchomia isolation center and the health post will be fully disinfected.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- The city of Beni remains the main focus of the Ebola virus disease epidemic. For week 39, from 24 to 30 Sep 2018, Beni recorded:
8/9 new confirmed cases reported
1/1 new probable case reported,
4/4 new deaths reported.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 13 208 people have been vaccinated, including 4207 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 4095 in Beni [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 1193 in Katwa [North Kivu], 944 in Butembo [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 260 in Tchomia [Ituri], 257 in Bunia [Ituri], 164 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[A little more detail on the 2 new confirmed cases can be found in the CIDRAP report below.

It appears that the resistance to vaccination is slowly being overcome in at least the lobby group mentioned below, a good sign. Without vaccination, a delay in treatment can be lethal. Perhaps the experience of losing a family member after refusing treatment is a lesson that is changing the resistance group's perspective. - Mod.LK]

[2] New cases confirmed (North Kivu, Beni)
- Mon 1 Oct 2018. DRC reports 4 more Ebola cases over the weekend
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Reporting and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/drc-reports-4-more-ebola-cases-over-weekend
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry reported 4 more Ebola cases 29 Sep 2018 and yesterday [20 Sep 2018], 3 of them confirmed, and noted that 2 involved circumstances known to spread the disease: delayed treatment and unsafe burial.

All of the cases are from the most recent disease hot spots, Beni, which has experienced civil unrest and community resistance, and Butembo, a large city near the Uganda border.

Political overtones in Butembo
------------------------------
In its 29 Sep 2018 report, the DRC health ministry reported 2 new cases, 1 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.

The case-patient from Butembo is a woman whose symptoms began on 20 Sep 2018, but her family members initially refused to transfer her to an Ebola treatment center and instead hid her. They refused to meet with Ebola responders without the presence of members of the "Standing Parliament", a district political pressure group that they support. When the woman's condition worsened, the pressure group, which had been in negotiations with responders in Butembo, called on emergency teams to transfer her to the treatment center.

The woman tested positive for Ebola upon her arrival, and health officials registered her family, members of the lobby group, and the aligned member of parliament, Crispin Mbindule Mitono, as at-risk contacts, and all agreed to be vaccinated.

According to the health ministry, Mitono had been quoted in the media in August 2018 as saying he believed Ebola was created in laboratories and moved from Equateur province to Beni to exterminate the population, and he had pushed his supporters to resist vaccination.

Getting Mitono and the pressure group on board with response steps is an important breakthrough, the health ministry said, according to a machine translation of its update. "Thus, the involvement of [Mitono] and the pressure group is a major step forward in social mobilization and the lifting of the last Butembo resistance wall," it added.

Unsafe burial in probable case
------------------------------
Yesterday [30 Sep 2018], the health ministry reported 2 more cases in Beni, one of them a confirmed infection involving a patient who died shortly after arriving at the Ebola treatment center.

The other is classified as a new probable case, a contact of the last confirmed case-patient who died a day earlier and was buried by his family without safety precautions. In Ebola outbreaks, unsafe burials have been known to pose a high risk of virus spread.

The latest developments push the outbreak total to 159 cases, 127 of them confirmed. The 2 deaths put the fatality count at 104. [Note the current number in the MoH report above for 30 Sep 2018 is 161 cases, 129 confirmed.]

- Mon 1 Oct 2018. DRC - Ebola: 6 cases confirmed after suspension of Beni response activities
[Actualite.cd; in French, machine trans., edited]
https://actualite.cd/2018/10/01/rdc-ebola-6-cas-confirmes-apres-la-suspension-des-activites-de-la-riposte-beni
[byline: Yassin Kombi]

Six confirmed cases of Ebola were recorded in Beni (North Kivu) during the 5 days [of general strike] called by the civil society to protest killings of people by suspected ADF [Allied Democratic Forces] fighters. [This] led to the temporary cessation of immunization activities and at least 243 people who were in contact with the patients could not be vaccinated, reports the health authorities.

"These events related to the massacres have not had any impact on the response and we have not been able to investigate all the alerts that have come in. Hospital surveillance at ports of entry and checkpoints has been suspended. As a result, there were 2 cases in the general hospital that were positive, our vaccination teams could not build the belts on the confirmed cases, and during that period there were 6 confirmed cases for 243 contacts that were not able to be vaccinated because of these actions of the strike, and all follow-up contacts were not made," said Dr Tambwe Bathe, general coordinator of the response to Ebola, on Sun 30 Sep 2018.

Several samples could not be examined during the strike, which was suspended last Fri 28 Sep 2018. "For hospitalized patients we were unable to conduct some tests including biochemistry and dermatology routine care of patients in treatment centers," said the health manager.

The 10th epidemic reported in the country has already killed 104 people in and around Beni and 2 localities in Ituri province. 159 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 127 confirmed and 32 probable. These figures could increase because 13 suspected cases are under investigation, say the health authorities.

- Sun 30 Sep 2018. Ebola: WHO: Risk of Ebola spread 'very high' -- 2 confirmed cases near the Uganda border
[The Progressive Farmer, Associated Press (AP) report, edited]
https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/news/world-policy/article/2018/09/30/risk-ebola-spread-high

The risk of the deadly Ebola virus spreading from Congo is now "very high" after 2 confirmed cases were discovered near the Uganda border, the World Health Organization says.

The outbreak of the hemorrhagic fever in north eastern Congo is now larger than the previous one in the northwest and more complicated to contain because of a dense, highly mobile population and a rebel threat so serious that some health workers say they're operating in a war zone.

A deadly attack in Beni, the heart of Ebola containment efforts, forced the work to be suspended for 2 days earlier in the week. That led WHO's emergencies chief, Peter Salama, to warn that insecurity, public defiance about vaccinations and politicians fanning fears ahead of elections in December could create a "perfect storm", leading the outbreak to spread.

As of [Fri 28 Sep 2018], the outbreak had 124 confirmed Ebola cases, including 71 deaths. The previous outbreak in Congo's Equateur province, declared over just a week before the current one was announced, had 54 confirmed cases, including 33 deaths.

This is the 1st time an Ebola outbreak has occurred in this part of Congo, affecting the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. Health workers have had to combat various rumors and fears about the disease, which spreads via the body fluids of those infected, including the dead. Some patients have left health facilities to seek alternative care, WHO said in a statement on [Thu 27 Sep 2018]. One infected person moved into a "red zone" where security is poor and carrying out Ebola response efforts is "extremely difficult, if not impossible."

The virus moved near the Uganda border after a woman who had participated in burials of Ebola victims refused a vaccination in Beni and disappeared, local officials have said. She died on 20 Sep 2018 at a hospital in Tshomia [Tchomia, Ituri] on Lake Albert, which separates the countries. The 2nd confirmed Ebola case in Tshomia was the woman's partner, WHO said.

The UN refugee agency on [Fri 28 Sep 2018] said it was "gravely concerned" for civilians' safety in North Kivu, which has the highest number of displaced people in Congo with an estimated more than 1 million. In August 2018, about 13 000 people fled their homes in the Beni area alone because of insecurity, the refugee agency said. Meanwhile some 200 refugees from Congo are arriving each day in Uganda, a "tiny fraction" of the everyday flow of traders and others between the countries, it said.

"While substantial progress has been made, the situation is precarious," WHO said of overall Ebola containment efforts. It continues to recommend against any travel restrictions.

Uganda, which has had 5 Ebola outbreaks since 2000, says it is preparing to begin vaccinations as needed. The health ministry in Congo, which is facing its 10th outbreak, says more than 12 000 people have been vaccinated so far.

[3] Orphans

The city of Beni in North Kivu province remains the epicenter of the Ebola virus disease at this 10th epidemic. Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, director of the response to this epidemic, demonstrated this on Sun 20 Sep 2018 during a press conference he hosted at the office of the health zone of Beni.

This health expert recognizes the collaboration of some inhabitants, which has facilitated the vaccination of more than 12 000 people since the beginning of the disease in the east of the country. The director of the response announced that 160 orphans of the Ebola disease have been registered, and need psychosocial help. He confirmed that they will be cared for by the Congolese government, until the declaration of the end of the epidemic.

[Children always suffer in an outbreak, in war, and in poverty. According to the ReliefWeb report from the UN Children's Fund (https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/155-children-left-orphaned-or-separated-their-parents-drc-s-latest), this figure [160] includes children who have lost one or both parents, or primary caregivers to Ebola, as well as those who have been left unaccompanied while their parents are isolated in Ebola treatment centres.

Children who lose a parent due to Ebola are at risk of being stigmatized, isolated, or abandoned, in addition to the experience of losing a loved one or primary caregiver. This group of children are particularly vulnerable and UNICEF is concerned for their wellbeing. "The loss of a parent or a loved one can be a deeply upsetting experience for a child," said Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano, UNICEF representative in the DRC. "Our mission is to protect and to assist all the children affected by the Ebola virus. As the outbreak continues, we will continue to coordinate with our partners to ensure their physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing."

UNICEF assistance to orphaned and unaccompanied children is tailored to meet the specific needs of the individual child. A newborn who has lost his mother has different needs than a school-aged child. UNICEF support to an orphaned or unaccompanied child typically includes psychosocial care, food and material assistance, and support to reintegrate into school.

Of the orphaned and unaccompanied children, 112 are school-aged and UNICEF and its partners have worked to get them back into the classroom. "Returning to school is essential for orphaned or unaccompanied children," said Dr Rotigliano. "It brings stability, a sense of belonging to the community, and hope for the future."

Children are greatly affected by the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the eastern DRC, particularly those that are orphaned by the disease or have become unaccompanied. Since the beginning of the Ebola-epidemic UNICEF and its partners have:
- trained 219 psycho-social agents to rapidly identify the specific needs of orphaned and unaccompanied children and provide assistance;
- provided food and psycho-social assistance to the 155 identified Ebola orphans and unaccompanied children in the affected areas of Beni, Mangina, Makeke, and Butembo;
- supplied school material and uniforms for the 112 Ebola orphans and unaccompanied children of school age, and paid for their school fees;
- deployed 7 nutritionists to assist orphaned and unaccompanied children in the Ebola treatment centres;
- sensitized 3163 school directors and teachers in 326 schools to support the reintegration of children affected by the disease and to avoid stigmatisation.

UNICEF continues to trace children affected by the Ebola virus disease and expand its psychosocial and material assistance as the epidemic evolves. - Mod.LK
