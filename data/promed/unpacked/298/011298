Abstract
--------
West Nile virus (WNV) is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus and is a major cause of viral encephalitis worldwide. Experimental models of WNV infection in mice are commonly used to define acute neuroinflammatory responses in the brain. Alpha-synuclein (Asyn) is a protein of primarily neuronal origin and is a major cause of Parkinson's disease (PD), a disorder characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons. Both WNV and PD pathologies are largely mediated by inflammation of the central nervous system (neuroinflammation) and have overlapping inflammatory pathways. In this review, we highlight the roles of the immune system in both diseases while comparing and contrasting both protective and pathogenic roles of immune cells and their effector proteins. Additionally, we review the current literature showing that Asyn is an important mediator of the immune response with diverging roles in PD (pathogenic) and WNV disease (neuroprotective).

The authors have summarized the early immune responses to WNV: "Following a mosquito bite, WNV initially enters the keratinocytes and Langerhans cells (LCs) of the skin. In mouse models, WNV infection results in migration of the LCs from the epidermis into the draining lymph nodes, a process mediated by interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β) and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) . Further amplification of the virus then occurs in the lymph nodes and spleen. Early immune responses to WNV are mediated by pattern recognition receptors, including retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors in the cytoplasm and TLRs. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I receptors drive downstream interferon responses, particularly IFNβ and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) target genes."

The study also highlights the mechanisms of neuroinvasion and neuronal injury: "The mechanisms by which WNV gains access to the CNS are not completely understood. WNV may cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through a few different mechanisms: transmigration of the virus through the BBB, transneuronal spread from peripheral nerves into the CNS, or through infection of immune cells in the periphery, which then act as Trojan horses to deliver virus to the brain. Proinflammatory cytokines produced during peripheral WNV infection may alter the permeability of the BBB, allowing the virus to cross. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is well known to regulate the BBB permeability. Signaling through TNF-alpha receptor 1, downstream of TLR3, promotes the WNV entry into the brain by increasing the "leakiness" of the BBB. Additionally, other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1-beta and macrophage migration inhibitory factor, can increase the BBB permeability, whereas others, including type I (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) and type III (IFN-lambda) interferons, appear to stabilize the BBB and decrease virus entry into the brain."

The study concludes, "Several studies in humans and mice have shed light on the numerous immune responses that impact both Parkinson's disease (PD) and WNV disease, and many cell types can play pathogenic roles in both diseases. We have identified Asyn, aberrations of which can be causative of PD, as a novel inhibitor of severe neuroinvasive viral disease. Further studies are necessary to define the mechanisms by which Asyn protects the CNS from damage and which factors tilt the balance between its protective and pathogenic functions." - Mod.UBA]
