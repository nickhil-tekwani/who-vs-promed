Before [GG] died of rabies, 25 of his family members went to visit him in the hospital, KSL-TV reported. That decision may cost his loved ones USD 50 000 in what were [are?] potentially "live-saving" treatments.

[GG], age 55, was the 1st first man to die of rabies in Utah since 1944, KUTV reported after he died in November [2018]. The man, of Moroni, Utah, was a father of 4 and would catch and release bats that flew into his home.

"The bats never hurt us, and we were always catching them in our hands and releasing them outside because you hear all the time about how bats are good for the insect population, and you don't want to hurt them," his wife [JG] said in November [2018], according to the Deseret News. "The bats would lick our fingers, almost like they could taste the saltiness of our fingers, but they never bit us."

The couple didn't realize the bats could have the deadly virus, the Deseret News reported. But it was a bat that likely gave GG rabies, the Utah Health State Department said, according to FOX13.

And his family didn't know he had rabies while visiting him in the hospital. They stayed with him at the hospital for 9 days as doctors ran tests, his daughter [CLS] wrote in a GoFundMe post. [The diagnosis may not be apparent early on. - Mod.TG]

"Everything [blood tests- Mod.TG] came back normal," she wrote. "This was incredibly aggravating to the doctors and to our family."

Over the course of his time in the hospital, 25 family members came to visit, according to KSL-TV.

He had seizures at first, but then his brain activity started to slow, according to the GoFundMe post. His family made the decision to take him off life support because "if he were to wake up he would not be able to function the way that he would want to," [CLS] wrote.

It wasn't until her dad died that the family learned what had killed him -- rabies, [CLS] said, according to FOX13.

The state health department called [JG] 2 days after her husband died and asked her to go to the hospital immediately, she said, according to KSL-TV. She and the other family members who visited [GG] got the recommended rabies-prevention vaccines.

In a statement provided to KSL-TV and published 31 Jan 2019, the Utah Department of Health said the family was right to get the treatment. "Preventive treatment, while life-saving and highly effective, is unfortunately very expensive," the department said. It said it will work with the family to "hopefully help them find a resolution" regarding the USD 50 000 bill.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says while the cost can vary, "a course of rabies immune globulin and 4 doses of vaccine given over a 2-week period typically exceeds [USD 3000]."

"The CDC estimates that about 1 to 3 people in the USA each year come down with rabies," McClatchy previously reported. "Symptoms of rabies include hallucinations, coma, difficulty swallowing, seizures, stiff neck, muscle spasms, irritability, headache, anxiety and death."

[GG's] family wants people to be aware of the rabies risk. "Our hope is people seeing bats in their home will contact someone else [animal control - Mod.TG] to have them removed, that they don't try to remove them themselves, that they don't touch them," [CLS] said, according to KUTV.

[This is a difficult situation for this family: the loss of a loved one, and the cost of protecting themselves. It is a lesson we all should pay attention to.

Rabies is a deadly disease but can be prevented. Knowledge is the key.

Bats can bite people, especially when they are sleeping, and the person may never realize they have been bitten. Any time bats are discovered in a home, it is time to call animal control or other authorities in your area.

So, while these bats may have licked their hands, a tiny cut could have let the virus into the body or saliva may have gotten on the mucous membranes of an open mouth or even the eyes.

Regardless of the risk of rabies, bite wounds can cause serious injury such as nerve or tendon laceration and local and system infection. Your doctor will determine the best way to care for your wound, and will also consider how to treat the wound for the best possible cosmetic results.

For many types of bite wounds, immediate gentle irrigation with water or a dilute water povidone-iodine solution has been shown to markedly decrease the risk of bacterial infection.

Wound cleansing is especially important in rabies prevention because, in animal studies, thorough wound cleansing alone without other postexposure prophylaxis has been shown to markedly reduce the likelihood of rabies.

You should receive a tetanus shot if you have not been immunized in 10 years. Decisions regarding the use of antibiotics and primary wound closure should be decided together with your doctor.

Rabies postexposure vaccinations
---------------------------------
For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.

The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.

Rabies postexposure prophylaxis consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14.

If a person has previously received postexposure vaccinations or received preexposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process.

[However, there is no value in administering rabies immune globulin greater than seven days after initiating a vaccine course, since vaccine-induced antibodies begin to appear within one week. - Mod.ML
