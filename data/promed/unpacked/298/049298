Subject: Emergency Management Warning 50: Exotic Newcastle Disease
Confirmed in the United States
All information in the following Notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last Notice was sent out.
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the State of
California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 17
commercial operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also
confirmed in a backyard flock in the State of Nevada. A backyard flock was
confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in the State of Arizona. Clinical signs
in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal
signs. Mortality is up to 90 percent of exposed birds. Investigations are
on-going and all figures are pending final validation.
Veterinary Services is exploring all options to send Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel, other federal government
personnel, and is working with the States to consider additional resources
to meet the labor demands. APHIS has developed a plan for nation END
surveillance. This plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance
underway.

educational material about END to State hunting license vendors for
distribution in their establishments. The Department is also hosting a
Turkey Hunting Expo this weekend and plans to distribute information about
the disease to attendees. Additionally, on 8 Mar 2003, the officials from
the Department will be distributing END information to participants
attending a wildlife rehabilitation seminar in Santa Barbara. A
representative from the Department serves as an Agency Representative to
Area Command.

working cooperatively with county officials to implement efficient
surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.
The Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination (AgMAC) Group met on 26 Feb 2003,
to discuss the END situation, resource availability, State personnel
legislation, and future personnel needs. The AgMAC is scheduled to have a
follow-up meeting 5 Mar 2003, and will meet weekly to address issues as

unit, ad they will be stationed at the Inland Desert Incident Command Post
(ICP).
An expert panel on poultry diseases visited the Inland Desert ICP, the
South Coast ICP, and the San Bernardino laboratory locations to discuss
testing, permitting, risk assessment, and industry relationships. Members
of the group include representatives from the Agriculture Research Service,
Penn State University, Ohio State University, and the University of
California at Davis.
