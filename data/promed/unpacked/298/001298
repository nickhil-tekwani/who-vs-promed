----------------------------------------------------------------------
Indiana State Board of Animal Health continues to receive inquires
about this post.

It appears as if the ProMED-mail post was based upon an edited version
of the press release furnished in its entirety below.

This release refers to what is known as the "Southeastern Indiana TB
Investigation". Only one Southeastern Indiana premises had cattle with
TB positive animals in the herd. There were 15 animals that were
positive all together: The original trace animal identified under
routine slaughter surveillance (a PCR positive); index herd animals
identified through caudal fold testing and subsequent Bovigam,
laboratory pathology and culture testing; and index herd animals
identified at slaughter through the depopulation process.

NO TB positive animals were subsequently identified in Indiana as a
part of contact, trace-in or trace-out herd testing. Reports to date
have not identified any animals in out-of-state trace-in or trace-out
efforts by regulatory veterinarians of the USDA or the various
states.

We hope this clarification will help our wildlife, regulatory and
veterinary colleagues better understand this joint release from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Indiana State Board of
Animal Health.

Press release [15 Sep 2011]
Bovine TB investigation ends, wild surveillance continues

<dderrer@boah.in.gov> and Phil Bloom, DNR Communications Director,
<pbloom@dnr.in.gov>

The Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) staff has completed
testing for bovine tuberculosis of all livestock herds linked to
animals associated with the infected (or "index") herd. Quarantines on
the index site, located in Dearborn County, were officially released
in August [(2011], after the site and facilities were depopulated,
cleaned and disinfected, then left empty for 60 days.

The investigation began in late December [2010], when a _Mycobacterium
bovis_-positive beef cow that tested positive at slaughter was traced
to Southeastern Indiana. Since then, BOAH staff tested more than 1000
head of cattle and 3 goats that had contact with high-risk animals
associated with the index herd. Another 174 animals in 10 states were
also traced to or from the herd.

Throughout the investigation, only 15 beef animals, all part of the
index herd, tested positive on culture for the disease. All were
euthanized for confirmatory testing.

As part of the investigation, 47 free-ranging white-tailed deer on or
near the index site were collected by Indiana Department of Natural
Resource (DNR) and the US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife
Services for testing. None tested positive for TB. Wildlife
surveillance efforts will continue during this fall's deer hunting
season.

Since 2009, more than 690 deer from Franklin, Fayette, Harrison, and
Wayne counties have been sampled for TB when hunters check their
animals at DNR stations. With the latest cattle case, that
surveillance will be expanded to include Dearborn County.

Indiana has held a bovine tuberculosis-free status since 1984 with the
US Department of Agriculture. Under federal guidelines, that status
remains. The last time a Hoosier cattle herd tested positive for the
disease was in the 1970s.

About bovine TB
---------------
Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease that affects
primarily cattle, but can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal.
TB is difficult to diagnose through clinical signs alone. In the early
stages of the disease, clinical signs are not visible. Later, signs
may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade
fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node
enlargement may also be present. Cattle owners who notice these signs
in their livestock should contact their private veterinarian.

More information about the disease and details for this fall's hunting
season will be available online at http://www.in.gov/dnr and
http://www.in.gov/boah.
