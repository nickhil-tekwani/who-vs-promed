CHOLERA, IMPORTED - UK 1996 (02)

This note highlights some of the inconsistencies associated with infectious
diseases reporting. How many cases of cholera were imported into the U.K.
in 1996?
The PHLS (above) confirmed and typed 13 isolates, presumably from 13
patients. That same year, 35 cases of cholera were reported in the U.K.
(CDR Weekly 25:7, 1997); while the U.K. reported only 2 cases to W.H.O.
(WER 71:88, 1996 and 71:124, 1996).
One of these cases is presumed to have been imported from the Canary
Islands; however, no cases were reported from Spain in 1996 (see insert
below). This inconsistency is reminiscent of my own country (Israel): each
of three of our imported cholera cases during the last 15 years originated
in Egypt; notwithstanding the fact that Egypt does not report any cases,
whatsoever.
In 1995, 46 cases of cholera were reported for England and Wales in CDR
Weekly (6:13, 1996) , and only 10 in WER (21:160, 1996). As of week 26
for this year, 13 cases have been reported in CDR and only 4 to WER.
U.K. publications in this area are themselves confusing to the outsider.
CDR publishes reports for the 'United Kingdom' and/or 'England and Wales'
(ie, excluding Scotland, Northern Ireland). Scotland, Wales, Northern
Ireland and Scotland also maintain separate publications.
Do 'cases' include diseases which later prove not to be cholera? Are
specimens (properly) submitted from all clinical cases? Do these
inconsistencies extend to all reportable infections in the U.K.? What of
the other 200+ countries which maintain internal and international
reporting schemes?
The following background material was extracted from the GIDEON software
program. Note that these data are based on the most recent figures (health
ministries, WHO, peer-review journals).

Cholera in United Kingdom:
4 cases (imported) were reported in 1991; 5 (imported) in 1992; 39
(imported, 0 fatal) 1993; 51 (imported, 0 fatal) in 1994; 46 (imported,
nonfatal) in 1995; 35 (imported, nonfatal) in
1996; 13 (imported, nonfatal) during January to June 1997.
As of 1994, 5 isolates of Vibrio cholerae 0139 had been recovered (imported
from the Indian subcontinent).
One case of cholera was imported into Scotland in 1990, 2 in 1992, 3 in 1993.

Cholera in Spain
Outbreaks were reported in 1971 and 1979. One case (imported -nonfatal) was
reported in 1991; 3 imported cases (0 fatal) in 1993; 1 (imported,
nonfatal) in 1994; 6 (imported, nonfatal) in
1995; 1 (imported, nonfatal) in 1996.

Cholera - Global status:
The current (7th) pandemic originated in Indonesia in 1961, and is due to
Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor.
461,783 cases of cholera were reported in 1992 (354,089 from the Americas);
376,845 (209,192 from the Americas) in 1993; 384,403 in 1994 from 94
countries - 42.1% from Africa and 29.6% from the Americas; 208,755 (85,809
from the Americas) in 1995. 8,072 fatal cases were reported in 1992; 6,781
in 1993; 10,692 in 1994; 5,034 in 1995.
Approximately 8,000 fatal cases were reported in Africa in 1981; 5,000 in
1983; 12,000 in 1985; 8,500 in 1987 and 4,000 in 1989.
153,367 cases (13,998 fatal) were reported by African countries in 1991 -
50,748 of these in Nigeria;
91,081 (5,291 fatal) in 1992; 76,713 (2,532 fatal) in 1993; 161,983 in
1994; 84,976 in 1996.
Infection by V. cholerae O139 began in India and Bangladesh in 1992.
Over 100,000 cases of V. cholerae O139 infection had been reported
(involving 11 countries) as of January 1995; however, this strain was
reported from only 1 country (Myanmar) in 1995.
