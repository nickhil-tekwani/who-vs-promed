["Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is a serious systemic disease of fish. The VHS virus (VHSV) is carried by at least 50 species of marine and freshwater fish. The infection is subclinical in some species, but it is associated with severe disease and high mortality rates in others. Clinical infections are economically important in farmed fish, particularly rainbow trout, turbot, and Japanese flounder. Outbreaks have also been reported in some wild populations, including Pacific herring and pilchard along the Pacific coast of North America."

"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia affects farmed rainbow trout and some other freshwater species in continental Europe and Japan. VHSV has also been isolated from a variety of wild marine fish in North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and the North American part of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This virus has also been reported from Korea."

For this and additional background information please refer to the fact sheet "Viral hemorrhagic septicemia", prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf.

"Fish infected with VHS may have hemorrhages on the body, eyes, gills, or at the base of the fins, bulging eyes ("pop-eye"), swollen (fluid-filled) abdomens, and darkened coloration. Affected fish may have abnormal swimming behavior. Hemorrhages may also be seen in the muscle and organ tissues.

"Some fish infected with VHS may show no signs of illness, but can still spread the virus and infect other fish.

"Most VHS outbreaks occur in the spring when water temperatures are less than 15 deg C (59 deg F). Deaths from VHS rarely occur at temperatures above 18 deg C (64 deg F).

"VHS has caused large-scale fish die offs. Reported death rates in some species of fish have been as high as 80-100 percent" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia_F.pdf).

There is no indication that this disease is a threat to human health (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf). - Mod.CRD
