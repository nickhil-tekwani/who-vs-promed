I shall attempt to give you something of an update on some of the
epidemiology of RHD as seen in Australia. I have recently performed
analyses on data collected retrospectively on 245 release sites in NSW [New
South Wales]. A paper arising from this work has recently been submitted
to the Australian Veterinary Journal. The following paragraphs present the
important findings and conclusions from this work.
Results - For each week following cessation of rabbit breeding activity
there was an 7% decline in the odds of an outbreak occurring. Low ambient
temperatures were associated with outbreaks, with a decrease in the odds of
disease falling by 13% for each 1C rise in mean monthly temperature in the
month following release. The presence of high flea infestations (odds
ratio 3.3) and moderate rainfall (25 to 50mm) in the month of release (odds
ratio 27.4) were also associated with the occurrence of outbreaks. However,
rainfall also was an effect modifier of temperature, whereby the sparing
effect of high temperatures was apparently reduced in months in which the
rainfall was over 50mm. Effects of lesser importance included the presence
of RHD in the vicinity of the release site, which was associated with a
mean population reduction 9% lower than those sites where RHD was not close
by. However, the prior presence of RHDV on farm was found to be associated
with an eight-fold increase in the odds of an outbreak occurring. The
presence of cattle in the vicinity enhanced population declines by 12% over
those properties without cattle. Increasing distance from the nearest
water body was associated with a decrease in the odds of an outbreak
occurring, such that for each 100 metre increment there was a 10% decline
in the probability of disease occurrence.
Conclusion - This is the first report finding a strong association between
the presence of high flea numbers, breeding activity in rabbits and
rainfall, and outbreaks of RHD. Although European rabbit flea numbers rise
in concert with breeding activity in rabbits, the two factors may act
independently. Fleas leaving dead viraemic rabbits in search of new hosts
have great potential to increase viral transmission, and breeding activity
may produce changes in physiology, behaviour and demography resulting in
enhanced transmission. Low to mild environmental temperatures which
enhance viral survival are also often associated with rabbit breeding
activity in many areas.
Moderate monthly rainfall may also stimulate breeding activity through the
promotion of high quality pasture growth. Fly and mosquito activity,
associated with proximity to cattle and water, suggests a minor role of
these flying insects in local transmission. Firm evidence for persistence
of the virus in a population following first introduction is provided by
the greatly increased likelihood of outbreaks associated with the prior
presence of RHDV in an area.
The NSW tablelands areas suffer from a reduced likelihood of outbreaks and
lower population declines than other parts of the state. Such effects may
result from a less intense and more protracted breeding period in these
cool, high rainfall areas where green feed is often available all year. An
additional factor may be the presence of a non-virulent rabbit calicivirus,
such as has been found in Europe, which may protect a proportion of the
population from the virulent disease. The presence of such a virus in the
moderate to high rainfall areas of Australia has been suspected following
testing of sera from the Cooma and other districts. These sera, collected
prior to the escape of RHDV from quarantine on Wardang Island, have
demonstrated moderate caliciviral antibody levels in a proportion of the
samples. Such pre-escape antibody levels have not been found in rabbits
from semi-arid areas where high mortality rates (>95%) were seen following
the initial RHD epidemic.
In summary, it appears as though a significant proportion of the rabbit
population must be reproducing (birth pulse) before a noticeable outbreak
of RHD will occur. In high, reliable rainfall areas breeding activity may
often occur at a low intensity and over too prolonged a period to allow
development of outbreaks associated with high flea abundance. Efforts to
artificially generate widespread and effective disease outbreaks are likely
to be met with frustration unless necessary risk factors are present in the
population or environment. Further, this association with breeding
suggests that the virus and host have developed a stable relationship
whereby outbreaks will occur only when some offspring are, by nature of age
insusceptible, thereby facilitating survival of host populations and
consequent viral persistence. If high levels of virus particles are only
present in the blood during terminal stages of this acute disease then
there will be little opportunity for mosquitoes, flies or fleas to transmit
infection from live hosts. This is especially so if there is a high
density threshold for infectious particles in the blood before successful
transmission by biting insects can occur, as has been shown for
myxomatosis. Thus, if most RHDV spread depends upon flea and fly
transmission subsequent to host death, then there will also be continuing
selection pressure for viral pathogenicity.
Additional comments - The virus released in New Zealand was illegally
derived from Australia, either a field isolate from a dead rabbit(s) or
purified virus used for releases in Australia.
New evidence involving positive PCR testing of lymphoepithelial tissues
from serologically positive rabbits suggests that a carrier state exists in
at least some recovered rabbits. It is conceivable that the stress
associated with low temperatures and rainfall events may stimulate viral
shedding and initiate outbreaks in populations in which sufficient other
risk factors are present.
