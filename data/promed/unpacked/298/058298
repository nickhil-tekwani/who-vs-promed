Green GM, Olds BA, Matthews G et al. Proceedings of the Society of
Experimental Biology and Medicine 1973;142:1162-1167 actually fed mice
unheated soybeans or the specific trypsin inhibitor (a pancreatic
protease enzyme released in the gut). Hypertrophy in the pancreas
resulted presumably because the soy equivalent binds free trypsin and
overstimulates enzyme formation in the pancreas. What these people may
be exhibiting is some kind of side effect caused by chronic
malabsorption of all proteins (it would affect everything as the
pancreas would be affected) in the gut.
One other thing. Many of the villagers may be showing signs of niacin
poisoning. Why? It's plausible since this B vitamin is the only one
that will accumulate at all, and it causes numbness and neurologic
symptoms analogous to these.
