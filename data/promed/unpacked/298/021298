More than 7500 people have now died from the Ebola virus, as the number of cases climbs towards 20 000, the World Health Organisation said today [22 Dec 2014].

The UN health agency reported that as of 20 Dec 2014, 19 340 people had been infected with the deadly virus in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and that 7518 of them had died.

The death toll in other countries remained the same: 6 in Mali, one in the United States and 8 in Nigeria, which was declared Ebola-free in October 2014...

[2] Sierra Leone: urges safe burials to stem Ebola
Date: Sun 21 Dec 2014

Sierra Leonians urge safe burials to stem Ebola
-----------------------------------------------
Dr Desmond Williams, a Sierra Leonean-American doctor who works for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], took to the airwaves in November 2014 as part of efforts to encourage people to avoid dangerous burial practices. Now similar pledges have been made by prominent Sierra Leoneans, including the communications director for the Health Ministry, pop stars and radio DJ's. Dr Williams' radio announcement is chilling and blunt:

"If I die, I want the deaths to stop with me. I want to give my family the permission to request a safe and dignified, medical burial for me."

The announcement is part of a [radio] campaign to urge Sierra Leoneans to abandon traditional burial practices, such as relatives touching or washing the dead bodies, that are fueling the spread of Ebola in the West African country. Unsafe burials may be responsible for up to 70 per cent of new infections, say experts.

But cultural traditions are hard to break. Many believe a traditional burial is necessary to make sure the dead don't return to haunt the living. A well-attended funeral where many people touch the body provides the opportunity for the disease to disperse into a crowd and then be carried long distances back to their homes, where it can seed new clusters, according to Rebecca Bunnell, a behavioral epidemiologist with CDC. People have been washing their hands more and avoiding crowded places, but changing burial traditions has proven particularly hard. "Burials and funerals are deeply, deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone," said Austin Demby, a Sierra Leonean-American epidemiologist who has also taken the burial pledge. He is the director of a US government AIDS program but has been helping with Ebola containment.

In the early days of the Ebola epidemic, some families held their own burials because teams were slow to arrive, or carried off bodies without telling relatives where they would be buried, said Bunnell of CDC. But as more teams have been put in the field and relatives have increasingly been able to watch funerals, compliance appears to be increasing...

[3] Sierra Leone: sequelae of Ebola
Date: Thu 18 Dec 2014
Source: IRIN [edited]
http://www.irinnews.org/report/100952/mystery-over-ebola-survivors-ailments


For some Ebola survivors, overcoming the lethal viral assault has not heralded a full return to good health. An array of ailments including headache, joint pains, vision and hearing problems have afflicted convalescents; experts are still uncertain of the exact cause.

Not all survivors of the virus, which has been rampant in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since earlier this year [2014] and killed some 70 per cent of patients, suffer the symptoms, the extremes of which include amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) and erectile dysfunction. It is also not yet known why only some are affected.

Margaret Nanyonga, World Health Organization (WHO) consultant clinician, who has assessed 85 Ebola survivors with various symptoms in Sierra Leone's eastern town of Kenema, told IRIN that some of the ailments were treated, but others such as vision and hearing problems tended to persist...

[4] Sierra Leone: treatment with ORS for suspect Ebola cases, rapid tests
Date: Wed 17 Dec 2014
From: Katrina Roper <katrina@ivelo.net> [edited]


I would like to provide clarification on the comment provided by moderator JW -- "Why not treat all severe fever cases in those countries now with ORS (oral rehydration solution) as long as they can still take liquid by mouth?" -- see ProMED-mail. Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (53): Canada, Netherlands, susp. 20141217.3037779.

I have recently returned from Sierra Leone, after 6 weeks in-country [September-October 2014] providing social mobilisation and IPC/PPE training to health care workers. During my time there, I visited several Ebola observation and treatment units, and also discussed strategies with the staff running the facilities. I can state that in the units in Freetown, Sierra Leone, particularly those run by the Sierra Leone staff, the standard response is to immediately commence ORS, along with anti-malarials, antibiotics and vitamins, upon admission of any patient. The strategy is to provide immediate supportive treatment to give the patients the best chance of survival.

As moderator JW observes, it is the same strategy as per treatment of cholera patients; keep the patients as hydrated as possible by ORS while they can still take liquids by mouth. Where the rapid test will be very useful will be in screening at observation units, to more rapidly identify those who have EVD and hence need to be moved to a treatment unit as a confirmed case, and to more rapidly release those who do not have the virus, hence freeing up a bed to isolate another suspect or probable case.

The rapid test will also be useful at hospital triage to help identify potential EVD patients who have presented ostensibly for another illness, for example, a vomiting pregnant woman. Being able to identify EVD positive patients more rapidly will help staff work more safely and provide appropriate care.

[5] Region: Nigerian university re-admits 100 students from Ebola ravaged countries

Nigeria: OAU re-admits 100 students from Ebola ravaged countries
----------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign students from countries with Ebola virus disease (EVD), numbering about 100, who were screened and cleared of having Ebola virus, were readmitted into the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, Osun State. The screening was conducted with the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Department of Immigration Service and clearance given to all those who were screened before they were re-admitted into the school. The re-admitted students had returned to campus to continue their studies.

Vice chancellor of the university, Professor Bamitale Omole, said [the decision to readmit the foreign students] ... was part of measures through which the management ensured that the virus would not spread to the campus...

[6] Region: Ebola-stricken families to receive cash payments
Date: Fri Dec 19 2014

Ebola- stricken families to receive cash payments
-------------------------------------------------
In 2015, the 3 Ebola-affected countries will start offering cash payments for families hit by Ebola, as well as survivors having trouble re-acclimating to society because of the stigma of the disease.

Every aspect of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone's societies have taken a hit from Ebola, and the disease has shocked what were once fragile but growing economies. Public spaces are now forbidden, so markets are empty, tourists are no longer traveling into the countries and international companies have largely pulled out, including large industries like mining. The World Bank estimates the aftershock of Ebola to already weakened economies will be "devastating".

"We are seeing a backwards slide of development of about 10 years," says Boaz Paldi, chief of media and advocacy at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). "The outlook is not good." That's why instead of waiting for caseloads to reach manageable numbers, the 3 countries, with the help of UNDP and other partners, are laying the groundwork now for rebuilding the damaged economies. One of the 1st major initiatives to be rolled out in the new year [2015] are cash transfers and payments to families who no longer have breadwinners, and to survivors out of work. Many women in the Ebola-affected countries have taken in orphaned children of their family members or neighbors, despite having no steady income.

UNDP has calculated that around USD 50 will keep a family of 5 going in the 3 countries with essential needs for one month, with some variations by country. The group is anticipating making monthly payments to 150-200 thousand people in each of the countries.

According to UNDP leaders, plans for the payment process are still being refined. Lists of names of affected families and survivors are being collected and coordinated for small pilot programs, starting early 2015, to test the effectiveness of the payments in preparation for widespread efforts...
