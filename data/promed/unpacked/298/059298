In wild populations there appear to be other non-pathogenic strains of RHDV
that differ from the "RCV" strain identified by Lavazza, Capucci et al. For
example, in a longitudinal capture-recapture study in the UK we found cases
of adult rabbits acquiring RHDV and remaining healthy (mortality is lower
in very young rabbits that acquire infection); in many cases the virus was
partially sequenced and its capsid sequence was different from that of RCV.
