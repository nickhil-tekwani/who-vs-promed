13 million Afghans at risk of contracting leishmaniasis
-------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) today launched its 1st global report on
neglected tropical diseases. In the light of an ongoing leishmaniasis
outbreak in Herat, Afghanistan, WHO -- along with the Ministry of Public
Health and the Afghan Red Crescent Society -- used this opportunity to
raise awareness about and advocate for neglected diseases in Afghanistan,
with special emphasis on leishmaniasis, a disease that threatens the health
of 13 million vulnerable Afghans, especially women and girls.

In Kabul, commonly considered as the world capital of [cutaneous]
leishmaniasis, the number of new reported cases rose dramatically from the
estimated yearly figure of 17 000 to 65 000 in 2009, mainly among women and
girls.

"This number is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as cases are grossly
underreported owing to poor diagnostic tools and the stigma that is
attached to this disease," said Peter Graaff, WHO representative to
Afghanistan.

[Cutaneous] leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted through the
bite of certain species of sandfly. The major symptom is skin sores which
erupt weeks to months after the person has been bitten.

Leishmaniasis is both preventable and curable. Preventable through bed
nets, and curable through medical treatment. "The high cost of treatment
makes it difficult to integrate anti-leishmaniasis drugs into the Basic
Package of Health Services," said Her Excellency Dr Suraya Dalil, acting
minister of public health. "I urge donors to take this cause seriously, as
it causes unnecessary suffering amongst a large number of Afghans."

"Addressing stigma, early diagnosis and early treatment is the way to go
about tackling this disease," said Fatima Gilani, director of the Afghan
Red Crescent Society. "Protecting people from leishmaniasis is affording
them the right to life with dignity."

[In ProMED-mail's last posting on leishmaniasis in Afghanistan, we cited a
study finding that 8.3 per cent of children had signs of cutaneous
leishmaniasis (Leishmaniasis ­ Afghanistan 20070508.1487). The estimated
population of Afghanistan is about 30 million, with an expected lifespan at
birth of 44 years for both males and females
(<http://data.worldbank.org/country/afghanistan>). Leishmania was ignored
under the Taliban regime and appeared as a major health problem after the
fall of that regime. - Mod.EP
