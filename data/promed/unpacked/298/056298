The community is coming together to support 2 sisters who are being treated at a Cincinnati hospital for _Escherichia coli_ [infection]. The mother of the 2 Crittenden, Kentucky, sisters says [both girls] have been at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. The 2, aged 4 and 11, are in different rooms on different floors, although their parents said they are being treated for almost the same thing.

The mother said it started with the 4 year old a few weeks ago when she fell ill. Severe stomach pains and vomiting led them to the Cincinnati Children's emergency room. "They admitted her to give her some fluids and stuff, and then they ran the _E. coli_ test on her stool, and it came back positive," [the mother] said.

Doctors immediately began treating [the child] for the _E. coli_ bacterium, but then she got worse. "She actually developed HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] from the _E. coli_. It puts out a toxin in your body, and it attacks your kidneys, so she lost all kidney function," the mother said. Two surgeries and 2 weeks of dialysis later, the 4 year old is slowly recovering, although she is still struggling to eat, the mother said.

However, they are now concerned about the health of the 11 year old; three days ago, she also fell ill. The mother said doctors gave her the same diagnosis of _E. coli_. It is not clear where the bacteria came from, the mother said, and they may never know. She also said they do not know when either of the girls will be fully recovered and released from the hospital.

[The development of hemolytic uremic syndrome confirms that the strain of _E. coli_ involved here is one of the enterohemorrhagic types, the prototypic strain being serotype O157:H7. The posting states that the girl was then treated for the _E. coli_. It is not clear what is meant, as antimicrobial therapy is felt to increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome developing.

With an incubation period of several weeks between the onset of illness of the sisters, it is certainly likely that the latter case was a household secondary case from the earlier one. The source of the 1st case is unclear. - Mod.LL
