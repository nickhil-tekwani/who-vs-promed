Foot and Mouth disease [FMD] has broken out in Chisamba District - Central Province affecting over 180 cattle.

District Veterinary Officer Allan Lianzambi says his team has since moved in to vaccinate the cattle and that 300 have since been vaccinated. He says 11 000 animals are earmarked for vaccination.

Dr. Lianzambi who says no animal has died so far, revealed to the media that the disease has affected mainly dairy animals.

[Zambia reported in April 2018 2 outbreaks of FMD serotype O in the central province which had started in March and April (2018), stating that "5 farms have been affected within Chisamba and Chibombo districts of the Central Province. All affected farms have been quarantined with movement restrictions instituted in the area".

No additional outbreaks have been reported from Zambia since. The last follow-up report, informing absence of additional outbreaks in Zambia, was submitted to the OIE on 9 Dec 2018; see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=28885. This event is regarded as "continuing".

Zambia's southern neighbor, Zimbabwe, has been experiencing a large-scale FMD, serotype SAT-2 event since mid 2018.

Epidemiological details and serotyping results of the event in Zambia, described above, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
