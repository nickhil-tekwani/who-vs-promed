Residents of Kasana Sanja zone in Kulambiro, a Kampala suburb, are
panic-stricken following the deaths of several people in the area within a
month. The latest victims of a strange disease, who died on Friday [21 Aug
2009], include 3 residents of Kasana Sanja zone.

Nakawa RDC [cannot find definition of this acronym. - Mod.SH], Mr Fred
Bamwine, who has since visited the area, has appealed to the police and
Kampala City Council authorities to investigate the cause of the deaths.

According to an uncle who was staying with one of the recently deceased
residents, the disease 1st killed their mother in July 2009. "She woke up
in the morning, and all seemed okay, but we were surprised to be informed 2
hours later that she had died. And on Friday [21 Aug 2009] at 2 a.m., my
nephew called us from his bed saying he could not see anything, though he
could hear our voices. He also felt a heavy chest. Moments later, he died.
Victims of the disease do not show any signs of illness. They simply go
blind and feel a sudden heaviness in the chest, which stops them from
breathing, and within a matter of hours, they die."

Kira Road Police Station DPC confirmed the deaths. "We have recorded 7
deaths in the last one month in Kasana LC1 Kulambiro village Sanja. We are
still waiting for the medical report."

[This strange disease has claimed 9 people in 4 weeks, all residents of a
Kampala suburb. The common symptoms prior to death include blindness and
respiratory symptoms. These would suggest methanol poisoning, in which
visual effects and metabolic acidosis are the hallmark. The same symptoms
may, however, manifest in other types of poisoning, including iron,
salicylates, or diseases like diabetic ketoacidosis and uremia.

The probabily of methanol poisoning will be strengthened if the history of
ingestion can be elicited, which, therefore, needs to be established by the
investigations that are currently going on.

There were related reports, 3 months ago, of 5 deaths in the Western Uganda
town of Kasese following consumption of liquor packed locally in the town
<http://www.newvision.co.ug/PA/8/13/680686>. The investigation into those
cases was not conclusive, but it is possible that all these reports point
to unregulated brewing of alcohol products in the country, especially in
the rural areas.

In 2007, 40 people with a presentation similar to the symptoms of the
current deaths died in Kampala and nearby districts after drinking a toxic
local gin. The investigation into those cases by the Ministry of Health
revealed that the cases had been exposed to a local gin that contained too
much methanol <http://www.newvision.co.ug/PA/8/13/680686>.

Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing
world, where methanol is often a component of bootleg alcohol, which is
made in rural regions. Because of its low cost, it is often consumed by
those in lower socioeconomic classes. Methanol has a relatively low
toxicity, hence the adverse effects are thought to result from the
accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. Formic
acid metabolism is very slow, hence accumulates in the body, leading to
metabolic acidosis.

Initial symptoms occur 12-24 hours after ingestion and in general correlate
with the volume of methanol ingested and the amount of ethanol
concomitantly ingested. The minimal lethal dose is believed to be 1 mg/kg
body weight. Initial symptoms include disinhibition and ataxia followed by
headache, nausea, and vomiting or epigastric pain. These are then followed
by drowsiness, seizures, and eventually coma. Visual symptoms like flashes
of light, blurring, scotomas, and scintillations occur and may progress to
complete visual loss. Prompt medical care is hence vital to avoid
complications secondary to methanol intoxication. Supportive therapy is
aimed at initiating airway management, correcting electrolyte disturbances,
and providing adequate hydration. The metabolic acidosis may necessitate
administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate
potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help
to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the
methanol is eliminated from the system, either naturally or via dialysis,
often accomplished in 2 ways: ethanol or fomepizole. Ethanol is also
metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and the enzyme has 10-20 times
higher affinity for ethanol compared with methanol. Fomepizole is also
metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high costs and
lack of availability. <http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1174890-overview>.
