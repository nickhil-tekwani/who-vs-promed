The Regional Government of Andalusia confirmed yesterday 17 Nov 2015, the death of a child less than 2 months old in the Virgen del Rocio hospital in Seville, in September 2015, making it 2 dead girls in less than 3 months of age, after the death of a newborn baby of 18 days recorded in late October 2015 in Malaga. In both cases the mother of the children had not been vaccinated. In view of this case, Andalusian authorities have planned to include the vaccine for all pregnant women starting on 1 Jan 2016.

The Community of Madrid will also begin vaccination in 2016. The [President of the Community of Madrid], Cristina Cifuentes, said that the decision responds to the recommendations of experts from the Vaccine Advisory Committee and indications agreed to by the Public Health Commission of the Interterritorial Council of the National Health Service, after assessing the nationwide increase in cases of whooping cough in recent years and the highest incidence in children younger than 1 year, an age group in which the disease can be severe.

The new vaccination strategy of the Community of Madrid includes pertussis vaccine for pregnant women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy (between weeks 28 and 36). It is safe for pregnant women and protects the baby early in life until the immunization sequence for pertussis (combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids - Mod.LL] begins, with doses at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A booster is administered at 6 years of age. However, following the recommendations of experts, Madrid plans to adjust the calendar as a result of the worldwide shortage of vaccine and is expected to suspend temporarily the dose given at 6 years of age until the situation is resolved. The disease is far more deadly in infants than in children who have already received the initial doses.

According to the National Epidemiology Center (NEC), until October 2015, the cumulative number of pertussis cases nationwide was 6816, almost triple compared to those recorded during the same period of the previous 5 years. Regional reports show data along the same lines. For example, in Aragon, in 2015 there has been a remarkable increase in the incidence (71 so far in 2015, against the 12 expected). If during the period between 2000 and 2006 an average of 1 death per year was recorded, between 2011 and 2014, the average annual deaths increased to 5.5, all young infants. So far in 2015, there have been 4 known deaths, according to the National Epidemiology Center.

The Spanish Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics (SEGO) already warned of the surge of cases a year ago after conducting a study of prevalence of the disease. It is for this reason that the recommendation to vaccinate all pregnant to avoid infection in newborns was established. "There has been an increase in cases because there are women from other countries who have not been vaccinated or because there is a tendency not to vaccinate," explains Jose Maria Lailla, professor of gynecology at the University of Barcelona.

There are 7 autonomous communities in Spain that recommend vaccination between weeks 27 and 36 of gestation (Catalonia, Asturias, Navarra, Valencia, Basque Country, Canary Islands, and Extremadura) after it was observed that in recent years, the incidence in Spain has increased to 325 cases per 100 000 in infants under 30 days old. The line followed by these regions is similar to that of other European countries, such as the UK, that follow the same recommendation

[Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.

A newly released study now links an increased risk, albeit small, for the development of epilepsy in individuals who had a hospital-diagnosed case of pertussis:

Olsen M, Thygesen SK, Ostergaard JR, et al: Hospital-Diagnosed Pertussis Infection in Children and Long-term Risk of Epilepsy.
JAMA. 2015; 314(17): 1844-9. doi: 10.1001/jama.2015.13971.

Importance:
Pertussis is associated with encephalopathy and seizures in infants. However, the risk of childhood epilepsy following pertussis is unknown.

Objective:
To examine whether pertussis is associated with the long-term risk of epilepsy.

Design, setting, and measures:
We used individually linked data from population-based medical registries covering all Danish hospitals to identify a cohort of all patients with pertussis born between 1978 and 2011, followed up through 2011. We used the Civil Registration System to identify 10 individuals from the general population for each patient with pertussis, matched on sex and year of birth.

Exposures:
Inpatient or hospital-based outpatient diagnosis of pertussis.

Main outcomes and measures:
Cumulative incidence and hazard ratio of time to hospital-based epilepsy diagnosis (pertussis cohort vs general population cohort), adjusted for birth year, sex, maternal history of epilepsy, presence of congenital malformations, and gestational age. Unique personal identifiers permitted unambiguous data linkage and complete follow-up for death, emigration, and hospital contacts.

Results:
We identified 4700 patients with pertussis (48 percent male), of whom 90 developed epilepsy during the follow-up. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy at age 10 years was 1.7 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval], 1.4-2.1) for patients with pertussis and 0.9 (95 percent CI, 0.8-1.0) for the matched comparison cohort. The corresponding adjusted overall hazard ratio was 1.7 (95 percent CI, 1.3-2.1).

Conclusions and relevance:
In Denmark, risk of epilepsy was increased in children with hospital-diagnosed pertussis infections compared with the general population; however, the absolute risk was low. - Mod.LL
