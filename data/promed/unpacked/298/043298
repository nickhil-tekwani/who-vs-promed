The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported yesterday [9 Sep 2008]
Taiwan's 11th death from enterovirus infection [hand, foot & mouth
disease] so far this year [2008]: a 2-year-old boy in the central
county of Changhua. According to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih
Wen-yi, the case was a sporadic one, because the enterovirus season
is not at a peak in the county. "The public should not panic too much
because of this case," Shih said.

The latest victim came down with a fever, vomiting and vesicular
eruptions in the mouth on 26 Aug 2008 and was hospitalized on 29 Aug
2008 when he further developed a skin rash. The boy was discharged
from hospital 2 days later, according to a report provided by
Changhua health authorities. However, on 1 Sep 2008, the boy was
again hospitalized after he took a sudden turn for the worse. He died
on 4 Sep 2008, the authorities said.

CDC statistics showed that from the start of this year to 8 Sep 2008,
a total of 352 severe enterovirus infections were recorded in the
county, 11 of which were fatal and 93 percent of which were caused by
enterovirus type 71 (EV71). Of these 352 cases, 97 involved one-year
olds, 96 affected 2-year-olds and 63 were children under the age of
one, the statistics showed. The largest number of cases occurred in
the central and southern parts of Taiwan, with 49 cases in Tainan
County and 48 in Changhua County, according to the CDC.

While this year's [2008] enterovirus outbreak slowed down noticeably
following the start of the summer vacation in July 2008, a new peak
was expected after school reopened this month [September 2008]. Shih,
however, said no suspected cases of severe enterovirus infection have
been reported since 1 Sep 2008, which indicated that the expected
peak has not occurred.

Shih reminded the public that sporadic enterovirus infections can
occur in Taiwan even when the virus is not in season, and he advised
people to maintain good hygiene to prevent infection and avoid
passing the virus to young children in their families.

[The death of another child is distressing, but the good news is that
the expected 2nd phase of the enterovirus 71 epidemic that has swept
through Asia this year (2008) does not seem to be materializing, in
Taiwan at least. - Mod.CP]
