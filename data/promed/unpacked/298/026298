[On 28 Sep 2007, Nigeria notified the OIE of the reoccurrence of ASF
in Kan Hawa, Kumo, Akko, Gombe; the previous report dated back to
2005. Reportedly, the disease started on 5 Jul 2007 and was confirmed
on 28 Aug 2007; diagnosis was based upon clinical signs and necropsy
findings. No laboratory involvement (tests or results) was reported.
This is the most recent information on ASF in Nigeria and is
available on OIE's website at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6261\>.

The current report, kindly forwarded by Dr Babalobi, looks like a follow-up.

The case is regarded as suspected; further information is requested. - Mod.AS]
