A mass outbreak of food poisoning at a governor's ball in the
Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk was caused by a flagrant disregard of
sanitary and epidemiological norms, the Russian prosecutor general's
office reported on Tue 6 Mar 2007.
The ball, hosted by Krasnoyarsk Governor, Alexander Khloponin, on 1
Mar 2007, brought together more than 1400 people, 232 of whom were
suffering from symptoms of food poisoning as of 6 Mar 2007.
So far, 212 guests have been hospitalized with symptoms of
salmonellosis. "We have identified a number of people who were
involved in the making of salads and hors d'oeuvres," a spokesperson
said.
