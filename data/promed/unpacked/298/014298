SALMONELLA INFECTIONS - UK (Scotland)

From: Robert A. LaBudde <ral@lcfltd.com>
Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
Eight people have been confirmed as suffering from Salmonella D and a further
seven are showing symptoms after eating cooked meats traced to a butcher's
shop in St. Boswells in the Scottish borders.
According to the story, some of them ate cooked meat at a bowling club tea
held in the borders town on the weekend. A 67-year-old woman and a 27-year-
old man are being treated at Borders General Hospital but are not giving
doctors cause for concern. Bowling teams from St. Boswells, Galashiels,
Hawick and East Lothian had attended the competition and every person has
been alerted to the situation.
The article goes on to say that samples from the meat and swabs from
equipment used by the unnamed butcher had been taken and health chiefs were
waiting for the results. The butcher involved has voluntarily withdrawn all
cooked products from sale and has agreed to sell only raw meats until further
notice.
The story advises that anyone who has bought anything other than uncooked
meats from the shop in St. Boswells should take it for analysis to the
Protective Services Department at Scottish Borders Council or dispose of it.
An Outbreak Control Team had been set up and has informed the Scottish Office
and the Scottish Centre for Infection of the incident. As laboratory tests
results become available, the number of confirmed cases are expected to
increase.
