Brazil (Minas Gerais): Death Due to Hanatavirus Infection in Pratapolis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The personnel of the Division of Epidemiology of the State Secretariat of
Health (SES) [of Minas Gerais] confirmed on 27 Feb 2003 a death due to
hantavirus infection in the municipality of Pratapolis, the southwest of the
state. The technical personnel issued precautions that the population
should take, not only against hantavirus but with all forms of hemorrhagic
fevers.
During the year 2002 there have been 7 deaths reported due to hantavirus
infection. The areas with the largest number of cases were the Triangulo
and the Southwest of Minas. "The number of deaths [due to hantavirus
infection] was greater in 2002 because a new area appeared with the disease,
the southwest" explained Mariana Gontijo, the state reference person for
hantavirus.

[The last hantavirus-associated death in Minas Gerais occurred in early
December 2002 and was confirmed in January 2003 (see ProMED-mail post:
"Hantavirus infection - Brazil (Minas Gerais) 20030110.0079"). As stated
previously, hantaviruses are transmitted through the urine and feces of wild
rodents, and the principal symptoms are fever, severe headache, muscle
pains, and respiratory and renal problems. Each species of hantavirus has a
distinctive rodent host. At least 3 different hantaviruses, _Juquitiba
virus_, _Ararquara virus_, and _Castelos dos Sonhos virus_, have been
associated with cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Brazil (see:
Johnson, A.L., et al., Journal of Medical Virology 59, 527-535, 1999).
Information on the identity of the virus and the specific rodent host
responsible for this and previous fatal cases of hantavirus infection in
Minas Gerais would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
