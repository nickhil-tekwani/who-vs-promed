Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been notified by Environmental Science and Research of a cluster of human illnesses linked to the bacterium _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_.

While cases are reported each year, there has been an increase in cases, mainly in Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland, but reports have also come from the Bay of Plenty, Waikato, Hawkes Bay, and Otago/Southland. There is a total of 101 confirmed cases and 41 presumptive (suspected but yet to be confirmed) nationwide. A total of 38 people have been hospitalized. The increase has been observed since mid-August 2014 with the majority of confirmed cases occurring in September 2014.

_Y. pseudotuberculosis_ causes stomach pain and can present symptoms that mimic appendicitis. Diarrhea can occur but is rare. It has a 3 to 21 day incubation period.

MPI is working to determine the source of the outbreak. At this stage, the source has not yet been identified, but _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ outbreaks overseas have been linked to contaminated fresh vegetables and fruit, contaminated water, and animal contact.

We believe there is a credible link that food is the likely source, but it is too early to be certain about the source of this pathogen and direct people away from foods that have no proven risk for consumers.

The people who have become ill with _Yersinia_ have been interviewed on what foods they have been eating and this information has been cross-referenced, giving us sources to investigate further. It is important to note that MPI's investigation is over a range of foods.

Packaged carrots and lettuce are being blamed for a painful epidemic of food poisoning sweeping through New Zealand. Nationwide, more than 100 people have been reported as suffering from symptoms mimicking appendicitis, including from the Bay of Plenty.

Toi Te Ora (Public Health Service) has recorded 5 people from the Bay of Plenty suffering from the stomach bug, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_.

The bacterium can cause painful stomach pain with or without diarrhea and can be extremely unpleasant for the person involved.

Chief medical officer of health Phil Shoemack said Toi Te Ora recorded 4 cases in the Lakes district and 1 from the coastal Bay. "This is an unusual cause of food poisoning. That's why it sticks out -- to have more than 100 cases around the country within 2 weeks is most unusual," he said. "It appears to be related to consumption around carrots and packaged lettuces but we haven't managed to track an actual suspect yet."

Dr Shoemack said Toi Te Ora was working collaboratively with Wellington health officials in finding the exact cause behind the outbreak but there was still a lot of information unknown. "We've spoken to each of the cases about what food they consumed in the days prior to getting ill and it appears the most likely risk factors are the carrots and lettuces which are pre-packaged.

"It appears loose fruit and vegetables are not involved. It's very much a day by day investigation and hopefully we are getting closer to nailing what it is."

Dr Shoemack said the issue was likely to be a batch problem, and if so it should dissipate soon.

For now, he reminded people to take extra care with personal hygiene when preparing and consuming food and washing any raw fruit and vegetables thoroughly.

The symptoms of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ include:
- abdominal pain (often on the lower right), which may mimic appendicitis,
- fever,
- sometimes diarrhea.
- About 1-3 weeks later, you may get a rash and joint pain. The joint pain can last up to 6 months.

In rare cases _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ infection can lead to sepsis (infection in the blood). This is more common in people with weakened immune systems.

[The following is extracted from Tauxe RV: Salad and pseudoappendicitis: _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ as a foodborne pathogen. J Infect Dis. 2004; 189(5): 761-3 (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/189/5/761.long):

"Though it is relatively rare in humans, infection with _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ is a recurrent problem in animals. _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ likely has several zoonotic reservoirs around the world. The organism causes a fatal plague-like illness in the guinea pig and significant epidemic illness in the European brown hare. It causes enteric illness in domesticated sheep and has been problematic enough among farmed deer to lead to the development of a vaccine for those animals in New Zealand. In addition, the organism has been isolated from the feces of healthy swine and from a variety of other mammals and birds in Eurasia. Thus, it would not be unexpected to find this organism in the deer or hares that inhabit the areas near the fields where the implicated lettuce was grown.

This natural history may provide a glimpse into the evolutionary origins of another major pathogen, _Y. pestis_, which is exceedingly close to _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ genetically. The 2 pathogens are so closely related that Achtman et al. recently proposed that _Y. pestis_ diverged clonally from a progenitor _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ strain within only the last 20 000 years, basing this hypothesis on multilocus sequence typing. Acquisition of 2 plasmids by _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ may have permitted the new variant to circulate via the flea, as well as via the fecal-oral route."
