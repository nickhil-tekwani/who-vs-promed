[The suspicion of PPR in northern Uganda was included in
ProMED-mail's posting 20070325.1037 of 25 Mar 2007, which concluded:
"Laboratory confirmation on the current recorded outbreaks in
Uganda's Karamoja sub-region is anticipated, followed by official
notification to the OIE." Both expectations have now been fulfilled,
adding Uganda to the growing list of declared PPR-infected countries.
The recent 1st notifications of PPR from countries like Kenya, China
(Tibet) and now Uganda, may reflect improved surveillance and
diagnostic efforts rather than new introductions into the said
realms. - Mod.AS]
