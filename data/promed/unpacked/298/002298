This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Ontario, Toronto
Started on: 11 Jan 2022
Ended on: 2 Feb 2022
Epidemiological unit: Other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dogs / - / 1 / - / 1 / - / -

Affected population: Dog was imported from Iran in June 2021. It presented clinical signs of rabies on 11 Jan 2022 and was euthanized on 16 Jan 2022. The geographic coordinates do not represent the actual location of the animal.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: The rabid dog was imported from Iran on 28 Jun 2021. It developed clinical signs of rabies on 11 Jan 2022 and was euthanized on 16 Jan 2022. Rabies diagnosis was confirmed on 19 Jan 2022. Results from virus characterization by genetic sequencing confirmed the dog was infected with a canine rabies virus variant previously reported in Iran and Iraq. Follow-up investigation identified 42 human contacts. All human contacts were located and 37 were given post-exposure prophylaxis. All relevant domestic animal contacts were also traced and are being appropriately managed. The rabid dog had no contact with any other wild or domestic animals during the risk period for virus shedding. This is the 2nd case of dog-mediated rabies reported in Canada since the 1960s; both cases were reported in the past 7 months and occurred in dogs imported from Iran (date of last occurrence then 12 Jul 2021).

[The rabies exposure described above is the same exposure as was described in section 4 of an earlier posting: ProMED Rabies (03): Americas (USA, Canada) animals, human exp 20220205.8701273. However, at the time of the initial investigation strain typing was not available to know the origin of the virus infecting this unfortunate animal. We are grateful to Howard Shapiro for drawing this to our attention. - Mod.SH

Dogs with rabies are commonly found in Iran (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/iran).

"Rabies is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system of mammals, including humans. Once clinical signs appear, rabies is almost always fatal in animals and people. In Canada, the animals that most often transmit rabies are bats, skunks and foxes.

"In Canada, rabies is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals Act, and all suspect cases must be reported to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA)" (https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/rabies/eng/1356138388304/1356152541083).

"Human rabies is rare in Canada. This is largely due to excellent prevention and control programs." Further information is available at https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/rabies/surveillance.html#a1. - Mod.CRD
