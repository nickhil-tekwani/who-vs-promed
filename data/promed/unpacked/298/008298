Seven die, 75 infected by dengue fever in Bangladesh
----------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is spreading at an "alarming rate" in Dhaka, virologists,
doctors and hospital sources in the Bangladeshi capital said Friday. At
least 75 cases of dengue fever have been detected in hospitals in the city
in the last week, the sources said. Seven patients, including 2 children,
have died in the last 2 weeks.
Prof. Nizoral Islam, head of the Virology Department at Bangabandhu Medical
University Hospital and a member of a WHO Expert Advisory Panel on Viral
Disease, described the situation in Dhaka as alarming. "The sudden
emergence of dengue-carrier mosquitoes in a crowded city such as Dhaka
worries us very much because mosquito habitation is growing unchecked," the
professor said.
According to the World Health Organization, worldwide cases of dengue
infection are increasing dramatically. In Bangladesh, it is considered as a
re-emerging disease. Globally, 50 million cases of dengue infection are
[estimated to occur annually.

Dengue in Dhaka up-date, 20 Jul 2000
---------------------------------------
A significant number of dengue cases have been reported during the last two
weeks in Dhaka, Bangladesh. So far, seven persons died out of estimated
four hundred reported dengue cases. Two vector mosquito species (_Aedes
aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_) have been recorded in significant numbers in
Dhaka city area. The Breteau Index of _Aedes_ was recorded to be 138 in a
recent survey (July, 2000). In 1997, the Breteau Index was recorded to be
30.8 [mosquito-positive containers per 100 premises - Mod.ES
The government has acted promptly and already formed a high powered
committee to monitor the situation. Dhaka City Corporation which has the
responsibility of controlling mosquitoes has launched a media campaign to
raise the level of awareness among the general public about the importance
of larval control in discarded cans, pots, tyres, etc. The Zoological
Society of Bangladesh and Safeway Pest Control, a local R&D oriented pest
control firm, recently have organized a discussion meeting to review the
dengue situation in Dhaka. So far, no dengue case has been reported from
other cities of Bangladesh.

Dengue/DHF - Bangladesh (Dhaka) - Appeal for help
--------------------------------------------------
The Bangladeshi government has sought international help for diagnosis and
treatment of dengue fever which was said to have assumed an alarming
proportion, the Bangla-language daily Ittefaq reported here Friday. Quoting
laboratory sources, the daily said at least 10 people were killed by the
disease in the capital alone in two weeks, and around 60 percent of 500
patients have been tested dengue positive. The reagents essential to test
dengue have been exhausted, the sources told the newspaper. Prof. Nazrul
Islam of Virology Department and Prof. Ruhul Amin of Microbiology
Department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said they have
run out of reagents. Health Minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim said steps
have been taken to bring reagents from abroad through the World Health
Organisation (WHO). Reports from different hospitals and clinics throughout
the Dhaka city suggested that dengue fever is spreading at an alarming
rate.
A WHO report said Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions are the areas
where dengue fever has taken the most serious turn. Before 1970, only nine
countries had experienced DHF (Dengue hemorrhagic fever) epidemics, but the
number had increased fourfold by 1995. Some 2.5 billion people worldwide
are at risk of catching dengue fever.

Dhaka in grip of dengue fever
-----------------------------
Potentially fatal dengue fever is spreading at an alarming rate in Dhaka,
killing eight and putting at least 100 people in hospitals in less than
two weeks, The Independent daily reported on Monday. At the Dhaka Medical
College Hospital, 35 patients are being treated, while another 90 were
reported to have been taken to Shishu hospital. However, doctors at Shishu
confirmed treating only 20 patients. Earlier last week at Birdem, a major
hospital for diabetics, 31 people were brought in to be treated, causing
alarm the disease could have reached epidemic levels. Nazrul Islam, an
expert on virology at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University and
Hospital warned that unless the spread of the mosquito - which carries the
disease - was checked, the situation could be worse next year. Last year,
46 cases of dengue were detected in Dhaka of which 10 were fatal.

[The Xinhua report mentions that around 60 percent of 500 patients have
been tested positive but does not mention what testing has been reported,
whether testing has consisted of paired sera or single serum samples.
Readers should be reminded that there was a major epidemic of dengue fever
in Dhaka last year, peaking in the period September to November. More
information on the current outbreak would be very much appreciated,
including the age distribution of cases, and hemorrhagic cases, as well as
information on which serotype of dengue is prevalent. As indicated in the
report from Maj. Chowdhury, during the winter months of this year [December
through March 2000, the Dhaka City Corporation was making significant
efforts to control mosquitoes in Dhaka City, with daily rounds of mosquito
fogging activities, and educational campaigns for breeding site reduction.
If there is anyone out there with information on the assessment of the
impact of these activities, please share it with us. Mods.MPP/CP
