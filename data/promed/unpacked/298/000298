A free ranging, white-tailed deer in Genesee County died due to complications from epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD], a viral diseased spread through a type of biting fly called a midge.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources [DNR] Wildlife Disease Laboratory and the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory announced the finding [Wed 20 Sep 2017] and is asking residents to keep an eye out for dead deer in the county.

"Although this has been a single deer death at this point, we are asking for hunters to look around as they hit the field to let us know if they find dead deer, especially any near water," said Tom Cooley, DNR wildlife pathologist.

While there is no evidence the disease can be passed on to humans, the DNR wants to monitor the spread of the disease to ensure the safety of animals in the state.

When infected with the disease, deer lose their appetite and fear of humans, before growing progressively weaker. The DNR says that due to a high fever and dehydration, infected deer will often make their way toward water to hydrate and lower their body temperature. This usually results in deer being found sick or dead along or in bodies of water, according to the DNR.

More than 12 000 deer died from the disease in 2012, but those numbers were down significantly since then. There is no known cure for the disease despite it being prevalent in the US for several decades.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in many USA states. The current occurrence of the disease appears to be at its normal levels, although in Michigan it was last reported in October 2016. - Mod.PMB
