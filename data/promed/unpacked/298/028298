Deschutes County Health Department officials confirmed a local woman died [Wed 13 Jun 2018] from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], a disease [virus] transmitted through rodent droppings.

The woman, 67, and her husband, lived in Redmond but also maintained a home in the 3 Rivers community in Culver [Jefferson county].

According to a neighbor, she had come to the Culver home before Memorial Day to prepare for a family visit.

"They have a loft in their barn that they use for extra sleeping," said a neighbor and friend. "She had gone out with a Shop-vac. She didn't know, as well as most people didn't, that you should wear protective gear and all that stuff."

Hantavirus exposures usually occur after breathing in the virus when rodent urine and droppings are stirred up into the air. People can also become infected when they touch mouse or rat urine, droppings, or nesting materials that contain the virus, and then touch their eyes, nose, or mouth. The disease [virus] is not spread from person to person, and cats and dogs cannot transmit hantavirus infections to people.

"A lot of times it will happen after an area has been closed up for a while, a summer home or a barn, something like that. They go in and they do spring cleaning, and there are mice droppings everywhere," said Heather Kaisner, a spokeswoman for the health department.

[The neighbor] said she saw her friend at the 3 Rivers Community Church on [3 Jun 2018], but the next day [the woman] came down with what they both thought was the flu. On [7 Jun 2018], she was having trouble staying awake and her husband called 911.

[The woman] was admitted to the ICU at St Charles Redmond, and on [Sat 9 Jun 2018], was placed on a ventilator. She was airlifted to Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland on [Sun 10 Jun 2018], where she died [Wed 13 Jun 2018].

"She was in good health," [her neighbor] said. "You would have never in a million years thought she would have been gone in a week."

The case is the 23rd hantavirus infection in Oregon since 1993, and the 7th in Deschutes county. Officials from the Deschutes and Jefferson counties health departments are working with Oregon Public Health officials to investigate the case. They have not completed their investigation and could not yet confirm how or where [the woman] had been infected.

The incubation period from infection to the point when symptoms first appear can range from 1-6 weeks.

"It's pretty rare, but it is a very deadly disease," Kaisner said.

According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 35 percent of those infected will die from the disease.

Symptoms include tiredness, dizziness, fever and chills, muscle aches and headaches, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, and coughing. More severe symptoms may include shortness of breath or severe difficulty breathing. The virus can trigger an inflammatory reaction that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a condition characterized by blood leaking into the lungs, affecting both breathing and circulation.

There is no vaccine to prevent infection and no treatment for the condition, said Dr Jon Lutz, an infectious disease specialist at Summit Medical Group Oregon-Bend Memorial Clinic who was not involved in Farr's care. "You just have to avoid exposure," he said.

Health officials stressed that prevention starts by rodent-proofing homes and by taking precautions when cleaning up rodent droppings.

"All of us don't think about it. We've got some mouse droppings, let's clean it up," Kaisner said. "You definitely don't want to take the vacuum out and have it aerosolize. That's when you breathe it in."

Most of the cases in Oregon have occurred east of the Cascades, and are linked to deer mice. "The deer mouse is present throughout the United States. It's not like there's more in Eastern or Western Oregon," Oregon Public Health Veterinarian Dr Emilio DeBess said. "Does Eastern Oregon have more hantavirus than Western Oregon? We don't know have that answer."

[The victim's friend] described her as "the kind of person who always put everybody else first." She was part of a Bears and Quilt group at the 3 Rivers Church that sewed teddy bears and donated them to Jefferson County Emergency Medical Services to hand out to young patients. "She was always trying to help people out and make things easier for everybody," Hunt said.

[This case illustrates how quickly a hantavirus infection can proceed from a febrile disease to full-blown HPS. The report above indicates that the woman was present in several settings where her Sin Nombre hantavirus might have been acquired. Although this is the 1st case of Sin Nombre virus infection in Oregon this year (2018), there was a recent case reported from the neighboring state of Washington (see ProMED-mail archive Hantavirus - Americas (33): USA (WA), Panama (LS) 20180504.5784821). Cases were reported in Oregon last year (2017). Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections occur annually across the western USA including occasionally in Oregon. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the source URL above (2nd image).
