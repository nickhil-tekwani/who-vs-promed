A 70-year-old Wisconsin man died after contracting rabies last year
[2010], the 3rd case of the rare disease in Wisconsin since 2000.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that all 3
cases involved had known or suspected contact with bats, and only one
of the 3 victims survived.

State officials would not say where the man lived or was treated.
However, contributors to the report include doctors from Aurora Health
Care in Milwaukee and West Allis.

The man sought treatment in December 2010 and died 13 days later.

The CDC says the man's wife reported bats were present when they were
selling firewood, although he did not report a bite.

His wife and grandchild and 5 health care workers received the rabies
vaccination as a precaution.

[The authorities were extremely slow in positing notice of this, but
as fall season is upon the northern portion of the US, this serves as
a warning. If there is close contact with bats, report it, and seek
medical assistance.

Bites may occur, and the victim may not realize they have been bitten
or brush it off as a scratch from the firewood or the construction
material or other events. A brush with bats or other suspicious
wildlife should be reported. Treatment with post exposure prophylaxis
may have saved this man's life. - Mod.TG]
