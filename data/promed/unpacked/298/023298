White-nose fungus confirmed in Missouri bats
--------------------------------------------
A deadly disease that has killed millions of bats in the northeastern U.S. in recent years has been confirmed for the 1st time in Missouri, the state Department of Conservation said. The disease, called white-nose syndrome, was discovered in 3 bats from 2 public caves in Lincoln County. The name describes a white fungus typically found on the faces and wings of infected bats.

The U.S. Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, confirmed the disease in a little brown bat in one of the caves and 2 tri-colored bats in a 2nd cave north of St. Louis, the department said.

Evidence of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome was first detected in Missouri in April 2010 on a little brown bat found in a private cave in Pike County. A month later, signs of the disease was noticed on 5 federally endangered gray bats and on a northern long-eared bat netted outside a public cave in Shannon County.

The disease spreads mainly through bat-to-bat contact and hasn't been found to infect humans or other animals. The specific names and locations of the Lincoln County caves where the diseased bats were found aren't being disclosed to prevent disturbance of any remaining bats. The caves are closed to public access.

[It is not completely clear whether it was the disease that was confirmed or just infection by _Geomyces destructans_. If the fungus was found in diseased/dead bats, information on the estimated attack rate (ill/at risk) would be valuable.
