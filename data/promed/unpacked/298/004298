[1] Liberia: possible sexual transmission

Possible Sexual Transmission of Ebola Virus -- Liberia, 2015
------------------------------------
What is already known on this topic?
Ebola virus persists in seminal fluid following recovery, but the duration of viral shedding and the likelihood of sexual transmission are not known. Earlier studies have demonstrated that the virus can be isolated from semen as long as 82 days after symptom onset, and that semen can be positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, indicating presence of viral RNA, up to 101 days after onset. Possible sexual transmission was reported in 1968 for Marburg virus, a related filovirus, but has not been clearly documented for Ebola.

What is added by this report?
Ebola virus can persist in the seminal fluid of convalescent men for longer than previously recognized and can potentially lead to sexual transmission of Ebola.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Until more information is known, contact with semen from a male survivor should be avoided. If male survivors have sex (oral, vaginal, or anal), a condom should be used correctly and consistently every time. Additional studies are planned to examine Ebola virus persistence in body fluids of male and female convalescent patients and the likelihood of sexual transmission... - much more

[Scientists can't say definitively, but it appears that the Liberian woman contracted Ebola from unprotected sex with a male Ebola virus disease survivor. Previously, it was believed that the Ebola virus can survive in semen up to 82 days after a patient is considered cured, but there has never been a documented case of this happening, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. Tests of the man's semen, performed 199 days (6-1/2 months) after he 1st developed symptoms, found Ebola RNA. This suggests the genetic material can remain in semen much longer than previously known. However, another woman he had sex with around the same time tested negative. - Mod.LK]

[On 18 Sep 2014, a man was tested Ebola-blood-negative in West Africa. He was finally released from airport quarantine in New Delhi after testing Ebola-semen-negative in mid-March 2015, 6 months after he was declared Ebola-free in West Africa; see ProMED archive (61) below. - Mod.JW]

Cluster of Ebola Virus Disease, Bong and Montserrado Counties, Liberia

Abstract. Lack of trust in government-supported services after the death of a health care worker with symptoms of Ebola resulted in ongoing Ebola transmission in 2 Liberia counties. Ebola transmission was facilitated by attempts to avoid cremation of the deceased patient and delays in identifying and monitoring contacts.

[Zambia's Parliamentary Committee on Health has been assured that the Copperbelt Provincial medical team has put in place measures that will help minimize the risks of an outbreak of the Ebola virus. This is a prudent precaution because it now seems possible that Ebola virus is widely distributed, undetected, in wildlife in forested areas of Africa. - Mod.JW]

Fri 1 May 2015 USA: "Health care equity key to Ebola fight:" doctors, nurses petition Obama
http://www.pnhp.org/news/2015/may/%E2%80%98health-care-equity-key-to-ebola-fight%E2%80%99-doctors-nurses-petition-obama
[A petition was sent to President Obama, from more than 1400 health professionals, who say the Ebola epidemic is linked to global inequality and that African nations will require sustained US aid to build up their health systems. The authors call for a commitment by the United States to provide USD 8.4 billion annually (the equivalent of a single day's health expenditures in the USA) to Ebola prevention and treatment efforts in West Africa, and to build up the health infrastructure in Africa. - Mod.LK]

[It is self-evident that the health infrastructure in Africa needs to be built up, but that will take decades. My personal view is that as no epidemic was set off in the USA by the various imported cases, it might make more sense for the money to be spent in providing proper isolation facilities and training in large state hospitals to handle suspect cases of dangerous infectious diseases. - Mod.JW]

http://www.pnhp.org/news/2015/may/%E2%80%98health-care-equity-key-to-ebola-fight%E2%80%99-doctors-nurses-petition-obama

[In the same petition sent to President Obama, the authors call for a commitment by the United States to establish a public pharmaceutical company to develop drugs and vaccines in the public interest, given that private drug companies "failed to pursue an urgently needed Ebola vaccine because it offered little prospect of financial gain." I don't think a public pharmaceutical company would be able to compete for expert scientific staff with the existing pharmaceutical giants, who should be given financial incentives to compete to produce the best product the fastest. - Mod.JW]

Fri 1 May 2015: WHO approves China's Ebola test

Sat 2 May 2015 USA: Ebola virus stability on surfaces and in fluids in simulated outbreak environments
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/7/15-0253_article
[Abstract. We evaluated the stability of Ebola virus on surfaces and in fluids under simulated environmental conditions for the climate of West Africa and for climate-controlled hospitals. This virus remains viable for a longer duration on surfaces in hospital conditions than in African conditions and in liquid than in dried blood.]
