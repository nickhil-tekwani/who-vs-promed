The Ministry of Health has asked Ghanaians to remain calm as the National Technical Coordinating Committee (NTCC) works to bring the outbreak of bird flu under control.

"The public should remain calm. The situation is being technically and expertly handled by the NTCC," a statement from the Ministry said.

For the past month, there has been an increase in the mortality of birds, particularly in the Greater Accra Region. On 12 May 2015, the Veterinary Services Directorate laboratory diagnosed influenza type A in a dead bird, which was further confirmed at the Noguchi Memorial Institute as H5N1.

Following these preliminary results, a number of interventions have been instituted by the Veterinary Service Directorate and the Ministry of Health in anticipation of the final results.

A further confirmatory result as influenza type A H5N1 was later received from the International Reference laboratory in Italy. Thus, Ghana has been declared as having a bird flu outbreak.

The statement said although the current bird flu threat to humans remains very low, a screening of the people on the affected farm is being conducted as a precaution.

"All poultry farmers have been alerted to increase their levels of bio-security and to ensure that people do not unnecessarily enter their farms," it said.

The statement said the NTCC would continue to organize more education and publicity programmes to educate the public about prevention measures to keep the bird flu disease out of their farms and homes.

At this stage, the public is assured that it is still quite safe to eat chicken, the statement said, adding that it was not advisable for the public to touch or handle any sick or dead birds with bare hands.

The public must also report the death of any bird to the nearest local veterinary or agricultural officer whilst desisting from dressing and eating sick or dead birds.

In addition, poultry products (chicken, turkey, duck, eggs) must be cooked properly (above 70 C [158 F]) before eating, as is the cultural norm in Ghana.

The statement asked the public to contact the local vet or agricultural officer if they find any sick or dead birds.

For further information, please contact the Director of Veterinary Services/Head of Public Health (VSD) on 0244289782 or Director of Public Health (GHS), 0244417911.

Since the year 2003, when outbreaks of bird flu (avian influenza) were reported in Southeast Asia, Ghana has continued to monitor the global situation. In Ghana, intensive efforts have been put into the surveillance of the disease, and a national response has been prepared.

There have been outbreaks of avian influenza in other African countries, including Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Ivory Coast within the past 2 months.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joe Dudley

[The initial "immediate" notification on the HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Ghana (3 outbreaks) was submitted to the OIE on 2 Jun 2015, notifying about 3 outbreaks that reportedly had started on 13 Apr 2015. The immediate notification ascribed the causal agent to "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5." In follow-up report No. 1, submitted 10 Jun 2015, an additional (4th) outbreak was reported, and the completed diagnosis was included, performed by the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Italy (OIE's Reference Laboratory). Applying reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the strain was designated HPAI H5N1.

Ghana has become the 5th H5N1-infected country in West Africa, joining Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire and Niger. - Mod.AS
