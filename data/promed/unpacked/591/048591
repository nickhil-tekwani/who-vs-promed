Greece confirms 1st case of bird flu in EU
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu was confirmed inside the borders of the European Union today [Mon
17 Oct 2005] when Greece said that at least one case had been detected on
an island in the Aegean.
The Agriculture Ministry said the H5 virus had been detected on a turkey on
the island of Chios. It was not yet clear whether the bird was infected by
the H5N1 sub-strain, which has claimed at least 60 human lives in Asia.
Chios is in the eastern Aegean, only a couple of miles at its closest point
from western Turkey, where an outbreak of bird flu at a turkey farm,
confirmed as H5N1, has brought a major cull. The virus has also been found
in wildfowl in Romania's Danube delta.
News of the outbreak in Greece came as Patricia Hewitt, the Health
Secretary, told the Commons that the Government was taking the prospect of
a bird flu pandemic -- if it crosses across into humans -- "very seriously"
and its latest contingency plans would be published on Thursday [20 Oct 2005].
"As the chief medical officer has stated, most experts believe it is not
question of whether there will be another severe influenza pandemic, but
when," she said. "We take this threat very seriously. The Government has
been taking increasing action, particularly over the last 12 months, to
prepare."
Officials in Croatia said today [Mon 17 Oct 2005] that the country had
started testing dead birds found by citizens for possible avian flu,
although no cases had yet been confirmed. The former Yugoslav republic is
on a key migratory route linking the Russian Far East and northern Europe,
where millions of birds overwinter after leaving Siberia.
"Until recently, people simply did not notice dead birds, but now they see
them everywhere and immediately call the police," a Croatian agriculture
ministry official told Reuters, commenting on a newspaper report that 10
dead starlings found near Zagreb were sent to a veterinary institute for
testing.
"We react promptly to every report, take samples and analyze them, but so
far nothing has been found. People are really overreacting, but we are
taking all precautionary measures," the official said.
Staff at the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire have
started testing some 2000 birds to make sure that none of their resident
flocks of geese and ducks are carrying avian flu. Thousands of migratory
swans and geese will be arriving at the center over the next few weeks.

Greece Confirms 1st Bird Flu Case
-------------------------------------
Greece has confirmed the 1st bird [flu] case after the emergence of
positive results on 8 dead birds found in the northeastern Evros river
delta over the weekend [15-16 Oct 2005].
According to state-run television as quoted by Sky News, tests for the
deadly H5N1 strain of the flu are pending.
Officials have feared the spread of the disease is likely because it also
sits on one of the busiest migratory routes from Europe to Africa.
"Our operation is in full swing," Agriculture Minister Evangelos Basiakos
has earlier told reporters. "We have over 1000 vets and employees on duty
at the moment. There should not be any panic. Our labs are working, the
system is working."
In another main migratory route, Croatia had started testing dead birds
found by citizens, becoming the latest country to begin testing birds after
dead animals were found.
Bulgaria -- which borders Turkey, which confirmed H5N1 among domestic fowl
last week [2nd week October 2005] -- has tested scores of dead birds. But
here officials said they had not yet found any suspected cases of the virus.
The virus found in birds in Romania and Turkey is the same deadly H5N1
strain that has killed 60 people in southeast Asia.
The infected farms have been sealed off and their birds destroyed, but
there are fears that wild birds may already be infected and could spread
the disease as they migrate.

Tests on dead birds in Evros
-----------------------------
3 dead birds found in Evros, northeastern Greece, were sent for tests at
the Thessaloniki Veterinary Laboratory. 2 of the birds were found in
Orestiada and one in Soufli.
The EU Foreign Ministers meet in Luxembourg tomorrow [18 Oct 2005], while
EU veterinarians call for stronger measures in addition to the banning of
the imports of poultry and poultry products from Romania, where bird
culling continues to avert the spread of the disease.
The Serb Health Minister expressed support for the initiative undertaken by
Greek Health Minister Nikitas Kaklamanis for a meeting of the Balkan and
Black Sea countries.
Samples of migratory birds continue to be taken in Evros after the bird flu
cases recorded in Romania and Turkey.
During the weekend [15-16 October 2005], the Veterinary Department at the
Prefecture of Evros in cooperation with the Hunting Association of
Alexandroupolis collected 20 more samples of migratory birds to be sent for
tests to the Thessaloniki Veterinary Laboratory, while the results from the
tests conducted on the 1st 40 samples of migratory birds sent 5 days ago
will be out before the end of the week [3rd week October 2005].

An official notification with epidemiological and laboratory-confirmatory
