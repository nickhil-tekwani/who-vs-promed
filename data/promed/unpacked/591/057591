Acute hepatitis of unknown etiology: technical briefing 3
---------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
This briefing is produced to share data useful to other public health investigators and academic partners undertaking related work. Although a detailed clinical case review is also taking place, that data is not shared here as, given the small number of cases, there are some risks to confidentiality.

Cases:
As of 16 May 2022, there have been 197 cases of acute non-A-E hepatitis with serum transaminases greater than 500 IU/L identified in children aged under 16 years old in the UK since 1 Jan 2022. This is the result of an active case finding investigation commencing in April [2022] which identified retrospective as well as prospective cases. A total of 11 cases have received a liver transplant; no cases resident in the UK have died.

New cases continue to be identified across the UK, including cases that meet the case definition and reported cases that are pending classification. Potential reporting lags mean that the rate of new cases is uncertain, though the current rate is more consistent with plateauing than exponential growth. Cases pending classification are usually those in which laboratory testing to rule out known causes of hepatitis has not been completed.

Working hypotheses:
The working hypotheses have been refined. The leading hypotheses remain those which involve adenovirus; however, we continue to investigate the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 and to work on ruling out any toxicological component.

Associated pathogens:
Adenovirus remains the most frequently detected potential pathogen. Among 197 UK cases, 170 have been tested for adenovirus, in whom 116 (68%) adenovirus was detected. Among cases the adenovirus has primarily been detected in blood. On review of some of the adenovirus negative cases it was notable that some had only been tested on respiratory or faecal samples, and some had been tested on serum or plasma rather than whole blood (whole blood being the optimal sample). It is therefore not possible to definitively rule out adenovirus in cases.

SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in 25 cases of 169 with available results (15%). SARS-CoV-2 serological testing is in process. A range of other possible pathogens have been detected in a low proportion of cases and are of uncertain significance, with some of these under further investigation, including adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV6). The inclusive nature of the UKHSA case definition intentionally will pick up some cases of non-A-E hepatitis with recognized causes.

Adenovirus characterisation:
Typing by partial hexon gene sequencing most commonly shows that the adenovirus present in blood is type 41F (27 of 35 cases with an available result, 77%). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been attempted on multiple samples from cases but the low viral load in blood samples, and limited clinical material from historic cases, mean that it has not been possible to get a good quality full adenovirus genome from a case as yet.

Metagenomics:
Metagenomics undertaken on blood and liver tissue has detected primarily adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV-2) with certain samples containing reads from human adenovirus and herpes virus among others. One adenovirus 41F (ADV F41) consensus sequence has been generated from a case fecal sample using metagenomics, and when placed in a phylogenetic tree sits with other ADV F41 samples. Additional data from both cases and controls is required to further investigate the role of ADV F41 in these cases.

It is not unusual to detect bystander, reactivating or other incidental species during metagenomic sequencing; however, given the presence of AAV-2 in a number of cases, the significance is being explored through testing of additional sets of controls.

Toxicology:
Toxicological investigations continue and samples have been analyzed from all patients for organic compounds, volatile compounds and metals where there were appropriate samples. Paracetamol was detected in some patients and, as far as can be ascertained from the information available, its use appears to have been for therapeutic purposes and below toxic levels. Other therapeutics have been detected and among these, fluconazole was investigated more closely and the relationship to therapeutic use and levels are being further assessed. No metals that might be causative was apparent, though some were found to be at higher levels than expected which might be due to pathological change. For organic compounds the current focus is on mycotoxins. Some mycotoxins have been detected in these samples but are not differentially present in cases compared with controls.

Part 1. Working hypotheses
--------------------------
The following hypotheses are all being actively tested by the investigations in process. There are increased pediatric acute non-A to E hepatitis presentations due to:
1. Abnormal adenovirus infection, due to one of:
a. Abnormal susceptibility or host response which allows adenovirus infection to progress more frequently to hepatitis (whether direct or immunopathological), for example from lack of exposure during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
b. An exceptionally large wave of normal adenovirus infections, causing a very rare or under-recognized complication to present more frequently.
c. Abnormal susceptibility or host response to adenovirus due to priming by a prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 (including omicron restricted) or another infection.
d. Abnormal susceptibility or host response to adenovirus due to a coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 or another infection.
e. Abnormal susceptibility or host response to adenovirus due to a toxin, drug or environmental exposure.
2. A novel variant adenovirus, with or without a contribution from a cofactor as listed above.
3. A post-infectious SARS-CoV-2 syndrome (including an omicron restricted effect).
4. A drug, toxin or environmental exposure.
5. A novel pathogen either acting alone or as a coinfection.
6. A new variant of SARS-CoV.

Part 3. Case definitions and summary data for cases in the UK
-------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Case definitions
[See original URL - Mod.LL]

3.2 Summary data on cases in the UK
As of 16 May 2022, there are 197 confirmed and possible cases in the UK. Of these, 144 cases are resident in England, 26 in Scotland, 15 in Wales and 12 in Northern Ireland (see Figure 1). Between 21 Jan and 16 May 2022, 11 children in the UK meeting the case definition have required liver transplantation. For the purposes of this summary, all confirmed and possible cases will be referred to as cases. The public health agencies of the 4 nations continue to work with the NHS to classify reported case-patients who have incomplete laboratory information (referred to as 'pending').

3.3 Outcomes
Clinical outcomes for 197 cases (at time of clinical notification or interview with parent/guardian) are shown in Table 1. All cases are being followed up for outcome at 28 days after presentation to health services. No cases have died. Of the 197 cases, 180 reported hospitalization, of whom 11 have required transplantation. It should be noted that the case definitions require high transaminases, and it is possible that there are milder cases which have not been reported.

Figure 1. Cases by week of presentation, 1 Jan to 16 May 2022
See figure at original URL but weekly numbers have continued to drop since epidemiological week 13 pending delayed reporting.

3.4 Possible exposures
Investigations have included interviews of parents conducted by public health specialists to assess a broad range of different exposures (trawling questionnaires), as reported in the Acute hepatitis: Technical Briefing 1. In the first 60 case patients in England with data available, no notable features or common exposures were observed in travel, family structure, parental occupation, diet, water source or potential exposures to toxicants, and no association with prior immunosuppression. The public health agencies of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland report similar findings through their investigations. Public Health Scotland also report that there are 2 pairs of epidemiologically linked cases.

As detailed in Technical Briefing 2, routine questionnaires found that about 70% of children affected, whose families were interviewed, reported recent contact with pet dogs. This finding has been further examined against healthcare data and virological data including adenovirus typing. There is no difference between children with dog contact and those without dog contact in either the patterns of illness or virological detections. As noted in Technical Briefing 2, trawling questionnaires explore many areas of potential exposure, as part of wide-ranging investigations and in identifying areas for more focused investigation. From our extended investigations, there is nothing to indicate a role of dogs in the hepatic syndrome, there are no public health concerns regarding dog contact and the hepatic syndrome. This is no longer an active line of investigation by public health agencies. About three quarters of respondents in data for England mentioned paracetamol use. Details of further investigations into paracetamol are included in the toxicological section of this briefing.

Part 4. Cases in England: descriptive epidemiology and clinical data
--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Cases in England
As of 16 May 2022, there were 144 confirmed and possible cases in England. There are no known epidemiologically linked cases in England. Forty-eight potential cases in England are awaiting classification pending further data (see Figure 2). Cases are predominantly aged between 3 and 5 years old (77; 53.5%), median age 3 (interquartile range: 2 to 4 years) and 50% are female. The majority are of white ethnicity (113 out of 131; 86.3%) where information was available.

Figure 2. Notifications by week of presentation to care and investigation status (Case and pending classification) in England, 1 Jan to 16 May 2022
[For the entire figure, see original URL but it parallels the overall UK numbers - Mod.LL]

4.2 Clinical features
The commonest presentation reported in cases remains jaundice (99 out of 144; 68.8%) followed by vomiting (83 out of 144; 57.6%). Pale stools were also frequently reported (42.7%). Gastrointestinal symptoms were commonly reported at presentation including diarrhea (43.1%), nausea (25.7%) and abdominal pain (36.1%). In addition, lethargy (48.6%), fever (28.5%) and less frequently, respiratory symptoms (18.1%) were reported. Note that the denominator includes those who have reported the symptom, absence of symptom and unknown (missing information).

Part 5. Cases: pathogen investigations
--------------------------------------
5.1 Potential pathogens detected through routine clinical testing: all UK cases
Cases have been tested for pathogens at or around the time of admission. Test choice is a local clinical decision and not all cases have been tested for the same pathogens (from 8 Apr 2022, UKHSA recommended a panel of tests to perform on all cases). All hospital admissions would have SARS-CoV-2 tests. Testing information is gathered from a variety of sources, including direct reports from clinicians, direct reports from laboratories, information from UKHSA reference laboratories and from linkage to data sources including Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) and the COVID-19 Unified Sample Dataset.

Adenovirus remains the commonest pathogen detected (Figure 3). Of 197 UK cases, 179 were tested for adenovirus. Adenovirus was detected in 116 (68%), and not detected in 54 cases. Nine cases have results pending, 5 were not tested, and no information is available for 13 cases. On a review of some of the cases tested for adenovirus which were negative, it was apparent that several had not been tested in whole blood (the preferred sample type), and additional retrospective testing is being explored.

A more detailed breakdown of pathogen results for cases, where available to UKHSA, is provided in Figure 3 [See original URL. - Mod.LL].

5.2 Adenovirus
Adenovirus was the commonest pathogen detected. In England adenovirus was detected in 91 of 122 cases where results are available (75%). Further analysis below relates to cases from England. Further details on adenovirus testing can be found in Technical Briefing 2.

For cases in England, by sample type based on the data reported, adenovirus was detected more commonly in blood or serum samples from cases (77 out of 97; 79.4%), than in stool (43.9%) or respiratory (27.3%) samples; however, a consistent sample set has not been tested for most cases (see Table 2 [for table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). The detection of enteric adenoviruses in blood is so far not accompanied by detection of enteric adenovirus in stool at the same time, but in a handful of cases an enteric adenovirus has been found in blood, with a different adenovirus found in fecal or respiratory materials, indicating a possible mixed infection.

Of the 31 cases where adenovirus was not detected, 13 had no testing on blood reported, which appears to be the most relevant sample type for the syndrome, and there are potential performance differences between assays in clinical use. Therefore, the presence of adenovirus cannot be definitively excluded in sample types other than blood when it is not detected. Thirty-five of the 77 cases with adenovirus in blood have been successfully subtyped, of which 27 (77%) are type 41F. Of the 8 England-resident patients who required a liver transplant, 7 were tested for adenovirus in blood samples and the virus was detected in all 7. Five were successfully subtyped, as 41F.

Sample analysis
---------------
The summary of findings as of 13 May 2022, in different sample types is based on samples submitted (real world data). There is considerable variation in samples that have been submitted for each case. Each sample has been tested using 2 different PCR targets, Hexon gene PCR and Fibre gene PCR. Hexon gene PCR target is a pan adeno detection system whereas the Fibre gene detects enteric adenoviruses 40 and 41. PCR detection tests are based on published studies.

Using the dual PCR target approach, there is good concordance for detection of adenovirus in blood using both targets, showing a similar distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) values for detection. Cycle threshold (Ct) values are based on the number of cycles conducted before detecting the virus on a PCR test. The fewer cycles needed to detect the virus, the more virus there is in the sample (and therefore higher viral load).

Figure 5 indicates that whole blood is a better matrix for detection of adenovirus than serum/plasma and the use of serum or plasma alone for diagnostic detection will miss the detection of an adenovirus in the majority of cases (with the caveat that the paired samples received may not have been identical in timing). Not all samples have yielded sufficient material for genotyping through partial genome sequence analysis. There is evidence of mixed infections in several cases involving several different subtypes. Adenovirus 41 has not so far been found in fecal samples from cases, even where the case has detectable adenovirus 41 in blood.

5.3 SARS-CoV-2
For cases resident in England, 13 cases tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission (PCR or lateral flow device), of 123 cases with available test data (10.6%). An additional 3 cases tested positive in the 8 weeks prior to admission (1 of whom was negative on admission) giving a total period prevalence of 16 out of 125; 12.8%. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the hepatitis case cohort is broadly consistent with NHS pillar 1 COVID-19 testing and the ONS infection survey prevalence; more focused investigations are required to determine any role of SARS-CoV-2 in the hepatic syndrome. Serological testing of cases is in process to explore prior infection further, however, the high population cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 will make the interpretation of this data challenging. Seven cases were co-infected with adenovirus and SARS-CoV-2.

5.4. Metagenomic sequencing - blood and liver analyses
Metagenomics data from 28 UK samples, of which 10 samples (9 cases) sequenced at GOSH, and 18 samples (9 cases) from Medical Research Council-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (MRC-CVR) have been analysed. Sample types include 8 liver samples, 7 fecal, 6 blood, one rectal, and 6 throat.

Analysis of metagenomics data from blood and liver samples (n = 14) has been initially performed using Kraken2. One sample contained insufficient viral reads for further analysis. Viral reads in the remaining 13 samples show adeno-associated dependoparvovirus A in all samples. Four samples contain reads mapping to human adenovirus, which includes viruses such as Adenovirus 41F. All samples also contain reads identifying as Human Herpes Virus, including viruses such as HHV6. Work is ongoing to determine sub-types. Four of 8 liver samples also contain human polyomavirus. The classifier used in initial analysis does not have the specificity required to identify species and subspecies. Work is ongoing.

It was previously reported that adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) was detected in both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) fractions through metagenomic analysis, in samples from cases in England and Scotland. Analysis is ongoing.

One adenovirus 41F consensus sequence from a case fecal sample has been generated from metagenomic data by MRC-CVR. This sample contains 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) not present in ADV 41F background sequences from Genbank. Analysis of blood and liver metagenomic samples identified as containing ADV 41F reads was performed, but sequence data were of insufficient quality to generate consensus sequences for comparison. Further WGS of ADV 41F is required. A tree containing the MRC-CVR faecal sample alongside background samples is shown in Figure 6 [See original URL. - Mod.LL]. The tree contains currently unpublished GOSH samples, as well as a non-case recent WGS fecal sample.

Academic and clinical centers which have or can generate adenovirus WGS data are asked to share consensus genomes to an International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration such as GenBank to assist characterisation of circulating adenovirus strains internationally.

Part 6. Cases: Toxicology investigations
----------------------------------------
As of 17 May 2022, 222 samples have been received from 145 confirmed cases and 77 age-matched controls from the biobank. Of these, 170 are serum or plasma, 29 urine and 23 whole blood. The 145 confirmed case samples are from 44 patients, reflecting multiple time-point samples from several patients. Of the samples from confirmed cases, 69 were obtained within 5 days of presentation or hospital admission, 27 within 5-10 days and 26 were from more than 10 days after presentation or admission. The remainder cannot currently be staged due to missing information. Sera from 41 confirmed cases and 28 controls have been analysed by Liquid Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC/HRMS) in all modes (see below), 28 cases and 23 controls by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) and 24 cases and 1 control by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) for metals. The ICPMS analysis is initially quantitative and so not as dependent on a control comparison as the LC/MC and GC/MS.

LC/HRMS targets substances with different chemistries: polar and nonpolar, each with positive and negative ionisation for organic molecules and metabolites. GC/MS is being used for volatile and semi-volatile organics and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) for metals/elemental analyses. The LC/HRMS gives a qualitative report of the masses of chemicals detected in the samples, where there is a sufficiently strong signal. These masses and fragmentation patterns are compared against a variety of databases to derive possible substance identification. Differential observed response for each mass is compared between controls and cases to determine potential substances of interest. Upon identification potential causative substances identified can then be compared to a reference standard, if this is available, for confirmation of identity and quantitative assessment. The 1st samples obtained were from late-stage cases and yielded hundreds of organic substances consistent across patient samples, but many (such as bile acids, bile salts and therapeutics) are related to the pathophysiology or management of acute hepatitis. Several therapeutic moieties including antibiotics, ursodeoxycholic acid, vitamins, paracetamol and fluconazole have been detected. Some of these have been reported as being administered in hospital as part of case management. Paracetamol and fluconazole have been investigated in more detail because of their known relationship with liver injury dependent on dose and individual susceptibility.

Paracetamol:
The levels of paracetamol have been quantitated, with plasma and urine levels in the collected samples and in early samples below those at which liver injury would be expected. Additionally, most strongly positive samples are late stage, indicating use in hospital (confirmed for some cases). It therefore appears highly unlikely that paracetamol is causative, with one caveat that the very low levels (below limits of quantitation) detected in the early samples could reflect dosing several days prior to sample collection, when most paracetamol will have been excreted prior to presentation. To fully discount paracetamol as causative, it is necessary to know when paracetamol was used prior to sample collection and at what dose. This information is being sought.

Fluconazole:
This agent has been associated with drug-induced liver injury in a small percentage o individuals, reflecting individual susceptibilities. This compound has been detected in 4 early samples and one late sample. It has not been quantitated but was easily detected and identified. Detection likely reflects use on or near admission and therefore is unlikely to be causative but as with paracetamol more information on therapeutic use (time/dose) is being sought.

Mycotoxins:
Mycotoxins are known to cause liver injury with a pathology like that seen in these patients. Some mycotoxins have been detected in these samples but are not differentially present in cases compared with controls. It is likely though that most that may be causative in these cases will have been excreted prior to or soon after presentation. Nevertheless, standards and other necessary materials are currently being procured to set up the analysis method and mycotoxins will be the focus of work moving forward.

"Do not be afraid but be alert." That was one Indonesian health expert's advice to parents as the country reassessed the status of its rising number of pediatric acute hepatitis cases with no known cause.

On Wednesday [18 May 2022], the Indonesian health ministry said it has identified 14 suspected cases of the illness. Authorities were waiting on test results of 13 of these cases before they were to be classified as probable cases, The Jakarta Globe reported.

Earlier, 27 suspected cases were reported but they were "discarded" after results proved reactive to hepatitis A, B, or other pathogens, the health ministry's spokesman Mohammad Syahril was quoted as saying.

The nation is among those in South East Asia, including Malaysia and Singapore, where cases have begun to appear in recent weeks. Some children with confirmed cases of acute hepatitis needed liver transplants, while others, sadly, have died.

[As reported by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 18 May 2022 (https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0518-acute-hepatitis.html), many of the American cases were identified by "look back" and were not new cases since the initial alerts.

This did not seem to be the case from recent WHO data whose (https://bit.ly/3MFpb7k) epicurve, although showing a handful of cases reported with a date of onset of illness in late 2021, began to spike upward at epidemiological week 9 of 2022 [week of 1 Mar 2022] (6 cases/week) peaked at week 15 [week of 11 Apr 2022] (44 cases) and then dropped sharply, and now as shown in this UKHSA report above, this trend appears to be continuing. As noted in the summary, the WHO stated "as severe hepatitis can take some time to develop after the onset of the 1st symptoms and as investigations take time, there may be a delay in the reporting of cases. The recent decrease in cases is therefore challenging to interpret."

The most current UKHSA report of 19 May 2022 further extends the numbers but there remains more to learn. The leading candidates to be involved continue to be adenovirus serotype 41 and SARS-CoV-2 perhaps working together to produce an immunologically mediated hepatocyte injury as presented in the ProMED post "Hepatitis, undefined, global (14): children, poss. mechanisms, 2021-22 20220514.8703250". Until a definitive cause is found, it remains to be shown how many of the reported cases are due to the same etiology and how many subclinical or mild cases have occurred. - Mod.LL]
