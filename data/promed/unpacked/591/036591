Mosquitoes carrying a possible life-threatening virus may be buzzing around your neighborhood. Officials said the 2nd case in the state this year [2018] of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was found in a horse in Onslow County, [North Carolina], last week. It was confirmed the horse died of the virus.

"We did have a case of EEE, and it infected a horse . . . get this, a disease very similar to humans from a bite of a mosquito," said Pamela Brown, community relations officer for the Onslow County Health Department. Brown said symptoms vary. Some people may experience no sign of EEE, but others may experience flu-like symptoms. "If folks have a sudden onset of heat, fever, chills, headaches, or vomiting, we want them to contact their provider and let their provider know," Brown said.

Officials said it's important to let your doctor know, because the symptoms can get much worse. "Those symptoms can turn into things like seizures and coma and, in rare cases, this disease can be fatal to humans," Brown said.

So what's the best way to protect yourself? Brown said you can do so by using the basic common methods to battle mosquitoes, like making sure you don't have standing water around your house. "Use insect repellent according to the directions, and wear long sleeves or long pants if the temperature is not too warm. Make sure there are no holes in the screens of the house so the mosquitoes can get inside. Make sure you don't have standing water in any form around your house, because [without it], it's hard for them to reproduce. You can actually cut down on the number of mosquitoes in the neighborhood."

[We reported this Onslow, NC, equine case earlier (see 13 Jul 2018 Eastern equine encephalitis - USA (11): (NC) new case 20180713.5903958). And yes, humans can catch an EEE infection, so one should be on the lookout for it. The further north you live in the USA, the more severe the symptoms are likely to be. So be cautious. Here in Louisiana, where we have mosquitoes nearly year-round (they disappear for a short while following the occasional frost), there is a significant herd immunity in the human population; hospital cases are rare, and recovery is assured. On the other hand, EEE is lethal in horses, so make sure your horses are vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ
