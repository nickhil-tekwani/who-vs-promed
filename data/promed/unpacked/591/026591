Mumps cases in Otago have spread to the point where Public Health South is now working to manage the infectious disease, rather than contain it.

The outbreak is believed to follow outbreaks in Auckland and parts of the Pacific.

Since late 2016, there have been more than 1662 "probable or confirmed" cases of mumps notified nationwide, and Public Health South has recorded an increase in cases in Dunedin, Oamaru and Queenstown.

As a result, Medical Officer of Health Dr Keith Reid said the organisation had moved to a "manage it" phase.

"This means that there are now too many local people with mumps for case-by-case investigations to control the outbreak, and efforts will focus on vaccinating populations at risk."

The MMR vaccine is free and is available from general practices and student health centres.

From 1 Jan 2017, to yesterday [Thu 17 May 2018], 195 cases of mumps were notified in Otago, 90 of those were confirmed, he said.

"Many of the Dunedin cases are connected to the University of Otago and associated with student travel to areas affected by mumps outbreaks.

"Cases in Oamaru are associated with travel to overseas areas affected by mumps outbreaks and by subsequent local transmission within a school community.

"Queenstown cases have been connected to several workplaces and travelers."

Contact tracing will now be patient-led and Public Health South has developed a range of resources to support clinicians and patients with their diagnosis and management.
