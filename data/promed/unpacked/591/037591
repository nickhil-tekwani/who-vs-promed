Impatiens necrotic spot virus in Greenhouse-Grown Potatoes in New York State.

publication 9 Dec 2004.
Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV; genus _Tospovirus_) was detected in
experimental greenhouse-grown potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_) and _Nicotiana
benthamiana_ in New York State in July and August of 2003 and 2004. Potato
leaves exhibiting necrotic lesions with a concentric pattern similar to
those induced by Tomato spotted wilt virus (1) were observed on cvs.
Atlantic, Huckleberry, NY115, and Pentland Ivory. The presence of INSV was
confirmed using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
and a rapid 'ImmunoStrip' assay (Agdia, Inc., Elkhart, IN).
INSV-specific sequences were amplified from total RNA extracts using
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with 'Tospovirus Group'
primers (Agdia, Inc.) and 2 independently amplified DNAs were sequenced. A
common sequence of 355 nucleotides (GenBank Accession No. AY775324) showed
98 percent identity to coding sequences in an INSV L RNA. The virus was
mechanically transmitted to potato and _N. benthamiana_ and could be
detected in asymptomatic, systemically infected potato leaves.
Stems nodes and leaves were removed from infected potato plants, and
sterile in vitro plantlets were established (2). None of the regenerated in
vitro plantlets of cvs. Pentland Ivory (6 plantlets) or NY115 (5 plantlets)
were infected with INSV. 2 of 10 regenerated cv. Atlantic plantlets
initially tested positive, but INSV could not be detected after 6 months in
tissue culture. In vitro tissue culture plantlets could not be established
from infected cv. Huckleberry plants, even though they were consistently
obtained from uninfected plants.
Infected greenhouse plants were grown to maturity and the tubers harvested,
stored for 6 months at 4 deg C, and replanted in the greenhouse. INSV could
not be detected in plants from 26 cv. Huckleberry, 4 cv. NY115, or 4 cv.
Atlantic tubers. Although this isolate of INSV was able to systemically
infect potato, it was not efficiently maintained or transmitted to progeny
tubers. This might explain why INSV has not been reported as a problem in
potato production. Lastly, in both years, dying _N. benthamiana_ provided
the 1st sign of a widespread greenhouse infestation of INSV in a university
facility housing ornamental and crop plants. INSV induced a systemic
necrosis in _N. benthamiana_, and this host may be useful as a sensitive
'trap' plant indicator for natural infections in greenhouse production.

[This disease is a conundrum, of sorts because it involves production of
potato in an experimental glasshouse rather than a production field. Under
the growing conditions prevailing in the glasshouse, the virus failed to
replicate sufficiently to maintain the virus in infected potato. The
interesting aspect of this disease is that INSV-infected _N. benthiamiana_
is an effective indicator of the disease. Disease management would require
applications of insecticides to reduce populations of the insect
(_Frankliniella occidentalis_). Other thrips have not been identified as
vectors, but that may have changed. The biology of INSV is similar to that
of TWSV, such that the 2 viruses are often recorded together.
