There has been a recent case of botulism in New South Wales, Australia, possibly associated with the intravenous injection of methamphetamine ("ice"). We are seeking information on any similar reports from other regions.

The case developed acute onset ophthalmoplegia and bulbar dysfunction several hours after using methamphetamine intravenously. This progressed to motor weakness and respiratory muscle paralysis, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. There was no wound at the injection site. _Clostridium botulinum_ was isolated from 2 separate blood cultures. _C. botulinum_ toxin B was detected by PCR. _Bacillus kochii_ was also isolated from the aerobic bottle of the 1st blood culture. The patient was administered heptavalent botulinum antitoxin, along with antimicrobials.

Several items associated with methamphetamine use by the case were obtained. Microbiological testing identified spore-forming bacteria, and _C. botulinum_ toxin B was detected by PCR. Food history remains incomplete, but may include consumption of old food. The living environment was reported to be unclean.

It would be helpful to know about any similar contemporary reports of cases of wound botulism associated with intravenous injections of methamphetamines. In particular, we are interested in understanding whether any substances are thought to have been contaminated by spores of _C. botulinum_ (or have been found to be contaminated via testing), as opposed to contamination via paraphernalia or the environment.

We are aware of reports of wound botulism cases/clusters linked to subcutaneous injections of black tar heroin. There is a single case report of botulism after IV methamphetamine use in the United States, which may be related to using water from an opened bottle (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939a4.htm).

[The MMWR report cited (Waltenburg MA, Larson VA, Naor EH, et al. Notes from the field: Botulism type B after intravenous methamphetamine use -- New Jersey, 2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2020; 69: 1425-1426. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr) was different from this very interesting submission in that the skin and scalp examinations revealed peripheral phlebitis and sites of induration, but no abscesses or open wounds, whereas none such lesions, at least at the injection site, were noted in this submission. The shorter incubation in the Australian case (the NJ case developed symptoms "24-48 hours" after the intravenous injection suggests intravenous injection of preformed toxin instead of in situ production of toxin which occurs in wound botulism. The gene for toxin B was found by PCR when testing the drug paraphernalia but it is not clear that preformed toxin was present. As the authors imply a foodborne route could not be excluded.

ProMED thanks Anthea Katelaris for this submission and would appreciate feedback from others with similar cases. - Mod.LL
