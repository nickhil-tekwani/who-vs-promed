Josephine County Public Health (JCPH) has confirmed that a 2nd fox
tested positive for rabies in the Cave Junction area in February
[2010]. The 1st was confirmed positive in January [2010]. Both foxes
were found dead.

Officials want residents to be aware of the rare risk of rabies from
foxes or other wildlife.

A more common disease with similar clinical and behavioral signs in
foxes, raccoons, and skunks is canine distemper. It is only
infectious to animals in the canine and weasel families, according to JCPH.

The fox that died in January [2010] was confirmed to have been
infected with a bat strain of rabies. Foxes, coyotes, raccoons, or
skunks may also come into contact with domestic animals and put them
at risk for contracting diseases like rabies, canine distemper, or an
untimely death because they may become prey.

Health officials ask the public to leave wildlife alone in their
natural habitats and to report any sick or dead wild animals to the
nearest office of Oregon Dept. of Fish & Wildlife.

In Oregon, the last fox that tested positive for rabies was 10 years
ago in Josephine County. Jackson, Curry and Coos counties also have
had cases of foxes testing positive for rabies. Of the 72 sick foxes
submitted for testing after showing clinical signs for rabies or
distemper from 1990 to 2009, 26 percent (19 out of 72) have had
confirmed rabies.

Of the bats that were submitted sick or dead and tested from all
parts of Oregon during the same period, 9.9 percent (160 out of 1631)
have had confirmed rabies.

[There seems to be an increase in rabies in the area as this is the
2nd dead fox that has tested positive for rabies. It would be greatly
appreciated if we knew the strain or rabies that was affecting the fox.

Hopefully residents have been warned to be sure their pets'
vaccinations are up to date. It also may be a good time for the
community to try an outreach program and provide low cost rabies vaccines.

Rabies vaccine should be given to horses and cattle as well as
companion animals. Loosing your livestock investment is an impact but
for the disease to pass from a domesticated animal to yourself or you
family makes the vaccine excellent insurance. - Mod.TG]
