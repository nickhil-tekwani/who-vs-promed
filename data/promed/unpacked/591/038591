Following the confirmation of yellow fever cases on 15 May 2013, the Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute's Public Health Emergency Management center (EHNRI/PHEM) formally notified the situation to WHO as per the International Health Regulation (IHR), which requires notification of a confirmed case of yellow fever to the WHO IHR Focal Point. To date, a total of 105 cases have been reported to EHNRI/PHEM from South Ari, Benatsemay, and Selmago woredas [districts] of South Omo zone in SNNPR [Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region]. The Regional Health Bureau (RHB), with close support from EHNRI and WHO, is implementing the standard prevention and control strategy that is composed of reactive vaccination, vector control, case management, and enhanced surveillance; and has finalized to initiate the reactive vaccination of 20 000 people in 4 kebeles [smallest administrative unit of Ethiopia] in South Ari woreda where the confirmed cases were reported.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ota Masaki for sending in this report. This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of yellow fever cases in Ethiopia.

The SNNPR, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, is one of the 9 ethnically-based administrative regions (kililoch) of Ethiopia. The 2007 census estimates the population at 14 929 548, of whom 13 433 991 are estimated to be rural inhabitants. A map showing the SNNPR location can be accessed at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nations,_Nationalities,_and_Peoples'_Region and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Ethiopia at http://healthmap.org/r/76YC. - Mod.TY]

Yellow fever in Ethiopia
------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Ethiopia is launching an emergency mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever from 10 Jun 2013. This is in response to laboratory confirmation of 6 cases in the country on 7 May 2013.

The campaign aims to cover more than 527 000 people in the 6 districts of South Ari, North Ari, Benatsemay, Selamago, Hammer, and Gnangatom and one administrative town (Jinka) in South Omo Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia.

The International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG11) will provide over 585 800 doses of yellow fever vaccine for the mass vaccination campaign run by the Ministry of Health in Ethiopia, with support from the GAVI Alliance [Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization] and other partners. WHO is closely supporting the outbreak investigation, capacity building for case management, resource mobilization for outbreak management, and monitoring preventive and control activities in the field.

The 6 laboratory confirmed cases are from South Omo, in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region. The cases were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever. The index case was a 39 year old man who presented with fever and jaundice and haemorrhagic signs in January 2013. He was laboratory confirmed by IgM (antibody test). Differential diagnosis for other flaviviruses was negative.

The laboratory confirmation was done by Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever.

[One hopes that this is a small outbreak in a limited area. Although the index case occurred in January 2013, only 6 more cases have been reported. No mention is made in either of the 2 reports above on previous yellow fever vaccination campaigns in the SNNPR, so the immune status of the population is not defined.

One also hopes that the vaccination campaign to be initiated on 10 Jun 2013 will prevent further cases. - Mod.TY]
