Chili crop hit by viral disease
-------------------------------
Farmers in Sattari [North Goa district] have urged the government to
intervene and take steps to eradicate the viral disease, locally known
as Karpo, which is badly affecting the chili [_Capsicum_ sp.] crop in
various parts.

Scientists from the Indian Council for Agricultural Research in Old
Goa have collected samples and identified the disease as viral. In
earlier seasons, tomato and brinjal [aubergine] plants were also
affected by the disease. However, this year, the disease has affected
the chili plant.

The local agriculture officer said, "We have treatment available for
bacterial and fungal diseases. But, as Karpo is a new viral disease,
so far our office does not have any solution for the disease." He has
planned to undertake a survey to assess the losses suffered by farmers
due to the disease and send a proposal to seek compensation from the
government for the affected persons.

[Around 20 viruses are known to infect capsicum causing yield
reduction and/or loss of fruit quality. Several of them are
transmitted by insect vectors (for example, aphids or thrips).
Solanaceous weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management
is difficult, especially under open field conditions, and usually
requires an integrated approach including vector control,
phytosanitation, cultural measures, as well as certified clean seed or
planting material. Crop varieties with different levels of resistance
to several of the viruses are available, but a clear diagnosis of the
specific virus(es) involved would be required in order to select
suitable cultivars for Goa.

While capsicum viruses often also affect related solanaceous hosts
such as tomato and aubergine, this is not proof that the problems in
Goa in earlier seasons on these crops were due to the same pathogen.
