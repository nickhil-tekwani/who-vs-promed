My knowledge of immunology and infectious disease prevention through
vaccination is rudimentary, but I think several questions /comments
concerning the offer of the HHS should be explained/discussed:
How can the usefulness of a vaccine in post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) be
investigated when:
1. there is no definitive knowledge of exposure;
2. the persons "at risk" still take antibiotics; and
3. there is no "control group"?
"Its [the vaccines use to combat the disease in people who have already
been exposed," as mentioned, is therefore not [amenable to study.
The only result in the opposite sense could be that people fall ill despite
vaccination. So this seems to be a study on "civilian humans" of
"development of antibodies in humans after short course anthrax vaccination".
Is this enough? Is any information available about antibody development
after exposure to anthrax (without becoming ill) through antibiotic
prophylaxis?

[These questions point up some of the shortcomings in the thinking behind
the government "vaccination" response to _B. anthracis_ spore exposure on
the east coast of the United States. Epidemiologists can construct criteria
groupings to answer questions 1 ­ 3 (for example, "high" or "low" risk
based on nature of a post office worker's activities, place of work, and
related environmental sampling; antibiotic cover by period of taking x or y
antibiotics; "controls" as above but not vaccinated) but, in the absence of
any subsequent "cases," however defined, we are no further forward. In
animals we do see individuals with raised titers after exposure but without
obvious prior disease. These vary from a handful to a significant
proportion, the latter usually in wildlife. To date I gather that
serosurveys of US postal workers have not revealed any with titers but no
clinical disease. If little of the vaccine put aside for those exposed is
used, I would strongly recommend that it be used to vaccinate those who
work with hazardous materials and other first responders in high-risk
cities, as well as a stored volume for if and when it happens again. ­
