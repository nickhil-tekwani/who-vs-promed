The Regional Epidemiological Surveillance of Ponte Nova, reported to the health authorities of the region a Macular Fever alert. According to the statement, 4 deaths have already been reported in the cities of Rio Casca and Sao Jose do Goiabal, 2 of which are laboratory confirmed cases.

The disease
-----------
Brazilian spotted fever is a disease transmitted by a tick of the species _Amblyomma cajennense_ infected by the bacterium _Rickettsia rickettsia_. This hematophagous tick can be found in large animals (bulls, horses, etc.), dogs, poultry, rodents and especially in capybara, the largest of all natural reservoirs.

Transmission
------------
For transmission of the disease, the infected tick needs to stay at least for a number of hours fixed on people's skin. The younger and smaller ticks are more dangerous vectors because they are harder to see. There is no transmission of the disease from one person to another.

Vaccine
-------
There is no vaccine against Brazilian spotted fever.

Symptoms
--------
When the bacterium invades the circulation, it causes vasculitis, that is, it damages the inner layer of the vessels (endothelium). The first symptoms appear 2 to 14 days after the exposure; in the vast majority of cases, about 7 days later. The disease begins abruptly with a cluster of symptoms similar to those of other infections: high fever, body pain, headache, poor appetite, and malaise. After 2-3 days, small reddish spots appear on the skin, the macules. These lesions will develop into the petechial component (petechiae are hemorrhagic spots that looks like a flea bite), and sometimes small subcutaneous hemorrhages occur at the site of the petechial rash. The rash becomes widespread and also manifests in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, which is not usually the case in other exanthematic diseases (measles, rubella, hemorrhagic dengue, for example).

Diagnosis
---------
The indirect immunofluorescence reaction (IFAT) is a specific test for the diagnosis of Brazilian spotted fever. However, one should not wait for results because they take time. For this reason, it is essential to consider the clinical findings and the epidemiological data of the disease, which has the peculiarity of causing micro-epidemics. Early diagnosis is important to start treatment because the disease lethality rate is high.

Cases of Brazilian spotted fever are compulsory notification to the epidemiological surveillance service.

Treatment
---------
Brazilian spotted fever has been cured since treatment with antimicrobials (tetracycline and chloramphenicol) are introduced within the 1st 2 to 3 days. The ideal is to maintain the medication for 10 to 14 days, but soon after the 1st doses the picture begins to regress and evolves to the total cure. Delay in diagnosis and, consequently in early treatment, can lead to serious complications such as impairment of the central nervous system, the kidneys and lungs, and vascular injuries leading to death.

Read the official communique issued by the Coordinator of the epidemiology of Vi√ßosa Ronilson da Silva Vieira in full:

"Epidemiological Alert: We requested wide dissemination to the entire health network of its municipality, mainly referring hospitals, on the occurrence of Macular Fever in the municipalities of Sao Jos do Goiabal and Rio Casca. There are already 4 deaths in these 2 municipalities (2 with laboratory confirmation). Please pay attention to chloramphenicol stock in hospitals, and disclose it to doctors. Before any suspicion, notify the case, collect sample (serum) and follow the treatment protocol, at medical discretion, always considering the positive epidemiology for this area and environment. - SRS Epidemiology Team Ponte Nova"

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also known as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (a flat rash with small raised bumps) at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric (small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin), involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpurae usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

It's important to note that dogs make excellent sentinels for _R. rickettsii_ due to their susceptibility and increased exposure to ticks. Disease clusters in urban/suburban areas are often seen in dogs and their owners due to similar tick exposure profiles. - Mod.JH
