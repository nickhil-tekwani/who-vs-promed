Eleven deer test positive for chronic wasting disease during spring
collections in Hampshire County, West Virginia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test results have detected the chronic wasting disease (CWD) agent in
a total of 11 white-tailed deer collected during the 2008 spring
collections in Hampshire County, West Virginia, according to the West
Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR). All of the deer testing
positive for CWD were collected by Wildlife Resources Section
personnel working in the Slanesville/Augusta area of the county. No
new positive samples were detected in the Yellow Springs area of
Hampshire County.

These collections have been designed to investigate and determine the
prevalence and distribution of the disease in Hampshire County. In
addition, wildlife biologists are carefully monitoring changes in the
structure of the deer herd within the CWD containment area.

The 1st case of CWD in West Virginia was confirmed on 2 Sep 2005.
Since that time, DNR has been fully engaged in activities guided by
its CWD Incident Response Plan, which is designed to accomplish the
following objectives:
- determine the distribution and prevalence of CWD through enhanced
surveillance efforts;
- communicate and coordinate with the public and other appropriate
agencies on issues relating to CWD and the steps being taken to
respond to this disease;
- initiate appropriate management actions necessary to control the
spread of this disease and prevent further introduction of the disease.

To date, CWD surveillance efforts conducted by DNR have resulted in a
total of 31 deer being confirmed positive for CWD in Hampshire
County. These include 30 deer in the Slanesville/Augusta area and one
deer in the Yellow Springs area. Despite ongoing and extensive
surveillance efforts being conducted by Wildlife Resources Section
personnel throughout West Virginia, CWD has not been detected outside
of Hampshire County.

CWD is a neurological disease found in deer and elk, and it belongs
to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE). The disease is thought to be caused by
abnormal, proteinaceous particles called prions that slowly attack
the brain of infected deer and elk, causing the animals to
progressively become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, and
invariably results in the death of the infected animal.

There is no known treatment for CWD, and it is fatal for the infected
deer or elk. It is important to note that currently there is no
evidence to suggest CWD poses a risk for humans or domestic animals.

"Landowner and hunter cooperation throughout this entire CWD
surveillance effort in Hampshire County has been excellent," noted
DNR director Frank Jezioro. "As we strive to meet this wildlife
disease challenge and implement appropriate management strategies,
the continued support and involvement of landowners and hunters will
be essential." DNR remains committed to keeping the public informed
and involved in these wildlife disease management actions. "We would
especially like to thank all the cooperating landowners in Hampshire
County for allowing our personnel to enter their property and collect
deer for CWD testing," said Jezioro.

"Our well trained and professional wildlife biologists, wildlife
managers, and conservation officers are working diligently to fully
implement the DNR's CWD Incident Response Plan, which is designed to
effectively address this wildlife disease threat," said Jezioro.
"Hunters, landowners, and other members of the public should feel
confident that we have some of the best wildlife biologists and
veterinarians in the world, including those stationed at the
Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens, Georgia,
working collaboratively on this situation."

[West Virginia was confirmed with chronic wasting disease in 2005.
The fact that it has not been found outside of the county is
remarkable. Although it may be too early to know if the plan is
working, it may be interesting to examine the plan they are working
from. - Mod.TG]
