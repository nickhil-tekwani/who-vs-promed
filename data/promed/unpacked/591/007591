Equine influenza, Australia: summary situation report, issued at 4.30
pm Tue 28 Aug 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Key points
Equine influenza (EI) was 1st detected at Eastern Creek Quarantine
Station (ECQS), Sydney, New South Wales (NSW), Australia, on 17 Aug
2007 and confirmed on 20 Aug 2007. Sick horses were seen on 22 Aug
2007 at Centennial Parklands Equestrian Centre (CPEC) adjoining
Centennial Park in central Sydney. These 2 cases have been confirmed
as H3 equine influenza virus and the properties classified as
infected premises.
In NSW, there are currently a total of 18 infected premises, 37
premises for which results are pending, and in excess of 90 premises,
which have been traced and are waiting to be assessed. The infected
properties have been diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs and
preliminary laboratory test results (PCR - polymerase chain reaction
for viral antigen). The properties are at Parkes in Central West NSW;
Tamworth (Moonbi), and Moree in northern NSW; Cattai and Wilberforce
(near Windsor on the northwest outskirts of Sydney); Kulnura and
Wyong (near Gosford); Berry on the south coast of NSW; Muswellbrook,
Aberdeen, Maitland in the Hunter Valley; and Mt Hunter in
southwestern Sydney.
There are 2 infected premises in the southwest corner of Queensland,
close to the NSW border (a 3-day Event at Warwick and a property at
Minden near Gatton). A further 2 properties in western Brisbane are
being traced due to contact with Minden horses. Horses from the
Maitland event are also in quarantine.
At this stage it is not possible to identify the index case.
There is an agreed national ban on horse movements in place until
1.00 pm Fri 31 Aug 2007.
2. Current situation
Testing carried out by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL)
in Geelong Victoria has shown virus from the 1st 2 infected premises
(IPs) to be subtype H3 equine influenza virus.
There are no indications of EI in jurisdictions other than NSW and
QLD at this time.
At this stage the outbreak seems to be largely confined to
recreational and eventing horses. There is no evidence that infection
has spread to the thoroughbred or standardbred racing sectors at this
time.
New South Wales
---------------
Many of the cases in NSW are directly or indirectly linked to a horse
event held at Lochinvar, near Maitland 18-19 Aug 2007. Some 215
horses attended this event and all owners have been contacted.
Yesterday [27 Aug 2007] NSW advised that 3 sick horses at 2 racing
stables at Randwick were under investigation. Initial laboratory
results have been reported as negative for equine influenza.
Queensland
----------
Queensland has also confirmed EI in 3 horses at Warwick, which
attended the same event at Lochinvar. Approximately 30 other horses
are showing clinical signs. Investigations have confirmed equine
influenza on a property at Minden near Gatton, which received horses
from Warwick. Restricted areas have been established around the 2
infected premises. Other horses around Brisbane that had contact with
Minden horses are under surveillance.
Other jurisdictions
-------------------
All traces notified by NSW and Queensland have also been followed up.
So far, no direct evidence of EI has been found. Reported cases of
equine respiratory disease have been investigated with negative
findings to date.
3. Response
In NSW, the whole state is declared a Control Area for EI. Horses of
any type, including pets, riding club, and show animals and donkeys,
are prohibited from travelling anywhere in NSW.
10-km (6.2 mi) restricted areas have been declared around each of the
IPs confirmed yesterday [27 Aug 2007], including Warwick and Minden
in QLD. No movement of horses is permitted within, into, or out of
these areas.
Further tracing of horse movements onto and off infected premises is
being urgently undertaken. All tracing cases are being investigated
and inspected according to a formal protocol. All horses showing a
significantly raised temperature and signs of respiratory infection
must be investigated at this time, particularly if more than one
horse is involved or they have had contact with other infected or
trace properties.
The public is being asked to report all horses with a fever and
respiratory signs to the LDCC (local disease control center) for
follow up as well as being re-assured that sick horses are not being
destroyed.

[The following concise background information on equine influenza is
derived from the review "Influenza" in "Disease Factsheets," Center
for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH), Iowa State University,
available at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/influenza.pdf>.
"Equine influenza viruses mainly infect horses and other Equidae. The
2 subtypes known to cause disease in horses are H7N7 (equine virus 1)
and H3N8 (equine virus 2). There is less antigenic drift in these
viruses than in human influenza A viruses. The H7N7 virus is
currently extinct or present at only very low levels in some parts of
the world. In 1989, a novel strain of equine influenza [A/eq/Jilin/89
(H3N8)] caused a serious epidemic, with high morbidity and mortality
rates, in Chinese horses. This virus appears to be an avian influenza
virus. A related virus caused influenza in a few hundred horses the
following year [1990] but there were no deaths. The avian-like virus
continued to circulate in horses in China for at least 5 years
without further fatalities.
One equine H3N8 virus recently jumped into dogs."
