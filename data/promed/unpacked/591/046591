Officials at the CDC have confirmed that last week the agency sent out an email alert to foodborne disease partners at the state and local levels looking for any illnesses associated with complaints related to the consumption of Lucky Charms cereal. According to the alert, there has been an increase in gastrointestinal illness complaints attributed to eating the cereal.

Earlier in April [2022], Food Safety News reported on complaints made on the <iwaspoisoned.com> website. The FDA has been investigating reports of illnesses possibly linked to Lucky Charms cereal since the 1st week of April [2022].

The message from the CDC said the following:

During April 2022, there has been an increase in complaints of gastrointestinal illness (GI) attributed to eating Lucky Charms cereal reported primarily to a crowdsourcing website. Some complaints of illness have also been reported to the FDA and state and local health departments. There are very little data on the clinical presentation of these complaints, e.g., symptom profiles, incubation periods, and illness durations, as well as a lack of laboratory testing of clinical specimens. The scarcity of data and lack of a consistent clinical presentation are making it difficult to ascertain if any of these illnesses are linked to the suspected cereal.

The CDC is coordinating with state and federal partners to characterize the clinical presentations and epidemiology of recent illness reports. CDC is also collaborating with state and federal partners to evaluate data collected from ill people to determine if an outbreak of GI illnesses is occurring and its potential link to Lucky Charms cereal.

Instructions for health officials:
--------------------------------------
Given that there is not enough information at this time to establish an outbreak, health officials are advised to
- treat complaints related to Lucky Charms cereal like all other complaints;
- interview complainants with standard illness complaint forms to collect details on clinical presentation such as symptoms, symptom onset date, symptom resolution dates and times AND
- collect a 3-4-day food history;
- collect production code/production date and lot code from any boxes linked to a complaint;
- consider collecting leftover boxes of Lucky Charms from ill peoples' homes, particularly for persons who are also willing to submit a stool specimen. It is not yet clear what the cereal should be tested for; that will depend on a review of detailed clinical data. If possible, please hold the product until we know more about the etiology of the illnesses;
- test complainants who are willing to submit a stool specimen for common foodborne pathogens (this is usually not done for individual complaints, but in this situation would be valuable to rule out Lucky Charms as the source of illness).

[ProMED has been aware of this potential foodborne outbreak since the 1st news reports occurred. It still remains unclear if the breakfast cereal is related to these illnesses. While the baking process should inactivate any bacterial pathogens, some toxins are heat stable and can cause nausea and vomiting or, as noted above, contamination can occur after the baking process. An example of the latter is baked-pastry transmission of hepatitis A related to postbaking contamination of the icing (ProMED post Hepatitis A, 2012 - Germany: (NI) bakery sweet pastries, Archive no. 20141219.3042399). ProMED would appreciate any additional information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod. LL
