[A] China: Half of its population projected to get COVID-19
Date: Mon 26 Dec 2022

Half of China's 1.4 billion people will be infected by the novel coronavirus in the coming months, analysts said, based on trends seen after the government eased its "zero COVID-19" policy earlier this month [December 2022]. The Chinese government stopped releasing data on new cases involving asymptomatic patients on 14 Dec 2022, citing difficulties in determining the number because many of them shun PCR tests. As a result, figures released by health authorities are significantly lower than the actual number of new cases.

However, an internal document believed to be about a government meeting was leaked on the internet. It showed new infections from 1 Dec to 20 Dec 2022 totaled an estimated 248 million, or 18% of the Chinese population. If the pace of infections has remained the same, the number of new cases now could exceed 300 million.

Chinese government officials say more than 90% of the population have been given 2 vaccine doses as protection. But Tetsuo Nakayama, a specially appointed professor at Kitasato University in Tokyo who specializes in clinical virology, questioned the efficacy of the Chinese-made vaccines. "The vaccines are made based on a strain originating in Wuhan at an early stage of the pandemic, and they are not effective in fighting the omicron strain, which is now dominant in China," Nakayama said.

Some reports have shown the vaccines used in China are not as good as the mRNA vaccines administered in the United States and Europe in terms of protecting patients from serious symptoms and death.

The virus in China is spreading faster than it's spread ever before anywhere during the pandemic, Ben Cowling, chair professor of epidemiology at Hong Kong University School of Public Health, noted. He projected that half of the country's population would be infected before long. Cowling attributed the recent explosion to the Chinese government's strict controls under its "zero COVID-19" policy, which he said has left the bulk of the population with little immunity to the virus.

Zhang Wenhong, a leading contagious diseases expert at Fudan University-affiliated Huashan Hospital, has researched the omicron variant now raging in China. The basic reproduction number of the strain, or the number of people who could be infected by a single patient, would average 16 to 18 among crowds lacking herd immunity to the virus.

Beijing is reportedly being pummeled by the highly transmissible BF.7 subvariant of omicron. But BA.5.2, another omicron subvariant, is the dominant strain nationwide, according to reports by the Chinese health authorities.

Tetsuya Mizutani, a professor of virology at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, noted Japan has also been hit by BF.7 and BA.5.2, both of which are derived from BA.5. "The immunization coverage against the omicron strain is rising in Japan," he said. "Even if the subvariants from China find their way into Japan, it should not be particularly concerning to the overall infection situation of the country."

With little information being released by Beijing on the status of infections, apps that can predict peaks of infections in each region of the country have emerged. A company collecting data in Shanghai projects the trajectory of infections in each city by comparing the frequency of searches for "fever" on Baidu, the largest search engine in China. The 1st peak of infections came on 17 Dec 2022 in Beijing, and 55% of the city's population were infected by 25 Dec 2022, according to the company's estimate.

Health authorities in Zhejiang province in south eastern China said on 25 Dec 2022 that new daily cases have topped 1 million in the province with a population of 64.57 million. The number is expected to rise to 2 million around 1 Jan 2023, they added.

Chinese leaders are particularly worried about the virus reaching rural areas, where health care systems are fragile. Wu Zunyou, chief expert of epidemiology at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, projected his country would experience 3 waves of infections this winter [2022/23]. The 1st wave is expected to hit large urban areas, lasting until the middle of January [2023], while the 2nd wave would strike between late January [2023] and the middle of February [2023], when people travel to their ancestral homes in local regions for the Chinese New Year holidays. The 3rd wave would likely be from late February [2023] to the middle of March [2023], when people return to the cities.

[A preprint (not peer-reviewed) by the University of Hong Kong estimated that the COVID-19 epidemic driven by the omicron subvariant BF.7 (short for BA.5.2.1.7) in Beijing peaked on 11 Dec 2022, with a cumulative incidence of 75.7% (95% credible interval: 60.7 to 84.4).

---------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We tracked the effective reproduction number Rt of SARS-CoV-2 omicron BF.7 in Beijing in November-December 2022 by fitting a transmission dynamic model parameterized with real-time mobility data to (i) the daily number of new symptomatic cases on 1-11 Nov 2022 (when the zero-COVID interventions were still strictly enforced) and (ii) the proportion of individuals who participated in online polls on 10-22 Dec 2022 and self-reported to have been previously test-positive since 1 Nov 2022. After the announcement of "20 measures", we estimated that Rt increased to 3.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 2.82-4.14) on 18 Nov 2022 and the infection incidence peaked on 11 Dec 2022. The cumulative infection attack rate (that is, the proportion of population who have been infected since 1 Nov 2022) was 43.1% (95% CrI: 25.6-60.9) on 14 Dec 2022 and 75.7% (95% CrI: 60.7-84.4) on 22 Dec 2022. Surveillance programmes should be rapidly set up to monitor the evolving epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 across China. - Mod.LWW]

[B] USA: 100 million cases recorded and over 200 million Americans have probably had it

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/us-records-100-million-covid-cases-but-more-than-200-million-americans-have-probably-had-it.html


The United States recorded more than 100 million formally diagnosed and reported COVID-19 cases this week [week of 26 Dec 2022], but the number of Americans who've actually had the virus since the beginning of the pandemic is probably more than twice as high.

COVID-19 has easily infected more than 200 million in the US alone since the beginning of the pandemic -- some people more than once. The virus continues to evolve into more transmissible variants that dodge immunity from vaccination and prior infection, making transmission incredibly difficult to control as we go into the 4th year of the pandemic.

The US officially recorded more than 100 million cases as of Tuesday [27 Dec 2022], just under a third of the total population, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data aren't perfect and likely a huge undercount of the actual number of infections, scientists say. While they count people who've tested positive more than once or caught COVID multiple times, they don't capture the number of COVID patients who were asymptomatic and never tested or tested at home and didn't report it.

Japan on Wednesday [28 Dec 2022] recorded 415 COVID-19 deaths, the highest-ever count for a single day, health ministry data showed. The country counted 216 219 newly confirmed coronavirus cases on Wednesday [28 Dec 2022], up 4% from a week earlier, the data also showed, approaching the record high of some 260 000 a day in August [2022].

In the past 7 days, Japan had the world's largest confirmed COVID-19 infections and the 2nd-most deaths after the United States, according to a tally by the World Health Organization.

[D] Italy: cases in flights from China
Date: Wed 28 Dec 2022
Soure: BNN Bloomberg [edited]
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/milan-reports-50-of-passengers-in-flights-from-china-have-covid-1.1863915


Italian health authorities will begin testing all arrivals from China for COVID after almost half of the passengers on 2 flights to Milan were found to have the virus. They are also sequencing the Milan tests to see if there are new variants, the Health Ministry said in a statement. If a new strain is found, officials may impose stricter curbs on travel from the country.

China has seen outbreaks of the virus since the government there abandoned its strict zero-COVID policies. Uncertainty over the scale of the spread has prompted countries, including the US, to consider new restrictions on entry.

Italy's government is set to discuss the Milan passenger numbers at a cabinet meeting later Wednesday [28 Dec 2022], when health minister Orazio Schillaci may present information on the tests. Most of those who tested positive weren't showing symptoms. But local media reported that there's increasing concern among health officials about new COVID variants emerging from China.

Italy was the 1st European country to be hit hard by COVID in early 2020. While the high rate of passengers with the virus has put authorities on alert, one factor in Italy's favor is its high vaccination rate. More than 80% of people are fully inoculated, according to the World Health Organization, and many have also received booster shots. It's a similar story across much of Western Europe.

Elsewhere, the UK said it will ensure it has the necessary COVID surveillance in place, but doesn't have plans to introduce mandatory testing on arrivals from China. In Germany, health authorities are "closely watching" the situation, according to Health Ministry spokesman Sebastian Guelde. "We have no indication that a more dangerous mutation has developed in China that would give rise to a declaration of a virus variant area, which would result in corresponding travel restrictions," he added. The French health ministry is also monitoring developments, and said it's "ready to look at all useful measures that could be put in place as a consequence, in collaboration with France's European partners."

[2] COVID restrictions on travellers from China
Date: Thu 29 Dec 2022
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/29/countries-imposing-covid-rules-for-travellers-from-china


Growing list of countries imposing COVID rules on China arrivals
----------------------------------------------------------------
Several countries have imposed restrictions on travellers from China because of a surge in COVID-19 infections after the country rolled back its stringent "zero-COVID" policy.

From the United States to Japan, nations are worried that new variants could emerge from China's continuing outbreak and that Beijing may not inform the rest of the world quickly enough. There have been no reports of new variants yet, but there is widespread concern over the lack of information and data from China.

WHO has said it was very concerned about rising reports of severe cases across China after the country largely abandoned its "zero-COVID" policy. While Beijing has moved to reopen its borders and will, from 8 Jan 2023, scrap mandatory quarantine for overseas arrivals, these countries have introduced curbs on arrivals from China:

United States
-------------
From 5 Jan 2023, the US will impose mandatory COVID-19 tests for travellers from China. All air passengers aged 2 years and older will require a negative test no more than 2 days before departure from China, Hong Kong or Macau. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that Americans should reconsider travel to China, Hong Kong and Macau.

The US is also considering sampling wastewater from international aircraft to track new variants and has expanded its voluntary genomic sequencing programme at airports, adding Seattle and Los Angeles. This brings the total number of airports gathering information from positive tests to 7.

India
-----
From 1 Jan 2023, people arriving in India from China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand will have to show a COVID-19 negative test report.

Travellers from those countries will have to upload their test result on an Indian government website before their departure, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya wrote on Twitter on Thursday [29 Dec 2022].

India has already started randomly testing 2% of all international passengers arriving at airports.

Italy
-----
Italy is the 1st country in Europe to order COVID-19 antigen swabs and virus sequencing for all travellers coming from China. The main airports in Milan and Rome have already started testing passengers arriving from Beijing and Shanghai.

Prime minister Giorgia Meloni said she "expects and hopes" the European Union will follow its lead on imposing mandatory tests for all passengers flying in from China. Addressing a news conference on Thursday [29 Dec 2022], Meloni said Italy's measures -- which also subject transit passengers to compulsory testing -- risked being ineffective if not extended across the EU.

Others in the largely borderless bloc either said they saw no need to follow suit or were waiting for a common stance across the 27 member states.

Taiwan
------
From 1 Jan 2023, Taiwan will start testing arrivals from China for COVID-19. Its Central Epidemic Command Center said all passengers arriving on direct flights from China, as well as by boat at 2 offshore islands, will have to take PCR tests on arrival.

Countries monitoring situation:

United Kingdom
--------------
Britain has no plans to bring back COVID-19 testing for those coming into the country, a government spokesperson said, in contrast to a growing list of countries mandating tests for travellers from China. "There are no plans to reintroduce COVID-19 testing or additional requirements for arrivals into the UK," the spokesperson said when asked about a report in the Telegraph newspaper which said the government will consider curbs for arrivals from China.

Australia
---------
The country said it was making no change to its rules regarding allowing travellers from China in. "There is no change in the travel advice at this point in time but we are continuing to monitor the situation, as we continue to monitor the impact of COVID here in Australia as well as around the world," Prime minister Anthony Albanese said.

Philippines
-----------
The South East Asian country is being "very cautious" and could impose measures such as testing requirements on visitors from China, but not an outright ban, transportation secretary Jaime Bautista said.

Malaysia
--------
The country's health minister announced new tracking and surveillance measures, and said the aim was to increase the percentage of booster dose uptake to reduce the severity of infections and the risk of death.

[3] WHO: insufficient evidence to support syndromic screening
Date: Wed 28 Dec 2022

https://www.news-medical.net/news/20221228/World-Health-Organization-reports-insufficient-evidence-to-support-syndromic-screening-for-COVID-19.aspx


World Health Organization reports insufficient evidence to support syndromic screening for COVID-19
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a scientific brief by WHO, there is insufficient information to implement syndromic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission prevention across land borders. [The WHO scientific brief can be accessed at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Sci-Brief-Syndromic-screening-2022.1 - Mod.LWW]

Background
----------
The term "syndromic testing" refers to using one test to target multiple pathogens with overlapping signs and symptoms. This may comprise testing for temperature and pulmonary or other complaints, observation, and completion of health statement documents. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, syndromic testing was applied for other communicable diseases such as Ebola virus disease, respiratory infections such as pandemic H1N1, and plague.

Questions have been raised over the preventive potential of syndromic testing on COVID-19 transmissibility among travelers. Also, illegal land trespassing and open borders hamper any intervention used to curb the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, particularly in the setting of a global crisis.

In this scientific brief, the authors assessed the effectiveness of syndromic testing in containing the spread of COVID-19 at border crossings and transboundary river crossings. This study aimed to examine the effect of COVID-19 syndromic departure and entry screening of travelers crossing land borders utilizing the PICO question (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome).

The study
---------
A systematic review was conducted to resolve the PICO question. Based on the GRADE methodology (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation), evidence was classified as high, moderate, low, or extremely low in terms of quality.

An external systematic review team assessed the validity of the research using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data were analyzed, and findings were established by the WHO International Travel and Health Guidelines Development Group (ITH GDG). The research found 7 empirical studies published between 2020 and January 2022 that investigated the utility of COVID-19 screening at border crossings.

A retrospective cross-sectional study in Uganda examined the effectiveness of syndromic screening records collected from 7181 truck drivers who traveled to Uganda through Mutukula, in the United Republic of Tanzania -- from 15 May to 30 Jul 2020.

The findings
------------
In a cross-sectional retrospective study conducted in Uganda, thermal screening failed to detect COVID-19 infections at border crossings. The number of cases detected by the tests varied significantly across the 7 investigations, ranging from 2.2% to 43.6%. Insufficient data were found to support or refute the claim that syndromic screening is associated with health risks. Therefore, WHO concluded that there is inadequate data to support syndromic testing for COVID-19 at border crossings.

In addition, traveling through unorganized and informal border crossings can circumvent checkpoints complicating the evaluation of the intervention's effectiveness. Of note, considering the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, syndromic testing can be ineffective in some countries. Furthermore, screening might give travelers and neighbors a false sense of security.

It was also noted that communication across countries and states and extensive coordination among the participating nations are essential for appropriately interpreting and using screening strategies. For individuals with disabilities, syndromic screening may adversely affect access to healthcare providers and caregivers.

Moreover, there is an urgent need for investigations comparing the efficacy and success of syndromic screening versus testing, quarantine, and other public health and social interventions, as well as syndromic screening in conjunction with other health measures.

Limitations
-----------
In this brief, there are several limitations, including a small number of studies (only 7 investigations), early pandemic investigations, data stratification, and a lack of scientific knowledge. As a result of these limitations, future active surveillance, and study approaches, which separate the effects of syndromic screening techniques, are necessary.

ref: Cao Z, Gao W, Bao H, et al. VV116 versus nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for oral treatment of COVID-19. N Engl J M. 28 Dec 2022. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2208822. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 36577095
--------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background: Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has been authorized for emergency use by many countries for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the supply falls short of the global demand, which creates a need for more options. VV116 is an oral antiviral agent with potent activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Methods: We conducted a phase 3, noninferiority, observer-blinded, randomized trial during the outbreak caused by the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Symptomatic adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 with a high risk of progression were assigned to receive a 5-day course of either VV116 or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. The primary end point was the time to sustained clinical recovery through day 28. Sustained clinical recovery was defined as the alleviation of all COVID-19-related target symptoms to a total score of 0 or 1 for the sum of each symptom (on a scale from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater severity; total scores on the 11-item scale range from 0 to 33) for 2 consecutive days. A lower boundary of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of more than 0.8 was considered to indicate noninferiority (with a hazard ratio of > 1 indicating a shorter time to sustained clinical recovery with VV116 than with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir).

Results: A total of 822 participants underwent randomization, and 771 received VV116 (384 participants) or nirmatrelvir-ritonavir (387 participants). The noninferiority of VV116 to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with respect to the time to sustained clinical recovery was established in the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01 to 1.35) and was maintained in the final analysis (median, 4 days with VV116 and 5 days with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir; hazard ratio, 1.17; CI 1.02 to 1.36). In the final analysis, the time to sustained symptom resolution (score of 0 for each of the 11 COVID-19-related target symptoms for 2 consecutive days) and to a first negative SARS-CoV-2 test did not differ substantially between the 2 groups. No participants in either group had died or had had progression to severe COVID-19 by day 28. The incidence of adverse events was lower in the VV116 group than in the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir group (67.4% vs. 77.3%).

Conclusions: Among adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were at risk for progression, VV116 was noninferior to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir with respect to the time to sustained clinical recovery, with fewer safety concerns.
