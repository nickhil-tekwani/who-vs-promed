A new suspected case of bird flu was found at a duck farm in South
Korea, the South Korean Agriculture Ministry said Saturday [4 Oct
2008]. Routine tests showed that some ducks at a farm in Yesan, 134
km south of Seoul, have been infected with avian influenza, the
ministry said in a statement.

The ministry said detailed tests were underway to confirm whether the
suspected outbreak of bird flu is a highly virulent strain of avian
influenza.

All ducks at the farm were culled to avoid further spreading of the
fatal disease, the ministry said.

[South Korea experienced a wide scale outbreak of HPAI H5N1 earlier
this year, which started 1 Apr 2008 and was resolved on 15 May 2008.
The outbreak was contained and eradicated by the application of
stamping-out policy; no vaccine was used. For the locations of the 33
outbreaks, see map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6934>.

On 14 Aug 2008, the S. Korean authorities sent the OIE an official
declaration, stating that "the Republic of Korea has met the
requirements for the recognition as a country free from Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) as of 15 Aug 2008 in accordance
with Article 2.7.12.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2006)."
