Taiwan slaughtered 210 goats on 2 goat farms near Taipei [the capital]
following a goat pox outbreak on 2 goat farms, a newspaper said on
Sunday [6 Jul 2008].

The China Times said that goats began to fall ill on the 2 farms in
Taoyuan County in May 2008, and on 27 Jun 2008, laboratory tests
confirmed goat pox had broken out on these farms.

From 1-4 Jul 2008, the Council of Agriculture slaughtered the 210
infected goats on the 2 farms and disinfected the farms.

It was the 1st time that Taiwan ever had a goat pox outbreak. The
Council of Agriculture suspects tourists brought the disease to the
farms.

[Sheep pox and goat pox (SP & GP) are viral diseases of sheep and
goats characterised by fever, generalised papules or nodules,
vesicles (rarely), internal lesions (particularly in the lungs), and
death. Both diseases are caused by strains of capripoxvirus, all of
which can infect sheep and goats, and although most of the strains
examined cause more severe clinical disease in either sheep or goats,
some strains have been isolated that are equally pathogenic in both
species. In the past, this disease (at that time called "sheep and
goat pox") was included in the OIE's List A, due to its infectivity,
pathogenicity and international trade implications. Since 2005, lists
A and B have been amalgamated. It has been proposed that the
malignant pox diseases of sheep and goats caused by capripoxvirus and
including Kenyan sheep and goat pox, Indian goat dermatitis and north
African stone pox of sheep and goats be referred to as capripox.

Capripox is endemic in Africa north of the Equator, the Middle East,
Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, parts of the
People's Republic of China and, since 1984, Bangladesh. Recently, it
has made frequent incursions into southern Europe. The disease is not
zoonotic. Information on the disease, its diagnosis and the available
vaccines can be found in Chapter 2.1.10. ("Sheep Pox And Goat Pox")
of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00033.htm>.

According to China's (PRC) OIE report for 2006, which is the last
annual report submitted by China so far, "sheep pox and goat pox,"
there is a "confirmed clinical disease limited to certain zones." The
only country in southeast Asia which has officially reported the
presence of the disease (in its 2007 OIE report) was Viet Nam.

A laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis of GP in Taiwan
and details on the clinical and epidemiological findings,
particularly addressing the mode/route of introduction will be
helpful. These should be followed by an official notification to the
OIE. In most Middle Eastern countries, the disease is endemic,
affecting sheep or goats. The Kenyan strain is known to affect both
species. - Mod.AS
