Polio has infected a 4-year-old girl in northern Kenya in the
country's 1st case of the disease since 2006, the government said on
Wednesday [25 Feb 2009]. The girl is believed to have contracted the
virus from neighboring southern Sudan, which has struggled to improve
its health sector since a 2005 peace deal ended a 2-decade civil war.

Shahnaaz Sharif, Kenya's director of public health and sanitation,
said a vaccination campaign would begin in the area on 7 Mar 2009 and
would aim to immunize more than 95 000 children.

Youngsters under 3 are most at risk from the disease, which can cause
irreversible paralysis. Vaccines have eliminated the virus as a
public health threat in most parts of the world.

Kenya announced its 1st polio infection in 20 years on Wednesday [25
Feb 2009], after a 4-year-old girl was diagnosed with the disease
along the country's remote border with Sudan.

"In a country free of polio, when you make a diagnosis of one case of
polio, the definition is an outbreak," said Dr. David Okello, country
representative of the World Health Organization. For every child
paralyzed by polio, there are about 200 other asymptomatic cases who
can spread the disease to others.

Okello said they were investigating a 2nd case in Lokichoggio, 900 km
(560 miles) north of the capital city of Nairobi, where an infant had
shown symptoms of the disease.

"Really we are not sure; there may be other cases," said Okello.

Polio is an infectious disease that mainly strikes children under 5.
It is spread primarily by the feces of an infected person getting
into the food chain [the main route of infection is considered
fecal-oral, but oral-oral infection can occur in the early stages of
infection, when the virus can be isolated from lymphatic tissue in
the oropharynx - Mod.MPP]. It causes paralysis and can be fatal.

In 2006, 2 refugees escaping the war in Somalia were diagnosed with
the disease at the Dadaab refugee camp at Kenya's eastern border with
Somalia. That outbreak was contained before it spread.

Okello said the disease may have spread from south Sudan, where a
polio outbreak occurred in early January [2009].

He said many Kenyan children were not immunized due to post election
violence in 2008, which left more than 1000 people dead and 600 000
people displaced from their homes. Many have still not returned home.

Okello said coverage of the immunization campaign was 100 percent
before the violence but has dropped to 60 percent.

He said in the next 10 days, health officials will conduct immediate
vaccination of Lokichoggio and surrounding areas to prevent the
spread of the disease and then a synchronized vaccination campaign
involving Sudan, Ethiopia and Uganda.

Global efforts to eradicate polio have decreased cases by 99 percent
since 1988. Last year [2008], it was only endemic in 4 countries:
Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan. But those countries have
the potential to re-infect anywhere in the world.

A child is being treated for polio in Amuru district 12 years since
the last case was reported in Uganda.

No case had been reported in the country since 1996, and in 2006, the
WHO declared Uganda free of polio. A country is declared polio-free
if no case of the disease is found for 10 years.

But a sample from a 16-month-old baby boy admitted to Lacor Hospital
with weakness in the limbs has tested positive for the polio virus.
The child is said to have been living in Awer camp for the internally
displaced persons, and he was 1st treated for malaria.

Samples from 2 other suspected cases in the camp have been taken for
testing at the Centres for Disease Control in Entebbe.

Doctors in Amuru said the patients present with acute flaccid
paralysis, which is the weakness of limbs. The district health
officer, Dr. Patrick Odong yesterday [24 Feb 2009] said the
preliminary results from the sample tested positive. He said the
sample had been sent to South Africa for confirmatory tests.

A team from the Ministry of Health is expected in Amuru today [25 Feb
2009] to carry out verification and collect more samples, he said.

The assistant commissioner for epidemic surveillance, Dr. Issa
Makumbi, and Dr. Possy Mugyenyi of the Uganda National Expanded
Programme on Immunisation said the preliminary tests had showed
positive results. Makumbi said he had sent a team to the district to
check on the situation.

Due to the global sensitivity to polio, the health ministry reported
constant surveillance.

"We don't want any chances of polio re-entry into the country. We are
concerned that the disease may spread from our neighbours," Monica
Musenero, the principle epidemiologist, said.

Last year [2008], the ministry and the WHO issued a polio alert and
launched an immunisation programme after cases were reported in the
neighbouring DR Congo.

The districts that were feared to be under threat were Kanungu,
Kisoro, Rukungiri, Kabale and Kasese.

Others were Bundibugyo, Ntungamo, Mbarara and Bushenyi. This was
because of their closeness to the Congo border and the fact that
Congolese were fleeing into Uganda, escaping the armed conflict back
home.

The health ministry and the WHO launched a polio immunisation
campaign in Kanungu last year [2008], which targeted children below 5
years in the 9 districts bordering Congo.

In the 1st week of February [2009], about 1.4 million children in 23
districts were immunised against polio. The 2-day sub-national
immunisation targeted children below 5 years.

"Our target was to reach 80 percent of the children in the 25 risky
districts. So far, we have immunised 1.4 million children, which is
90 percent coverage," said Mugyenyi.

[The occurrence of cases of polio in Kenya and Uganda, both suspected
to be importations from Southern Sudan, serves as a further
illustration of the challenges faced by the polio eradication effort,
especially in Africa. Both countries have been polio free for many
years (Kenya for 20 years -- although there was a solitary imported
case from Somalia in 2006 -- and Uganda for 12 years). In contrast,
the Sudan has reported 5 confirmed cases of polio this year (2009),
with date of onset of the most recent confirmed case on 1 Feb 2009.
In addition, there were reports of 26 confirmed cases last year
(2008) in the Sudan as well (see polio eradication website, weekly
case count as of 24 Feb 2009, available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).

According to WHO reports, wild poliovirus (WPV) has been circulating
in the Sudan for more than 12 months, with the original importation
related to the upsurge in WPV activity in Nigeria (see Poliomyelitis
- Worldwide: WHO report Nigeria, updates 20090106.0052). The current
cases are in both Uganda and Kenya. A disturbing bit of news is the
significant drop in vaccination coverages in Kenya related to the
recent civil unrest in 2008, setting up a situation of a large cohort
of susceptibles under 2 years of age that would facilitate WPV
circulation in the country in general (not just isolated to the
externally displaced persons due to conflicts in neighboring
countries). The challenges faced in Africa are multiple, both the
continued problems with vaccine coverages in Nigeria as well as
numerous countries with civil unrest and internally as well as
externally displaced persons.

The most recent information on reports of confirmed cases of polio by
country, available on the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>
are presented in the following table and highlight the challenges
still faced in Africa related to the ongoing WPV circulation in
Nigeria, with 5 additional West African countries reporting WPV cases
with dates of onset in 2009 (Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, and Niger,
Mali).
