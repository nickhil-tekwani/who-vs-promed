FDA clears Guatemala raspberries in cyclospora outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
Guatemalan raspberries did not play a role in the cyclospora outbreak in
West Palm Beach, Florida, last May that left hundreds sick, U.S. Food and
Drug Administration officials said Friday.
As a result of a meeting between FDA and Guatemalan officials, the FDA
concluded there was no evidence that West Palm Beach received any shipments
of contaminated Guatemalan raspberries. During the West Palm Beach outbreak,
more than 200 people received (sic) cyclospora from food they ate during a
convention.
The United States temporarily banned imports of Guatemalan raspberries last
year [1998] after they were linked with multistate outbreaks of
cyclosporiasis in spring 1996 and 1997. At least 2500 cases of
cyclosporiasis were reported in the United States during those outbreaks.
Cyclospora is a single-cell parasite that can cause prolonged diarrhea. The
crisis forced growers to close more than 30 Guatemalan farms of an industry
that once employed up to 6000 people.
