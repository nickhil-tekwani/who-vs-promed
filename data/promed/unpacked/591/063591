On 31 Jul 2013, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced the 1st equine case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) this year [2013]. The affected horse was stabled in Belchertown and is that town's 2nd EEE infected horse in 2 years.

"Today's [1 Aug 2013] finding significantly raises our concern for the area. It's important that people in high risk areas protect themselves from getting bitten by mosquitoes," said MDPH State Public Health Veterinarian Catherine Brown, DVM, MSc.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Its fatality rate in horses is 75-95 percent. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

Massachusetts confirmed 5 cases of EEE in horses in 2012. Nationwide, 209 equine cases were confirmed.

The MDPH encouraged animal owners to reduce potential mosquito breeding sites on their property by eliminating standing water from containers such as buckets, tires, and wading pools, especially after heavy rains.

Additionally, they recommended that water troughs, which provide excellent mosquito breeding habitats, should be dumped, cleaned, and refilled at least once a week during the summer months to reduce mosquitoes near paddock areas. Finally, they recommended that owners keep horses stalled at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes. And if an animal is diagnosed with EEE or West Nile virus (another potentially deadly mosquito borne disease), owners are required to report the illness to the Massachusetts Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health by calling 617/626-1795 and to the MDPH by calling 617/983-6800.

[There is a very effective vaccine that should be used. Why did the Department of Agriculture's Division of animal health not recommend vaccination? The vaccine is often provided in combination with West Nile virus. The combination vaccine is very effective and should be used to vaccinate horses.
