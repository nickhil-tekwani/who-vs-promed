I'm on the ProMED-mail list and find it very interesting although I'm not a
doctor or scientist. I'm just interested in the occurrence, frequency and
locations of various disease manifestations. At any rate, I live in
Honolulu on Oahu, one of the islands of Hawaii.
There have been several recent reports from the island of Kauai of
necrotizing fasciitis, which is [caused by a strain of the _Streptococcus_
group A bacterium, but I've not noticed any reports of this [outbreak on
the list. I do not feel qualified to report this event to the list and
would urge that someone contact Dr. Lee Evslin, president of the Kauai
Medical Clinic, (3-3420 Kuhio Highway, Suite B - Lihue, Hawaii 96766 -
(808) 245-1500), who was mentioned in a Honolulu Advertiser (11 December
1997) newspaper article, for detailed information.
The article goes on to report...During the past three months, [Oct - Dec
1997 38 people have been hospitalized with _Streptococcus_ group A
[infections. Four have had a more severe infectious form of
_Streptococcus_ group A which causes necrotizing fasciitis. One 60 year
old man has died. There have also been cluster outbreaks of infections on
Kauai in 1992 and a small cluster in 1995, mostly towards the end of the
year. Belief is that there are people who carry the disease but do not get
sick.
There is also a sidebox to the article that mentions the possibility that
medicines containing ibuprofen could be associated with the more severe
cases of streptococcal infection. However, much more research must be done
before making a definitive statement on this matter.
I just wanted to make this situation known to the medical (and list)
community. Please contact Dr. Evslin for information and post some notice
of this problem. I don't think that we can afford to keep any disease
outbreaks hushed up in fear of negative publicity. We need to be
responsible in reporting facts that will help us all understand the world
we live in today.

[We did not post this in December because it refers to only 4 cases
in 3 months, which is probably the normal background level for this
disease in Hawaii. But it provides an instructive contrast to the
current outbreak in Texas - Mod.JW
