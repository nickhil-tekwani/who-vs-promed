[1] Nigeria: outbreaks

[Nigeria] recorded outbreaks of measles in 13 local government areas of [Niger State] during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the pandemic.

Dr Fatima Abdullah, Director, Immunisation and Diseases Control, disclosed this during a one-day media orientation on measles immunisation awareness on Friday [19 Jun 2020] in Minna [capital of Niger State]. The event was organised by the Niger State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NSPHCDA) in partnership with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

She explained that during the lockdown, many caregivers did not take their children to health facilities for routine immunisation, which she attributed to the fear of contracting the virus.

"Even though the health facilities were opened for 24 hours [for] services, many parents failed to take their children for routine immunisation because they were afraid of contracting coronavirus. All services, such as routine immunisation, antenatal [services], and family planning, were available to everyone, but most mothers failed to access the service during the lockdown," she said.

Abdullah solicited the support of the media in creating an awareness of the need for mothers to take their children to health facilities within their wards for immunization while observing the COVID-19 containment regulations.

[2] Vaccination in USA: impact of SARS-CoV-2

A decline in pediatric care during the pandemic has put a lot of children behind the curve on routine vaccinations.

As states decide to reopen schools and daycare centers, children behind on their shots could pose a threat to themselves and others, on top of the risk of spreading the coronavirus.

"The last thing we want during a COVID pandemic is another epidemic of measles and pertussis and diphtheria here in the U.S.," Gary Kirkilas, pediatrician and professor at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix, tells Axios.

By the numbers:
- Non-influenza vaccine doses decreased by an estimated 21.5% from January through April [2020], according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- Publicly purchased non-flu vaccines, including hepatitis, meningitis, polio, and rotavirus, were also sharply down in April [2020], compared to this time last year [2019].
- In New York City, vaccinations plummeted 63% overall, and 91% for kids older than 2, compared to the same time last year [2019].
- In California, shots for children are down 40%.
- In Detroit, less than half of children younger than 2 are now up-to-date on their vaccinations, per a CDC case study.

Some local children's hospitals are partnering with public health departments and school districts to help parents get back on track with vaccinations or missed doses.

Before the pandemic, states were already struggling to get mandatory immunizations like measles, mumps and rubella and voluntary vaccines like the flu shot into people and children for a variety of reasons. State public health departments were battling the highest measles tally in 27 years: 31 states had nearly 1300 measles cases in 2019.

Doctors are concerned the same population that's hesitant to get immunized will be just as opposed to a coronavirus vaccine once available if the process appears rushed.

"Parents are still very scared," says Lisa Gwynn, associate professor of Clinical Pediatrics and Public Health Sciences at the University of Miami. "They don't want to expose their kids unnecessarily, and to be honest, school in the fall is not on people's radar right now. Especially in lower-income populations, they're not thinking about immunizing their kids. They're thinking about when they can go back to work and keep a roof over their head."

The bottom line per Kirkilas: "Clearly the greater risk for parents is not immunizing. It's not the risk of COVID. It's not immunizing your child against diseases that have been proven to affect children more."
