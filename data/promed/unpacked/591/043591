Spanish patients treated with drug made from blood possibly contaminated
with CJD
--------------------------------------------------
Anger over Britain's role in the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad
cow disease) crisis deepened in Spain amid reports [that over 1500
Spaniards [had been treated with a drug made from blood from a British
patient who later died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
According to reports in the Spanish media, between 1500 and 2100 patients
were treated with Amascan Pulmonate from 1996 to 1997. The drug was made by
the British company Amersham (now Nycomed Amersham) and used for diagnosing
deep vein thrombosis. The newspaper El Mundo reported that the drug was
used in more than 20 hospitals but was withdrawn in 1997 after the British
plasma donor was diagnosed with CJD.
A spokesman for Nycomed Amersham said: "There is no evidence CJD can be
linked to blood or blood products. The drug was withdrawn as a purely
precautionary measure. The infected person was one of 52 768 people who
donated blood for that batch." The Spanish health minister, Celia Villabos,
said patients prescribed the drug had been monitored and none had shown any
signs of the human form of BSE. The deputy prime minister, Mariano Rajoy,
said no case of CJD had been found in Spain. The scare came as Spain's 19th
case of BSE was diagnosed. Since the first case was officially recognized
at the end of [2000, beef sales have fallen by 70 per cent. Yesterday 20
000 beef production workers demonstrated in Madrid, calling for Britain to
pay compensation for its failure to control the disease.
