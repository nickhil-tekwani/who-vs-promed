1st record of Cowpea mild mottle virus in bean crops in Argentina

Cowpea mild mottle carlavirus (CPMMV) has been detected for the 1st time in
infected bean crops (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) in the bean-producing region of
Argentina (Province of Salta). Virus particles are filamentous (ca 650 nm)
and its physicochemical properties are typical of other carlaviruses, with
one major distinction in that it is transmitted in a non-persistent manner
by whiteflies (_Bemisa tabaci_). Other viruses known in the region include
bean common mosaic potyvirus, bean dwarf mosaic geminivirus, cucumber
mosaic cucumovirus, and a strain of bean golden mosaic begominivirus. The
results confirm the presence of CPMMV in Argentina for the 1st time. Spread
of CPMMV may be assisted by high densities of _B. tabaci_.

[There are 4 classes of plant virus transmission by Homopteran insects; 1)
non-persistently transmitted (styletborne [NP]), 2) semi-persistently
transmitted (foregutborne [SP]), 3) circulative-persistent (CP), and 4)
propagative-persistent (PP). Vector transmission of CPMMV by _Bemisia
tabaci_ [Bt] appears to be due to virus contamination of the stylet and/or
the foregut following feeding on infected plants. High densities of Bt
would likely increase the rate of transmission. CPMMV is also transmitted
mechanically, and some isolates are transmitted by seed. The virus has been
reported from Asia, Africa, Brazil, and Oceania but is not reported from EU
countries to date. It appears to be unrelated to known members of the
Carlavirus genus. It primarily infects tropical field crops. Its quarantine
pest status in EU countries is very minor, if not doubtful.
