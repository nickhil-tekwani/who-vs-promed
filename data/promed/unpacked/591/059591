---------------------------------------------------------------------
Potato tuber necrotic ringspot disease (PTNRD) is found worldwide but has not previously been identified in Ireland. In recent years necrotic symptoms, veinal necrosis, spots, mottling, mosaics, and chlorosis have been observed on potato foliage in different regions across Ireland. In 2011 and 2012 affected leaves were serologically tested by double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA). In some instances these symptoms were associated with PVY [_Potato virus Y_].

Further analysis of PVY positive samples using RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the recombinant strains PVY-NTN and PVY-N:O. No tuber samples were available to determine if their presence was associated with PTNTRD.

In 2013, foliage of the cultivar Nicola grown in County Carlow showing mosaic, veinal necrosis, and chlorosis was sampled and serologically and molecularly analysed as described above. Presence of PVY was confirmed by DAS-ELISA, and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of both PVY-NTN and PVY-N:O. Tubers from the infected plants were harvested and, following storage at ambient temperature for 28 days, developed typical superficial necrotic ringspot disease.

This is the 1st report of PTNRD associated with PVY recombinant strains in Ireland.

[_Potato virus Y_ (PVY; type member of genus _Potyvirus_) is one of the most damaging potato viruses affecting crop yields and tuber quality. PVY can also affect tomato, capsicum, and some other related species. Symptoms vary depending on viral strains and susceptibility level of host cultivars. They may include mottling, distortion, and necrosis of leaves and stems, premature defoliation, tuber necrosis, and plant death, or no symptoms at all.

PVY is transmitted by aphids in a non-persistent manner, with _Myzus persicae_ being the most efficient vector. PVY can also be spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected planting material such as seed tubers. Disease management of PVY and other potato viruses relies largely on clean planting material and use of resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful.

The PVY isolates reported so far have been classified in 3 main strains, PVY-N, PVY-O, and PVY-C, according to leaf symptoms induced on the experimental host _Nicotiana tabacum_. PVY-N isolates have been divided into 2 groups, one causing mild mosaic in most potato cultivars, while the other induces "potato tuber necrotic ring disease" and severe chlorotic mosaic of leaves. It is referred to as PVY-NTN (necrotic group [N] and inducing tuber necrosis [TN]) and is the most virulent strain of PVY. It has been suggested that PVY-NTN isolates may have resulted from natural combination of local strains of PVY-N with PVY-O or PVY-C.

PVY-O isolates induce severe symptoms on potato leaves, such as crinkling, leaf drop, or severe necrotic mosaic. PVY-C isolates causes stipple streak on potato cultivars carrying the Nc resistance gene. Some isolates determined serologically as PVY-O and inducing less severe symptoms in potato than the PVY-N isolates have been called PVY-N-Wilga isolates. PVY-N:O indicates a recombinant strain with PVY-N and PVY-O components.

The emergence of new and recombinant PVY strains is being reported from different areas (examples in ProMED-mail posts listed below). Numbers of co-infecting strains will build up with every crop cycle if PVY infected seed tubers are used, especially if these are moved to different areas where the virus strains they carry may combine with local PVY populations. PVY strains may also occur in (possibly synergistic) co-infection with others of the around 40 known potato viruses, invariably leading to severely reduced plant vigour and a dramatic drop in yield. The important role that tubers play in virus and viroid spread is recognised by the strict requirements for certified seed potato production in many countries worldwide.
