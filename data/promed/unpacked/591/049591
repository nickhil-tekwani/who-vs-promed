The Central Asian state's emergencies ministry said on Thursday [3
Jul 2008] 3 people have been hospitalized with suspected anthrax in
the Qyzylorda [Kyzylorda] region in central Kazakhstan. A 35-year-old
man who was forced to cull a sick cow was taken on Tuesday [1 Jul
2008] to the Shieli district hospital in the Kyzylorda region with
anthrax symptoms. Another 2 men, who also participated in
slaughtering the animal, were hospitalized Wednesday [2 Jul 2008]
evening, the ministry said. People who may have been in contact with
the sick animal have been placed under medical observation.

Regional authorities have also set up a headquarters to coordinate
health measures, introduced in the area, to combat and eliminate the
lethal infection, the ministry said.

Anthrax cases have also been reported in neighboring Russia.

Russia's health officials said on Tuesday [1 Jul 2008] that 8 people
had been hospitalized in the East Siberian Republic of Buryatia with
suspected anthrax. Three more people, who developed symptoms similar
to skin anthrax, had been hospitalized suspected of suffering with
the disease following a medical examination.

In a separate development, a state of emergency was introduced on
Tuesday [1 Jul 2008] in the Ketchenerovsky District of the southern
Russian Republic of Kalmykia, where a total of 5 sheep and goats have
died of anthrax since 18 Jun 2008.

[In Kazakhstan there was a typical case of anthrax infection during
slaughtering of cattle. As a rule, people get the infection from sick
cattle during the slaughter and burial of carcasses (74.1 percent),
cooking of infected meat (13 percent), care of sick animals (5.5
percent), trade on the markets (1.8 percent).

The same situation has occurred in Buryatia (Russia), where at
present 2 cases of anthrax have been laboratory confirmed. Anthrax
has not yet been confirmed in 2 hospitalised patients. Corr.BA

In general, cutaneous lesions are the most common lesions seen with
anthrax and one can safely assume that it is as a result of exposure
to a dead carcass and contaminated blood coming in contact with skin
cuts and abrasions. Promptly treated patients should recover though
the slow response will concern some physicians; it can take 10 or
more days for the inflamed tissue to go down. Without treatment some
10 percent of cutaneous cases can die.

Qyzylorda, or Kyzl-Orda, in Kazakhstan, can be found at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KZ/14/Qyzylorda.html>
to the east of the Aral Sea in an area enzootic for anthrax.

We have not been given the town in Buryatia where 11 people are
reported affected. But the general area for this region immediately
east of Lake Baikal can be gauged from
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/11/>.
Though the disease is known in eastern Siberia we see few reports.
