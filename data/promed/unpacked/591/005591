Health authorities say cases of typhoid fever in some areas of Metro
Vancouver have jumped almost 50 percent since 2007. The Fraser Health
Authority says more than 80 percent of typhoid fever cases in its
region are linked to travel to India, mostly to the Punjab. The
Fraser Health Authority and the BC Centre for Disease Control are
recommending that people traveling to places where typhoid is common
get vaccinated before their trip.

Arrangements for vaccinations should be done several months ahead of
time because some vaccines require several doses. Typhoid is also
common in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri
Lanka.

People are exposed to the bacteria that cause typhoid fever by eating
contaminated food and drink.

[Typhoid fever is the classical human infection caused by _Salmonella
enterica_ subtype Typhi. Unlike most salmonellae, _S._ Typhi is not
zoonotic, being a pathogen only of humans, and often causes
constipation and not diarrhea.

As a reminder, the term abdominal typhus is still used in some places
to refer to typhoid fever, since typhus (caused by _Rickettsia
prowazekii_) and typhoid fever (caused by _Salmonella typhi_) present
quite similar symptoms, such as the fever pattern, the rash, and the
cloudy mental state (also called coma vigil).

Differences include autopsy evidence of Peyer's patches involvement,
positive blood cultures for bacilli, and a reactive Widal test in
typhoid fever. - Mod.LL]
