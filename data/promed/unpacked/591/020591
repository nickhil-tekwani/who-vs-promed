Gulf of Maine whale deaths raising fears of toxic algae
-----------------------------------
More than 15 years after dead whales washed ashore at Cape Cod, history may
be repeating itself.
Scientists investigating a cluster of whale carcasses in the Gulf of Maine
say a near-invisible, toxic algae blamed for at least 14 whale deaths in
1987 may have struck again.
Blubber, skin, waste products and stomach fluid collected this week from 6
dead whales floating hundreds of miles off the Maine coast will help
determine whether the culprit is an algal bloom, often called red tide
because of its appearance when heavily concentrated.
Marine experts say the naturally occurring neurotoxin in the algae may have
been passed to the whales by the small fish they eat. The toxin could have
incapacitated the whales and kept them from breathing or feeding properly,
said Donald Anderson, a principal investigator and senior biologist at
Woods Hole (Massachusetts) Oceanographic Institution.
A team of researchers planned to revisit the carcasses on Monday to take
water samples, knowing full well the difficult task they face searching for
clues in a dynamic water system.
But, Anderson said, "If we can find the toxin in the whale tissue and find
that there are still a lot of toxic cells in there, then we'll have the
smoking gun, or at least the best we're going to get."
Authorities say at least 10 whales have been found dead in July near
Georges Bank, an underwater plateau that extends from Cape Cod northeast to
Nova Scotia and separates the Gulf of Maine from the Atlantic Ocean. It is
about 200 miles southeast of Portland.
Casualties include one fin whale, one pilot whale, and between 6 and 12
humpback whales, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration Fisheries in the Northeast. Dead whales are also cropping up
in Canadian waters. Canadian news reports put the number at more than a dozen.
The whales had been dead for between a week and a month when they were
found, said Teri Frady, spokeswoman for the federal agency, which is
charged with large-whale protection.
If the test results, expected by next week, are inconclusive, experts may
try to pull a more recently deceased animal to shore for more complete
testing, Frady said.
Toxic algae has emerged as a probable cause as other suspected causes grow
less likely. Anderson said veterinarians did not notice viral symptoms in
the whales, and NOAA Fisheries said there were no obvious signs of trauma.
Large numbers of whale deaths are rare, and some scientists say an unusual
set of events must have occurred, like the ones believed to have led to the
1987 whale deaths.
That year, mackerel had migrated south from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where
they likely ate toxic zooplankton, just as the whales were preparing to
migrate to the Caribbean and needed to consume a lot of food to generate
energy.
Because the sand lance typically eaten by the whales was in short supply
that year, the animals switched to eating the toxic mackerel. [The sand
lance is an elongated eel-like fish that swims in schools and embeds itself
in the sand at ebb tide. - CopyEd.PG]
"The fish kept eating zooplankton without being killed and the poor whales
didn't stop eating the fish until they were dead," said oceanographer David
Townsend.
Townsend, director of the School of Marine Sciences at the University of
Maine, said it is unlikely that the whales got sick near Georges Bank. He
said fish likely consumed the algae in 2 areas in the Gulf of Maine that
are prone to algal blooms -- the mouth of the Bay of Fundy and a patch
located 50 miles south of Penobscot Bay.
"My guess is that the fish that had been eating the toxic zooplankton were
followed to the point where the whales ate them and (then) moved onto
Georges Bank," Townsend said.
Scientists say there is little chance that the toxic algae will find its
way to the coast of Maine because of the currents -- good news for the
shellfish industry. Algal blooms closer to the coast already force the
state to regularly close shellfish beds on a temporary basis. In humans,
toxins can cause dizziness, nausea, fever, paralysis, and even death.
John Hurst, who directs biotoxin monitoring in shellfish for the Maine
Department of Marine Resources, said the state's monitoring system "will
keep everyone from getting sick."
"If we find that shellfish are getting toxic, there'll be closings," he
said. "The Maine patrol people will see to it that you won't harvest, and
dealers don't want it anyway because they don't want to be sued by somebody."
Anderson agreed, praising Maine's shellfish monitoring system as "one of
the best in the world."

[The toxic algae found in marine water are usually a different species than
those found in fresh water. Often times toxic algae blooms in marine water
may go by the common name of red tide, although not all toxin marine algae
cause a red coloring, and some fresh-water toxic algae may produce the red
coloring. - Mod.TG]
