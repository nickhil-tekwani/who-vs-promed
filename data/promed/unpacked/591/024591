In Rangpur, 2 people, including a child, have died, possibly from
Nipah encephalitis. They died on Friday [25 Feb 2011] at Rangpur
Medical College Hospital. One of the victim's husband died 11 days ago
at the hospital with similar symptoms. The hospital's chief of
medicine professor Zakir Hossain said whether the 2 had died from
Nipah infection could only be confirmed after tests. "They did have
symptoms of Nipah [virus] infection however," he added.

Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) urged
people not to be worried about the fresh infections in other parts of
the region as these cases were sporadic, not in a 'cluster.' "It's not
a matter of concern as we are getting scattered (single) cases,"
senior scientist Dr M Mushtuq Husain said on Monday [21 Feb 2011],
adding "if it infects another person within a 15-minute walking
distance, then it would be a matter of concern. Usually, we find the
presence of Nipah virus every year in Rangpur region," he told
bdnews24.com. IECDR confirmed deaths of 17 people since the outbreak
in Lalmonirhaat at the beginning of this year [2011].

Bats, primary carriers of Nipah, pass the virus into [palm] sap
through saliva and droppings. People get the virus while drinking raw
sap.

It appears with symptoms of fever, altered mental status and seizure.
Since its 1st outbreak in 2001 in Meherpur, the virus has so far
killed 130 people out of 176 affected, including the recent deaths.

[It is more likely that Nipah virus infections were 1st recognized in
2001, rather than that the 2001 cases were the 1st to occur there. The
virus in endemic in _Pteropus_ fruit bats, and the bats, probably with
the virus, has been present in Bangladesh for centuries, if not
millennia. Although these scattered cases do not portend an epidemic,
none-the-less they are of concern in that with public education and
with some simple, locally constructed barriers to keep the bats out of
the palm sap, these scattered cases with loss of life can be reduced.
