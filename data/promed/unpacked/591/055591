Sri Lanka seeks international help with viral epidemic
Sri Lanka has sought help from the World Health Organization to combat a
viral flu epidemic spreading though the country, health ministry
officials said. Initial investigations by Sri Lanka's Medical Research
Institute had shown that the flu, which has affected hundreds of
thousands of people in the country, was caused by the Influenza A virus,
Director General of Health Dr. V. Jeganathan told Reuters. "We have
sought the assistance of the World Health Organization. We have asked
them to confirm our findings," he said. The epidemic has claimed the
lives of at least 15 children and two adults as thousands of people with
flu symptoms have crowded hospitals across the country in the past three
weeks, health officials have said. An official of the epidemiological
unit of the health ministry said on Tuesday the incidence of flu had
eased in the capital Colombo. "We have seen a dramatic reduction in the
number of cases in Colombo but the virus is still spreading in the
suburbs," the official said.
