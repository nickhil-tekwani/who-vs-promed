LUCENA CITY, Philippines, Sep 22 - The Philippines government has warned
companies against the use of a substance which reportedly causes the
mysterious Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS).
Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) issued the warning in view of
reports that some companies at the Cavite Export Pprocessing Zone (CEPZ)
in Rosario, Cavite, were using tricoloenthylene (TCE) for cleaning
purposes. TCE was an ingredient in the substance to which four workers
afflicted with SJS in a Korean firm in Bacolor, Pampanga were exposed.
A victim, who had direct contact with the substance, died following
multi-organ failure due to SJS.
Government agencies, including DOLE, moved promptly to stop the
contamination of the other workers with the substance and protect them
from contracting SJS.
The regional offies of the DOLE, including the Bureau of Working
Condition (BWC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Center (OSHC),
had been alerted to assist companies and factories in protecting workers
from the Steven Johnson Syndrome.
[Sounds to me like there is one too many of the letter "n" in the name
of the chemical as reported. Can anyone confirm that, and give us a
case definition of SJS? - Mod.JW]
