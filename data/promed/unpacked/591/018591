UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, CANADA GEESE - USA (OREGON) (02)

In regard to ProMED-mail posting 20050204.0386 Undiagnosed deaths,
Canada geese - USA (OR): RFI, I notice that in Australia, there is
Annual Ryegrass Poisoning, which usually affects sheep and cattle.
But, since annual ryegrass is grown in the Willamette River Valley of
Oregon, is it possible that grazing geese can get a similar poisoning?
