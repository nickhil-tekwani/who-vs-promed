ALERT: Florida finds ASR in same Dade County kudzu as last year [2005]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The kudzu site in Dade County, Florida that was confirmed with ASR on
29 Apr 2005 (last year) was found to have ASR sporulating on its
still-green leaves last week [2nd week February 2006].
In today's [13 Feb 2006] Florida state commentary
<http://www.sbrusa.net>,
University of Florida plant pathologist James Marois reported: "In
another pass through Florida last week, the positive 2005 kudzu site
in Dade County was found again to be positive. Leaves were green and
the fungus was sporulating. We are seeing the coldest weather of the
season this week. In Quincy, there was a lot of frost this morning
and ice on the edge of shallow waters."
Marois recommended consulting the Florida Automated Weather Network
Web site for specific weather information across Florida.
The 29 Apr 2005 ASR find in Dade County (home to Miami in southeast
Florida) was the 4th of the season for the state. It was also the 1st
2005 Florida find south of the nation's 1st confirmed ASR of the year
in Pasco County, Florida, on 23 Feb 2005.
Florida had one county positive for ASR post-season in 2004, Gadsden
County. ASR was confirmed there in a university test plot in Quincy
on 17 Nov 2004. In 2005, Gadsden County was confirmed to have ASR on
17 Jul 2005, and this year [2006] was one of 9 Florida counties with
ASR announced on 17 Jan 2006.
Florida is now reporting 11 counties positive for ASR in 2006,
bringing the U.S. total to 14 positive counties.

[2] Significance of kudzu as alternate host for ASR

Rust-Kudzu Relation Examined
----------------------------
Kudzu is an alternate host for ASR, but how much it contributes to
the rust threat in the U.S. is still being investigated.
Kudzu, one of 95 known hosts for Asian soybean rust, is right at home
in the south. The plant grows almost too well. Vines can grow more
than a foot a day during summer months, climbing trees, power poles
and anything else they contact. Kudzu plants will survive the winters
in the south, but freezing temperatures will kill off any green
leaves.
If the plants survive, ASR will overwinter on kudzu.
Kudzu was introduced to the United States in 1876 at the Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the Great Depression
of the 1930s, the Soil Conservation Service promoted kudzu for
erosion control. Hundreds of young men were given work planting kudzu
through the Civilian Conservation Corps.
How it will affect the spread of ASR is still an uncertainty. The
plant is a very good host in Asia and South America but less of an
ideal host in the U.S. Tests on spore production of ASR on kudzu has
been inconsistent, which means it's not as good a host here as
elsewhere.
Kudzu growing along roadsides and in ditch banks in Brazil are
infected with ASR but show no apparent loss of plant vigor, meaning
the disease does not defoliate and kill the plant as it does soybeans.
Morris Bonde, a research plant pathologist with the USDA at Fort
Detrick, Maryland said many hosts exist for ASR in the U.S.
"The ASR pathogen has a large host range, which is very rare for rust
pathogens. It infects at least 95 other species," he said.
In the U.S., we are concerned about clovers, cowpeas, green beans, lima beans
and kudzu, Bonde said. Clovers, alfalfa, cowpeas and Lima beans do not
sporulate [the fungus], so are of little risk. Green beans and green peas are
fairly susceptible because they sporulate.
"Lupines are very susceptible, and there are over 150 individual
species that are susceptible," he said. "Kudzu is very susceptible,
has high sporulation, but the plant can tolerate the disease."
Soybeans are the most susceptible species in the U.S. with high
sporulation and, if infected, quickly defoliate and die.
If a significant portion of kudzu is susceptible in the U.S., its
importance to potential ASR epidemics cannot be underestimated. The
questions that remain unanswered are how susceptible the kudzu is and
do biotypes sporulate differently. If so, will some provide a greater
risk of inoculum production than others?
The ASR pathogen can survive in Florida and Texas on kudzu in areas
that do not freeze. In years such as 2004-2005, in winter, the kudzu
froze back all the way down to the Gulf Coast. This year [2006], some
kudzu survived in protected areas, and ASR will overwinter in areas
that we did not expect, Bonde said.
"The earlier the disease gets into soybean growing areas, the earlier
the inoculum builds up and the greater the risk of damage," he said.
Fortunately, what is in U.S. growers' favor is that rust does not
overwinter very well in the U.S. If it does survive and survives over
a greater number of sites along the Gulf Coast, we could see an
epidemic, Bonde said.
"Most people feel that the disease will do damage in some years but
not in others," he said, "and it may never reach the levels of
Brazil. In the U.S., kudzu is quite susceptible and is easily
infected in nature. However, we do not know much about its
sporulation ability. Observations in the U.S. show it becomes
infected easily, but does not get die or defoliate like soybeans."
Some biotypes are susceptible, and others are not very susceptible, Bonde said.
"In the U.S., kudzu is not nearly as susceptible as soybeans, and the
amount of infection is low enough that it does not knock it back like
it does soybeans," he said.
Perhaps kudzu grows so fast making it appear less susceptible, so it
does not get knocked back like soybeans, Bonde said.
Bonde and his colleagues at USDA are screening 50 biotypes of kudzu
they received from Mississippi. At Fort Detrick, USDA maintains its
containment greenhouse where they can test pathogens without risk of
them escaping into the environment.
It's in this facility Bonde plans to establish the kudzu biotypes,
inoculate them with the pathogen and test their reaction to ASR and
their ability to sporulate.
"It seems that we have some biotypes of kudzu that are vulnerable," he said.
Response to ASR by the kudzu species is highly sporadic. Some are
easily infected and others not, and some sporulate heavily and can be
a major source of inoculum, while others will not.
Bonde said he doesn't yet know why the kudzu plant doesn't die or
totally defoliate as do soybeans. But reactions differ to the
disease, depending on the isolates.
"Different isolates of the pathogen react differently on different
kudzu plants. We are going to screen the different biotypes with
different isolates," he said.
The goal is to find out whether the most common biotypes of kudzu in
the U.S. either do not develop the disease or do not heavily
sporulate. That could be a good sign, because it would mean
populations of kudzu native to the U.S. would not be a major source
of inoculum, but only an overwintering green bridge host.

Culvert Protects Georgia Soybean Rust; Florida Finds 11th Rust Case
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Scouts found an ASR case on Friday [10 Feb 2006] in Thomas County,
Georgia on kudzu growing in a concrete culvert. Thomas County, which
is located along the Florida border, did not have any positive ASR
finds in 2005.
The site was scouted on 30 Jan 2006 with negative results, but this
time around, pustules and spores were found on the plant, according
to USDA's ASR Information Site. Both older and newer green leaves
were infected.
Scientists believe the culvert served as a "heat island," protecting
the kudzu from low temperatures. Temperatures at the site dropped to
30 F on 9 Feb 2006 and to 29 F on 10 Feb 2006.
"There was no sign of frost injury," USDA said. "Young, greening
kudzu tissue found on 30 Jan 2006 was frozen, foliage gone, but vines
had survived."
Friday's [10 Feb 2006] find boosts Georgia's rust case total to 2.
Florida found rust in Dade County on Monday [13 Feb 2006], bringing
its 2006 case total to 11. Alabama has one confirmed case.
"It is unknown whether ASR is distributed more widely in the southern
U.S. in early February 2006 than it was one year ago," USDA said.
"There has been more extensive scouting this winter; all the Florida
kudzu locations that were positive for ASR in 2005 have been scouted
in January/February 2006 as well as many of the kudzu sites where no
ASR was found last year."

[4] Rust Spores Found in Rain
Date: 13 Feb 2006

More rust spores were found in rainwater in 2005 than expected
--------------------------------------------------------------
One of the most interesting findings that came out late last fall
[2005] was that scientifically confirmed rust spores were deposited
by rainfall across much of the Corn Belt.
Les Szabo, a research geneticist at USDA's Cereal Disease Laboratory
(CDL) at the University of Minnesota, was involved in a study in
2005, when they collected rainwater samples from a series of
collectors across the Corn Belt over the course of the summer and
fall, filtered out the particulate matter and then, using molecular
techniques, confirmed the presence of spores of ASR in the rainwater.
But the test does not measure the viability of the spores or their
ability to germinate and infect leaves.
For many years, USDA has tracked the movement of wheat rust spores
northward. Scientists have found spores of wheat rust as far north as
the Dakotas as early as May, which indicates spores can move long
distances early in the year. Using this same detection system,
scientists said they could follow the movement of ASR spores and
detect them earlier than they thought possible. But 1st, they needed
the molecular tools to confirm the identity of ASR spores.
"The risk of ASR raised the question of using the NADP (National
Atmospheric Deposition Program) wet deposition collection sites to
monitor rust spore movement," Szabo said.
The NAPD maintains a series of 250 rainwater collectors across the US
that were set up in the 1970s to monitor air pollution.
"NADP analyzes filtered rainwater for dissolved pollutants in rain
samples, [which] thus allowed us to analyze the filtered particulate
matter for fungal spores," he said.
In 2005, scientists collected spores in rainwater and looked at them with a
microscope. "This was a tedious process, and [it is] very difficult to
differentiate ASR from other rust spores," Szabo said. "They just can't
confirm their identity."
Szabo and his colleagues last year [2005] received funding to do a
national survey to further develop the molecular assay and monitor
124 sites across the Corn Belt.
"We covered all states south from North Dakota to Texas and east to
the Atlantic coast, except for the New England states," he said. "We
selected 124 sites to represent all of the soybean growing areas in
the central and eastern part of the U.S. All the states contained
more than one collection site. However, since the network was
established to monitor air pollution, several key soybean states had
only a few sites."
The NADP program took weekly samples, Szabo said. "Sites are sampled
weekly, every Tuesday morning," he said. "We have samples from the
mid-May through early November."
Rainwater samples were collected and then filtered by the NADP staff,
Szabo said. Filter papers with particular matter containing the rust
spores was dried and then tested for DNA of ASR spores.
Unfortunately, there is not a good molecular method to test for
viability, and it is unlikely spores survived collection and
transport.
One important aspect of the project was developing a molecular method
to detect the ASR spores, Szabo said, so they modified a real-time
polymerase chain reaction assay developed by scientists at Fort
Detrick, Maryland.
Polymerase chain reaction is a method for amplifying DNA. This is
important, because a few spores do not contain enough DNA for
identification. But if you amplify the DNA by making many copies, it
is easier to confirm the identity with the necessary degree of
accuracy.
Szabo and his colleagues collected more than 3000 samples and so far
have analyzed 1600 samples and found 85 positives. So far, the team
has processed and reported on samples collected through August 2005.
About 1400 samples remain to be processed and reported, and
processing the samples is tedious, Szabo said.
"It takes 4 people working full time to process a couple hundred
samples a week," he said.
The 1st spores were detected in May 2005 in North and South Carolina
and Tennessee, Szabo said.
The team's survey reports that in June 2005, spores were detected in
11 states from Florida to Texas to Minnesota and North Dakota, but
skipping the central Corn Belt. In July 2005, spores were detected in
13 states in the south, the Appalachian mountain range and the
northwestern Corn Belt. In August 2005, spores were found in 17
states in the south, the Allegany mountain range, the eastern Corn
Belt and the northwestern Corn Belt.
"The 85 positive findings were distributed throughout [the] soybean
growing area," Szabo said. "There were no positive finds for
Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska or Oklahoma. But there were positive
findings in Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota
and Wisconsin."
Scientists don't yet understand why ASR spores were found in the
northern states but not in these central Plains states, Szabo said.
"This could be a result of the low number of rainwater collection
sites in these states or the track of rain storms which transported
the spores further north," he said. "This needs further study."
Texas had several positives during summer, which was a surprise,
Szabo said, but Georgia had none.
Georgia was drier than normal, but Szabo said he did not understand
why they did not find any rainwater samples in the state. One reason
may be the weather patterns and where spores are picked up by the
storms.
The southern end of the Appalachian mountain range also had several
positives, he said, because of the way storms track north northeast
out of the gulf, hit mountain ranges and deposit rain and spores.
"Interestingly, preliminary analysis indicates that there was no
clustering of positive finds associated with Hurricane Katrina or
Rita," he said. "We found no correlation between spore deposition and
tropical storm events in 2005."
ASR spores were found across most of the Midwest and northeast
throughout the summer, Szabo said. The spores are easily transported
via the atmosphere over long distances, but scientists don't know
whether the spores are viable. Once they finish their sample
processing, they will know whether spores were found at one time or
another in the entire soybean producing state.
Szabo said he and his colleagues plan to repeat the survey again in 2006.

National Map Commentary (updated: 17 Feb 2006)
----------------------------------------------
The only 2 known rust positive sites in Georgia in 2006, one in Grady
county and one in Thomas county, were removed/destroyed. As a result,
these counties have been turned back to green on the observation map.
Please consult state commentary for more information.
Scouting for ASR continues on kudzu patches from Florida northward
through Georgia and Alabama, and westward to Texas. The confirmed
reports of kudzu in 2006 include Alabama with one and Florida with 11
counties. Due to the recent cold temperatures in northern to mid
Florida, much of the kudzu has died back. In one location just north
of Ocala, Florida new growth from this year [2006] had reached 3 to 4
feet in length, but was dead due to the frost on 14 Feb 2006. Other
sites further south of there and east of Tampa also suffered from the
frost. In general, there was about 90 percent kill of leaves from new
growth in 2006 in the sites west of Tampa. There may still be some
green kudzu in southernmost Alabama and Georgia in protected sites.
The possibilities of frost are not over in Florida, as the last
frost-free date for parts of northern Florida goes to 15 Mar 2006. In
general, as temperatures warm in central Florida, the kudzu is likely
to leaf out very quickly, as most stems and buds are green and ready
to grow.

[6] Ohio to use sentinel plots in 2006

Ohio to maintain its 45 ASR sentinel plots in 2006
--------------------------------------------------
Sentinel plots, established throughout the country last year [2005]
as the 1st line of defense against ASR, will again be a part of the
plan to monitor the disease this growing season.
Anne Dorrance, an Ohio State University plant pathologist with the
Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center and the state's
leading ASR expert, said that Ohio will maintain its 45 sentinel
plots.
"The sentinel plots worked, and they worked very well, and we got
good participation from the counties. The Extension educators did an
outstanding job scouting the sentinel plots," said Dorrance, who also
holds an Ohio State University Extension appointment. "Because of the
sentinel plots placed throughout the South, we will know a month
ahead of time if we are going to be at risk from ASR during 2006."
According the USDA, sentinel plots have been established in more than
30 states and Canada, stretching as far south as Florida, as far
north as Ontario, as far east as Delaware and as far west as
Washington.
A total of 138 counties throughout the United States tested positive
for ASR last year [2005]. The closest ASR got to Ohio was Kentucky,
where one rust pustule was found on kudzu in November 2005, long
after the soybean crop had been harvested. This year, the extent of
the disease's spread will hinge on how well wintry weather in the
South will hold the disease back.
"The big questions are how low will the freeze line go in the South,
and how soon will the inoculum build up this spring [2006]," said
Dorrance. "We've been having anything but a normal winter this year,
so anything can happen."
So far this year [2006], the USDA has reported positive ASR finds on
kudzu in Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
"Even if we get a lot of inoculum build-up this year [2006], an
unexpected epidemic in Ohio would be unlikely," said Dorrance. "At
just a 3 percent infection level in soybean fields across the state,
we would have to have 12 million spores hit every acre in the state
all at the same time. With 5 million acres, that just doesn't
compute, and we'd know that ASR was present long before it ever
reached that level because it would be everywhere."
Nonetheless, researchers are keeping a close watch on the disease's
potential path north. ASR can enter Ohio through a variety of routes:
south through Kentucky, from North Carolina over the Appalachian
mountains, or up the Mississippi River and along the Ohio River
through southern Indiana and western Kentucky.
"The network is in place. It's safe to say we've got all of that
covered," Dorrance said.
For the latest information on ASR, log on to the USDA's Soybean Rust
Information Site.
OARDC plant pathologist Dennis Mills will provide a ASR update at the
Conservation Tillage and Technology Conference 23-24 Feb 2006 at Ohio
Northern University in Ada, Ohio. For more information, go to

[Keywords: crop, plant disease, soybean, _Glycine max_, soybean rust,
Asian strain, _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, ASR.
One of the sites that had an April 2005 detection of the fungal
pathogen _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, the cause of ASR, on kudzu
(_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) in Dade County Florida
was confirmed to be an infected site in 13 Feb 2006. A 2nd site in
2006 was found in Georgia in Thomas County on 13 Feb 2006, but the
kudzu at this and an earlier positive site in Georgia was removed.
This means that Florida and Alabama are the only 2 states to have
known infection centers.
Taking these events into account, the confirmed reports of infected
kudzu in 2006 in mid February now include Alabama with one and
Florida with 11 counties. The role of kudzu in the epidemiology of
ASR is not clear in the southern states of the USA, where frost can
still (February) be a factor that could kill plants, including those
that have survived in protected spots and which account for several
of the finds to date.
Questions remain about ASR spore producing capacity on kudzu and
whether all biotypes of the plant are equal in levels of defoliation
and spore production when infected. The use of rain collections,
which can be monitored for spores of ASR by molecular methods, has
been demonstrated. 1600 samples collected in 2005 were tested, and to
date, 85 were positive for ASR. The effectiveness of doing this as a
method to monitor disease potential remains to be confirmed, and has
the obvious handicap of only being useful where it has been raining,
in contrast to the collection of aerial spores. Neither method can
predict the viability of the spores detected. The use of sentinel
plots will again be a major tool for spotting early infections should
they occur in northern states like Ohio (none in 2005), or monitoring
when they occur in states to the south. Note the 1st report of ASR in
Mexico in the "see also" section.
