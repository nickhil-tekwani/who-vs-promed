Elk in the cross hairs
----------------------
Montana wildlife officials killed 2 radio-collared cow elk near Gardiner
that had tested positive for exposure to brucellosis, a bacterial disease
that can cause pregnant cattle, bison and elk to abort calves.

The rest of the elk herd, which tested negative, will be allowed to
continue grazing in the Paradise Valley and south-central portions of
Yellowstone National Park, where they spend most of the spring, summer and
fall, Ron Aasheim, spokesman for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks (FWP), said on Wednesday [14 Jan 2009]. So far, only wildlife
near Yellowstone have tested positive for brucellosis, Aasheim said. "We
have not found brucellosis anywhere else," he said.

Officials have known for years that elk carry the disease and can transmit
it to cattle and bison. But after finding it in 2 different cattle herds
during the past year [2008], causing Montana to lose its brucellosis-free
status, state wildlife experts have ramped up efforts to track the disease.

Since 1981, FWP has tested nearly 7000 elk for brucellosis, mostly north
and west of Yellowstone Park. But this year, after the National Veterinary
Service said elk were the likely culprits infecting cattle, FWP expanded
efforts to collect blood samples from hunter-harvested elk in south western
Montana. And the agency is working toward implementing better tracking
systems, Aasheim said, "collaring another bunch of elk as we speak."

Existing tests show that up to 5 per cent of the elk grazing in and near
the park have been exposed to brucellosis. Fewer than half of those
infected are capable of passing it on, said state veterinarian Marty
Zaluski. But cattle ranchers, nervous about the disease, are asking the
state to increase elk-monitoring efforts, said Errol Rice, executive vice
president of the Montana Stockgrowers Association.

By better understanding the disease, the FWP aims to limit cattle-wildlife
interactions during late-winter and spring months when the potential for
transmission is highest, rather than targeting brucellosis-positive elk for
removal, Aasheim said. And although brucellosis may be more visible now
with increased testing, the threat to Montana cattle likely has not
increased, Aasheim said. "I don't think the threat is any greater than it's
ever been," Aasheim said.

While it's no surprise the disease popped up this week, Rice said ranchers
need to be vigilant and lobby the state to fund wildlife testing, to help
ensure cattle herds stay healthy. "Just hunters alone are not going to be
able to give adequate numbers," Rice said. "We can always do more."

On Monday, the Montana Board of Livestock approved an "action plan" to
limit transmission of the disease among cattle, requiring cattle in a
7-county area considered high risk be tested, largely based on exposure to
elk and bison. And Zaluski said the state's various efforts to halt the
disease are paying off. "We've made a fair amount of progress in a short
amount of time," Zaluski said. "But we still have a way to go."

The 2 elk killed on Tuesday were tested last spring [2008] and found to be
carrying the disease, but Montana wildlife officials waited until the
animals left the park before putting them down.

[The disease is caused by a group of bacteria known scientifically as the
genus _Brucella_. 3 species of _Brucella_ cause the most concern: _B.
abortus_, principally affecting cattle, bison, and cervids; _B. suis_,
principally affecting swine and reindeer but also cattle and bison; and _B.
melitensis_, principally affecting goats but not present in the United
States. In the Greater Yellowstone Area, the bacterium of concern is _B.
abortus_. In cattle and bison, the disease currently localizes in the
reproductive tract discharges.

There is no effective way to detect infected animals by their appearance.
The most obvious signs in pregnant animals are abortion or birth of weak
calves. Milk production may be reduced from changes in the normal lactation
period caused by abortions and delayed conceptions. Not all infected cows
abort, but those that do usually abort between the 5th and 7th month of
pregnancy. Infected cows usually abort once, but a percentage will abort
during additional pregnancies, and calves born from later pregnancies may
be weak and unhealthy. Even though their calves may appear healthy,
infected cows continue to harbor and discharge infectious organisms and
should be regarded as dangerous sources of the disease. Other signs of
brucellosis include an apparent lowering of fertility with poor conception
rates, retained afterbirths with resulting uterine infections, and
(occasionally) enlarged, arthritic joints. organs and/or the udder.
Bacteria are shed in milk or via the aborted fetus, afterbirth, or other
reproductive tract discharges.

The incubation period of brucellosis in cattle, bison, and other animals is
quite variable ranging from about 2 weeks to 1 year and even longer in
certain instances. When abortion is the 1st sign observed, the minimum
incubation period is about 30 days. Some animals abort before developing a
positive reaction to the diagnostic test. Other infected animals may never
abort.

Generally, infected animals that do not abort develop a positive reaction
to the diagnostic test within 30 to 60 days after infection, although some
may not develop a positive reaction for several months to more than a year.

Repeated attempts to develop a cure for brucellosis in animals have failed.
Occasionally, animals may recover after a period of time. More commonly,
however, only the signs disappear and the animals remain diseased. Such
animals are dangerous sources of infection for other animals with which
they associate.

Brucellosis is commonly transmitted to susceptible animals by direct
contact with infected animals or with an environment that has been
contaminated with discharges from infected animals. Aborted fetuses,
placental membranes or fluids, and other vaginal discharges present after
an infected animal has aborted or calved are all highly contaminated with
infectious brucella organisms. Cows may lick those materials or the genital
area of other cows or ingest the disease-causing organisms with
contaminated food or water. Despite occasional exceptions, the general rule
is that brucellosis is carried from one herd to another by an infected or
exposed animal. This mode of transmission occurs when a herd owner buys
replacement cattle or bison that are infected or have been exposed to
infection prior to purchase. The disease may also be spread when wild
animals or animals from an affected herd mingle with brucellosis-free herds.

The presence of brucellosis in free-ranging bison and elk in Yellowstone
National Park and Grand Teton National Park threatens the brucellosis
status of the surrounding states and the health of their livestock herds,
which are free of the disease. Reintroduction of the disease into a
brucellosis-free state could have a serious economic impact on domestic
livestock markets and potentially threaten export markets. The US
Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) is working cooperatively with other State and Federal
agencies toward containing the spread of brucellosis from bison to domestic
livestock and eliminating the disease from the Yellowstone and Teton herds
while maintaining viable free-roaming bison herds in the parks.
