New task force set up to tackle spoonbill deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Council of Agriculture (COA) yesterday established a national task
force that will seek international assistance and strengthen domestic
ecological conservation to tackle the epidemic of botulism that has killed
66 rare black-faced spoonbills.
COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung was urged yesterday by legislators,
conservationists, bird watchers, and environmentalists to tackle more
efficiently the recent deaths of the endangered birds, which winter at the
Chiku Lagoon in Tainan County, every October to April.
At a closed-door meeting held at the COA yesterday, DPP Legislator Eugene
Jao said a national-level task force was necessary because the possibility
of receiving international assistance relied on the government's active
involvement.
It is estimated the global population of the black-faced spoonbill does not
exceed 1000. According to Taiwanese bird watchers, 705 black-faced
spoonbills have already been observed this winter in Taiwan. As of 24 Dec
2002, however, 66 of them had died from _C. botulinum_ poisoning.
Local authorities have asked for the COA's help because the lack of
anti-_C.botulinum_ serum resulted in a delay in rescuing sick spoonbills.
The COA, however, has yet to solve serum shortage.
Jao contacted Japanese experts at Japan's National Institute of Infectious
Diseases and received a positive response. "They are waiting for an
official invitation from the government," Jao said. According to Yang
Jiao-yen, assistant to Jao, Motohide Takahashi, a specialist at the
institute, would like to offer related technologies. In addition, Shunji
Kozaki , a veterinary professor of Osaka Prefecture University, and Takeda
Masato -- who has dealt with recent botulism cases in birds in Japan --
would like to offer their experience to Taiwan.
COA officials said yesterday they would contact the Japanese experts soon.
Although the Tainan County Government has called on volunteers to pick up
dead fish and animals and dismantle oyster racks in an area covering 2000
hectares since 22 Dec 2002, the real factors that have been causing the
environmental deterioration in the area that fueled the botulism outbreak
remain uncertain.
Legislators had asked the COA to map the area in question and remove all
the dead fish and animal corpses. Legislators said that the COA should ask
for help from the military or demand financial assistance from the Council
of Labor Affairs for hiring workers for the temporary job.
At the meeting, ecological experts urged the COA to set up a standard
operating procedure (SOP) for rescuing endangered species in Taiwan because
the recent deaths of the black-faced spoonbills exposed the government's
lack of preparation to deal with such an outbreak.
"In addition to environmental monitoring, the SOP should be able to offer
guidelines regarding epidemic survey, treatment, and control," said Charles
Cheng, president of the Wild Bird Federation of Taiwan. Chiau Wen-Yan,
president of Wetlands Taiwan, said that he'd suggested that the agriculture
council rezone the ecological reserve.
"The government should have let some fish farms near the lagoon close in
winter and provide buffering zones to ensure sources of food for the
endangered bird," Chiau said.

[From the said news-item, and specifically the reference to the need for
botulism antiserum, it may be deduced that the suspected role of
_C.botulinum_ in the mortality of black-faced spoonbills in Taiwan, has
been confirmed. Generally, botulism in avians is caused by _C.
botulinum_ types C and/or E. Information on the _C.botulinum_ type,
involved in this event, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
