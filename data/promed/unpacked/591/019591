[The following summarised information on Mongolia's FMD situation is
derived from the page "Mongolia" in the website of the FMD World
Reference Laboratory, Pirbright, FMD, available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/mog.htm>:

"Current status: Sporadic
Serotype / Years
FMDV-Untyped / 1931 to 1973
FMDV-O / 1974(?), 2000-2002, 2004, 2010
FMDV-A / ????
FMDV-C / 0000
FMDV-Asia 1 / 2005
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 0000
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000

Notes: Types O and A occurred intermittently between 1931 to 1973. In
the early 1960s, an outbreak of FMDV killed large numbers of gazelles
in Mongolia's Eastern Steppe" (References for said data are included
in the URL above).

According to Mongolia's last annual OIE report, FMD was present in
wildlife during 2009. No further details are included, and it is not
clear if this was clinical or serology-based observation; reportedly,
surveillance in wildlife is applied.

FMD in Mongolian wildlife has been reported several times throughout
the years, including an outbreak in unspecified animals (antelopes?)
in 2004 (see ProMED-mail posting 20040219.0540). The 2 main antelopes
in Mongolia are the zeren or white-tailed gazelle (_Procapra
gutturosa_) and the black-tailed gazelle (_Gazella subgutturosa_). In
the southwest, the Saiga or burhom (_Saiga tatarica_) is present.

Though the current FMD outbreak, in cattle, is not yet resolved, the
impression is that Mongolia's policy, composed of modified stamping
out combined with "vaccination in response to the outbreak," is
effective. Interestingly, camels have been included in the
vaccination scheme. Camelids in Mongolia are (2-humped) Bactrian
camels, in which FMD has been described in the past and demonstrated
experimentally. Contrary to Bactrians, dromedaries (single-hump
camels, common in the Middle East) are regarded to be refractory to
FMD, therefore excluded, according to OIE's International Animal
Health Code, from the list of species susceptible to FMD.

It would be important to get Mongolia's causative virus genotyped, in
order to examine its relationship to the FMDV-O (topotype SEA, strain
Mya-98), currently circulating in China, South Korea, and Japan. -
