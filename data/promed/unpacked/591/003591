Dengue cases spreading
Dengue outbreaks have been declared in six more areas in the country
because of an unusual increase in the number of clustered cases in these
places. The Department of Health said yesterday that outbreaks had been
declared in San Antonio and Jaen, Nueva Ecija; Ballesteros, Cagayan Valley;
Barangays 1 and 9 in Malaybalay, Bukidnon; and Dumaguete City in Negros
Occidental.
The areas where a dengue outbreak has been declared this year now number
seven. An outbreak was declared in the town of Cabatuan in Iloilo in July.
The mosquito-borne disease yesterday claimed another life in Quezon City
the fourth recorded among dengue victims in the city since last month.
The three previous deaths involved persons with ages from 11 months to 18
years, all residents of Fairview.
A total of 7755 dengue cases nationwide were reported to the National
Epidemic Sentinel Surveillance System from January to July.
The Quezon City Health Department has recorded 458 dengue cases so far
since July. Most of these cases were reported in August.
