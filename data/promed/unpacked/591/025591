[It is important to note that only sheep showed clinical signs and
cattle were tested but negative for the disease. A map of the
outbreak area can be found in the OIE report at the source URL above.
The geographic proximity to Asia Minor is noteworthy and mentioned by
Homer in Iliad and Odyssey, as the place where Menelaus, Diomedes,
and Ulysses met after the siege of Troy. - Mod.PC]

[BTV-1 has been, reportedly, circulating during 2009 in 2 separate
regions around the Mediterranean. In the west -- its reappearance in
the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria), in late summer 2009, and in
south-west Europe (Sardinia, Corsica, Spain, Portugal, and France),
where it seems to have been circulating since 2006 (see the EU map,
"Bluetongue restriction zones as of 5 Oct 2009" at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg>.)
And in the east -- Lesvos (current reintroduction, following its
absence since 2001) and Oman (April 2009).

It will be interesting to note if these are 2 (or more?) different
western and eastern genotypes; if the Oman and Lesvos isolates are
similar; and if the Lesvos outbreak reflects its circulation also in
the adjacent mainland.

Similarly, it would be interesting to perform genotyping of the
recent BTV-8 isolates from Lesvos, Israel, and Oman, comparing them
to the west-European genotype. Turkey deserves to be placed high on
the list of candidate territories for BTV surveillance, with special
reference to BTV-1 and BTV-8. - Mod.AS]
