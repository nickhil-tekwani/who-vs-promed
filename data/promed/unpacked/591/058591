Amid the push to get COVID-19 vaccine boosters, Hollywood dog owners are rushing to protect not only themselves from the threat of pandemic but their furry friends as well. However, the pup vaccine they're looking to get isn't made by Pfizer or Moderna -- it's a vaccination to protect against a recent outbreak of leptospirosis among dogs in the Los Angeles (LA) and New York City areas.

While veterinary hospitals in urban areas usually see around 15 to 20 cases of this transmitted disease a year, a recent uptick has shown more than 100 cases in LA and New York just over the course of the past few months. An infection can cause lack of appetite, fever, vomiting, lethargy, diarrhea, dehydration and, in more severe cases, kidney and liver failure, requiring 24-hour hospitalization for several days.

The particular strain behind this outbreak passes from dogs to other dogs. "So it's likely being transmitted at dog parks, daycare facilities, boarding kennels and other highly social areas for dogs," says VCA regional medical director Dr. Silene St. Bernard. Many indoor dog play places around LA, as well as veterinarians, have been sending out alerts to their clients to make sure they vaccinate their 4-legged friends.

This means Hollywood dog owners are working to stay on top of yet another vaccine protocol, as dogs need 2 shots spaced about 3 weeks apart. Says TV producer [TR], a dog owner and resident of Pacific Palisades, California, "One woman raced up to me in the dog park and said, 'Between my 3 shots and his [the pet] 2 shots, I have to hire an assistant to schedule it all.'" She adds recently she also encountered "one woman who had a dog coat made saying Vax 2.0. We live to get ahead of crises out here."

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease shed through the urine of infected animals, most commonly rats, raccoons, opossums and other infected dogs. Once the bacteria have infected water or soil, they can survive there for weeks, even months.

When it comes to the increased cases in New York, Dr. Nahvid Etedali, staff doctor at Manhattan's Animal Medical Center, says he sees 2 factors at play: "Rats and rainfall."

"I've read we have about 2 million rats living in NYC and there has been an increased number of complaints regarding rat infestations in the past year," he says. "Direct contact of dogs with wildlife is not a common means of leptospirosis transmission, but more rats naturally mean more rat urine. Combined with the increased rainfall, this could be leading to more potential for domestic animals to come into contact with leptospires in parks and on the streets."zz

But while leptospirosis can be very serious, Bernard and Etedali both say vaccination is the best course of action to protect your animals. "We may be seeing a rise in cases, but this is not similar to the COVID-19 pandemic," said Etedali. "Airborne pathogens like COVID-19 are transmitted much more easily and can result in the rapid spread having occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. For a dog to become infected with leptospirosis, they must come into direct contact with infected urine."

"It's important to note this disease can affect humans, as well," Bernard added. "If your dog is diagnosed with leptospirosis, you should wear gloves to handle them and avoid touching any urine-contaminated items until treatment is completed (generally 14 days of antibiotics), and keep your dog separated from other animals."

[The following is from the Animal Medical Center, New York's website (https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/leptospirosis-in-dogs-causes-and-treatment/).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Leptospirosis, commonly known as 'lepto,' is a contagious, bacterial disease, causing serious damage to the kidney and/or liver. The bacteria causing leptospirosis are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive there for weeks or months.

"Dogs contract leptospirosis when the bacteria enter the body through skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth), especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water can also cause infection, and the disease can be passed from a mother dog to her puppies through the placenta.

"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. In humans, leptospirosis can cause flulike symptoms and may lead to liver or kidney disease.

Risk factors
------------
"Risk factors include swimming in or drinking from contaminated streams, lakes, and puddles, exposure to wildlife or farm animals, and contact with infected animals or their urine.

"While it was once seen mostly in rural areas, leptospirosis is becoming increasingly common in urban and suburban areas as well. Dogs who play in or near mud or puddles are at an especially high risk for leptospirosis.

Signs
-----
"The following are common in dogs with clinical signs, although many dogs show no signs at all:
- Lethargy
- Increased thirst
- Vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Fever
- Jaundice (yellow discoloration of skin)
- Discolored urine (dark yellow to orange)
- Joint or muscle pain

"If your dog is showing any of these signs, see your veterinarian immediately because leptospirosis is one of several serious diseases causing these clinical signs. Delaying treatment can lead to severe kidney or liver damage -- and may be fatal.

Diagnosis
---------
"Leptospirosis is diagnosed based on exposure history, clinical examination, and diagnostic testing. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a cage side test, and the PCR test are commonly used to diagnose the disease. The MAT is performed in a specialized laboratory and looks for antibodies in the blood. Since antibodies may not show up early in the illness, the MAT test may need to be repeated to confirm a diagnosis. The cage side test is performed in the clinic using a drop of blood. Because the results are available in minutes, a positive test results helps direct treatment. The PCR test is also performed in a specialized laboratory and looks for the DNA of _Leptospira_ bacteria in the blood and urine. In some situations, all 3 tests will be performed to confirm a diagnosis.

Treatment
---------
"If it's caught early, antibiotics are very effective for treating leptospirosis. However, if there is already severe damage to the dog's liver or kidneys, the dog may need to be hospitalized for supportive care with intravenous fluids. Hemodialysis may be required to replace the normal function of the kidneys while antibiotics clear up the infection. Long-term liver or kidney disease may persist, even with appropriate treatment.

Prevention
----------
"Getting your dog vaccinated against leptospirosis and keeping them up to date on vaccine boosters can help protect your dog. However, the vaccine is only effective against certain strains, so it's also important to keep your dog away from wild animals and to discourage drinking from or playing in streams, lakes, ponds, and puddles. When taking long walks, be sure to bring along fresh water for your dog, so they are not tempted to drink from potentially contaminated water sources. If your dog is sick and showing clinical signs consistent with leptospirosis, be sure to inform your veterinarian if your dog has been near wildlife or standing water.

"If you are caring for a dog with leptospirosis, it's important to wear gloves to avoid infection."

Dog parks and other areas where dogs often lick and sniff an area before urinating on the particular location can be high-risk areas. The act of licking, which is normal dog behavior, can be how your canine pet picks up the bacteria. Rodents are known carriers of this bacteria, and increasing populations of rodents increase your pet's risk. Rodents can be found in alleys, yards and many places, unobserved by humans, but leaving an intriguing odor for your pet.

Please take care of your pet by having them vaccinated. This also helps protect you. Cleaning up after a dog accident can put you at risk of the disease. You may not know your pet is carrying the disease until late in the disease stage. So please vaccinate your pet and protect yourself.
