The Ministry of Health, through the Epidemiology Department, has provided preventive measures to avoid new cases of psittacosis, after 2 families developed the disease in 2 different sites of Entre Rios (Paraná and Gualeguaychú).

Psittacosis is an acute infectious disease produced by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_, found in secretions of many birds, which transmit the infection to humans through inhalation, entering the respiratory tract and lodging the bacteria in the lungs. Occasionally, the infection can be complicated and lead to death if not treated on time.

This disease is of mandatory reporting, according to the regulation of law 15.465, article 4. The report of cases is required when the physician attends or has attended a carrier; when the veterinarian suspects the disease in animals or when the laboratory has performed tests that prove or allow to suspect the disease.

The outbreak in Paraná, affected a family that became infected after acquiring a parrot pigeon from a street vendor in Ramirez Avenue and Laurencena Street, in the vicinity of the Estrada School.

In Gualeguaychú, another family fell ill due to psittacosis after bringing home an infected parrot that they found on public roads.

In both cases, the patients presented to the health providers with respiratory symptoms. Given the epidemiology of the cases, the doctors recommended laboratory tests (blood sample and respiratory swab) to confirm or rule out the disease.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, turkeys, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Both cities are in the Argentine province of Entre Rios in the northwest part of the country and the province can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entre_R%C3%ADos_Province - Mod.LL
