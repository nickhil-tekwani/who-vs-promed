Dr Fabrizio Soscia, chief of the department of infectious diseases at the
Civil Hospital of Latina, reassured the community after the discovery of a
case of malaria contracted by a tourist in Rome after a short stay near
Lake Fondi (Latina).

The Roman visitor, who stayed in the area between Monte San Biagio and
Fondi, is well after being treated at the Spallanzani Hospital in Rome. The
patient had not been abroad, and, therefore, the Ministry of Health has
initiated a surveillance of the anopheline mosquitoes in the area.

WHO declared Italy free from malaria in 1970, and this is the 1st case of
malaria in which the person was infected in Italy since then.

[The story implies an incubation period of 2-3 months, suggesting that the
infection was with _Plasmodium vivax_. Lake Fondi is part of the Pontine
marshes, an area endemic for malaria until drainage works were completed in
the 1930s [subsequently sabotaged by the Nazis in world war two, but later
drained again. - Mod.SH].

It is conceivable that malaria may have returned to the area, but other
possibilities exist. The patient could have been infected elsewhere by
mosquitoes transmitting malaria from asymptomatic gametocyte carriers, and
this could have taken place anywhere.

ProMED-mail reported similarly unexplained cases from Virginia (United
States) in 2002 (PRO/EDR> Malaria - United States (Virginia)
20020907.5250). We would welcome further information about this case. - Mod.EP]
