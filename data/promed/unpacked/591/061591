[1] Viet Nam - New suspected human case

A student is under treatment at a Hanoi hospital for suspected bird
flu, a national anti-bird flu committee meeting heard on Wed 1 Aug
2007. Dr Nguyen Hai Yen of the National Institute for Clinical
Research of Tropical Diseases said the student's samples were being
tested for the H5N1 virus strain, which has killed 45 people in Viet
Nam since 2003, 3 of them in the past 2 months [but not yet confirmed
by WHO - Mod.CP].
The student was transferred to the institute from a hospital in Thanh
Hoa province where he had been treated for 12 days. He had "typical"
bird flu symptoms, though initial inquiries suggested he had had no
contact with poultry, Yen said.
Viet Nam, the country worst hit by bird flu in 2003-05, contained
later outbreaks through mass vaccination [of poultry], culling
millions of poultry, and public education initiatives. But the virus
returned strongly this year [2007], hitting scores of poultry farms
in an unusual summertime outbreak. Outbreaks have been reported since
early May 2007 in 18 of the country's 64 provinces and cities, mostly
among unvaccinated ducks and other waterfowl.
Six human cases have also been reported. Two of them, a 20-year-old
man and a 28-year-old woman, died in June 2007, the 1st fatalities
since November 2005. Another 22-year-old woman from Ha Tay died last
week of the disease. She was 7-months pregnant.

[The most recent 3 cases, prior to the suspected case described
above, have not yet been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Although the latest suspected case is not known to have had contact
with poultry, further investigation may reveal a link. For example,
it has been established that the 22-year-old woman who died last
week, and who came from a district (Thanh Oai) of Ha Tay province
believed to be free of avian influenza, in fact worked as a chicken
stools collector to feed fish since early 2006. Several days before
the woman went to hospital, she bought chicken. All of her family ate
the chicken but only the woman caught type A/H5N1 virus. Her family
is now under supervision at home; see

[2] Egypt - New case denied

Egyptian health authorities on Thu [2 Aug 2007] denied that a new
case of bird flu was discovered and stressed there were no new cases
of that disease after case 38, which was successfully treated and
left hospital. "There are no grounds to media reports about a new
case of bird flu reported in the Burj Al-Arab area, north-west of
Cairo," the Egyptian Health Ministry said in a statement.
It added that, rather than a new human case of bird flu, a new case
was discovered among birds that were under observation. "Ever since
the outbreak of the disease in Egypt at the beginning of last year
[2006], some 3039 people were put in isolation under suspicion of
carrying the virus," the statement said. It added that, out of 38
confirmed cases, some 15 died, while the remaining 23 were cured due
to the medical care they have received.
