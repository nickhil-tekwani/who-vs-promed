99/001 New data on quarantine pests [abstracted by Mod.JW]
-----------------------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests.
New geographical records
------------------------
_Phyllocnistis citrella_ was first found in Brazil in 1996, at Teresina in
Piaui State. The citrus leafminer also occurs in Santa Catarina and Sao
Paulo States. Review of Agricultural Entomology, 86(12), p 1515-1516
(11742-11748).
Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found in
Venezuela during a survey on tomato crops in Barinas State, in 1994-95. The
EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of this virus in
Venezuela.
Review of Plant Pathology, 77(9), p 1025 (7563).
Detailed records
----------------
_Bemisia tabaci_ (biotype B - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) occurs in the state
of Sonora, in Mexico.

In Indonesia, _Liriomyza huidobrensis_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was first
reported from Java, in 1994. It has now invaded the major
vegetable-producing regions of Java and Sumatra. The most severely attacked
crop is potato, although the pest has been found on more than 20 species of
vegetable, ornamental and weed hosts.
