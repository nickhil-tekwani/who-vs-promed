Mato Grosso do Sul culls 17 000 poultry with respiratory illness
---------------------------------------------------
Iagro (State Agency for Animal and Plant Health Protection) announced
yesterday [30 May 2005] that the previous weekend it had culled 17 000
chickens in a poultry farm affected by a disease with respiratory symptoms
in Jaraguari (30 km from Campo Grande) [the state capital], in Mato Grosso
do Sul.
According to Iagro, besides the 17 000 culled, about 6000 birds had already
died from the disease. The farm and 107 neighboring properties were
quarantined by Iagro.
Technicians collected specimens of poultry viscera, which were sent to Mapa
(Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries & Food) in Campinas (Sao Paulo state).
Test results should be available tomorrow [1 Jun 2005].
At least 15 Iagro staff set up roadblocks on the 3 access roads to the
property. They sprayed disinfectant on cars and trucks passing.
The director-president of Iagro, Gete Ottono da Rosa, said that 15
different types of disease cause respiratory symptoms in poultry. "Only
with the test results on Wednesday [1 Jun 2005] will we know which it is."

[Although it is disturbing to have this many birds affected with
respiratory signs, there are many diseases with very similar clinical
signs. Infectious laryngotracheitis and avian influenza are the 2 that
would certainly be on the differential list. We will be anxiously awaiting
the results of the testing and actions deemed necessary based upon those
tests. - Mod.TG]
