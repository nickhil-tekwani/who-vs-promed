With an increase in whooping cough (pertussis) cases reported in the city and district over the last 4 months, the Health Unit is urging that individuals ensure they are up to date with their immunization against this disease, particularly those individuals who are or will be around newborns and infants less than 6 months of age.

The Health Unit is aware of 10 cases of whooping cough that have been identified through laboratory testing, with additional cases in close household contacts. Five people have been hospitalized, 4 of whom were under 6 months of age. Although this is not considered an outbreak for our district, outbreaks have been reported in other areas of the country over the same time.

Newborns and infants less than 6 months of age are particularly vulnerable to pertussis. They are more likely than any other age group to have serious disease and are more likely to require hospitalization. In rare cases, pertussis can result in death. Newborns and infants are also not yet protected by vaccination, as the infant series of immunizations occurs over the 1st 18 months of life.

Pregnant women can receive the vaccine after 26 weeks of pregnancy.

[Most of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis occurs in infants less than 6 months of age, especially neonates. Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different, with periods of apnea [breathing arrest] sometimes with hypoxia-induced [low oxygen] seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension, are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital, and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care.
