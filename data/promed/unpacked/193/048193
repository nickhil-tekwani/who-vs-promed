The number of confirmed cases of _E. coli_ infection following an outbreak after a lambing live event has risen. Public Health England says they now have 14 confirmed cases of the O157 infection in 12 children and 2 adults who had been to "lambing live" at Huntley's Country Stores in Samlesbury, near Preston. Last week, the health body said there were 11 cases in 9 children and 2 adults. All of the children are under 10 years old.

An investigation was launched following the outbreak at the popular venue. All contact between animals and the public at the premises has now ceased. It is believed the outbreak began before Easter. Anyone who visited the lambing event at Huntley's between 29 Mar and 24 Apr 2014 and who is unwell is advised to seek medical advice.

[Cattle are the most common livestock to carry enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. Sheep, as shown in this outbreak, can also be a reservoir, as well as water buffalo, swine and deer.

Transmission of the potentially lethal pathogen can be from eating undercooked meat, ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, direct contact with an infected animal or its environment, or eating uncooked produce contaminated with an infected animal's feces. - Mod.LL]

[Australia & Canada have also had this problem in petting zoos -- see ProMED archives below. I thought petting zoos in the UK were required by law to have hand-washing stations for visitors to use as they leave. Certainly the one I visited in England 3 years ago had several hand-basins conveniently located around the premises. - Mod.JW
