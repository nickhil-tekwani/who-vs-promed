Several people [have] reported dead or dying white-tailed deer, along with a few antelope, to [Montana] Fish Wildlife and Parks [FWP] over the last few weeks [August 2020]. FWP says biologists are still waiting for test results to come back, but early indications suggest patterns and symptoms similar to epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).

EHD is an infectious, sometimes fatal virus that is usually spread by a virus-carrying gnat or midge. Many animals affected with EHD lose their appetite, are drawn to water, lose their fear of people, grow weak, and often eventually die. This disease is often confused with "blue tongue" which is a separate, but similar, disease.

It is not uncommon for EHD to show up in eastern Montana in the late summer or early fall, and it mostly impacts white-tailed deer but can show up in mule deer and antelope. EHD outbreaks typically end when a hard frost kills the insect vectors that carry the disease.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD) in cervids is caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) group or bluetongue virus (BTV) group (both Reoviridae: _Orbivirus_). It is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and mule deer (_O. hemionus_) in the United States. In North America, there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases BT viruses from infected deer were 1st reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BTV disease were noted as early as 1886.

EHDV and BTV are transmitted between its ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges. Available data suggest that the of _Culicoides_ species that transmit EHDV are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as for BTV. - Mod.PMB
