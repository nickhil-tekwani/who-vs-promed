Hippos and Algae Implicated in Multiple Animal Deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------
We reported 3 years ago on the how a spot of forensic detective work
by Kruger National Park (KNP) and state veterinarians revealed the
cause of a number of animal deaths that occurred in the early winter
of 2005 in the Crocodile Bridge section of the park.

Over about 6 months, at least 52 animals, including 2 lions, 2
cheetah and 7 white rhino, died mysteriously. Anthrax and botulism
were considered to be possible causes of the deaths, but the 1st real
lead came in May [2007], the following year when a fresh zebra
carcass was post mortemed.

Severe liver damage was spotted, and organs were sent to
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in Pretoria for analysis. The
locations of all the dead animals discovered were plotted on a map,
revealing 2 clusters. The Onderstepoort results showed possible
poisoning by algae, and the map pointed the finger at 2 specific dams
in the Crocodile Bridge area Mpanamana and Nhlanganzwane.

Inspection of the dams revealed green scum on the surface of the
water, and further tests confirmed that the blue-green algae known as
_Microcystis_ was the main reason for the discolored water. One of
the oldest known organisms on earth, blue-green algae or
cyanobacteria, were the first green 'plants' on earth and are found
in most water bodies in low numbers.

However, they can multiply rapidly under the right conditions to
produce algal blooms, great masses of algae that discolor the water.
The algae produce strong poisons, which can damage the nervous system
and the liver of animals. In the case of an algal bloom, these toxins
concentrate in the water at much higher levels than normally occur.

The wind plays a major role in concentrating the algae, which blows
across the surface of the water, piling up into dense clusters whose
location depends on the prevailing wind direction. In the 2 Kruger
dams, enough algae were present at various times, depending on the
weather and the prevailing wind, to kill over 50 animals over a
period of months.

Although the algae were directly to blame for killing the animals, a
variety of factors had combined to create the algal bloom conditions.
Both dams are man-made structures cut off from river systems and
depending on rainfall to fill up. They are also home to large hippo
populations, which defecate and urinate in the water, effectively
fertilizing the water for the benefit of the algae.

An uncommonly warm winter, lots of hippos and an ever-decreasing body
of stagnant water all combined to give the blue-green algae a chance
to multiply frantically and produce their toxic by-products that
eventually led to the death of at least 10 different species of
animals. Ironically, a hippo was amongst the casualties. Since
confirming that the algae were responsible for the mortalities,
management options for preventing a repeat of the experience have
been investigated.

As similar problems are known to occur in farm dams, existing
agricultural solutions were looked at. However, some of these depend
on keeping animals from drinking at the dam for 6 weeks after
treatment, not a feasible alternative in Kruger. Another option would
be to manage the size of the hippo population in the dams, or pump
out the dams altogether.

KNP officials have also considered using floating devices or curtains
that stop the algae concentrating on the leeward sides of the dams
and reaching poisonous levels.

A veld fire that occurred in the area after June [2007] also helped
to disperse the hippos to other nearby rivers, which reduced the
hippo dispersals in the dams and the visible algal blooms subsided
over the next few weeks.

"In addition, the burned area was also unattractive to other
herbivores due to a lack of grazing, which forced them to seek
grazing elsewhere," said Dr. Roy Bengis, state veterinarian. In July
2007, Crocodile Bridge section ranger, Neels van Wyk, detected a
number of new deaths in the area between Nhlanganzwane dam, Godleni
picket and Mac windmill.

The recurrence of a significant cyanobacterial bloom was detected at
Nhlanganzwane and Sunset dams where there are large hippo
populations. Neels found a dead zebra at Mac windmill and tests
showed Microcystis toxins in its tissue. Looking at the various
options, KNP management decided to drain the water from Nhlanganzwane
dam and a technical crew has begun with breaking the damwall on
Monday 30 July 2007.

"Rhinos usually don't walk into the water to drink and they were
mostly affected by drinking at the dams edge where most of the algae
were concentrated. With the discovery of all the carcasses we felt
strongly that a long term solution should be taken regarding the dam.
We could replace the waterhole with a smaller structure at a later
stage, if necessary," says Neels.

[Roy Bengis of the South Africa Department of Agriculture -
Veterinary Investigation Center provided the data on the incident not
contained in the preliminary report on this incident. - Mod.TG]

I can supply you with the following details regarding the
cyanobacterial die off in Kruger. A total of 32 carcasses were found
within a radius of 6 km [3.73 miles] of the Stillwater impoundment.
These included 15 white rhinos (very worrying), 8 zebra, 5
wildebeest, 1 lion, 1 buffalo, 1 warthog and a hippo.

Early in August [2007], the earthern dam wall was mechanically
breached and the dam was drained, which put an immediate end to this
point source bio-intoxication outbreak.

The following details summarize the impacts of a cyanobacteria bloom
in a water impoundment in Kruger National Park between May and July
2007 which resulted in the deaths of a large number of endangered
wildlife species. The total count of the animals believed that died
is 15 white rhinos, 8 zebra, 5 wildebeest, 1 lion, 1 buffalo, 1
warthog and a hippo.

[We greatly appreciated the added information provided by Roy Bengis
of the South Africa Department of Agriculture - Veterinary
Investigation Center.

Toxic algae can produce a number of different toxins, some capable of
killing animals within a very short time. Toxic blooms should be
taken seriously and public health warnings heeded.

Cyanobacteria is the scientific name for blue-green algae, or "pond
scum." The 1st recognized species were blue-green in color, which is
how the algae got their name. Species identified since range in color
from olive-green to red.

Cyanobacteria form in shallow, warm, slow-moving, or still water.
They are made up of cells which can house poisons called
cyanobacterial toxins. A mass of cyanobacteria in a body of water is
called a bloom. When this mass rises to the surface of the water, it
is known as surface scum or a surface water bloom.

Cyanobacterial toxins are the naturally produced poisons stored in
the cells of certain species of cyanobacteria. These toxins fall into
various categories. Some are known to attack the liver (hepatotoxins)
or the nervous system (neurotoxins); others simply irritate the skin.
These toxins are usually released into water when the cells rupture or die.

One group of toxins produced and released by cyanobacteria are called
microcystins because they were isolated from a cyanobacterium called
_Microcystis aeruginosa_. Microcystins are the most common of the
cyanobacterial toxins found in water, as well as being the ones most
often responsible for poisoning animals and humans who come into
contact with toxic blooms. Microcystins are extremely stable in water
because of their chemical structure, which means they can survive in
both warm and cold water and can tolerate radical changes in water
chemistry, including pH. So far, scientists have found about 50
different kinds of microcystins. One of them, microcystin-LR, appears
to be one of the microcystins most commonly found in water supplies
around the world.
