State health officials on [Thu 6 Jul 2017] said that a 5th case of [a] deadly hantavirus has been confirmed in the state, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 5 in 2017. That's the highest number of hantavirus cases in the state since 1999, according to state officials.

The cases 1st came to light in King County after an Issaquah man died from the virus in February [2017]. A 2nd woman from Issaquah contracted the virus, but later recovered. A 3rd case occurred in King County at the end of 2016 in Redmond.

Since those cases, [a] hantavirus has emerged in Franklin, Spokane, and Skagit counties. The victims in Spokane and Franklin counties died, while the Skagit victim survived.

Hantavirus [infection] is very deadly, with a mortality rate of about 38 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Seasonal flu, by comparison, has a mortality rate of about 2.5 percent.

Humans contract [a] hantavirus by coming into contact with the feces, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice [_Peromyscus manipulates_]. Humans often come into contact with deer mice droppings while cleaning or working inside outdoor structures, like barns or recreational vehicles.

There were also 5 cases reported in 1999. And until this year [2017], 1999 was the only year on record where hantavirus cases reached 5 more. There were 4 cases each in 1995 and 1996, according to state records.

The state Department of Health hosts a webpage featuring tips on how to avoid coming into contact with hantavirus.

[The hantavirus involved in the above and previous reports is not stated, but Sin Nombre virus is very likely involved.

Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the western USA, including Washington State. Deer mice commonly move into dwellings with the onset of cold weather. In the spring and summer, cleaning out areas with deer mice and their nests should be done with the same precautions mentioned above. Materials should be wetted down with a bleach solution and handled in an open-air space, with gloves and a mask worn.

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus and shed it in feces, urine, and saliva. Sin Nombre virus infections can be serious, with a relatively high case fatality rate associated with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Prompt medical attention is essential.
