The number of syphilis cases reported in Onslow County [North Carolina] has steadily increased over the past few years, according to 2020 data from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

"Throughout North Carolina in 2020, there has been an increase in infants reported to have congenital syphilis and the numbers of syphilis diagnoses in women have increased," said Kimberly Collins, communicable disease nursing supervisor with the Onslow County Health Department. "The highest rates of newly diagnosed early syphilis in North Carolina occurred among 25 to 29 year olds, with a case rate of 70 per 100 000 persons, followed by 30 to 34 year olds and then 20 to 24 year olds."

In Onslow County specifically, the annual case rate for syphilis rose from 12.8 per 100 000 people in 2019 to 17.7/100 000 in 2020. The county is now ranked 27th in the state for new early syphilis cases, an increase from 34th in the state over previous years.

According to that same data from the NCDHHS and CDC, new cases of other sexually transmitted diseases, like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV/AIDs, have decreased across the state, including Onslow County. "This is likely due to undetected cases due to the pandemic and less individuals seeking care," Collins explained. NCDHHS and CDC said the numbers of sexually transmitted infections for 2020 may not reflect the true prevalence of various infections, Collins continued, and it's suspected the numbers of cases may be higher than the data show, due to COVID-19 and reduced medical visits. Because of those decreased medical visits and more attention paid to COVID-19, people who acquire a sexually transmitted disease may not receive diagnosis and treatment, especially since many may experience no symptoms. "This lack of care results in skewed data and increases the likelihood that those with a current infection will not receive treatment and may unknowingly pass the infection on to others," Collins said.

Homosexual men are among the most vulnerable to infections like syphilis, according to the data from NCDHHS and CDC. Men who reported having sex with men accounted for 52.8% of newly diagnosed early syphilis cases in North Carolina in 2020, Collins said. To help combat this, Collins said the health department is working to strengthen relationships and partnerships with LGBTQ+ organizations in the community to help distribute condoms and information. One organization has also purchased a billboard to help promote HIV testing. The Health Department is proactively working to prevent future STD infections in a number of ways, including providing free condoms to patients upon request and informing patients of safe sex practices, when applicable to their individual situation and risk factors.

"We also offer expedited partner therapy (EPT) for chlamydia infection, which allows anyone tested and treated in the STD clinic for chlamydia to leave with a 'Partner Kit' for sexual partners they report having within the past 60 days," Collins said. The kit includes medication for the treatment of chlamydia, as well as medication information indicating any side effects to taking the medicine, a treatment fact sheet, a pamphlet on chlamydia and other STD/HIV facts, and condoms.

For a discussion of syphilis in the US, please see my moderator comments in prior posts listed in the see also's below.

The news report above says that congenital syphilis and the numbers of syphilis cases diagnosed in women have increased in recent years, but no mention is made of possible causes for this change. In recent ProMED posts, injection drug use has been cited as a contributing factor to recent increases in syphilis cases in both the US and Canada (see also's below). Injection drug use is associated with sexual behaviors that increase the risk for acquiring syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, including having multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, and exchange of sex for drugs or money (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm). The linkage of illicit drug use and syphilis transmission is reminiscent of the increase in syphilis among heterosexuals during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s when the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs played a major role in the transmission of syphilis. - Mod.ML
