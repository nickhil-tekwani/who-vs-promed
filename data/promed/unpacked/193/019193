New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Whatcom County, Washington
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Dec 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Green-winged teal: _Anas carolinensis_ (_Anatidae_) / - / - / - / - / -
Affected population: wild American green-winged teal duck

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: as part of the increased AI surveillance of wild birds (performed by testing hunter harvested birds), another Eurasian H5 clade 2.3.4.4 virus has been identified through whole genome sequencing of the virus isolate. Introduction of the Eurasian (EA) H5N8 virus into the Pacific Flyway sometime during late 2014 has allowed mixing with North American (AM) lineage viruses and generated new combinations with genes from both EA and AM origin (or "reassortant" viruses) such as the EA/AM H5N2-reassortant detected in Canada and the United States. Such findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. A novel EA/AM H5N1-reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 was isolated from an American green-winged teal in Whatcom County, Washington. This H5N1 subtype is different from strain circulating in Asia. The gene constellation is as follows: Eurasian lineage genes (PB2, H5, NP, MP more than 99 percent identical to A/gyrfalcon/WA/41088/2014 H5N8); North American lineage genes (PB1 [98 percent identical to A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 H5N2], PA, N1, NS of North American LPAI wild bird lineage. The HA cleavage site is compatible with strains that are highly pathogenic. This novel HPAI EA/AM H5N1-reassortant virus has not been found in commercial poultry anywhere in the United States.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Green-winged teal/ gene sequencing / 16 Jan 2015 / Positive
Green-winged teal/ real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 16 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the epidemiological comments in the OIE report above, this novel subtype H5N1 is the result of a reassortment between the Eurasian (EA)-type H5N8 virus and North American avian influenza strains. Noteworthy is the information on the complete description of the constellation of gene segments. This novel HPAI EA/AM H5N1-reassortant virus has not been found in commercial poultry anywhere in the United States.

In poultry, HPAI has only been detected in small backyard flocks in the United States. The findings confirmed by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories include (http://tinyurl.com/l9cg97s):
- HPAI H5N8 in a backyard poultry flock in Winston, Oregon (19 Dec 2014)
- HPAI H5N2 in a backyard poultry flock in Benton County, Washington (3 Jan 2015)
- HPAI H5N2 in a backyard poultry flock in Benton County, Washington (9 Jan 2015)
- HPAI H5N2 in a backyard poultry flock in Clallam County, Washington (16 Jan 2015)
- HPAI H5N2 in a backyard poultry flock in Canyon County, Idaho (16 Jan 2015)

Captive wild bird findings confirmed by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories:
- HPAI H5N8 in captive gyrfalcons in Whatcom County, Washington (16 Dec 2014)
- HPAI H5N2 in captive falcons in Canyon County, Idaho (16 Jan 2015)

Increased surveillance and biosecurity in commercial poultry operations in the United States needs to be maintained and/or strengthened to prevent an introduction into commercial poultry flocks. - Mod.CRD
