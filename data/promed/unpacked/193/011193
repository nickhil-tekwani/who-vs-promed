[The affected areas, Bryansk, Nizhegorod (Nizhny Novgorod), Kursk, and Pskov are located in the western part of Russia and Tatarstan in the eastern part of the country. See map at https://www.nationsonline.org/maps/Map-of-European-Russia.jpg.

The following information comes from a scientific document, "Current status of African swine fever", published on 5 Aug 2020 (1)

"The 1st ASF outbreak on Russian Federal territory was recorded in December 2007 in dead wild boars along the Argoun and Argoun-Shatoy rivers in Chechnya Republic on the border with Georgia. Its subsequent spread in Russian territories between 2007 and 2012 has been well documented. It can now be considered endemic in most of European Russia with new outbreaks reported in domestic pigs and/or wild boars in 26 administrative regions between 2018 and 2020, including a number of large commercial pig farms.

"Since 2017 there has been concerning expansion of ASF eastwards. Outbreaks have occurred in the eastern federal districts of Urals (Chelyabinsk, Omsk, Tyumen, Yamalo-Nenetsky), Siberia (Irkutsk and Krasnoyarsk) and most recently (2019-2020) in the Far East (Amurskaya, Khabarovsk, Primorskiy, and Yevreyskaya Avtonomnaya Oblast). These last outbreaks have been concentrated along the border with China. The virus that was isolated from the outbreak in Irkutsk, Siberia in 2017 proved to be identical to the original virus introduced into Russia in 2007 and is now comparatively rare among recent Russian isolates.

"The 1st outbreak in the Far East occurred on a small farm with 70 pigs in Primorskiy Kray in July 2019, followed a few days later on [5 Aug 2019] by an outbreak in village pigs in Amurskaya Oblast. At about the same time, 2 outbreaks involving 7 wild boars were identified in forest in the same general area as the 1st outbreak in Primorskiy Kray. Outbreaks have occurred among domestic pigs and wild boars in Yevreyskaya Avtonomnaya Oblast and in wild boars in Khabarovskaya Krai in 2019. Outbreaks in wild boars in Amurskaya Oblast were registered in 2019 and 2020, and also in wild boars in 2020.

"All the outbreaks in the Urals region and Siberia occurred in domestic pigs, with no evidence for a link to wild boars. On the other hand, cases in wild boars have occurred in the Far East. However, considering the distance between the Far East and the nearest known infections in wild boars in European Russia, it is extremely unlikely that Russian wild boars could be implicated in an ASF introduction to the Far East. Infection in wild boars has been reported only in 3 localities in China, none of them particularly close to the Russian Far East. However, there were outbreaks of ASF in the adjacent Chinese province of Heilongjiang in domestic pigs in early September 2018, and since the 1st outbreaks of ASF in August 2018 in Liaoning Province in China (Zhou et al. 2018) the situation in China has remained dynamic, with ASF having spread throughout the country within months of the initial outbreaks."
