Indonesia's Health Ministry recently announced the death of a
34-year-old Jakarta woman from H5N1 avian influenza, according to a
translated statement from the country's communications ministry [see:
Indonesia Ministry of Communication and Information.
<http://bipnewsroom.info/index.php?&newsid=6>. - Mod.CP] that was
posted today [2 Jul 2010] on the Bird Flu Information Corner blog
[<http://birdflucorner.wordpress.com>], which is part of a
collaboration between Kobe University in Japan and Airlangga
University in Indonesia.

The woman got sick on 25 May 2010 and sought care 2 days later. She
was hospitalized at a private facility the next day. After her
pneumonia worsened, she was transferred to a regional hospital in
Tangerang on 1 Jun 2010, where she died the same day. An investigation
into the source of her infection revealed no apparent contact with
birds, though she grew ornamental plants in her yard and had recently
visited relatives in Tangerang city, which the Ministry said is an
H5N1-endemic area. No flu-like symptoms have been noted among the
woman's contacts or healthcare providers.

The Health Ministry said it has reported the woman's illness and death
to the World Health Organization (WHO). If confirmed by the WHO, the
woman's case will raise Indonesia's H5N1 count to 166 cases with 137
deaths, the highest in the world. Once the case is added to the WHO's
H5N1 count, the global count will reach 500 cases [see: Cumulative
Number of Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported
to WHO (as of 8 Jun 2010)

[The absence of known contact with diseased fowl is an unusual aspect
of this case. The official confirmation by the WHO is awaited.
