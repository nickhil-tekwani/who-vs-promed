Foot and mouth disease outbreak in Limpopo
------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Dzumeri
area, near Giyani, in the Limpopo province. Lucas Mampane, the provincial
head of agriculture, says the disease started at Seloane village, which
borders game farms along the Letaba river.
Mampane says the defense force and police are patrolling the area to
control the movement of people and animals. The provincial agricultural
department is vaccinating the cattle. Mampane says the FMD was discovered
at Seloane village, outside Giyani, at the end of June 2004. More than 50
cattle are being treated for the disease, and, at least 3000 cattle in the
area are under threat. Mampane says the government's veterinarians are
vaccinating cattle, and other animals, in the area.
He says the situation is under control, as there were no new infections
reported over the past week [2nd week of July 2004]. He also says that the
disease has affected the communal stock farmers in the Giyani and
Phalaborwa municipalities. The area is under quarantine.
