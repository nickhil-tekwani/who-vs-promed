Marks & Spencer [retailer, M&S] is recalling thousands of packs of Scottish mussels following concerns over a possible link with cases of food poisoning. A range of mussel-based goods are being taken off the retailer's shelves as a precautionary measure, said the Food Standards Agency. Customers who have the products at home are being advised not to eat them and contact their local store for advice on a refund.

The packs affected are Mussels in Garlic, Mussels in White Wine, and Mussels and Clams. A spokesman for the store said: "At Marks & Spencer food quality standards and our customers' enjoyment of our products are key priorities for us. We take this very seriously, and as a precautionary measure, we have recalled all packs of M&S mussels, which should not be eaten by customers. The affected products have already been removed from our stores. However, if customers have already purchased these products, they should return them to their nearest store for a full refund as soon as possible."

The company is a favorite among shoppers for ready meals and Christmas foods. No conclusive link has been drawn between what the FSA [Food Standards Agency] called a small number of cases of illness and the mussels. The mussels are supplied to M&S by Pinneys, which is based in Annan, Scotland and is part of Young's Seafood company.

Pinneys was awarded a Royal Warrant in 1986 to supply smoked salmon to the Queen. While the business began as a supplier of smoked salmon, it has developed into selling wet fish, including salmon and premium white fish, fish delicatessen products, including pate, terrines, party food, and ready meals, focusing on the M&S additive free Cook! range.

The FSA closed several mussels and shellfish harvesting sites in Scotland, particularly around Shetland, in the summer [2013] following the detection of unusually high levels of toxins.

The toxins, which occur naturally, can cause acute food poisoning. The move followed reports that around 70 people in south east England had reported symptoms consistent with diarrhetic shellfish poisoning.

Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning can result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain accompanied by chills, headache, and fever. Symptoms generally present themselves between 30 minutes and 2 or 3 hours after eating affected shellfish, and can last for 2 or 3 days.

The cases in the summer were linked to the consumption of mussels originating from a particular harvesting area in Shetland and did not involve Pinneys.

The mussels had been supplied to a number of restaurants, including Belgo in Covent Garden, Holborn, Clapham and Bromley; Zero Degrees in Blackheath and Reading; The Phoenix near Hook, Hampshire; Boulevard Brasserie in Covent Garden; and Pig's Ears in Richmond.

[Diarrheic shellfish poisoning (DSP) (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20020 is a gastrointestinal illness caused by the consumption of shellfish contaminated with algal toxins produced by marine dinoflagellates belonging to the genera _Dinophysis_ spp. (_D. fortii_, _D. mitra_, _D. rotundata_, _D. tripos_, _D. acuta_, _D. norvegica_, and _D. acuminata_), and _Prorocentrum_ spp. (_P. lima_, _P. maculosum_, _P. concavum_, and _P. hoffmannianum_).

The DSP toxins, including okadaic acid (OA) and its analogues dinophysistoxin-1 (DTX-1), dinophysistoxin-2 (DTX-2), and dinophysistoxin-3 (DTX-3), belong to the larger group of lipophilic toxins which also includes the azaspiracid, yessotoxin, and pectenotoxin group toxins.

The term diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) was used in this report, but this moderator prefers to use diarrheal shellfish poisoning to avoid any confusion between the almost homophones of diarrhetic and diuretic.

DSP is often mistaken for norovirus-like disease. It is treated with rehydration, and affected individuals usually recover in 1-2 days. DSP is most commonly found in shellfish in Europe and Japan but can appear anywhere and bears consideration with the appropriate epidemiology. - Mod.LL
