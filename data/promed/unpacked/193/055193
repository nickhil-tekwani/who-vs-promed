In summer 2021, several tomato (_Solanum lycopersicum_) hybrids in glasshouse crops in two regions of Albania showed foliar symptoms such as interveinal yellowing of the basal leaves, brittleness and mild leaf curling. High populations of the whitefly _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ were observed.

The presence of _Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV, _Crinivirus_; EPPO A2 List) in symptomatic tomato plants was confirmed by RT-PCR. This is the 1st detection of ToCV in the country.

[_Tomato chlorosis virus_ (ToCV; genus _Crinivirus_) infects crops in the family Solanaceae, as well as weeds which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It can also affect a number of crop and ornamental species in other families such as Cucurbitaceae (which include cucumber mentioned above). Symptoms on tomato leaves may include irregular chlorotic mottle, interveinal yellowing, necrotic flecks, and possible distortions. No obvious symptoms develop on fruit and flowers, but fruit size and numbers are reduced due to a loss of photosynthetic area. Significant yield losses occur as a result, but symptom severity varies with host cultivars. Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and are also similar to those of the related _Tomato infectious chlorosis virus_ (TICV) of the same genus.

ToCV is transmitted by a number of whitefly vectors; outbreaks are usually associated with high vector populations. Whiteflies are a serious pest in themselves and have also been reported to transmit over 100 virus species. Multiple infections with viruses sharing these vectors (for example, coinfections of ToCV with TICV or _Southern tomato virus_; ProMED posts 20140808.2671012, 20190616.6522021) are not unusual and may result in symbiotic enhancement of symptoms (synergism) of the co-infecting viruses.

Control of whitefly transmitted viruses is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management of these viruses is difficult and includes vector control; removal of reservoirs of both virus and vectors; use of crop varieties with increased pathogen tolerance; and clean planting material.
