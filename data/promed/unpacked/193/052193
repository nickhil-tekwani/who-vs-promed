re: Rabbit hem. dis. - New Zealand (02): questions 20080219.0663
----------------------------------------------------------------
I am not in a position to offer a well-informed opinion on this matter. I
can offer a couple of comments though.

Legal importations of RCD [rabbit calicivirus disease] virus, and its
release, into New Zealand continue to be made by Regional Councils. I have
no detail other than what I could pick up using a Google search.

The virus may not be "circulating", but it is still being introduced.

I recall that when the original risk assessment was made [the one that
rejected a proposal to import, thus leading to the illegal introduction and
dissemination] it was noted that very young rabbits [unweaned] are
relatively resistant to infection, but can get maternally derived immunity
if their dam is herself immune. Thus, it was argued, when RCDV becomes
endemic, one could expect to see the situation where rabbits would be
exposed to infection at an early age when protected by maternal immunity
and thus acquire active immunity themselves.

In my opinion, what is being reported is what was predicted. You ask: "why
did it take 8-9 years to emerge -- why not 4 or 16 years?" Someone more
informed than me will have to offer an opinion on that one.

[Now that the RCD panacea has failed to live up to expectations, a betting
man would predict that there will be a Kiwi rural clamour for the
introduction of another quick fix, probably myxomatosis. Which, as has been
seen in other countries, will also come to terms with the rabbit population
and the latter will eventually rebound, yet again, and continue. The
strange thing is that until the Middle Ages and the dissolution of the
monasteries, rabbits were domesticated and penned, being kept for meat and
in fact a bit of a luxury food. - Mod.MHJ]
