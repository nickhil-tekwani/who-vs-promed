An Aransas county man has had 3 surgeries and is still in the hospital after he contracted _Vibrio_, a flesh-eating bacterium, while fishing on Ransom Island near Aransas Pass, according to a recent story from KRIS 6 NEWS. Shortly after a fishing trip, a 79-year-old was admitted into the hospital because of a cut on his hand that was also swollen, his daughter told KRIS 6 NEWS. He had been fishing with his son-in-law.

This is the 2nd flesh-eating incident that has been reported after visits to South Texas beaches. A Corpus Christi man underwent several life-saving surgeries after he contracted vibriosis from dipping his toes into the water near Waters Edge Park in Corpus Christi. The man, 42, didn't have any open wounds at the time, which the _Vibrio_ bacterium typically use as an entry into the body. His right toe, however, was infected with fungus, creating an opening between his skin and toenail, according to a mySA article.

According to the CDC, about 80 000 people a year are infected with vibriosis. The bacteria live in coastal waters and increase concentration when the water warms between May and October. People can also become infected by consuming undercooked or raw seafood.

An Ellenton woman who allegedly contracted necrotizing fasciitis on Coquina Beach died just 2 weeks later, her family said. A walk on an Anna Maria Island beach resulted in an Ellenton woman's death, according to her family.

The woman had come back from a walk on the beach when her son noticed she was bleeding from the shin. "She fell where there was a little divot in the ocean, she hit a rock or something and cut her shin," her daughter-in-law, told the Herald-Tribune. "It wasn't really a big deal; she had a little bump. We got an ice pack out of the cooler and the lifeguard cleaned it and went on his way. But 2 weeks later, the 77-year-old was dead.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare bacterial infection that most commonly enters the body through a break in the skin, and can lead to sepsis, shock, and organ failure. Even with treatment, as many as one in 3 people die from the infection, according to the CDC.

Two days later after the injury, the woman's leg was red and swollen, and she went to an urgent-care clinic, where she was prescribed antibiotics and given a tetanus shot. The next day, her friends found her at home unconscious, and her shin was black. An ambulance took her to Manatee Memorial Hospital, where she was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis.

Doctors attempted to save her infected leg with several surgeries. She was transported to Blake Medical Center, where she was put on life support. She died after suffering 2 strokes and organ failure during surgeries to save her leg.

"There are so many things we keep replaying that we could've done differently," the daughter-in-law said. "We had never heard of necrotizing fasciitis. We didn't know to look for any signs. If we had known to look for signs we could've stopped it. I was told my whole life that salt water is good for cuts." The deadly disease can be caused by different strains of bacteria, like group A _Streptococcus_ or _Vibrio vulnificus_. The CDC recommends avoiding swimming pools, hot tubs, and natural bodies of water if you have an open wound.

Paul Gulig, an expert on necrotizing fasciitis and professor of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the bacteria are more common in Florida because of the warm water. "Necrotizing fasciitis likes warm, lower salinity water, so you're more likely to find it on intracoastal side than the beach side," Gulig said. "If you have an open cut, you shouldn't be swimming in any water. When it gets in the skin tissue, it grows faster than it does in the lab. That's why people die within days. It's one of the fastest-growing infections."

Since 2010, approximately 700 to 1200 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur each year in the USA, according to the CDC, and the number of infections does not appear to be rising. Earlier in the summer, a 12-year-old girl contracted necrotizing fasciitis on a beach in Destin and survived after 3 surgeries. "If you catch it early, it is treatable with antibiotics," Gulig said. "But by the time you see that (black skin), they're probably going to be checking out."

If you have an open wound that touched the water and you see anything that resembles an infection, Gulig said you should see a doctor immediately.

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: first, vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and, second, most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL]
