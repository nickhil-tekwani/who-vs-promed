Has it been established that it is a bacteria that has caused the black
drum kill in Virginia? If so, what is the bacteria?
What has been the recent information on _Pfiesteria piscicida_? I recall
that this dinoflagellate was first reported to be a bacterium. There were
reports of illness in fisherman as well as research workers working with
infected fish. Some workers were reported to have had CNS problems.

Is there a possible connection between the June 8th Virginia fish kill and
_Pfiesteria_, the toxic dinoflagellate that was responsible for fish kills
along much of the East coast (North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia, etc.)
during 1997, 1998 and 1999?
_Pfiesteria_ spp. is thought to be inherently present throughout the
eastern waterways and along the coastline, but the toxicity is believed to
be triggered mostly by pollution from the region's hog farms or industrial
pollution. Exact details of the fish kill were not included in the June
10th posting. _Pfiesteria_ spp. first stupefies the fish then kills them,
effecting visible lesions on their skin. _Pfiesteria_ spp.can also act as a
neurotoxin, causing neurological effects in humans who are exposed for
extended periods of time to the fish or water containing the _Pfiesteria_
spp. toxin.

[I do not know if anyone has done a retrospective study from fish in 1998
There were a number of fish kills along the east coast of the US that were
from _Pfiesteria piscicida_. If any one has answers to Dr. Prouty's or
Anna's questions, please inform us. - Mod.TG
