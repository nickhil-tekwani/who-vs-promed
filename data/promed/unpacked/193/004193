After foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was confirmed yesterday [7 Aug 2014] at a pig farm in Hapcheon County, South Gyeongsang, local authorities took follow-up measures to prevent the disease from spreading.

Symptoms suspected to be those of FMD were reported on the pig farm on Wednesday [6 Aug 2014]. The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency confirmed yesterday [7 Aug 2014] that the animals had contracted the disease. The provincial government also said yesterday that they have already culled 121 pigs that showed FMD symptoms at the farm.

The confirmation yesterday [7 Aug 2014] marks the 3rd FMD case since the disease returned for the 1st time in 3 years. The 1st case this year [2014] was at a hog farm in Uiseong County, North Gyeongsang, on 24 Jul 2014, while the 2nd was at a farm in Goryeong County, also in North Gyeongsang, 4 days later.

Authorities are worried about the disease spreading because they have discovered that 217 more farms in the region have had either direct or indirect contact with the infected farm. They were all visited by a vehicle that stopped at the infected farm about 2 weeks ago.

The quarantine authority has set up 8 control posts in Hapcheon and neighboring Changnyeong County.

[South Korea experienced a major FMD epizootic from November 2010 to April 2011. It was very severe and affected both pigs and cattle. The causative agent was serotyped O and genotyped as topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. A total of 3748 farms were confirmed FMD-infected, and 3 479 866 animals were culled (Ref. 1), of which 322 654 pigs and 8441 cattle in 155 holdings were officially reported to the OIE as infected.

The S. Korean government started emergency vaccination for all FMD susceptible domestic animals in December 2010, using FMD type O vaccines. A total of 46 600 000 doses of FMD vaccine were administered to cattle, pigs, deer and goats through June 2011. (Ref. 1). Trivalent FMD vaccines (types O, A, and Asia1) were supplied for routine vaccinations beginning in September 2011, with the consideration of FMD outbreaks in surrounding countries.

According to the said paper, although 2 vaccinations with an interval of 4 weeks at ages between 2 and 3 months were recommended for cattle and pigs, growing piglets were vaccinated only once between 8 and 12 weeks of age for reasons of cost and vaccine supply. A study, reported in the paper, was performed to identify the appropriate time for FMD vaccination in growing pigs when vaccination is applied only once (at either 8 weeks or 12 weeks of age). It led to results indicating that pigs vaccinated once at 8 weeks of age showed much higher seroprevalences than pigs vaccinated once at 12 weeks of age (60.9 percent, in relation to serotype O).

The current event has involved, so far, pigs only. Its location in a 2nd province is of some concern, particularly in pigs where the vaccination regime has, reportedly, been of lesser intensity than in cattle. Data on the vaccination history of the affected farms and the ages of the affected animals, will be helpful.

The veterinary authorities have already submitted 10 samples for genotyping to the World reference laboratory (batch "WRLFMD/2014/00027," received at WRLFMD on 31 Jul 2014). Results are anticipated shortly, and their details will be gratefully acknowledged.
