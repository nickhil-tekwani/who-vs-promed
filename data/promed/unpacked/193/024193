Re: ProMED post Dolphin morbillivirus, fatal - Australia: (SA) 1st rep 20130505.1692701
----------------------------------------------
ProMED recently reported the identification of morbillivirus and fungal infection as the cause of death in one of a number of juvenile dolphins found dead off the coast of South Australia, predominantly in the Gulf of St Vincent.

Over 30 dolphins have been found dead in the past month [Apr 2013], mostly juvenile and some neonatal bottlenose dolphins. In addition to the University of Adelaide and the Australian Marine Wildlife Research and Rescue Operation, examinations of affected dolphins have also been conducted at the South Australian Museum and Gribbles Pathology. All virology work is being undertaken by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory.

We are in the process of collating results from this study. Morbillivius infection has been confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all of 6 lung tissues examined to date, often in association with fungal (_Aspergillus_ spp) or verminous pneumonia. Some animals have also had non-suppurative meningoencephalitis and fungal hyphae were present in some of these lesions.

The dolphin mortalities partially overlapped and followed a substantial fish mortality event in the same waters. Hundreds of shallow water fish, predominantly small-bodied benthic species, were found dead over a 1-2 week period. Branchitis was a consistent histopathology finding. Elevated water temperatures and a non-toxic algal bloom is believed to be the underlying cause of the fish deaths but it is not known at this time if the fish and dolphin deaths are related.
