Some 45 people, mostly children, have died from measles in 4 weeks among more than 300 cases in Kasongo, an area of Maniema province in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, administrative authorities reported on Sunday [7 Nov 2021].

The health division has counted 342 cases including 45 deaths already from the 22nd to the 39th epidemiological week. "The number of victims starts at the end of September [2021]," Anadolu Benoit Kitenge, administrator of the Kasongo territory, told the Agency.

The most affected health area is the locality of Bikenge, where 3 deaths are reported on average per day, according to the same source.

In addition to measles, the territory has recorded in recent weeks, "14 cases of polio, 2 cases of yellow fever, and hundreds of deaths due to severe and rebellious malaria with anemia," says its administrator, reporting a health emergency that requires a "rapid and appropriate response."

Measles is virtually the most contagious disease in the world. It is spread by coughing, sneezing, or by direct contact with nasal or laryngeal secretions.

Children who contract the disease can face serious complications, including measles "erasing" their immune memory, putting their health and lives at risk for years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In the DRC, the low vaccination rate is one of the factors explaining the resurgence of the disease. Between 2018 and 2020, the country experienced the largest outbreak on record. In just 2 years, more than 460 000 children had contracted the disease, and nearly 8000 had died from it, according to the authorities. About 3/4 of them were under 5 years old.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for sending this important update on measles in the DRC.

Kasongo, also known as Piani Kasongo, is a town and territory in Maniema province of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

DR Congo is burdened with Ebola in the eastern region of the country, COVID, low vaccination rates to measles, underfunding of its healthcare system, political violence, and more. According to Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), between 2018 and 2020, more than 460 000 children contracted measles, and nearly 8000 died from it, 3/4 of which were under 5 years old. Increased manpower and funding are needed to vaccinate the children to protect them against this highly infectious disease. - Mod.LK]

From the beginning of the year [1 Jan 2021] through the end of September 2021, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 41 099 suspected measles cases and 991 confirmed, including 603 deaths (CFR 1.5%) in 369 health districts across 26 provinces of the country.

The outbreak has been confirmed in 82 health districts across 23 affected provinces including the capital city of Kinshasa.

In August 2020, the DRC declared the end of a 25-month outbreak of measles that claimed the lives of more than 7000 children aged under 5.

However, earlier this year [2021], Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) reported the rise in measles once again.

In addition to measles, DRC reports outbreaks of cholera, meningitis, monkeypox, plague, typhoid fever, COVID-19, and the 13th Ebola virus disease outbreak in the country's history.

[As stated above, the DRC is burdened with many public health and infrastructure problems. COVID and unrest in the country have led to the exacerbation of neglected diseases that are endemic in the DRC, measles just being one. - Mod.LK
