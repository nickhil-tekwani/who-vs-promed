WHO urges countries to act on new anti-resistance malaria medicines
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geneva -Tackling rising levels of medicine resistance is one of the key
challenges to African States in their efforts to control malaria and meet
the declared target of saving the lives of half the 800 000 young children
who die of the disease every year by 2010.
The cheapest and most readily available medicines are increasingly
ineffective. That's why the World Health Organization (WHO) in its
programme to Roll Back Malaria is urging countries to switch to a new type
of combination therapy when there is strong evidence that existing
conventional medicines are no longer working.
The atemisinin-based combination is part of the new term Available
Combination Therapies, (ACTs). The artemisinin derivatives has been
developed from a Chinese herb and are the most exciting prospect in new
malaria treatments. They kill the malaria parasite very fast, allowing the
patient to recover rapidly, and with very few side effects.
Because ACTs combine 2 medicines that work in different ways, it is
unlikely that the malaria parasite, which has rapidly developed resistance
to other single treatments would evolve to resist these medicine
combinations.
The Board of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, meeting in New
York, have decided to fund proposals to Roll Back Malaria in Zanzibar and
Zambia. These proposals include purchasing and phasing-in the use of new
ACTs.
"We hope that the Fund and other funding mechanisms will be used to
purchase ACTs where they are needed to treat malaria and improve the
control of the disease in communities at risk," Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland,
Director-General of WHO. "WHO has worked with a variety of partners
including the manufacturers to reduce the price of ACTs in developing
countries. It is important that countries which need ACTs are able to
access and use them in a sustainable manner."
For decades, the best known treatment for malaria was chloroquine, an
inexpensive medicine that has saved millions of lives. However, in recent
years, the malaria parasite has developed resistance to chloroquine and so,
in many countries, it is no longer an effective treatment. As a result,
many countries have moved to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, known as SP or
Fansidar, as first-line treatment. However, resistance to SP is also
spreading.
WHO recommends that countries begin the transition as soon as levels of
resistance exceed 15 percent and that the change will be implemented before
resistance reaches 25 percent.

[There is evidence that the number of child deaths due to malaria has begun
to increase as a result of failing medicines and medicines of poor quality.
Recent evidence also indicates rising levels of medicine resistance, in
particular against chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar).
Almost half of the money spent on anti-malarial medicines is being used to
pay for inappropriate treatments. ACTs include artemether and lumefantrine,
artesunate and amodiaquine, or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine. It is hoped that
use of these combinations will avoid development of resistance. This also
highlights the need for more efforts on preventing malaria, using proven
cost-effective measures such as insecticide-treated bednets. Â­- Mod.EP]
