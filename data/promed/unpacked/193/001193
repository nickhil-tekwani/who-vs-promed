The 1st case of chikungunya identified in 2011 has been detected in
Mauritius [involving] an inhabitant of Quatre-Bornes, aged 60. This
patient has currently been admitted to Victoria Hospital, and the
Department of Health would like to reassure the public that it is an
isolated case and that "there is no epidemic in the country."

Chikungunya (CHIK in abbreviation) is a tropical infectious disease,
caused by an arbovirus (CHIKV for chikungunya virus), an Alphavirus
of the Togaviridae family, transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The
name's origin and meaning is that "which bends and curls like the
fallen leaves of trees that curl as they dry;" chikungunya was also
translated into French as "break-bone disease" or "disease of bent
man," because it causes very severe joint pain associated with
stiffness, which gives patients infected a characteristic curved appearance.

Several species of mosquitoes can transmit chikungunya, but only
_Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ have so far been identified as
vectors of epidemic [CHIKV transmission], because of their adaptation
to human settlements. These same species are also involved in the
transmission of other arboviruses such as dengue and yellow fever.

[CHIKV infections have not been reported on Mauritius island since
2006. One hopes that this is not the index case of another major
outbreak. ProMED would be interested in receiving reports of any
additional cases that occur, and any results of surveys of abundance
of the vector mosquitoes.
