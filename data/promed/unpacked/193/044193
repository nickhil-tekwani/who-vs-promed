With their distinctive shape and colorful exteriors, sea stars, also known as starfish, were once a staple of marine life along British Columbia's coastline.

"You can tell this one is healthy because his legs are stretched out and his exterior is firm," explained Nick Campbell while holding an okra sea star in the touch pool at the Shaw Centre for the Salish Sea.

While the animals once littered the ocean floor, sea stars from Mexico to Alaska are now dying at an alarming rate. Since 2013, millions of these iconic creatures have been wiped out by a mysterious and gruesome disease called the sea star wasting disease.

"They actually start to shed their legs and the legs crawl away," explained scientific diver Doug Biffard. "It's like the zombie apocalypse." The syndrome causes the infected sea stars to develop white lesions. They eventually disintegrate into a pile of slime.

Some areas have reported a 90 percent decline in their populations. "It may be the largest wildlife mortality event in recorded history" explained Jackie Hildering of the Marine Education and Research Society.

While they may hide below the surface, they are a major marine predator and act as the linchpin of habitats for hundreds of other species. "It's of terrible importance in realizing that they are top-level predators," Hildering said. "Our oceans are complex and there is something to be learned here that has relevance to our day to day lives."

There have been reports of certain sea star species rebounding in recent months, but the deadly disease is still highly active in 19 species along North America's Pacific Coast. "Because it's under the water, it's out of sight, out of mind and so there's a real problem where people aren't recognizing that," said scientific diver Stefania Gorgopa with the University of Victoria.

"If we continue to do the wrong things like shipping oil from the West Coast, there is a real risk that we're going to cause severe loss of marine life in the Salish Sea," Biffard said.

The public is encouraged to track sightings of sea stars by taking photos and submitting the information to the Vancouver Aquarium. "They will put it into their data archives and share it with the rest of the world" Biffard explained. It's a first step and a call to action to combating a widespread virus with no known cause or cure.

[Mass mortalities of echinoids (sea stars) as a result of disease have been widely reported from all over the world. Wasting disease has been observed in sea stars in the west coast of USA periodically during warm-water years since it was 1st recognized in 1978 and was especially prevalent during the 1982-1984 El Niño. The episodes that have been occurring since 2013 have spread throughout the west coast of North America, from Baja California to Alaska. There is no association with El Niño.

A few years ago, a densovirus was found associated with the syndrome, but as the pathogen appears to be part of the natural sea star parasite community, it is important to determine why it is causing mass mortalities. Is it acting as a natural mechanism of population control (in which case conservation actions are not needed)? Has it mutated to a more pathogenic form? (The theory of evolution of virulence runs counter this idea.) Is the physiological condition of sea stars deteriorated due to anthropogenic stressors and therefore they became more susceptible to the virus? If the latter were the case, applied research to inform conservation actions is urgently needed. A multi-scale interdisciplinary approach that aims to unveil the web of causation behind this disease is urgently needed.
