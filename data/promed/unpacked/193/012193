Two weeks after a dangerous strain of _E. coli_ ripped through the annual Milk Makers Fest agricultural fair in Lynden, Whatcom County [21-23 Apr 2015], the state is asking for federal help in figuring out the outbreak that has sickened at least 45 and sent 8 to regional hospitals. Dr Scott Lindquist, Washington's epidemiologist for communicable diseases, said he's requested that the CDC assist county and state officials in tracking the spread of what's known as Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 at the event attended by more than 1300 1st-graders. "I'm not calling them because I think it's a large outbreak and it's unmanageable," Lindquist said. "I think it would be great; it would be helpful."

Lindquist said he's looking for more boots on the ground to back up local officials as they conduct interviews and perform analysis to help identify the problem. Local health officials haven't been able to say how the outbreak started, whether food, livestock, a petting zoo -- or something else -- may have spread the potentially deadly bacteria.

Results are pending for tests that may show whether the bacteria that made people sick also were found in the environment or on surfaces at the Northwest Washington Fair & Event Center, Lindquist said. Ditto for additional tests that can tell whether the genetic fingerprint of the bugs indicates one source -- or several.

Such information can't come too soon for victims of the outbreak, including the mom of a teen who was hospitalized for 10 days with an _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection after he helped set up a hay maze at the festival. "I don't want people to think it's just from a petting zoo when it might be much bigger than that," said the mother who works at a local Safeway store. "I wouldn't want this to happen to anybody. This is a horrible, horrible thing." Her 15-year-old son fell ill within days of joining his Lynden High School classmates on a field trip to help set up the maze with hay from a local farm. 2 other high-school kids are among those who also got sick, she said. The teenager was eventually diagnosed with a life-threatening kidney complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, and sent by ambulance to Seattle Children's for treatment, hospital officials confirmed.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria are found in the guts of many mammals and cause infections usually linked to contact with animal feces. The Whatcom County Dairy Women, the group that organized the festival 21-23 Apr 2015, said it followed petting-zoo guidelines issued by the CDC, which call for hand-washing stations monitored by volunteers to prevent illness in children. Hand sanitizer was also available, they noted.

Information about the outbreak has been lacking so far. Normally, consumers by now could expect results of environmental sampling tests and so-called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE tests, which identify the genetic fingerprint of the bacteria. "I just think in the normal course of an outbreak, whether it's foodborne or environmental, the lack of basic information about PFGE, about environmental testing, is a bit odd," said an outside observer.

Dr Greg Stern, the Whatcom County health officer, said county and state health officials are working hard to find answers. They're interviewing the adults and children who are included in the outbreak and comparing them with people who attended the fair and didn't get sick. They're waiting for test results and hope to know about PFGE links soon. "It's going to take weeks to correlate the interviews," he said. "It takes time." Lindquist said test results could come as early as next week [week of 11 May 2015].

There's no question that the Milk Makers Fest was the source of the illnesses, Lindquist added. But there has been a lot of speculation in the community about when and where the bugs might have originated.

The teenager got sick after being exposed on just one day, 20 Apr 2015, before the fair began, his mother notes. That means the bacteria had to be present before the hundreds of 1st-graders, plus teachers and parents, ever showed up. "To me, it seems like they aren't looking at the right thing," she said. "To me, my son is like Patient Zero. Why wouldn't you be looking at that?"

More _E. coli_ infections tied to the outbreak could still be reported, particularly in people who didn't attend the fair but were exposed to those who did. So-called "secondary cases" could create a new wave of illness as serious as the 1st, Stern noted. "The good news is, the case count is increasing slowly," Stern said.

[According to the reporter, "From what I've been told, there were no animals yet present when the older kids were setting up the hay maze. So it raises questions about a possible environmental source already present or something in or on the hay, as well as the critters. Dr. Lindquist here in [Washington] acknowledged that they are looking at all environmental sources, maybe even the venting system, as well as the animal sources."

It is not clear where the hay for the hay maze came from and it has not been stated whether the children and others who became ill from _E. coli_ O157 were more likely to have been exposed to hay or the hay maze. We await more information regarding the source of the EHEC here. - Mod.LL
