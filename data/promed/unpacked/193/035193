Rotavirus infection responsible for the deaths of 2 children at a
residential school in the Urals
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Children falling ill at a residential school in the town of Lesnoy in
the Sverdlovsk Region (Oblast) have been diagnosed with rotavirus
infection. 2 children have died.

According to Arkady Bielyavski, the Regional Health Minister, this
type of illness has been common among children in Lesnoy at the end
of winter. According to the Minister, rotavirus infection is
transmitted by airborne droplets, via water, faeces, and poorly
washed fruits and vegetables.

All the children attending the particular residential school have
health problems and disabilities and all have impaired immune
systems. The 2 children who died, aged 11 and 12, resembled children
of 2-3 years of age, and weighed no more than 11 kg [24 lb]. Both had
central nervous system afflictions, and had not developed normally.
Unfortunately, such children have a low life expectancy and some die
every year. In 2009 there was a total of 5 deaths. The average life
expectancy of such children is 14 to 15 years. Bielyavski stated that
few of them survive to adulthood.

[Rotavirus infection is the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal
disease in infants and young children globally. Rotaviruses are
estimated to be responsible for approximately 527 000 deaths each
year. Children under 5 years of age, especially those between 6
months and 2 years are most vulnerable to the disease. Vaccines
against rotavirus gastroenteritis are available, but not yet in universal use.
