A rabid raccoon in the Walking Horse Lane area is the 15th confirmed rabies case in White County for 2020.

According to White County Environmental Health, on Tuesday [1 Sep 2020], a dog owner went outside when he heard some noise on his porch and discovered his dog fighting with a raccoon. The owner killed the raccoon and reported the incident to Environmental Health immediately. The raccoon was sent to the Georgia Public Health Lab in Decatur. The state lab shared confirmation of a positive rabies test on Thursday [3 Sep 2020].

The dog was up to date on its rabies vaccination and is required to undergo a 45-day observational quarantine and will have to get a rabies booster shot, according to Environmental Health. During the incident, the homeowner may be been exposed and was told to discuss the incident with his physician and follow the physician's advice.

Positive [rabies] alert signs have been posted in the area where the rabid fox was located. Those who live in this area and have concerns of rabid animal exposure should contact White County Environmental Health during normal business hours.

Animal owners are encouraged to vaccinate their domesticated pets for rabies. Please call a local veterinarian for an appointment.

The raccoon that attacked a 79-year-old man in a Hunterdon County park over the weekend tested positive for rabies, authorities said. The animal attacked the man at Christie Hoffman Farm Park in Tewksbury around 7 p.m. Friday [4 Sep 2020], police said.

Tewksbury Township police urge anyone who may have come into contact with the raccoon to notify their primary care physician or the Hunterdon Medical Center Emergency Room to discuss concerns and treatment options.

Residents are also reminded to avoid picking up stray animals and to vaccinate pets against the virus.

"Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus, authorities said. "The virus is found in the saliva of a rabid animal and is transmitted by a bite, or possibly by saliva of an open cut or the eyes. The disease is transmitted from animals to humans or from animals to other animals. Left untreated, humans can be protected by receiving rabies prophylaxis after exposure."

https://thehorse.com/192548/maryland-horse-euthanized-due-to-rabies/


Health departments in multiple Virginia and Maryland counties are tracing humans and horses that were potentially exposed.

On 2 Sep 2020 officials at the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) confirmed a 5-year-old Warmblood gelding in Montgomery County with rabies. The horse had shown signs of aggression and was euthanized. The positive test results led to health departments in multiple counties in Virginia and Maryland contacting humans who were potentially exposed. Two horses were also exposed; they were previously vaccinated and received boosters when exposure became known. They are under a 45-day hold order imposed by Montgomery County.

Rabies -- a zoonotic disease that can be spread from animals to humans -- is caused by a lyssavirus that affects the neurologic system and salivary glands. Horses are exposed most commonly through the bite of another rabid animal.

In horses, clinical signs of rabies are variable and can take up to 12 weeks to appear after the initial infection. Although affected horses are sometimes asymptomatic, an infected horse can show behavioral changes such as drowsiness, depression, fear, or aggression. Once clinical signs appear, there are no treatment options.

Rabies can only be diagnosed postmortem by submitting the horse's head to a local public health laboratory to identify the rabies virus using a test called fluorescence antibody. Thus, ruling out all other potential diseases first is very important in these cases to avoid potentially unnecessary euthanasia.

Because rabies threatens both horses and the humans who handle them, the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends rabies as a core vaccine every US horse should receive. The AAEP's vaccination guidelines recommend that adult horses receive an initial single dose and a booster vaccination annually; foals born to vaccinated mares should receive a 1st vaccine dose no earlier than at 6 months of age and a 2nd dose 4-6 weeks later followed by annual vaccination; and foals of unvaccinated mares should receive a 1st vaccine dose at 3 or 4 months of age and should be revaccinated annually.

[5] Texas: bat, human exposure

https://dfw.cbslocal.com/2020/09/16/rabid-bat-tests-positive-rabies-contact-plano-resident/


A bat tested positive for rabies this week after it came into contact with a Plano [Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, Collin and Denton counties] resident in the area of W. 15th Street and Custer Road, Plano Animal Services confirmed Wednesday [16 Sep 2020].

"This positive test highlights the importance of being cautious around wildlife and always reporting any contact with them," said Plano Animal Services Director Jamey Cantrell. "It also shows why it's so important to keep all pet vaccinations current, especially rabies. There is no way to predict when a pet may come into contact with a wild animal." Texas law and Plano city ordinances require animals to receive rabies inoculations along with subsequent booster shots for the duration of the animal's life.

Rabies is a viral disease occurring in warm-blooded animals and can be contracted by humans through bites from infected animals.

The Plano Animal Shelter does not routinely test wild animals for rabies unless they have had contact with a person or pet and are 1 of 5 high-risk non-domestic animals: bats, foxes, skunks, coyotes, and raccoons.

This particular incident involved a resident who had contact with a bat.

The bat was ill and died before Animal Services could pick it up. Due to the nature of the situation, the animal was tested and subsequently found to be rabid.

Rabies is preventable. The shelter hosts a low-cost rabies vaccination clinic on the 3rd Friday of every month.

In August [2020], a bat tested positive for rabies in Frisco.

The SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a fox found near Hunt Cup Lane and Kings Chase Road in Camden [Kershaw County] has tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider.

"Keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination is the easiest way to protect you and your family from this deadly virus," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

"Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to people or pets. The key to prevention is to stay away from wild and stray animals and keep your pets current on their rabies vaccinations. In South Carolina, rabies is most often found in wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats, but pets are just as susceptible to the virus. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it. Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office (https://scdhec.gov/ea-regional-offices). An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected or possibly infected animal.

If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider that your pet could have been exposed to rabies and contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Sumter office during normal business hours (8:30 am-5 pm, Monday-Friday). To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

This fox is the 7th animal in Kershaw County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 122 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged approximately 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, one of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina was in Kershaw County.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control confirmed a raccoon in Hilton Head tested positive for rabies, forcing 2 pets into quarantine. [If the pets are in quarantine, they likely have had a rabies vaccine, but in accordance with some rabies law, they are revaccinated and observed for a period of time. - Mod.TG]

The raccoon was found near Lagoon Road and Egret Street, DHEC officials say. It was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing Friday [25 Sep 2020], and lab results confirmed it was rabid on Monday [28 Sep 2020].

"Keeping your pets up-to-date on their rabies vaccination is the easiest way to protect you and your family from this deadly virus," Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division Director David Vaughan said. "Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to humans or pets. The key to prevention is to stay away from wild and stray animals and to keep your pets current on their rabies vaccinations!"

In South Carolina, wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats are the most common carriers of rabies, but pets are just as susceptible to the virus, he said.

If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office.

An exposure is defined as a bite, a scratch, or contact with saliva or body fluids from an infected or possibly infected animal.

If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your pet could have been exposed to rabies and contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Beaufort office during normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday-Friday. To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

This raccoon is the 7th animal in Beaufort County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 129 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged approximately 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, 4 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Beaufort County.

[We have several reports over the last several rabies postings of large animals being affected by rabies. These animals can be a source of danger to humans. They can become 'vicious' or overly aggressive and attack a human, biting, kicking, or crushing them.

If you have large animals you are around frequently, whether as pets or show projects, protect yourself and your family by vaccinating against rabies.

Almost any mammal is susceptible to the rabies virus. Don't take chances with your life. If they are pets, however large or small, vaccinate them. Most counties/states have a rabies prevention law. Vaccinating your pet forms a barrier between you and the disease as well as protecting your pet.

If you come into contact with wildlife, remember they can become infected with rabies. Be cautious of them. Animals normally afraid of you may appear more likely to come to you. Sometimes, the animal may be aggressive, but sometimes the dumb form of rabies may mean the animal seems more friendly or outgoing than usual. - Mod.TG]
