[Mato Gross do Sul in the west of the country, bordering
Paraguay and Bolivia, is home to 22 million cattle. They
underwent a false positive scare in late 2004, resulting in
the ban of beef from Australia until a definitive diagnosis
proved negative. However, as the OIE report indicates, this
is a reoccurrence in the country of Type O FMD which
occurred in May 2004. Type C also occurred in August 2004.
