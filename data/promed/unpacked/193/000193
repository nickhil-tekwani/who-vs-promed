MUMPS - MACEDONIA: CORRECTION

Some of our readers have pointed out that this report refers to the
FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia), NOT to the region of
Macedonia in northern Greece. ProMED seeks to adhere to UN-approved
country designations such as FYROM, but as the source simply referred
to Macedonia, we failed to pick up the error. ProMED regrets the
error, and particularly regrets any confusion this may have caused.
