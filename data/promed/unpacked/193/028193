The Nebraska Agriculture Department says a case of bovine tuberculosis [TB] has been diagnosed in a cow from a small herd in Knox County.

The announcement was made by the department on Tuesday [26 Nov 2013]. The rest of the herd was quarantined and tested negative for the disease.

The Associated Press reports federal experts are assisting the department in deciphering how the animal was infected.

Earlier this month [November 2013], the USDA announced new plans to help control bovine TB by developing and improving diagnostic tests, vaccines and other technology to detect and prevent the spread of disease.

Infection rates of bovine TB in cattle are low, but the disease persists in wildlife which can then be transmitted to cattle.

[Bovine tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that is difficult to detect early, especially in a herd believed to be clear of the disease. It is most often detected at carcass inspection during slaughter.

Certainly this means that the state and their federal partners will be on a heightened lookout for other cases. They will likely be busy tracing where the animal originated, trying to determine how many others were exposed and harboring the disease.
