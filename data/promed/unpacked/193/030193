A confirmed case of West Nile fever, a relatively unknown viral infection in the region, [has been] reported in the district. A 7 year old boy from AR [Abdu Rahiman] Nagar was admitted to the Kozhikode Medical College hospital on [Mon 11 Mar 2019].

The health authorities in Malappuram have informed that the infection was confirmed. The patient had been under treatment for a fever, and he was shifted to the medical college after showing symptoms of the West Nile viral infection. Following the report of the disease, the district health administration has issued a special alert across the district against the disease, which is typically spread by culex mosquitoes.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), West Nile virus [WNV] is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes, and it can cause a fatal neurological disease and death in people. Birds are the natural hosts of WNV. Human infection is most often the result of bites from infected mosquitoes, which become infected when they feed on infected birds, which circulate the virus in their blood for a few days, says the WHO website. No human-to-human transmission of WNV through casual contact has been documented, according to WHO. Symptoms of infection include fever, headache, fatigue, body aches, nausea, and vomiting.

The prevalence of the virus was raised in Alappuzha and parts of Kottayam in 2006 during the outbreak of chikungunya. A suspected case of disease was also reported in a 24 year old woman in Kozhikode last year [2018].

District medical officer (DMO) K Sakeena said that health authorities have initiated efforts to prevent the spread of disease, including vector control activities. "We have issued a warning to private hospitals, veterinary doctors, and public health authorities. As no vaccines are available for humans, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus," she said, adding that the cleaning of drainages and waterlogged areas, the main breeding grounds of mosquitoes, is on. She said that community programmes also would be conducted to destroy mosquito breeding sites in residential areas.

Health authorities have already identified the presence of culex mosquitoes in the premises of the house of the boy who was infected, and local sanitation works also were carried out in the region.

[West Nile virus (WNV) has been reported from many states in India. Evidence of WNV cases through serology was reported from Vellore and Kolar districts in 1977-1978 and 1981. WNV-neutralizing antibodies have been detected in human sera collected from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. During an outbreak of AES [acute encephalitis syndrome] in Kerala in May 2011, WNV was confirmed in clinical specimens. Since then, WNV encephalitis cases have regularly been reported in Kerala [https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/communicable-disease/west-nile-fever].

WNV is a zoonotic flavivirus that is mainly transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. WNV is maintained in nature through the mosquito-bird transmission cycle, as birds are the natural hosts of the virus and act as both carriers and amplifying host. Humans, horses, and other mammals can be infected. Ornithophilic (feeds on birds) mosquitoes belonging mainly to _Culex_ species act as vectors for transmission of infection from infected birds to vertebrate hosts. - Mod.UBA
