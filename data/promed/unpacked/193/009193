[There was a similar outbreak of Newcastle disease involving fattening
pigeons at Ille-et-Vilaine in France last November. A map of the location
can be found at <http://www.maplandia.com/france/bretagne/ille-et-vilaine>.
The current outbreak location is still along the Atlantic coast but further
south and can be seen at
<http://www.maplandia.com/france/poitou-charentes/deux-sevres>.
An outbreak was also reported last November in pheasants at Siracourt in
the Pas-de-Calais department, whose location can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/FRA051028.pdf> and last July at
St-Mars-de-Coutais in the Loire-Atlantique department, which can be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/FRA050729.pdf>.
So, these outbreaks have occurred in widely disparate locations but have
not yet involved commercial chicken production. It is suspected that
Newcastle disease has been introduced by wild birds but to date there
appears to be no definitive evidence. Newcastle disease is a serious
disease of commercial poultry, and if it is being introduced by contact
with wild birds, it may be time to start considering biosecurity measures
to prevent further introductions. - Mod.PC]
