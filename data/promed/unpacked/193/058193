Health authorities in the Northern Territory [NT] have issued an alert for the potentially fatal mosquito-borne virus Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE).

The virus is a severe infection that causes inflammation of the brain, as well as affecting the nervous system. It is considered rare, part of the same group of viruses as dengue fever and Zika, and there is no vaccine.

Health authorities have kept a close eye on the mosquito-borne virus for years through the use of chickens. Professor Paul Young, the head of the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences at the University of Queensland, said researchers release chickens that mosquitoes will feed on and then take regular blood samples from the chickens. "Those blood samples are sent to a central pathology lab; in this case, it would be down in Perth," he said. "They test for antibodies, and they can test for specific MVE antibodies. And when they get a positive signal, they know there's some MVE activity in the region."

The Northern Territory's Department of Health said it had received that "positive signal" in the Darwin rural area.

Professor Young said while he did not want to play down the seriousness of the virus, alerts of that type were quite common, particularly at this time of year. "The vast majority of these infections are asymptomatic, so it's not a disease that we've had huge epidemic outbreaks as a result of but more sporadic occasional disease," he said.

Professor Young said there was not a vaccine for the virus because it was considered a relatively exotic pathogen, so there were no commercial incentives to produce a vaccine. "That doesn't mean there hasn't been good research that has developed approaches, but they haven't made their way into commercial manufacturing," he said.

Nina Kurucz, a medical entomologist with the department, said that in the Darwin rural area and into east Arnhem, there were a lot of lagoons and wetlands where mosquitoes remained active.

"We are still running more tests on chicken blood that we are getting in from Katherine, and also the Barkly region, so hopefully next week we will have results for that as well," Ms Kurucz said. "But at the moment, the mosquito numbers down in central Australia are very low, and Alice Springs chickens actually tested negative, and our chickens in Darwin itself also tested negative. But everything else in the Darwin rural area had a lot of MVE virus activity indicators."

Only one in 1000 people who are bitten by an infected mosquito actually develop MVE. But in those rare cases, the consequences could be severe, Ms Kurucz said. "It is a very serious disease, so we have had surveillance since the early 1970s," she said. "Since then, we've recorded 36 cases. Usually about 25 percent of the cases are left with severe impairment, and another 25 percent actually die, so it is very serious."

The good news is that it is easy to take precautions: use mosquito sprays and coils, and cover your skin, particularly around dusk and at night.

The highest risks of transmission are expected to last until the end of June [2016].

[Murray Valley encephalitis virus occurs across Australia, but human cases are sporadic to rare. The use of sentinel chickens is a standard method to provide an early warning system for transmission of several arthropod-borne viruses, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus. MVE-positive chickens can lead to efforts for vector control and to warn the public about the risk of infection and measures to avoid mosquito bites.

In the article above Professor Paul Young states that sentinel chicken blood testing for NT chickens is carried out Perth (Western Australia). Nina Kurucz, Director of Medical Entomology at the Northern Territory Department of Health, has advised us that, in fact, sentinel chicken blood testing for NT chickens is carried out by the Berrimah Farm Veterinary laboratories (Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries) in Darwin. - Mod.TY
