Local carp die-off turns out to be short-lived
----------------------------------------------
According to Kensington Metropark officials, an estimated 700 carp
died last month [June 2011] at Kent Lake and portions of the Huron
River.

However, the die-off -- likely due to a virus called spring viremia
of carp, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources
[DNR] -- was thankfully short-lived, said Huron-Clinton Metroparks
Chief of Communications Denise Semion.

Semion said the die-off continued for only a few days after dead carp
were first reported by boaters at Kent Lake and a segment of the Huron
River just east of the lake.

"We have had no incidents since, and we're estimating between 600 and
700 fish died," said Semion. She noted that the lake is about 800
acres [324 ha] in size, equating to approximately one dead fish per
acre.

"We did receive reports then of things being unsightly, and we did
hear complaints of odors," she said.

Semion said cleanup crews worked diligently to remove dead fish to
reduce any risk posed by dead or decomposing fish, like _E. coli_
bacteria.

The disease that likely caused the die-off affects only species of
carp and posed no human health risk.

Jim Francis, a fisheries biologist for the DNR, said last month [June
2011] that evidence pointed to spring viremia of carp, primarily
because no other fish were otherwise affected.

Francis said spring viremia of carp -- which causes infected fish to
become extremely lethargic -- has been confirmed in portions of
southeastern Michigan before, including Woodland Lake in Brighton
Township.

"Based on the reports we've gotten and the evidence, what we're
seeing is consistent with what spring viremia of carp does," Francis
said. "Typically, when we get calls for fish die-offs, people assume
(it's caused by) water contamination, but if there were poison in the
water, it would kill indiscriminately."

Semion said cleanup crews sent samples of the dead carp to the DNR,
which forwarded them to labs at Michigan State University. Results,
she said, are expected within a few weeks.

[While it may be spring viremia of carp, it may well be Koi herpes
virus as well. Neither disease can be diagnosed by visual signs alone.
Both affect only carp, so to claim one over the other may be
premature.

Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a contagious viral disease of carp
and related species. Outbreaks can cause substantial economic losses.
SVC can be highly fatal in young fish, with mortality rates up to 90
percent. In Europe, where this disease has been endemic for at least
50 years, 10-15 percent of 1-year-old farmed carp are lost to SVC each
year. The causative virus can be spread by fomites and parasitic
invertebrates, and is difficult to eradicate; once it is established
in a pond, elimination of the virus may require the destruction of all
aquatic life. Since 2002, several SVC outbreaks have been reported in
the US, with both cultivated and wild species affected.

The clinical signs of SVC can include darkening of the skin, swollen
eyes, abdominal swelling, pale gills, trailing fecal casts, and
protrusion of the anus. Infected fish may be lethargic and show areas
of bleeding in the gills and skin. Diseased fish tend to gather at the
water inlet or sides of the pond, swim and breathe more slowly than
normal, and react sluggishly to stimuli. Loss of equilibrium, with
resting and leaning, are seen in the late stages. Concurrent bacterial
infections (carp-dropsy complex) or parasitic infections influence the
symptoms and mortality rate.

It could be koi herpesvirus, since only carp are affected, and carp
are a type of koi. When results from the diagnostic laboratory are
returned, then the exact cause of death of these fish may more likely
be found.

Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a foodfish and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as koi. Almost all countries have reported KHV, which was
first recognized in 1996 in England. However, publications (Pokorova
et al) in 2005 report that Australia does not have the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of the
gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured
fish, inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that
some fish may be carriers.
