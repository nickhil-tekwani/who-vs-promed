Zambia: Save the Cattle Population
-----------------------------------
Cattle are a coveted livestock species among
people in Southern and other provinces in Zambia.
They are used mainly in agriculture upon which
the livelihood of many people depends. The
animals should therefore be protected from
diseases because they are an integral part of the
daily activities of the people that rear them.

Southern Province Permanent Secretary Darius
Hakayobe has rightly pointed out that appropriate
infrastructure should be developed to fight
corridor disease before the ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives can continue with
the cattle restocking exercise. The suspension of
the exercise is the appropriate decision because
it will be an exercise in futility to increase
the number of animals when the disease is rife
and killing animals in large numbers. The
authorities concerned should heed the advice and
embark on putting up dip tanks [to control
_Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_ vector ticks] and
other structures while at the same time
expediting the process of vaccinating the animals.

The Government last year provided K1.7 billion
[USD 299 032.00] for the cattle restocking
exercise in Southern Province. This money would
go to waste if the exercise went ahead without
eradicating the disease, which is wiping out on a consistent basis.

As the permanent secretary noted, specialists
from the ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
should immediately be detailed to redesign the
programme so that it starts with ridding the
province of the corridor disease before
introducing more animals. This will save the cattle population in the province.

In Southern Province, the animals are not only a
natural source of food such as meat and milk, but
are also used in ploughing, planting and
harvesting. The same animals are also used as a
means of transport to ferry agricultural products
from the fields to homesteads and later to
selling points such as Food Reserve Agency (FRA)
depots. Though it may seem far-fetched, the
cattle are also a mode of transport for people
from their villages to various destinations such
as health centres. Thus, it will be disastrous to
go ahead with the restocking exercise without
looking at the root cause of the dwindling cattle population.

Many people in Southern Province are already
negatively affected because of the reduced animal
population. The solution, which is restocking the
species, should be preceded by a protective
mechanism -- disease control. We urge the
ministry of Agriculture and Cooprerative the
provincial and the administration in Southern
Province as well as the farmers' cooperative
movement to confront the problem collectively, and with the right approach.

Communication submitted by
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Susan Baekeland

[We have been seeing for some time now indirect
comments and hints out of Zambia of a severe
problem with this bovine disease in that country.
All enquiries aimed at Lusaka went unanswered.
The above editorial is the 1st hard information
that such a problem does in fact exist in the country.

Corridor disease is an acute and usually fatal
disease of cattle, caused by the protozoa
_Theileria parva lawerencei_, which is
transmitted by brown ear ticks (_Rhipicephalus
appendiculatus_) from buffaloes. The disease is
called corridor disease due to its occurrence in
the corridor region between UmfoloÂ­zi and
Hluhluwe Game Reserves in KwaZulu Natal.

The protozoa parasite is taken in by the larvae
of brown ear tick, which will feed on an infected
buffalo. The larvae will moult and fall off and
climb on a new host. The nymph will moult again,
fall off and the adult will climb on a new host.
The protozoa parasite will die off when the adult
tick dies and can therefore not be transmitted to
the eggs (trans ovarial passage) and infect the
new generation larvae. 2 years after infected
buffalo were removed from the veld, the ticks can
be regarded as free from corridor disease.

The brown ear tick is called a 3-host tick,
because it will feed on 3 different hosts (may be
different animal species) during its life cycle.
The adults occur during the rainy period
(December to March), larvae late summer and cool
period after the rains (March to July) and the
nymphs in winter and early spring (June to
October). The tick occurs in the eastern and
wetter parts of South Africa. Ticks prefer to
attach to the ears of animals. The optimum
control of these ticks are in the summer months.
The aim must be to prevent adult ticks from
laying eggs. Dipping with an ascaricide must be done on a weekly basis.

The clinical signs in cattle appears after an
incubation period of 9-20 days (average 12).
Clinical signs are a rise in temperature,
swelling of lymph nodes, fever, listlessness,
swelling of eyelids, nasal discharge, diarrhoea
and emaciation. A diagnosis can be made by
looking for the parasite in smears of the lymph
nodes using PCR technology to demonstrate the
presence of DNA of the parasite. [ex <http://bigfive.jl.co.za/diseases1.htm>]
