Unidentified disease reported in Viet Nam
--------------------
In mid-April, 70 people in the Vietnamese southern province of Long An were
hospitalized due to an unidentified infectious disease.
The disease, whose symptoms include rash on the face, neck, legs and arms,
and mild fever, has quickly been transmitted from the sufferers to a number
of their relatives, other patients, and healthcare staff in the Long An
Hospital, local newspaper People's Police reported Monday.
The disease may have been caused by a kind of virus, which lives in
insects, the hospital's Vice Director Phan Loi said, adding that the
hospital has sprayed insecticides and closed the windows to prevent insects
from entering rooms.
Local relevant agencies are investigating the right cause of the disease.

[The differential diagnosis of a febrile rash illness is rather
extensive. The above newswire offers conflicting information on the
possibly transmission. The latter portion of the report mentions the
likelihood of its being a vector-borne disease, speculating mosquito as the
vector. The beginning of the report mentions that it has quickly spread
from the patients to their contacts including family and hospital staff,
suggesting there is person-to-person transmission of the etiologic
agent. We do not have information on the age distribution of the cases,
although if hospital staff are involved, adult cases are likely. More
information on this outbreak from authoritative sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
