Ontario's oat growers will need to be "on the alert" this spring
[2009] for crown rust, as fungal infection rates are high this spring
in the other plant species that host the rust spores. Crown rust
depends on European buckthorn as the alternate host, and buckthorn
infection rates are high this spring in many parts of the province,
crop plant pathologist Albert Tenuta said.

The pathogen is not seed or soil-borne, Tenuta said. European
buckthorn is the primary local source of spores, while another source
is blown in from the southern U.S. There are different races of the
crown rust fungus, and like other rusts, they change over time,
Tenuta said. Thus, they can affect a variety's performance over time.

Crown rust, he said, is most problematic when the disease develops
early. Temperatures above 30 C, which stop infection, are expected
soon, but the milder daytime highs (15-25 C) and nighttime lows
(10-20 C), combined with frequent dew and rain in the meantime, have
not helped the situation.

To deter crown rust, the province advises oat growers to seed a
tolerant variety and as early as possible in the season to avoid
late-season infections. Foliar fungicides are effective against the
pathogen but must be applied "in a timely manner" and close to flag
leaf emergence so as to protect the flag leaf, Tenuta said.

[Crown rust of cultivated or wild oats (_Avena_ species) is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia coronata_. While it can infect a number of
grasses, particularly ryegrass, the strains on grasses do not cross
into oats. Rye and barley may be slightly affected by crown rust, but
these strains will also not infect oats. Pustules containing orange
spores are produced on leaves and sheaths, and these are spread by
wind and by mechanical means. The life cycle of _P. coronata_
includes as obligate alternate hosts buckthorn (_Rhamnus
catharticus_) or alder buckthorn (_Frangula alnus_) before it can
infect oats again.

The disease is favored by warm and humid weather and mild winters.
Severe epidemics have been reported with yield losses of up to 40
percent. Disease management may include timely fungicide
applications, cultural methods (for example early planting), use of
resistant oat varieties, and eradication of buckthorn within
approximately 2 km of oat fields.
