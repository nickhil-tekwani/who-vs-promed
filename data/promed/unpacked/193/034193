RABBIT ENTEROCOLITIS, NEW FORM - FRANCE

A new form of rabbit enteritis which recently appeared in Europe has been
observed in France since early 1997.
The disease affects animals during the initial weeks of fattening. A
nutritional cause was first suspected but has since been ruled out as a
major factor. The most likely hypothesis remains that of a viral
infection, with the virus being transported from one farm to another in feed.
Two research teams (at INRA and CNEVA) are proceeding to identify a virus
recently isolated by CNEVA. The above hypothesis is likely to be confirmed
within the next few days.
The pathology, in which intestinal transit is slowed and then blocked,
results in high mortality (40-80%) in young fattening rabbits aged between
five and seven weeks. The disease appears to be highly contagious within
rabbit farms. While it mainly affects young rabbits it may also be
observed in reproductive stock.
The disease spreads rapidly according to the replies from groups of
breeders who responded to an initial survey (i.e. approximately half of the
existing groups, representing around 1,500 farms). Twenty percent of farms
experienced cases of enterocolitis at the end of August compared to 6% one
month before. The results of a survey currently being carried out are
expected in November.
Preventive measures have been implemented to avoid any further spread of
the disease. These include:
restrictions on visits to farms and between farmers;
systematic use of disposable overalls, gloves and boots;
washing of tires of transport vehicles, cages and any
material introduced into the farm;
where appropriate, spreading of lime around the building.

[Enterocolitis in rabbits is usually due to bacteria and coccidia, and is
clinically complicated by the involvement of the liver, thereby producing a
spectrum of signs. To date very few viruses have been indentified with
this condition in rabbits but this reflects more the paucity of research,
not the reality of the condition. As a colleague commented, "Too few
viruses have been found to date." If this virus goes from farm to farm via
the feed, it must be fairly robust. - Mod.MHJ]
