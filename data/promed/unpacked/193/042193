Poplar Island attracts hundreds of species of birds, from shorebirds to waterfowl to birds of prey. But some of them are in trouble. Avian botulism is sickening and killing some of the shorebirds and waterfowl at Poplar, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Services one of the government agencies involved in restoring the Chesapeake Bay island as a wildlife sanctuary.

This summer's [2012] heat waves and lack of rain have allowed avian botulism to thrive on the island, where dredged material is being used to reclaim the island as a wildlife habitat, said Chris Guy, a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife Service's Chesapeake Bay office in Annapolis.

Avian botulism is not harmful to humans but can cause lethargy and dehydration in birds. If left untreated, it can be fatal to birds.

The concern started 2 Aug [2012] when a black-neck stilt, a large black-and-white shorebird, was spotted with signs of avian botulism.

In recent weeks, biologists from the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Maryland Environmental Service have collected nearly 300 sick or dying birds, mostly sandpipers and mallards.

A total of 78 birds have been sent to Tri-State Bird Rescue and Research in Delaware for treatment. The goal is to eventually allow the birds to be released.

Biologists think they caught the outbreak in time to prevent a large-scale loss of birds. "By recognizing warning signs and taking decisive action, we were able to keep the number of birds harmed by this event very low," said Pete McGowan, a biologist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

More than 130 species of birds have been spotted nesting, feeding, or resting at Poplar Island. It has a particularly robust population of cormorants, as well as many egrets, terns, and ducks.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Outbreaks of botulism in wild aquatic birds are a natural phenomenon in North America.
