First Report on the Presence of _Leptosphaeria maculans_ Pathogenicity
Group-3, the Causal Agent of Blackleg of Canola, in Manitoba. WGD Fernando,
Y Chen, Department of Plant Science, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB
R3T 2N2, Canada. Plant Dis 2003; 87: 1268, published online as
D-2003-0808-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 23 Jul 2003.
Blackleg, caused by _Leptosphaeria maculans_ (Desmaz.) Ces. & De Not.
(anamorph = _Phoma lingam_) (Tode:Fr.) Desmaz.), is an economically
important and serious disease of canola (_Brassica napus_ L.) in Australia,
Europe, and Canada.
_L. maculans_ isolates can be categorized into four pathogenicity groups
(PGs) on the basis of the interaction phenotypes (IP) on the differential
canola cvs. Westar, Glacier, and Quinta (1) by using a standard screening
protocol in the greenhouse.
PG1 isolates are weakly virulent, and PG2, PG3, and PG4 isolates are highly
virulent. In Manitoba, [the] _L. maculans_ population consists mainly of
PG2 (virulent on cv. Westar; avirulent on cvs. Glacier and Quinta) and a
few PG1 isolates (avirulent on all three differentials).
The Oilseed Pathology Lab in the Department of Plant Science, University of
Manitoba examines the pathogenic variability of blackleg isolates obtained
from Manitoba each year. In 2002, the blackleg-resistant cv. Q2, was found
to be severely infected in Roland, Manitoba. The canola stubble collected
from a coop trial plot (Roland, Manitoba) and a farm in East Selkirk (60 km
northeast of Winnipeg, Manitoba) was isolated for the blackleg fungus.
Small pieces of stubble were cut from the pseudothecia-forming section and
surface-sterilized with 1 per cent sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 to 5
min and then rinsed in sterile distilled water. V8 agar medium containing 1
per cent streptomycin sulphate was used to culture the isolates under
continuous cool-white fluorescent light for 14 days. Pure cultures of the
pathogen were isolated and characterized as _L. maculans_ by means of
colony morphology, pycnidia, and microscopic observations of pycnidiospores.
Pycnidiospores that formed on V8 plates were flooded with 10 ml of sterile
distilled water and then harvested by filtering through sterilized
Miracloth and kept at -20 deg C. The isolates were passed once through cv.
Westar to maintain their virulence. The PG test was performed with the 3
differential cultivars. 2 additional cultivars, Q2 (resistant to PG2
isolates) and Defender (moderately resistant to PG2 isolates), were
included for comparisons.
12 cotyledons of each differential cultivar (7 days old) grown in Metro Mix
were wound-inoculated with a 10-microliter droplet of pycnidiospore
suspension (10 000 000 pycnidiospores per ml). Inoculated cotyledons were
maintained in the greenhouse (16/21 deg C night/day and a 16-h
photoperiod). The experiment was repeated twice. Disease severity on
cotyledons was assessed 12 days postinoculation by using a 0 to 9 scale (2).
All five isolates from Roland and East Selkirk were highly virulent on
Glacier (6.4 to 7.7), Q2 (7.1 to 8.2), and Defender (7.2 to 8.4), but
intermediately virulent on Quinta (4.5 to 5.4). This clearly indicated that
these isolates were of PG3. Isolates of PG2 have been predominant in
Manitoba for the past 25 years, and highly virulent isolates belonging to
PG3 had not been detected previously.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of PG3 in _L.
maculans_ in Manitoba.

[_Leptosphaeria maculans_ [Lm] causes the most important disease of canola
worldwide, especially prevalent in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and
the United Kingdom). Disease management includes cultural control,
fungicides, and genetic resistance. Weeds and volunteer canola must be
controlled. Pathogen-free seed should be used. Lm survives on stubble, so
fields affected by the pathogen should undergo crop rotation for at least 3
to 4 years, and new plantings should be at least 500 metres from such
fields. Seed treatment with fungicides (benzimidazole, dicarboximide, and
morpholine) results in almost complete elimination of seed transmission of
the pathogen. Resistant cultivars are the most important and sustainable
means of blackleg control, but the choice of cultivars depends upon
availability and the strain of Lm in the production area. - Mod.DH]
