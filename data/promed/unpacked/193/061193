I think some reports on O157 outbreak in Japan are available on the Web page
bellow.
http://www.nih.go.jp/yoken/iasr/index.html
Also the U.S.-Japan conference on Microbiology is going to be held this July
in Japan. I think the main theme of this meeting is on O157.
Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare published a final report on the O157
outbreak in Sakai city, Osaka, but I don't think it has English version. I
think almost all of the report was released to the press. So what you know
is what has been reported in Japan.
