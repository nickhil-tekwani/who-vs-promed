As many as 59 cases of meningitis C have been registered in Tuscany from 2015 to today, authorities said Wednesday [28 Dec 2016] after a Rome elementary-school teacher became the latest victim of the virus [_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal meningitis is a bacterium, not a virus]: 31 last year [2015] and 28 this year [2016].

12 people have died of meningitis, 6 this year and 6 last, they said. To these must be added a death from meningitis B and the death of a patient affected by another strain, pneumococcal meningitis. The greatest incidence of the virus [sic] was in the 20-29-year-old age bracket, followed by the 0-19-year-old [age] bracket. Only in 19 cases the persons affected were more than 40 years of age. But the average age of those who died was 52 [years].

Tuscany has seen more meningitis deaths than any other Italian region.

The most alarming case is that of a 22-month-old child from Porcari, province of Lucca, Tuscany, who died while being transferred to the Meyer Children's Hospital of Florence where the causal agent was identified as _Neisseria meningitidis_, type C, strain st11. The child had not been vaccinated against meningococcus, notwithstanding the reiterated offers to do so, in the course of the campaign launched by the Tuscan health service in an effort to curb the morbidity by the hypervirulent strain which, since 2015, has already caused 60 cases in a limited part of the region, with 7 deaths.

Two other fatal cases occurred in the province of Naples, Campania: an 18-year-old in Agerola and a 46-year-old in Naples. The news reported that _N. meningitidis_ was involved in the youngster.

A further, unrelated case of meningitis has been reported in a 34-year-old Peruvian woman residing in Chiavari, province of Genova, Liguria, presently in critical condition at the San Martino hospital of Genoa.

In the past week, the death from meningitis at the Gemelli hospital of Rome, of a primary school teacher, had activated the protocol for the tracing and prophylaxis of the contacts, which was stopped after the agent involved was identified as _Escherichia coli_.
