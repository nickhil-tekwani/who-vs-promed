Kenya Key Message Update, July 2018
-----------------------------------
By early July [2018], an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF), which affects both humans and livestock, was contained in Wajir and significantly reduced in parts of Mandera, but it is still ongoing in Mandera South, Marsabit (Moyale, North Horr, Saku, and parts of Laisamis sub-counties), and Isiolo (Sericho, Merti, and Oldonyiro wards).

All livestock markets and slaughter houses in the affected areas remain closed in an effort to stop the spread of the disease, constraining a major source of pastoralists' income. Widespread vaccination efforts continue, and alerts have been issued in neighboring counties.

However, according to Kenya's official reports to the OIE (last updated Mon 16 Jul 2018), the disease has also caused clinical cases in animals in the provinces of Siaya (cattle, sheep, goats), Mandera (a mixed sheep-goats holding), and Meru (cattle).
