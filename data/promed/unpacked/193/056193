You wouldn't really expect a water guy to agree with a vet would you,
especially a vet from cattle country! In reality, I do accept what you say
and I don't think that we are disagreeing on the main points. Perhaps I have
been a little parochial in my perspective and have allowed my local
experience to dominate my thoughts.
In the area served by my utility (the North West of England including the
cities of Manchester and Liverpool) the dominant type of agriculture is
cattle and sheep grazing and we are not so land rich that we can afford to
exclude such activities from our catchments (watersheds, I believe is the
term used in the US). We serve almost 7 million people and look at just over
a thousand environmental samples for Cryptosporidium (and Giardia) each
year. Of the treated water samples, or raw water samples taken at sites
where we believe the current treatment is inadequate to ensure removal of
oocysts, around 5% are positive. This usually means detection of just one
oocyst in a 10 litre sample using flat membranes and flow cytometry, but
occasionally we have detected up to 5 oocysts. Raw (untreated) water samples
taken from some of our river sources have a higher rate for positive
detections (up to 75%) and the concentrations detected are significantly
higher (up to 25 oocysts in the same 10 litre grab samples).
>>"Many members of communities, even in our developed countries, are loath
to seek medical attention unless they are on death's doorstep.
Secondly, it has been my observation that in many communities ... that some
physicians are unaware of the clinical signs and symptoms and seem to
believe that if there is no
animal exposure, then there is not a risk, and the resulting clinical
situation is therefore some virus."<<
Crypto is in most (?) cases unpleasant enough to send people in the UK off
to the GP (no charge at point of service delivery) and although the
screening policy does vary from lab to lab there is a significant amount of
routine stool examination for crypto from patients presenting with diarrhoea
in my area (and indeed the UK as a whole).
>>"Furthermore, in some cases cities are reluctant to report that their
drinking water may be at fault. <<
While some water utilities may not be too happy to see their systems
associated with community outbreaks, the reporting of such events in our
country is not in their control. The water industry in England and Wales was
placed into the hands of regional water authorities in 1974 and then
privatised in 1989. A central government team of expert regulators, the
Drinking Water Inspectorate, was set up at that time and given wide ranging
audit and enforcement powers to ensure drinking water quality. Local city
and district councils cooperate with district health authorities to
investigate outbreaks of disease in the community and are not connected with
water companies in any way, though we do like to think that we act as
willing collaborators in their investigations.
For all of this, I do readily accept that what we see reported is only the
tip of the iceberg, just like with foodborne and gastrointestinal illness
generally. My point was that the same system of gastrointestinal illness
reporting that sees in England and Wales more than 40,000 cases of
Campylobacter enteritis, 30,000 cases of Salmonellosis, 14,000 cases of
small round structured virus infection, 5,000 cases of giardiasis etc is
still often not picking up even small numbers of cases of crypto in
communities served by water systems with recorded spikes of oocyst laden
water passing into supply. This makes it even more difficult to translate
the predictions of mathematical and even experimental models into real world
risk assessments.
