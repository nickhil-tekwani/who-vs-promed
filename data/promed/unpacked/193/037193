Health authorities have declared an "epidemiological emergency" in southern
Chile after 21 people were hospitalized with trichinosis, an illness caused
by eating undercooked meat contaminated with the parasite _Trichinella_ spp.
According to the medical report released Monday, the 21 people had been
admitted to the Herminda Martin de Chillan hospital, some 403 kilometers
(250 miles) south of Santiago, where their condition was listed as
non-life-threatening.
Health authorities have advised anyone who has eaten pork that may be
contaminated to go immediately to a hospital to be examined. The meat was
believed to have been sold during the national holidays, Sept. 18-19.
The medical report said 150 blood tests have been run so far to find a
possible source of contagion of the _Trichinella spiralis_ parasite, the
cause of the illness. By law, all health emergencies in Chile must remain
in force for at least 10 days.

[Trichinellosis is a parasitic disease of public health importance caused
by the nematode (worm) _Trichinella spiralis_. Human infections are
established by consumption of inadequately cooked infected meat, usually
pork or bear, although other species have been implicated. Natural
infections occur in wild carnivores; trichinellosis has been found in
horses, rats, beavers, opossums, walruses, whales and meat-eating birds.
Most mammals are susceptible. - Mod.TG
