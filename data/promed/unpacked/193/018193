The Central District Health Department has issued a warning for a bacterial illness outbreak in Grand Island. Since March 2014, more than 118 residents have been diagnosed with shigellosis, which is a bacterial infection that affects the intestines. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps. A severe infection with high fever may be associated with seizures in children younger than 2 years old. Dehydration may also occur, especially in warm weather. Some of those who are infected may show no symptoms at all but can still pass the shigella bacteria to others. The illness usually resolves in 5 to 7 days and rarely requires hospitalization. It can be treated through antibiotic therapy, reducing both the severity of the symptoms and the risk for spreading the illness.

_Shigella_ is spread from one infected person to another in several ways. It is present in the diarrhea stools of the infected person and can be passed along when changing diapers or assisting toddlers with potty training. Family members, caregivers and playmates of sick children are at high risk of becoming ill. Failure to wash hands often and well also increases the risk of the spread of shigella bacteria.

Swimming in public pools while ill can also result in the spread of the disease.

To prevent the spread of _Shigella_, take these precautions:
- Wash hands often and well and help young children with their hand washing.
- Store diapers in a closed-lid garbage can and wash hands immediately after changing.
- Wipe diaper changing areas with a disinfectant such as diluted household bleach, Lysol or bactericidal wipes.
- Seek medical attention for diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps.
- When possible, isolate a sick child from other children to prevent the spread of the illness.
- Do not send a sick child to day care, and do not allow sick children to swim in public pools.

[Shigellosis] causes fever, diarrhea and even vomiting. It's a disease on the rise in Marion County. It's most commonly found in children, and leaders with the Marion County Health Department want you to know how to prevent the spread of shigellosis.

"We are seeing this in young children here in Marion County as of today we have 175 confirmed cases," said Melissa McMasters, Marion County Health Department. That number is up from just 34 in 2013. It spreads when people do a poor job of washing their hands after using the bathroom.

Stopping the spread of germs is a full-time job for nursery school teacher Nina Woodbury. "After they get their diapers changed or go to the potty- all day long they are washing their hands," said Woodbury.

Woodbury says she knows how quickly germs spread amongst children, which is why she is adamant on proper hygiene. "As much as we emphasize the safe hand washing and all of those things children at this age still explore everything with their mouth," she said.

McMasters says public pools are also a breeding ground for the disease to spread. "We mention pools because obviously if a child is sick and has diarrhea they don't belong in a pool," said McMasters.

More and more Coastal Bend residents have been coming down with cases of a stomach ailment called shigellosis, and county health officials say the number of reported cases is significant. The Nueces County Health Department said that, in a normal year, they would have had 68 cases reported by this time; but the number so far in 2014 is up to 154. That number could be seriously underreported because many people, especially adults, tend to tough out the illness, which generally lasts less than a week.

The disease is harder on children, and the number of cases being treated at Driscoll Children's Hospital has reached 180. City-County Health Director William Burgin said even a fly landing on a child's hand can spread the illness. "If you have diarrhea, stay home. Don't go to work. Don't spread it around," Burgin said. "And if you have high fever and you think you've got a bad case of shigellosis, please see your doctor. He can give you medication that will make the illness much shorter."

St. Louis area health officials are urging caution about a contagious infection that is causing illnesses at day care centers. KMOV-TV reports that cases of shigellosis are way up. 55 cases have been reported in the city and 71 in St. Louis County.

Shigellosis is a bacterial infection commonly spread by poor hygiene. It can cause diarrhea that lasts five to seven days.

Dr Faisal Khan of the St Louis County Health Department says shigellosis is typically spread by people who don't wash their hands after changing a diaper or who fail to clean diaper stations adequately.

[From the US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Bad Bug Book http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

Shigellosis accounts for less than 10 percent of the reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in this country. _Shigella_ rarely occurs in animals; principally, it is a disease of humans except for other primates such as monkeys and chimpanzees. The organism is frequently found in water polluted with human feces. The infective dose is as few as 10 cells depending on age and condition of host. The _Shigella_ spp. are highly infectious agents that are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.

Associated foods include salads (potato, tuna, shrimp, macaroni, and chicken), raw vegetables, milk and dairy products, and poultry. Contamination of these foods is usually through the fecal-oral route. Fecally contaminated water and unsanitary handling by food handlers are the most common causes of contamination.

Clearly, unlike foodborne infections in humans due to _Salmonella_ (except for typhoid fever), _E. coli_ O157, and _Campylobacter_, shigellosis is associated with food contaminated by human, not animal, feces. - Mod.LL]
