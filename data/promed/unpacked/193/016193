A new threat to public health haunts the state of Rio de Janeiro: Scientists at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) have discovered that a virus with symptoms similar to those of the chikungunya virus [infection] may precipitate an epidemic in the Southeast.

Both have similar characteristics, such as disabling intense joint pains that last for months. There is no vaccine or any specific treatment.

Laboratory tests have shown that the Mayaro virus can be transmitted by both the _Aedes_ mosquito and the common mosquito (_Culex_). According to Amilcar Tanuri, coordinator of the Laboratory of Molecular Virology at UFRJ, where the study was carried out, this increases the risk of an epidemic.

Mistaken for chikungunya [virus], Mayaro [virus] has been present in Rio since 2016. Additionally, the gravity of the discovery lies in the fact that the cases are autochthonous, meaning the victims were infected here, rather than in other locations. To date, 3 cases are known, all from Niteroi.

[Mayaro virus (MAYV) has been found to cause human disease in other areas in Brazil. This is the 1st report of Mayaro virus infection in Rio de Janeiro state that ProMED-mail has posted. The 1st report of Mayaro virus cases was in 1955, in an outbreak in Para state, Brazil. In 2011, thousands of cases of Mayaro fever were reported an outbreak occurred in Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.

As Mod.JT noted in an early ProMED-mail post, MAYV, of the _Alphavirus_ genus, Togaviridae family, is endemic in tropical areas of South America (Trinidad, Suriname, French Guyana, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and Venezuela). The transmission cycle is very similar to yellow fever virus, utilizing primates as reservoirs and _Haemagogus_ mosquitoes as vectors.

MAYV has been associated with a variety of mosquitoes that are possible vectors that can transmit it humans. MAYV has been isolated from _Aedes aegypti_ and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ captured in the field in Brazil. _Anopheles_ mosquitoes have been implicated as important virus vectors (see references below).

Several public health experts have expressed concern that MAYV could become a significant problem in the tropical Americas. - Mod.TY
