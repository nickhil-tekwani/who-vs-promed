A meningitis epidemic has killed 109 people in the north eastern
Brazilian state of Bahia since the start of the year, according to a
report released by local authorities on Friday [9 Dec 2011]. A total
of 1670 people have been hit by bacterial meningitis, the most serious
form of the disease, officials said.

The mortality rate for cerebrospinal meningitis, characterized by an
inflammation of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord, is around
eight to 10 per cent of cases.

In the tourist resort of Costa do Sauipe, dozens of tourists have
canceled their bookings as a result of the epidemic, hotel staff told
the media.
