Dengue in Kandy
----------------
The dengue epidemic has surfaced again with nearly 64 suspected cases
reported from the Kandy area during the last few weeks.
Health sources said out of the total suspected cases, 2 had succumbed to
dengue [died?] from the Yatinuwara and Gangawata-Korale.
An epidemiologist said although the situation has now been brought under
control in the Kandy area, the number of cases might increase if the rains
continue. There is an increase of dengue cases in July and September every
year, but the spread of dengue had declined by 30 percent during the last year.
The highest number of dengue cases has been reported from the Western
province, with the Colombo district at the top of the list.
The Gampaha district ranks second with most of the cases reported from
Katana, Negombo, Wattala, Mahara, and Gampaha town. Matara district has
also recorded a considerable number of cases.
Meanwhile, the Colombo Municipal Council Medical Unit has launched a house
to house inspection campaign. This action programme seeks to clean up the
City and destroy mosquito breeding places.
Already, 512 city households have been issued notices by Municipal Health
authorities for ignoring health standards. These households are required to
clean up within one week, failing which they will be prosecuted. "If the
intermittent rains continues further, the situation would lead to an
outbreak of dengue in the Municipal area and cases will increase," a
Municipal official added.

6 people have lost their lives because of dengue, [and] some 20 cases
of confirmed dengue have been reported in the city. However, many cases go
unreported, say doctors.
Doctors say the worst is not yet over. The current climatic conditions
favour the breeding of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the bite of which
[transmits] dengue. The conditions would change when winter sets in, [in
November], they say.
At Sterling Hospital, 7 patients suffering from dengue have been admitted
over last 10 days and 2 deaths have been reported. ''This year [2003] the
number of dengue cases is more [than] last year. The reason why the number
of patients is not as large as in Delhi and other places is that this
might be just the beginning of an epidemic here. The cases are certainly on
the rise,'' says Dr Bharat Ghadhavi, hospital's medical superintendent.
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) medical officer (health) Dr P K
Makwana says that about 17 cases have been recently reported at AMC
hospitals. "4 people have died of the fever, but none could be confirmed,
and all of them belonged to different areas. Those who died included a
2-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. However, one cannot deny that dengue
cases are on the rise and that there are a number of cases which go
unnoticed," he says.
Officials point out that the rise in the number of the dengue cases is due
to the favourable climatic conditions for the breeding of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes. ''It has rained quite well this season and accumulation of
rainwater across the city is quite common. The mosquitoes, which bite only
during the day, breed in the warm weather in the artificial collection of
clean water, and the current climatic conditions are quite favourable for
their breeding. The breeding is bound to continue till November; after
winter sets in, it will be naturally controlled,'' says Makwana.

80 dead, 4720 infected as India braces for severe dengue fever
--------------------------------------------------
Indian health authorities predicted a deadly wave of dengue fever, saying
80 people had died of the mosquito-borne disease in the past 3 months.
A National Anti Malaria Programme (NAMP) coordinator warned Thursday that
infections could rise because heavy monsoon rains have left stagnant pools
of water, which are breeding grounds for mosquitoes in overcrowded Indian
housing estates.
"At least 4720 cases of infection have been reported from 15 states, while
78 people have died of dengue up until 6 Oct 2003," said the NAMP official
who did not want to be identified.
Gujarat
---------
Another 2 people died of the disease Thursday in the western Indian state
of Gujarat taking the death toll to 80. "2 of my male patients died of
dengue. There are 7 other patients in my hospital being treated for the
same disease," said doctor Bharat Ghadvi at Gujarat's Sterling Hospital.
India this year [2003] had one of the wettest monsoons in 25 years, and
although the bountiful rains are expected to boost the agriculture-based
economy, they have caused floods and led to a spate of mosquito-borne
disease like malaria and dengue.
Kerala
--------
Dengue has reached alarming proportions in southern India, with the state
of Kerala recording 3155 cases of infection and 63 deaths, said the NAMP.
Karnataka
----------
Neighbouring Karnataka state has reported 6 deaths and 816 infections.
"There has been a lot of mixed infection such as dengue, typhoid, and
malaria," said Sudha Dinnakar, a doctor in Lakeside Hospital, in Bangalore,
the capital of Karnataka.
New Delhi
------------
New Delhi, home to 14 million people, has reported 568 cases of dengue
fever in recent months, with the disease claiming one life this week. The
Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has issued 15 541 notices this year
[2003] to owners with unclean residences and prosecuted 5114 cases as part
of a drive against dengue fever and malaria, deputy director B.K. Hazarika
said. Even Indian Law Minister Arun Jaitley and film superstar Amitabh
Bachchan were fined for having residences that could spread mosquito-borne
diseases.
