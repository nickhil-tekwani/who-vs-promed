Deadly virus kills half of France's oysters
-------------------------------------------
A deadly virus has managed to kill half of France's oysters this year.
Oyster production has dropped by 30 percent because of a very
aggressive form of herpes. The virus, _Ostreid Herpesvirus 1_, or
OsHV-1, has been attacking shellfish farms for the past 3 seasons with
mortality rates of 27 percent to 90 percent on France's Mediterranean
and Atlantic coasts, according to a Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries alert this week.

France's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries believes the country
will be able to restock its supply of Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea
gigas_) within 4 or 5 years.

French Minister of Food, Agriculture and Fishing, Bruno Le Maire is
hoping genetic selection will work to make the Pacific oysters' shells
resistant to the disease that has been decimating populations since
2008. Scientists from the French Research Institute for Exploration of
the Sea (IFREMER) and other researchers have been selecting specific
genetic strains to produce more robust and disease-resistant oysters.
The results have not been impressive, however.

"We were able to reduce the mortality of young oysters, which was 70
percent in some places," said the Directorate of Fisheries. Maryline
Maingam, a spokesperson for the country's National Shellfish
Committee, explained that French production of oysters dropped 38
percent in 2010 to 80 000 tonnes as a result of a herpes outbreak.

OsHV-1 begins killing oysters once water temperatures rise above
around 16 deg C (61 deg F).

[Since 13 Apr 2010, France notified the OIE about 21 outbreaks of
OsHV-1 along its Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. All reports and an
interactive map are available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9179.
The most recent follow-up report, with information on 17 new
outbreaks, was submitted on 25 Jul 2011. It included the following
statement:

"The event is unlikely to be contained and is now considered to be
endemic. No more follow-up reports will be made, but instead,
information about this disease will be included in the future
6-monthly reports." - Mod.AS]
