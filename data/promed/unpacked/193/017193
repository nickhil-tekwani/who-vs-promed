[The ProMED-mail post of Thu 8 Oct 2007, titled "Avian influenza,
human (148): Viet Nam, susp. RFI 20071108.3625," incorrectly
reported that a South Korean patient had died in Viet Nam as a result
of suspected avian influenza virus infection and that his father in
Korea was also ill. As indicated in the original article reproduced
below, the man and his father were both from Taiwan. ProMED-mail
apologizes for the error to the News agency and to Mary Marshall who
communicated the report. - Mod.CP]

Taiwanese dies of suspected bird flu in southern Viet Nam
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Taiwanese man died of pneumonia in Can Tho city Monday [5 Nov
2007], local doctors, who suspect he had contracted bird flu, said.
The man was taken to the city General Hospital at 3:00 am Monday with
high fever and breathing problems. He died at 2:00 pm.

The doctors have sent his blood samples to Pasteur Institute in Ho
Chi MinhCity to test for the H5N1 strain of bird flu virus, which has
caused 100 infections and 46 deaths in Viet Nam in the last few years.

The man's family said his father in Taiwan too was suffering from
pneumonia-like symptoms.
