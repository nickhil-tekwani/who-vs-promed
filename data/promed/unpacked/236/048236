[3] England (Sussex): case increase
Date: Sun 23 Oct 2022 08:29 BST
Source: Sussex Live [edited]

Sussex has continued to record a rise in confirmed cases of monkeypox despite a national trend which shows the spread of the disease slowing, the latest data has revealed. It comes as the county recorded 130 known cases as of 11 Oct 2022.

This is up from a total of 123 on 14 Sep 2022 and an increase of 26 from the 104 cases recorded on 9 Aug 2022. The majority of the cases in Sussex were recorded in Brighton and Hove at 88, while West Sussex also counted 30 and East Sussex a further 12.

There are now [as of 23 Oct 2022] known to be 3499 monkeypox cases across England, with 19 new ones detected in the week to 11 Oct 2022. This is down from the increase of 49 between 20 and 27 Sep 2022.

Despite a low number of incidents the Government has still faced criticism from a leading sexual health charity for its response to the outbreak. The HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust (THT) claimed it had withdrawn from meetings with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) due to "appropriate actions not being taken and the lacklustre monkeypox communication strategy."

The charity has since called for a "sustained, multi-channel campaign targeting gay and bisexual men" to ensure people are aware of the risks and how to spot signs of infection. Head of Policy at THT Ceri Smith said: "We've seen a drop in monkeypox cases in recent weeks, but now is not a time for complacency.

"At present, vaccines are available to those most at risk of monkeypox -- but this supply is finite and we cannot simply say to gay and bisexual men that they're on their own once we're out of vaccines." They added: "There is also a lack of clarity amongst gay and bisexual men about vaccine availability, with many outside of London struggling to find an appointment."

UKHSA incident director Dr Will Morton said: "The UK was the 1st to detect the international outbreak of monkeypox and we purchased 150 000 vaccine doses early to help protect the public." He continued: "With thanks to Terrence Higgins Trust and other LGBTQ+ and sexual health partners there is very high awareness of the disease, its symptoms, and how to seek help and prevent transmission among those at higher risk."
