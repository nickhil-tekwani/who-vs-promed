Viral hepatitis has started to spread among tens of displaced people in Zogra camp near Jarabulus city (125 km or 78 miles north of Aleppo) at the Syrian-Turkish border, which accommodates people displaced from Homs.

A medical source told Smart News on [Thu 19 Oct 2017] that jaundice or viral hepatitis has begun to spread among the displaced people aged 10 to 40 years in the camp. Around 100 cases of the disease have been identified in addition to almost the same number of suspected cases. It is expected that the cause of infection is water pollution, potential contamination of the distributed food or vegetables, and not washing them properly.

The source warned of the spread of infection among a larger number of people if preventive measures are not taken through awareness campaigns and maintenance of sewage networks as soon as possible.

The 10 200 persons living in the camp have previously complained of lack of food and health assistance and lack of water and electricity.

[Serological information confirming the cause of these illnesses is needed. Both the hepatitis A and E viruses are waterborne and can occur in outbreaks. In areas of poor public health infrastructure where waterborne infections are common, if outbreaks of viral hepatitis occur in adults, it is likely that the culprit is the hepatitis E virus. This is the case since, in many countries, the seroprevalence rate of hepatitis A is close to 100 percent by the age of 10. - Mod.LL
