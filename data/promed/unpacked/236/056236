In response to: Rabies - Indonesia (09): (Bali) 20110404.1043
-------------------------------------------------------------
For your information, we all do know we must continue to run the
vaccination program and the plan is to start again as soon as possible
by 1 May 2011 at the latest, again island-wide. We will booster all
previously vaccinated dogs (with the exception of those we are
positive were vaccinated in the previous month) and vaccinate all
newcomers into the dog population here. We also vaccinate all pet
macaques we come across and cats that have owners and can hold them.

We don't have the capacity to vaccinate all "outdoor" cats, and as
you mention [see statement by Merritt Clifton below] don't need to
focus on them. We have had several cats test positive for rabies, and
one cat had bitten the family it lives with so they had to receive
post-exposure [prophylaxis] and we continue to educate the community
in regards to post-exposure.

A comment on the above: Rabies and reservoir species
----------------------------------------------------
For a wild rabies reservoir to exist, it is necessary to have a
substantial population of wild animals of a species which has evolved
the capacity to become a rabies host -- in other words, a species
among which there is a specific rabies strain, adapted to attack the
animals slowly enough that they have time to infect many others.
Animals of species other than those which host specific rabies strains
seldom have a long enough rabies incubation period to spread rabies
far before they die.

Thus, though any mammal can become infected by rabies and die from
it, only a very small number of species form wild rabies reservoirs.
Among these are feral domestic dogs, skunks, raccoons, foxes, and many
species of bat.

Bali has many street dogs, which are mostly semi-tame "community
dogs," used to receiving handout food from humans and to the presence
of humans, even if they cannot be petted. These dogs are part of the
Bali Animal Welfare Association vaccination program, funded by the
World Society for the Protection of Animals, and their population is
counted in the BAWA and WSPA counts of dogs already vaccinated and
dogs yet to be vaccinated. In other words, they are part of the target
70 per cent which must be vaccinated to stop the spread of rabies, and
the target of 80 per cent-plus that BAWA is aiming for, to eliminate
any margin of error.

Bali does not have skunks, raccoons, foxes, or endemic species of
wild dog. Bali has bats, but the bat strain of rabies is rarely
incubated and transmitted by domestic dogs, and in any event the Bali
bat population is not known to be a rabies vector (although any bat
bite should be taken very seriously, especially since bats in that
region may transmit Nipah virus or other lyssaviruses.)

Bali has many cats, both feral and domestic, and many monkeys. Cats
and monkeys can both get and transmit rabies, but as there is not a
cat-specific or monkey-specific rabies strain, they are rarely vectors
for spreading rabies far beyond themselves. Usually when cats spread
rabies, it is within a single litter, or multiple litters which have
been housed together, and usually all of them die rather rapidly. Of
course anyone who has handled rabid kittens and has been bitten or
licked (especially on an open wound) should receive post-exposure
rabies vaccination as a precaution; but as numerous as cats are,
around the world, I am aware of only a handful of cases of confirmed
human infection via cats.

I am not aware of any confirmed cases of human infection via monkeys.
Again, though, a person who has been bitten by a suspected rabid
monkey should receive prompt post-exposure vaccination. At the same
time, if there is no reason to believe a monkey is rabid, I would be
much more concerned about the possibility of contracting some of the
other 90-odd human diseases known to be capable of transmission from
monkeys to humans. The severity of the bite itself being equal, a
monkey bite is vastly more likely to compromise human health than a
dog bite.

Dogs have evolved the ability to live among humans while posing
minimal routine risk; no monkey species has ever preferentially lived
among humans, with the possible exception of urbanized macaques within
just the past few decades, not nearly long enough to evolve out of the
risk of transmitting most potentially deadly diseases as part of the
price of becoming accepted as close neighbors.

Rats are also a species of concern on Bali, as a potential disease
vector; but because rats and other rodents have very little resistance
to rabies infection, they almost always die before infecting any other
animals. The major health issues pertaining to rats on Bali pertain to
diseases which may be transmitted by rat parasites, such as
leptospirosis -- and it is of note that dogs, on Bali as elsewhere
around the world, are a major brake on rat infestations of human
dwellings.
