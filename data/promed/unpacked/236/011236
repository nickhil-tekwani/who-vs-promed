Risk of introducing new variant influenza A (H1N1) to the UK pig population
- update
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[This revised update of the assessment has been issued after the reporting,
on 2 May 2009, of a "novel A (H1N1) influenza"'-infected pig farm in
Alberta, Canada. The previous DEFRA assessment, issued on 27 Apr 2009, was
covered in ProMED-mail posting 20090428.1604. -Mod.AS]

Introduction
------------
Canada has reported an outbreak of new variant influenza A (H1N1) in a
farrowing/fattening pig herd in Alberta, Canada. This is the 1st known case
of this strain of virus being reported in a pig population. Introduction of
the disease was attributed to a human who travelled to Mexico and returned
to Canada on 12 Apr 2009. Clinical signs were observed in 450 out of over
2000 pigs. 19 out of 24 samples were positive for the influenza A matrix
gene and 15/24 for the H1 gene. Partial sequencing indicated 100 per cent
identity of the matrix gene and 99-100 per cent identity of the H1 gene
with sequences from virus isolates from humans in USA and Mexico.

The new variant influenza A (H1N1), which has been circulating in humans in
various countries in North America since mid-March 2009, has now spread
further afield to Europe (including the UK), South America, Asia, the
Middle East, and Australasia [as of 12 May 2009, 30 countries in 4
continents have officially reported influenza A(H1N1) infection in humans.
- Mod.AS]

The disease continues to be primarily a human-to-human transmissible
infection and generally causes mild disease in infected people, although
fatalities have been recorded in North America.

Situation assessment
--------------------
Investigations conducted by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and
Veterinary Authorities have concluded that this is an isolated incident of
human to pig transmission by a farm worker returning from holiday in
Mexico. The worker returned from Mexico on 12 Apr [2009], and then
developed flu-like symptoms. He returned to work on 14 Apr and between
14-29 Apr the worker, pig producer, and producer's family all showed
symptoms. By 24 Apr the worker had recovered and he tested negative for the
flu virus. After this date, the pigs exhibited signs of inappetence, fever,
and respiratory signs. The affected animals have recovered and there was no
mortality that could be directly attributed to influenza infection. The
premises is under quarantine. Further diagnostic testing is underway.

EU Rules allow the export of live pigs and pig meat or pig products from
Canada to the EU. According to TRACES, the European Electronic Trade
Notification System, there have been no consignments of live pigs from
Canada in the last 2 months. Transmission of influenza in pigs is via
inhalation of aerosols. Whilst it is true that some influenza viruses have
the capacity to enter the bloodstream and therefore meat and other tissues,
this has not been seen following natural infection in swine with influenza
viruses. Infection in swine does not produce viraemia and the virus is not
found outside the respiratory tract and associated lymph nodes (AQIS,
1999). Therefore, it would be highly unlikely that influenza viruses could
be transmitted in pork or pork products or pig semen [see commentary. -
Mod.AS].

The European Commission has released a statement acknowledging the timely
and appropriate measures that the Canadian authorities have taken. In the
light of this information, the EC has not changed the rules on the trade of
pigs or pig products from Canada. This is also in line with recommendations
from the OIE.

Surveillance for influenza in pig herds in GB and elsewhere in the EU has
been carried out since 1991. Results suggest that although swine influenza
of all strains remains a low level disease with occasional epizootics of
new strains, this new variant of H1N1 does not appear to be present in pigs
in the UK or EU.

There is still considerable uncertainty as to the true situation in pigs in
affected areas. More information will be available from a current OIE FAO
mission to Mexico and meanwhile we will continue to work with international
organisations to understand whether there is any increased risk to pigs in
the UK and whether any action to restrict trade would be appropriate.

Further studies on the epidemiology of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
are required and to this end, the European Commission is giving financial
support to the Avian Influenza Community Reference Laboratory at VLA,
Weybridge, UK.

Conclusions
-----------
We continue to consider that there would be a negligible likelihood of
introducing new variant influenza A (H1N1) to the UK by the legal import of
pigs or pig products from Canada. The current EU trade rules for live pigs
and pig products are considered appropriate to mitigate the risk of disease
introduction.

Another possible route for disease introduction into pig herds in the UK
would be through direct or indirect contact of an infected person with a
pig farm or workers on a pig farm. Livestock workers recently returning
from an affected country and/or showing symptoms of an infectious disease
should not have contact with pigs or pig farms. This advice applies to many
diseases in common with humans and pigs, not just influenza.

The UK Pig Veterinary Society and the European Commission have advised that
pig keepers should strengthen on-farm biosecurity measures to safeguard
their own livestock.

There remains no requirement to alter current trade rules for pigs or pig
products from Canada.

We will continue to review the situation.

[The above cited reference "AQIS (1999)" includes article 2.3.17 "Swine
influenza virus". Under "Transmission via semen" (page 30), it says:
"Transmission of swine influenza is via inhalation of aerosols. Swine
influenza virus does not produce viraemia. The virus is not found outside
the respiratory tract and associated lymph nodes (1). The virus has not
been recovered from semen. Hare (2) notes that this virus could be present
in semen but the disease probably would not be transmitted through
artificial insemination.

Though animal influenza viruses do occasionally cause viraemia (such as
HPAI H5N1 in cats; see Giese, Harder, Teifke, et al. The role of T cells in
avian influenza H5N1 infected cats. Veterinary Immunology and
Immunopathology 2009; 128: 343), it appears that viraemia generally does
not occur in cases of (classical) swine influenza. The results of the
further experimental studies on the epidemiology of the novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus in various animal species, reportedly to be performed soon by
the Avian Influenza Community Reference Laboratory at VLA, Weybridge, UK
together with other European laboratories, are anticipated with great
interest. It is to be hoped that these studies will address also the
viraemia issue, relevant to the safety of pork. - Mod.AS]
