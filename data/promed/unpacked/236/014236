Health officials in Cotabato province have sent a team to help the municipal health office of Pikit town to contain the rising number of typhoid fever cases in one of its remote villages. As of Tuesday [4 Jan 2022], the North Cotabato Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) said at least 30 persons have been hospitalized for typhoid fever that hit the village of Manaulanan.

In a statement, Dr. Eva Rabaya, Cotabato provincial health officer, said the 30 patients were all residents of the village that have taken unsafe drinking water since the last week of December [2021]. Manaulanan is a remote village with no potable drinking water. Residents rely on commercially available mineral drinking water in gallons or bottles, but the indigents take drinking water from water pumps and open wells.

"No one was reported to have died among the patients," Rabaya said in a radio interview Tuesday [4 Jan 2022]. Quoting a report from the Pikit municipal health office, she said the possible cause of the typhoid fever was the contaminated drinking water that people sourced from open wells and water pumps in the area.

"Many of the patients were children who are now in various hospitals in Pikit," Rabaya said, adding that members of the IPHO sent to the village have brought with them medicine and water purification tablets to help prevent the spread of waterborne diseases.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the more common kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City, Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the See Also section below).

Cotabato, officially the Province of Cotabato and formerly but still colloquially known as North Cotabato, is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Soccsksargen region in Mindanao. - Mod.LL
