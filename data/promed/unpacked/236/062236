EHV-I confirmed in horses at Maryland farm
------------------------------------------
The neurologic form of equine herpesvirus type-1 (EHV-1) has been confirmed
as the cause of disease in 2 Maryland horses infected during a deadly
outbreak this spring. 12 horses exhibited signs of neurologic illness in
the outbreak at a single Montgomery County farm, and 5 of them died. While
the virus has not been confirmed in the other 10 horses, EHV-1 is suspected.
Dr. Amy Polkes, one of the veterinarians involved in the case, said it took
several weeks of extensive testing at multiple laboratories to make the
confirmation, which was announced 8 Jul 2004. The confirmations were made
using samples from a deceased horse and one that survived.
The 1st signs of illness were detected in March 2004, and the Maryland
Department of Agriculture put the farm under quarantine. Veterinarians are
confident that the disease was contained, and the quarantine was lifted on
22 Jun 2004, after 5 weeks had passed with no additional cases of
neurologic disease.
Polkes said no one is sure how EHV-1 was introduced to the farm, which
houses mainly polo horses. "It's one of those contagious diseases that is
usually seen as the respiratory form, and there's no way that we could
track it back to exactly how these horses got it," she said.
"This has been a very interesting and frustrating presentation of equine
herpesvirus," Polkes said. "Clinical signs ranged from mild hind limb
ataxia, to acute recumbency and coma, to cranial nerve signs. While this
covers the gamut of possibilities for EHV-1 neurologic clinical signs, it's
just unusual to have such a wide range."
"Not one of these horses had any bladder paresis (which often causes urine
dribbling in affected horses), and the diagnostic testing was not all
consistent in several aspects. You would hope that you might have gotten
more positive test results out of that number of horses."
Veterinarians don't have molecular information on the EHV-1 strain, so they
can't yet compare this strain to others from recent EHV-1 neurologic
outbreaks in the United States.
