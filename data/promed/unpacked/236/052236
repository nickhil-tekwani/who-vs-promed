MAST, the food and veterinary authority, is investigating credible evidence of _Brucella canis_ [_B. canis_] bacterial infection in a dog in Iceland. The bacteria can be passed on to humans, though this is rare. Children, pregnant women, and those with suppressed immune systems are most at risk of illness. It is the 1st time that _Brucella canis_ is suspected in Iceland.

"Yes, it is a strong suspicion, but still a suspicion, and we are sending a sample overseas for confirmation, or hopefully not confirmation. But that can take up to 2 weeks," says MAST veterinary specialist Vigdís Tryggvadóttir.

_Brucella canis_ is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be transmitted between animals and humans, or vice versa. The main symptoms of the disease in dogs are the death of foetuses late in pregnancy, still-born puppies, or sick puppies that die shortly after birth, as well as Epididymitis in males. The main infection route is through mating or very close contact.

It is rare for _B. canis_ to infect humans, but symptoms in people include fever, shivering, dysphoria, loss of appetite, bone or muscle aches, and lymph node inflammation. Symptoms can appear a few days, or even months, after contact and children under 5, as well as immuno-suppressed people and pregnant women are more at risk than others.

The main transmission route into humans is while assisting an infected bitch giving birth to puppies. Dog breeders and vets are therefore more likely to be exposed. Symptoms can range from mild illness to serious. The disease does not generally spread between humans.

"_Brucella canis_ is endemic in many European countries and also in Asia and elsewhere. It has never been diagnosed here and is rare in some other European countries. This has never come up here and we would dearly like to keep it outside of our borders," Vigdís says.

She adds that one case does not mean an epidemic has begun, and emphasises that very close, usually sexual, contact is required for transmission. Dogs are not at risk of infection in their daily lives.

MAST has received a notification of a suspected _Brucella canis_ bacterial infection in a dog. Suspicion of such an infection has not arisen before in this country. _Brucella canis_ causes a disease that can be transmitted between animals and humans. It should be noted that human infection by _Brucella canis_ is rare.

The main symptoms of the disease in dogs are miscarriages late in pregnancy, dead or weak puppies that often die soon, and swelling of the testicles in dogs. The main route of transmission between animals is mating, but close contact between dogs can also cause infection.

Few cases of _Brucella canis_ infection in humans have been described. Symptoms may include fever, chills, malaise, loss of appetite, bone or muscle pain, and enlarged lymph nodes. The symptoms may appear after a few days or even months. They can also disappear and come back. Children under the age of 5, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women are considered to be at greater risk of serious infection. The main risk of infection to people is from the fluids and tissues used during childbirth in infected bitches. Veterinarians and dog breeders are therefore most likely to be exposed to infection. The disease is generally not contagious between people.

Actions have been taken, such as recommendations to relevant parties about home quarantine of animals and a ban on mating where appropriate. We are also working on collecting epidemiological information and sampling. Actions are aimed at preventing the spread of the disease while waiting for the diagnosis to be confirmed. Two weeks may pass before the final results of the investigation are available. The persons most likely to be exposed to infection have been contacted and given instructions.

It is imperative that dog breeders take the utmost precautions during prenatal care for their dogs and always contact a veterinarian if they become aware of any abnormal symptoms related to pregnancy or litter, such as miscarriage late in pregnancy or dead/weak puppies.

[Canine brucellosis is caused by _Brucella canis_, a Gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). _Brucella canis_ and the disease it causes, canine brucellosis, should be clearly differentiated from other _Brucella_ species, in particular _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, which are important zoonotic pathogens, affecting and spread by farmed animals (cattle, sheep, goats, swine), which cause a serious disease, brucellosis, in humans. Occasionally, these _Brucella_ species may be associated with disease in dogs.

_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis, and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult.

Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.

_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central, and South America and parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe.

The suspected, yet to be confirmed spread of _B. canis_ to Iceland, reminds me of information published in the journal of the Dutch Veterinary Society in January 2019, according to which several dogs originating in eastern Europe had been found infected by _B. canis_ since 2016. On 24 May 2022, MAST published its 'GUIDANCE NOTES', "Import of dogs & cats of Ukrainian refugees", which include, among the requirements, lab tests for _Brucella canis_ with a negative result; see at https://www.mast.is/static/files/innflutningur_hdkt20/dcu-leidbein-en.pdf. - Mod.AS
