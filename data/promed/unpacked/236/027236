[The recurrence of LSD to the (south of) the West Bank after absence since May 2013 deserves to be seen in tandem with the LSD situation in Israel, where the disease has reportedly recurred on 30 May 2019, after its absence since September 2013. The 1st outbreak in the current, continuing event in Israel was located in southeast Golan, affecting a large dairy operation adjacent to Syria's southwestern province Dar'a and Jordan's northwestern province Irbid (see map in the OIE immediate notification, covered in 20190605.6505053. Since then, 11 additional outbreaks have been reported to the OIE from Israel (map and links to the 2 follow-up reports, as of 13 Jul 2019, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=30698.

From unofficial, reliable sources, we are informed that since 13 Jul 2019, and as of mid-August 2019, few additional sporadic LSD cases were confirmed in the Golan and northern Israel. The absence of significant outbreaks is attributed to the application of mass vaccination. Hopefully, vaccination of cattle, in particular dairy animals, is being applied in the Palestinian territories as well.

Notably, LSD has been recently reported officially, for the 1st time, from Syria (20190725.6585523).
