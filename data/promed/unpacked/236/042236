Residents in Brisbane's north have been urged to ensure they are
vaccinated against measles amid fears a man diagnosed yesterday [Tue
25 Jan 2011] could have unwittingly spread the highly contagious virus.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said she was
concerned the 21-year-old man visited the busy Westfield Chermside
Shopping Centre on Wed 19 Jan 2011, when he would have been infectious.

He was diagnosed with the highly contagious disease at Prince Charles
Hospital yesterday [Tue 25 Jan 2011]. "We know he was in the food
court, and he transacted some business at the ANZ Bank," Dr Young
said. "We urge anyone who was at the shopping centre on Wed 19 Jan
2011 and especially anyone who was at those 2 locations within the
complex to ensure they are protected against measles and to seek
medical advice if they develop symptoms. Queensland Health will
continue to actively investigate this case and do whatever it can to
prevent further transmission."

It is understood the man contracted the virus on a recent flight into
Brisbane from overseas; 3 other passengers on the same flight who
continued on to another location were infectious with measles at the
time [see Measles - New Zealand (02): in-flight exposure, 2nd alert
20110122.0267, and the comment below]. Queensland Health is contacting
all other passengers who disembarked in Brisbane and who were seated
close to the infected people.

Measles is one of the most infectious diseases and is often acquired
in public places such as shopping centres or on public transport.
According to Queensland Health, measles is spread by tiny droplets
through coughing and sneezing, and the virus can linger in the
environment for several hours. It can be a severe illness even in
otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults and can cause pneumonia
and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). The initial symptoms are
fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough and sore and red eyes,
followed a few days later by a blotchy red rash, which starts on the
face then becomes widespread.

Dr Young said symptoms usually start about 10 days after infection.
"We're getting close to that time for people who may have contracted
the virus at Chermside shopping centre to start to get symptoms," Dr
Young said. "Anyone who was at the Chermside Shopping Centre last
Wednesday [19 Jan 2011] who develops measles-like symptoms in the next
few days to a week should contact their GP for advice. It's very
important to call the medical practice first to say you could have
measles so that staff can take precautions to avoid spreading the
disease to others."

"Everyone should make sure that they are vaccinated against measles,
as we are seeing a lot of people who have acquired measles overseas
who may unknowingly spread the virus in public places," she said. Dr
Young said Queensland Health recommends anyone born during or since
1966 who has not had 2 documented doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella
(MMR) vaccine or had proven measles to visit their local GP for a free
extra vaccination.

[It is stated that the 21-year-old man contracted the virus on a
recent flight into Brisbane from overseas; other passengers on the
same flight were infectious with measles at the time. The flight
referred to would almost certainly have been Emirates flight EK434,
which arrived in Auckland (New Zealand) from Brisbane on 11 Jan 2011
with 3 [subsequently 4] passengers exhibiting symptoms of measles
virus infection, which triggered the alert, posted by ProMED-mail as:
"Measles - New Zealand (02): in-flight exposure, 2nd alert
20110122.0267."

Subsequently, on Wed 26 Jan 2011, NZTV
(<http://tvnz.co.nz/health-news/more-measles-confirmed-flight-4008023?ref=rss>) has reported that 2 more passengers from the same flight between Brisbane and Auckland have been confirmed as having measles. All 6 cases so far are children ranging in age from 5 to 16. One was hospitalised due to the severity of the illness. The Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) said there are likely to be further
cases.

The Auckland Medical Officer of Health, Dr Richard Hoskins, said that
these children almost certainly contracted measles during their
journey, as did the patient who disembarked at Brisbane. Measles is
very easily transmitted from one person to another through the air,
for example, while walking past the passengers with measles, or while
waiting in the airport gate lounge.

This incident illustrates that the in-fight transmission of measles
virus infection is more than a theoretical risk.
