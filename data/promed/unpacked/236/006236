Georgia's diagnostic capability for ASF
---------------------------------------
PCR [polymerase chain reaction] diagnostic capability for African
swine fever (ASF) was established 11 Jun 2007 in Tbilisi, Georgia,
and the trained Georgian staff will provide diagnostic capability at
a regional lab in Kutaisi in the west and via 2 RAPID PCR machines at
mobile sites throughout the country as the control campaign unfolds.
On 15 Jun 2007 RAPID ASF PCR was established in Azerbaijan through
the Republican Vet Lab. The government of Georgia is willing to
support the Armenian government and so the Caucasus is covered.
The Georgian government has declared a nationwide 30-day standstill
on movement of swine, pork and materials that might spread infection.
There are believed to be ASF-free areas. It is not clear at this time
what the government will decide to do: total depopulation or a
prolonged clean-up campaign. Much will depend upon the financial and
logistical support of international agencies.
Very active steps are being taken to impose movement quarantines and
road search and disinfection sites for vehicles. Surviving animals in
infected herds are being killed. This is already very hard on the
Georgian people who depend on their swine. The virus is producing a
peracute disease with very high mortality. The Azeri government is
killing wild pigs along the border and closely monitoring the 20 000
swine in the country.
