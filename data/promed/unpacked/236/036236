Health officials have reported that a fever of uncertain etiology has
killed 14 people in Peru this year. The illness, which doctors believe may
be caused by a virus, has spread along Peru's northern coast, where
torrential rains attributed to El Nino have flooded shantytowns and
disrupted water supplies. Health officials say the resulting destruction
and pooled water provides fertile ground for insect breeding and the spread
of disease.
The 14 children and adults who have died from the fever were in the cities
of Talara, Trujillo and Chimbote, said Health Ministry spokesman Jose
Anicama. Before dying, victims experience high fever, coughing and
diarrhea for up to three weeks, said Dr. Marcial Anaya of the state
hospital in Chimbote, 225 miles northwest of Lima.
