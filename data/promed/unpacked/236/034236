Unnecessary Vaccination Requirement Endangers Yellow Fever Vaccine Supply
--------------------------------------------------
MEDINFO has reported that the Egyptian Embassy in Pretoria is insisting on
travelers to Egypt receiving a vaccine that is unnecessary, and potentially
depriving travelers to high-risk areas of a life-saving vaccine.
Yellow fever vaccine is a vaccine that is used to protect travelers who are
either travelling from an area of high risk to an area of zero risk, or
vice versa. This is typically for travel such as from South Africa to
Angola, or for travelers from Angola to South Africa.
There is zero risk of contracting Yellow Fever in both South Africa and
Egypt. Despite this, the Egyptian Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, is
insisting on travelers having a yellow fever vaccination in order for a
visa to be issued. There is no medical reason for this requirement, nor is
any offered.
Due to an international vaccine shortage, Yellow Fever vaccine stocks are
at a record low level in South Africa and the rest of the continent. Many
clinics have only a few days' supply, if any at all. "In the light of this
shortage, having to administer vaccine for an arbitrary administrative
reason is nonsensical," comments Dr Andrew Jamieson of Netcare Travel
Clinics. "We have attempted to reason with the Egyptian mission, but it
seems to be pointless. When it is pointed out to the Egyptians that even
the World Health Organisation says the vaccine is not required, they have
asserted their sovereignty and insisted on the vaccine." In a letter to Dr
Jamieson from the Egyptian Embassy, Mr Mohamed Safwat, Second Secretary,
Head of Consular Section has stated that: "While recognizing that your
medical opinion is undoubtedly correct ... travelers departing from South
Africa and willing to visit Egypt have no other option [for] the time being
but to respect Egyptian Laws." Egypt has now begun to refuse visas to
travelers who have not had the vaccine.
"All medications have potential side effects -- and yellow fever vaccine is
no exception. Although risks of side effects are greatly outweighed by the
protection offered in travel to high-risk areas, it should not be given
when it is not needed. Additionally, in the light of the international
shortage, people who really need the vaccine may be deprived of it because
of this bureaucratic insistence. It really is entirely counterproductive."
