Deadly disease may claim 9 out of 10 rabbits in UK
-----------------------------------------------
The worst outbreak of myxomatosis in years is threatening Britain's
rabbit population, and owners of domestic animals are being warned to
get their pets vaccinated without delay.
Reports are coming in of outbreaks of the disease across the country,
with epidemics confirmed in Dorset, East Sussex, Essex, Newcastle,
Cambridge, Durham and Surrey. Experts are blaming mild conditions in
the autumn.
More than 90 percent of rabbits -- wild and domestic -- that contract
myxomatosis die. The disease is carried by insects such as
mosquitoes, ticks, mites, lice and fleas. An outbreak in the early
1950s almost wiped out the UK's rabbit population.
Claire King, executive officer at the Rabbit Welfare Association, the
UK's largest rabbit owners' organization, said: "It is now everywhere
in the country. Rabbit owners should take their rabbits down to the
vet and vaccinate them. They should do it as soon as possible. This
is the worst outbreak for years."
The disease begins with lumps around the rabbit's head and genitals.
Acute eye infection follows, causing discharge and, usually,
blindness. The rabbit then loses its balance, stops eating, and
develops a fever. Infections then occur, causing pneumonia and
inflammation of the lumps. In typical cases, death takes about 13 days.
Rabbits were introduced into Britain by invading Roman legions 2000
years ago. The population, estimated at 37.5 million, is at its
highest for half a century.
Myxomatosis was 1st observed in laboratory rabbits in Uruguay in
1896. It was tolerated by South American rabbits but proved lethal to
their European cousins. The disease was deliberately introduced into
Australia to devastating effect in 1950. In the autumn of 1953, it
arrived in Britain. Ministry of Agriculture officials tried to
contain it but failed.
2 years later, 99 percent of Britain's wild rabbits were dead. It was
alleged that some farmers had spread the disease deliberately, as
rabbits had been blamed for the destruction of vast swathes of crops.
The Pests Act of 1954 criminalized intentional transmission, but few
prosecutions followed. The rabbit population has now grown to half of
what it was before the disease spread.
Mairwen Guard, of Cottontails Rabbit Rescue in Westbury, Wiltshire,
believes the high cost of vaccination -- between 10 to 20 GBP [17 to
34 USD] per rabbit -- is helping to spread the disease. She said:
"Responsible pet owners already vaccinate their rabbits twice a year.
Your average person will buy rabbits for their kids and then just
leave them at the bottom of the garden when the family gets bored.
It's no wonder that the disease spreads."
Dorothy and Ray Massey of the British Belgian Hare Club have over 70
animals in their barn in Wearmouth, Derbyshire. Mrs. Massey is
prepared for the worst. "This outbreak could wipe the whole lot out," she said.
"All our stock, everything. We can't vaccinate, though. It's so
costly to have the whole lot vaccinated, as well as making the does infertile."
The disease is not monitored by the Government. A spokesman for the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said yesterday [26
Nov 2005]: "This is not a notifiable disease. People whose pets catch
it or who see it are not required by law to report it. It doesn't
affect any other mammal."
