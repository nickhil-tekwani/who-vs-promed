A 3rd person has died from an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in North Carolina, state health officials said. None of the victims has been identified by authorities and health officials have not discussed the circumstances of their deaths.

In recent weeks, health officials have confirmed 140 cases among people who attended the NC Mountain State Fair in Fletcher, North Carolina, last month [September 2019] [and] have been diagnosed with legionnaires' disease, an airborne lung infection, or Pontiac fever, a milder form of the disease. The 140 cases involve people from several North Carolina counties and a few other states. 94 people have been hospitalized, health officials said.

The outbreak has been linked to a hot tubs display in one events center and officials said it took place during the last 5 days of the fair, a preliminary report shows.

There were no other significant sources of aerosolized water -- small droplets of water or mist that can be inhaled -- at the event center, and no other ongoing potential sources of exposure identified, the health department has said.

Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection contracted when people breathe in the _Legionella_ bacteria through a mist or by accidentally getting water into their lungs that contains the bacteria.

[Six more cases have been identified since the last ProMED-mail post on this outbreak, but no cases linked to the outbreak had a symptom onset date more than 2 weeks after the end of the fair.

The latest status, as of 14 Oct 2019, of the legionellosis outbreak associated with the Mountain State Fair that was held in western North Carolina between 6 and 15 Sep 2019 at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center (WNC Ag Center) in Fletcher, a town in Henderson County, can be found at https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/legionellosis/outbreak.html.

The number of confirmed cases of legionellosis by county are as follows: Buncombe, 49; Burke, 1; Caswell, 1; Cherokee, 1; Gaston, 1; Granville, 1; Haywood, 12; Henderson, 34; Jackson, 3; Madison, 6; McDowell, 5; Mecklenburg, 4; Mitchell, 2; Polk, 1; Rutherford, 3; Transylvania, 3; Union, 1; Watauga, 1; and Yancey, 1. Ten cases occurred out of state (in South Carolina). Total cases: 140.

A map showing the location of the North Carolina counties can be found at https://geology.com/county-map/north-carolina.shtml.

Male, 79 (57%)*; female, 59 (43%)*. Median age in years (range): 61 (24-91). Hospitalizations: 94 (69%)*; deaths 3.
*Some cases reported with unknown gender or hospitalization status.

A total of 132 (94%) have legionnaires' disease, the pneumonic form of the infection, and 8 (6%) have Pontiac fever, the non-pneumonic form of the infection.

The source of the outbreak has still not as yet been confirmed. However, hot tub displays in one of the buildings (Davis Event Center) has been linked to the outbreak, and _Legionella_ was found in a women's restroom in this building (https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/legionellosis/InterimReportLegionnairesDiseaseOutbreak_101019_final.pdf). A site map of the WNC Ag Center that shows the location of the Davis Event Center building can be found at https://www.wncagcenter.org/p/mountainstatefair/competitions/map.

The species of _Legionella_ detected in patients is not specified; however, the usual pathogen in the US is _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 and one sample of water collected from the women's restroom in the Davis Event Center has tested positive for _L. pneumophila_ (https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/legionellosis/InterimReportLegionnairesDiseaseOutbreak_101019_final.pdf). Genotyping clinical and environmental isolates will help identify clusters of cases with a common source and identify the source responsible for infection in these clusters. - Mod.ML
