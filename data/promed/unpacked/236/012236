South Korea reports additional case of foot-and-mouth disease
-------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea reported an additional case of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) on Wed [20 Apr 2011], a week after the government lowered the
alert level for the highly contagious disease by one notch.

Quarantine authorities said baby pigs at a farm in Yeongcheon, 344 km
[214 miles] south east of Seoul, tested positive for FMD, the 2nd
confirmed case since Seoul downgraded its alert level last week.

The quarantine authorities said they buried about 80 pigs that showed
symptoms of the disease and ordered a restriction on the movement of
livestock near the farm.

South Korea lowered the alert level from "orange" to "yellow," the
2nd-lowest level in the 4-tiered alert system, on 12 Apr 2011, a sign
that the highly contagious disease has been largely contained. Seoul
downgraded the level to "orange" from "red," the highest alert level,
on 24 Mar 2011.

South Korea has been making all-out efforts to stem the nationwide
spread of the disease since the 1st case was confirmed last November
[2010]. The country culled more than 3.47 million cows, pigs and other
animals, incurring around 3 trillion won (USD 2.78 billion) in losses,
and conducted nationwide vaccinations to curb the spread of the
disease.

The fresh cases of FMD are raising some concerns about the
effectiveness of the vaccinations [see comment] and the possibility
that the FMD virus might have mutated.

Farm minister Yoo Jeong-bok said the government may consider raising
the alert level if necessary. "Because FMD does not seem to have
spread yet as it earlier did, the government is closely watching the
situation," he added.

Countries that report the disease are barred from exporting meat from
cloven-hoofed animals.

[Vaccination against one serotype of FMD virus (FMDV) does not
cross-protect against other serotypes and may also fail to protect
fully or at all against other strains of the same serotype. The
vaccine strain should match the circulating field strain. The most
direct and reliable method to measure cross-protection is to vaccinate
relevant target species and then to challenge them by exposure to the
virus isolate against which protection is required. This will take
account of both potency and cross-reactivity. However, such an
approach requires the use of FMDV and appropriate biosecurity
procedures and practices must be used; the facility should meet the
requirements for Containment Group 4 pathogens. In addition to the
safety concerns, this procedure is slow and expensive; hence, usually
the use of 'in vitro' alternatives is preferred. In vitro vaccine
matching methods and vaccine potency testing are described in detail
in OIE's terrestrial manual; see chapter 2.1.5 at
http://web.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.01.05_FMD.pdf.

International FMD vaccine banks keep, following experts' advice, 3
strains of the serotype O FMDV: O Taiwan, O Manisa and O BFS as frozen
FMD antigen. Similarly to other selected vaccine strains of all 7 main
FMD serotypes, the concentrated antigens are stored at ultra-low
temperature for later formulation into FMD vaccines. The O Manisa
vaccine strain was selected as more suitable than the 2 other stored
FMDV-O strains to confer protection against the SEA topotype
circulating in recent years throughout eastern Asia. For the
International standards of vaccine banks, see
http://web.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/1.1.10_VACCINE_BANKS.pdf.

When South Korea decided, towards the end of January 2011, to give up
its traditional non-vaccination policy, it applied to international
vaccine banks for an urgent supply of a potent (inactivated) FMD
vaccine. On 24 Jan 2011, President Lee Myung-bak stated that the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands were the only countries
manufacturing internationally approved vaccines, but that the
government was going to "actively actively review the possibility of
producing vaccines here in Korea." (see archived 20110124.0290)

Since then, mass vaccinations have been carried out extensively
throughout South Korea to protect all susceptible species; the vaccine
was supplied from international banks and from European producers.

To evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine and rule out possible
deficiencies, the vaccination history of the 2 recent affected swine
holdings deserve to be analysed, such as the time elapsed since
vaccination/revaccination, the age of the animals at vaccination,
vaccine dose applied, mode of vaccination, batch details, etc.

On top of examining the potency of the applied vaccine, the source of
the virus which has infected the 2 pig farms deserves to be
investigated. Surveillance deserves to cover also wildlife, such as
wild boars and deer. - Mod.AS]
