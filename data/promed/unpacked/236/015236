Syphilis is spreading in Japan, with a record 8155 cases reported so far this year [2022], mainly in people in their 20s.

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) reported that 8155 cases of the sexually transmitted disease had been tallied nationwide as of 4 Sep 2022, suggesting this year's total will likely increase. The cases are the most since the NIID began collecting data on syphilis cases by employing its current method in 1999.

The increase likely results from people becoming more promiscuous as social media provides ample opportunities to have sex with relative strangers, said Katsumi Shigemura, an associate professor of urology at Kobe University, and a senior official at the Japanese Association of Infectious Diseases. "Even if suspected symptoms are gone, people should undergo an examination as soon as they suspect even a remote chance of being infected," he added.

By prefecture, Tokyo reported the most cases, at 2343, followed by 1091 in Osaka Prefecture, 463 in Aichi Prefecture, and 332 in Fukuoka Prefecture.

An analysis of the cases reported between January and July [2022] showed that 34 percent of patients were those in their 20s. People in their 30s accounted for 22 percent, with 20 percent being those in their 40s. Of the patients, 67 percent are men.

A patient develops syphilis after being infected with _Treponema pallidum_, a bacterium. The bacterium is transmissible through intercourse, kissing, and other sexual activities. It can be passed from a mother to her unborn child.

A patient will have a small sore on their genitals or mouth about a month or so after becoming infected. Although the sore naturally disappears, red rashes appear all over the body in one to 3 months, accompanied by fever and fatigue in some cases. Even if patients do not experience symptoms for some time, symptoms can later return. Without treatment, patients can develop bumps on the skin or bones or bulging and swelling of the aorta 3 to 10 years later. A blood test can determine if someone is infected. The disease is treatable.

Shigemura said syphilis is also preventable with the proper use of contraceptives.

[In a prior ProMED post, as of 27 Jul 2022, Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) reported 6385 total syphilis cases. Now, as of 4 Sep 2022, the NIID is said to be reporting a total of 8155 cases of syphilis nationwide. These data are likely for total cases of syphilis, which include all stages of syphilis. In recent years, about 70% of the total cases of syphilis each year in Japan were cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the most contagious stages of syphilis. - Mod.ML
