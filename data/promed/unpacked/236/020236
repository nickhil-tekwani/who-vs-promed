A Grant County baby has died from whooping cough [pertussis] and
another is recovering from the highly contagious bacterial disease,
Grant County health officials say.

The infant died Tuesday night, 24 Aug 2010, at Children's Hospital
and Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, according to Theresa
Fuller, public information officer for the Grant County Health
District. The other child is recovering at home. There appears to be
no connection between the cases, she said.

Health officials are working with health-care providers of children
and adults who may have been exposed to the sick children, Fuller
said. In some cases, those people may need antibiotics.

According to the CDC, 8000 to 25 000 cases of pertussis, are reported
each year in the USA.

During the last decade, pertussis has re-emerged as one of the most
pressing public health issues due to increasing numbers of cases and
lower vaccination rates, Fuller said.

Recently, multiple outbreaks of pertussis have been investigated in
the USA, including cases in California and Idaho, said Jeff Ketchel,
health district administrator. From 2005 to 2009, Washington state
had 2636 cases of whooping cough. During this same time period, Grant
County had 17 cases.

About 1 in 20 infants with pertussis get pneumonia, said Dr Alexander
Brzezny, Grant County health officer. About 1 in 100 infants will
have convulsions. In rare cases, pertussis can be deadly, especially
in infants under 1 year old. Nearly all infants with pertussis get
the infection from an infected adult.

A rise in reported cases of pertussis in causing concern in the
greater Philadelphia area, health officials say. The suburban
counties of southeastern Pennsylvania have witnessed increased
occurrences of the infection, which can be fatal in infants,
Philly.com reports. Delaware County saw the largest increase in
cases, jumping from 5 cases to 44 within a 3 month period.

The 2nd highest increase in whooping cough cases was in Montgomery
County, Philly.com reports, where 39 new cases were tallied between
April and June 2010, compared to 8 new cases in the 3 months preceding.

According to a report from Dr Joshua Meyerson, the medical director
of the Health Department of Northwest Michigan, 25 cases of pertussis
have been discovered in the 4 counties, Antrim, Charlevoix, Emmet,
and Otsego, served by Northwest. The outbreak is 5 times the typical
number. There have been cases so far in Otsego County in 2010, a
child and an adult.

Meyerson states that 10-15 percent of children have not been
vaccinated. "In some ways these vaccinations are victims of the
initial success of the vaccine," said Jane Sundmacher, public
information officer of Northwest. "Before the vaccine was introduced
in the 1940s, pertussis was the major cause of serious illness and
death in infants and young children."

The alarm being sounded about the outbreak is particularly important
in Michigan. California and Michigan lead the country in the
percentage of children not vaccinated. California has suffered 10
deaths and Michigan one.

"Be really careful about who's around an infant," Sundmacher said. "A
really common report we hear is that an adult has a cough, but
doesn't feel that sick, and ends up passing pertussis on to a baby or
young child. Even if an infant has started the series of shots
usually given at 2, 4, and 6 months, if they haven't completed the
series, their parents and anyone else who cares for them should get
immunized. Booster shots are available for ages 7 to 64."

Wendy Phillips, public information officer of Northeast Health
Department, reports there have been no identified cases of pertussis
in 2010 in Montmorency County. There are, however, 2 cases in both
Alpena and Cheboygan, and the 2 in Otsego suggests it's only a matter
of time before it spreads to Montmorency.

An additional 17 cases of whooping cough were reported last week
[week of 9 Aug 2010] in Kern County, bringing the total to 227 for
2010, according to the Kern County Department of Public Health.

The monthly rate of cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis,
in Kern County has been going up and up in 2010, though no deaths
have been reported. The weekly rate has, since 23 May 2010, ranged
from 5 between 30 May and 5 Jun 2010 to 33 between 27 Jun and 3 Jul
2010, according to Public Health. Of the 227 Kern cases, 182 were
reported in Bakersfield.

The reason for the uptick is unclear but it's happening across the
state so health officials are just trying to get the word out about
the need for vaccination, said Denise Smith, Public Health's
assistant director of disease control.

Officials have said the incidence of whooping cough is cyclical. In
Kern there were 6 reported cases in all of 2009 and 8 in 2008,
according to Public Health.

Missouri has reported 82 confirmed cases of pertussis in the last
month. One-quarter of those involved infants under a year old.

No one knows exactly why this is happening. In the 1920s and '30s,
pertussis was a feared childhood killer, with an annual toll as high
as 250 000 cases and 9000 deaths, according to the CDC. In the 1940s,
health authorities introduced a combined vaccine against diphtheria,
pertussis, and tetanus (often called DPT or DTaP), and by 1976
pertussis was virtually eliminated, with just 1010 reported cases.

Recent research has shown that the protection provided by the vaccine
wears off over time, Aaron Miller wrote in an article posted on St.
Louis Children's Hospital's website. Miller, a pediatrician at the
hospital and an instructor of pediatrics at Washington University
School of Medicine, added that the CDC now recommends that all
children receive a booster shot at 11 or 12 and that adults receive
the same booster.
