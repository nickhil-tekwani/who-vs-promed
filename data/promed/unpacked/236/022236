[Ohio] public health officials have confirmed the outbreak of cryptosporidiosis has grown to 202 cases in Franklin and Delaware counties.

Columbus Public Health said the outbreak this year [2016] is more than the last 4 years combined. They added that the outbreak is not tied to any one location as a large number of cases include people with exposure at various places.

As a result of Thursday's [18 Aug 2016] update, all Columbus pools and spray grounds closed Friday [19 Aug 2016] as a precaution due to the outbreak. The city of Dublin has closed the community pools on 5660 Dublinshire Drive and 6363 Woerner Temple Road to begin hyperchlorination.

Hyperchlorination is a process that kills chlorine-resistant organisms like 'crypto'. The pools will reopen once chemicals are rebalanced to a safe level.

Last week, officials announced 117 cases had been reported.

Public health officials are reaching out and working with pool operators, schools, and day care facilities by providing them with information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on preventing the spread of the bacteria [parasite].

To reduce the spread of illness when heading to a spray fountain, pool, or water park:
- do not swim when you have diarrhea and for 2 weeks after you recovered;
- do not pee or poop in the water;
- take a shower/bathe before going in the water;
- wash hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before eating;
- change diapers in a bathroom and not by the pool;
- take kids on frequent bathroom breaks and check diapers often;
- avoid swallowing any water and keep it out of your mouth.

Additionally, the CDC recommends these safety measures for schools and child care facilities:
- keep kids with diarrhea out of a child care setting and school until
diarrhea has stopped;
- keep kids with diarrhea or those diagnosed with crypto out of water-play and swimming activities for at least 2 weeks after diarrhea has stopped;
- practice good hygiene, especially handwashing with soap and water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds; crypto is not killed by alcohol gels or hand sanitizers;
Have kids wash their hands when they first arrive, after they use the toilet, after having their diapers changed, and before eating snacks or meals.
- keep facilities clean by disinfecting bathrooms, tabletops, desks, diaper-changing areas, toys, food surfaces, and high chairs every day.

Crypto is a germ that causes diarrhea. It is found in the fecal matter of a person who has been infected by crypto. It is spread by swallowing water that has been contaminated with fecal matter containing crypto or from human-to-human contact.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea with abdominal pain and cramping, which can be accompanied by dehydration, weight loss, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms can last for 2 weeks with improvement often followed by recurrence.

Infected persons can continue to spread the disease for several weeks after diarrhea subsides, so they should avoid activities in recreational waters for at least two weeks after diarrhea subsides and practice diligent handwashing.

[It is intriguing that the health authorities said the outbreak is not tied to a single location but include people exposed at various places. If not already done, perhaps the health authorities should map the outbreak in relation to the water supply as cryptosporidia may enter water supplies especially if the source is surface water. - Mod.EP
