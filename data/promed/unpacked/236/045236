[1] Cholera - Sudan (Darfur. Khartoum, N. Kordofan)

The number of cases of acute watery diarrhea has increased noticeably
in the past 4 weeks, with outbreaks reported in camps for internally
displaced persons (IDPs) in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, as
well as urban areas, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said.
"We're concerned because diarrheal diseases are a major killer of
children," Edward Carwardine, UNICEF senior communications officer,
said. "40 percent of the collected stool specimens tested positive
for cholera -- all the more reason to accelerate our response. South
Darfur has been a particular cause of concern, with 5 new suspected
cases reported on 10 Aug 2006 and 13 on 11 Aug," he added. Since Apr
2006, 701 cases had been reported in South Darfur alone.
According to the Sudanese Ministry of Health, the total cumulative
number of acute watery diarrhea cases for all northern Sudan since
Apr 2006 is 5953, with 196 fatalities. Besides Darfur, a high number
of cases had also been reported in Khartoum State and Northern Kordofan.
Carwardine observed that during the rainy season, traditionally, a
higher than average number of cases could be expected. "You can have
chlorinated water sources, but if people are not using those safe
sources, it doesn't have an effect -- that's why there is a very big
public information campaign under way."
The situation has been exacerbated by the limited access to IDP camps
over the past weeks due to escalating violence in many of the camps
and the killing of several Sudanese aid workers by angry mobs.

The number of deaths from acute watery diarrhea in the Oromiya and
the Southern Nations and Nationalities regions of Ethiopia has
increased to an alarming level, a United Nations agency has warned.
The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
said in its weekly bulletin on Mon, 14 Aug 2006, that the disease had
claimed the lives of 89 people and affected 9270 in the regions since
Jun 2006 highest number of cases was reported in Shashamene and Arsi
Negele districts.
Last week, a mission comprising UN agencies and government
representatives visited West Arsi zone to assess the situation. "A
regional response plan on the basis of gaps identified by the
[assessment] team is under preparation," said Sophie Yannoutsou,
regional programme coordinator for the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) in
Oromiya. So far, 44 treatment center have been established in the
affected areas in a bid to contain the outbreak and local authorities
have been coordinating the response.
The disease initially started in Gambella Region then spread to West
Arsi zone, seriously affecting 2 districts -- Shashamene and Arsi Negele.

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Arua)

Following an outbreak of cholera, 3 primary schools in Rhino Camp, a
Sudanese refugee settlement, have reportedly been closed. According
to Ministry of Education calendar, schools are to close on 18 Aug
2006 for the 2nd term holiday.
Dr Patrick Anguzu, the District director of health services, said
last week that the index case for the latest epidemic occurrence in
the river belt area came from Sudan. He said a man who was nursed at
home died and, after his funeral, people got ill until medical
investigations confirmed it was cholera.
Ten residents were hospitalized with cholera in Siripi and O'dobu
health centers in the refugee camps.
"The situation is made worse because people disregard precautionary
advice from the health workers currently on community sensitisation,"
Anguzu said.
During nearly the same period [of 2005], cholera struck Rigbo
Sub-county and killed at least 26 people.
Meanwhile, the cumulative cases of cholera infections registered at
Oli Health Center in Arua Municipality have gone up to 30 since the
epidemic [began] on 12 Jul 2006.
