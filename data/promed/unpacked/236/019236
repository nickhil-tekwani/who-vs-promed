CLIMATE CHANGE AND HEALTH: SCIENCE ARTICLE

A ProMED-mail post

From: Jonathan Mayer <jmayer@hsph.harvard.edu>

The 7 November issue of Science (Vol. 278, pp. 1004-6;
<http://www.sciencemag.org/>)
has, in the "News and Comment" section, a cogent summary of the issues
involved in the debate over weather global warming will have significant
impact on health, pitting experts such as Paul Epstein ("yes") against
Duane Gubler and Donald Henderson, who attribute health impacts to
breakdowns in public health infrastructure. It is definitely worth reading
since it lays the issues out so clearly and succinctly.
