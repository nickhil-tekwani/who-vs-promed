The infectious disease that mimics leptospirosis best is not so much
dengue or hepatitis A, but rather hantavirus-induced hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Both infections have surprisingly
many similarities, despite their completely different etiology. Both
are zoonoses with a worldwide distribution, both are spread uniquely
(hantavirus) or mainly (leptospirosis) by wild rodents, and hence
have even some epidemiological similarities, such as, outbreaks after
floods due to heavy rainfalls, as is now the case in Jamaica.

Symptoms of leptospirosis can overlap almost completely those of
hantavirus infections: fever myalgia, and headache. Jaundice from 12
percent up to 93 percent of the cases, constitutes together with
thrombopenic acute renal failure (ARF) the classic form of Weil' s
disease, the most severe variant of leptospirosis. However, during
the 1993 Belgian HFRS epidemic, we found in 7 percent of cases
(mostly mild) icterus as well (1), so this triad in a patient with
fever is not always exclusive for the diagnosis of Weil' s disease.
Nevertheless, a rapid distinction between the 2 entities is of
paramount importance, since leptospirosis can be successfully treated
in the early phase with antibiotics.

Even more confusing, all major complications of leptospirosis, such
as acute respiratory failure, hemorrhages, rhabdomyolysis, and
extreme thrombocytopenia, with or without overt signs of diffuse
intravascular coagulation (DIC), can be encountered in hantavirus
infections as well, and act as a severity index of the degree of ARF
to come in both conditions. Even the renal lesions are quite similar
to hantavirus nephropathy: interstitial edema and infiltrates,
sometimes complicated by acute tubular necrosis and /or medullar
hemorrhages. Typical for proximal tubular damage in both infections,
fractional excretion of sodium (Fe Na) is often more than one
percent, despite volume depletion in the oliguric cases of both
conditions. Moreover, both conditions are rare examples of infectious
ARF complicated by hypokalemia, rather than hyperkalemia.

HFRS is still wrongly considered as a problem for the Old World (3).
In fact, the 1st published account of symptomatic hantavirus
infections in the Americas (Recife, Brazil) was of cases of HFRS,
originally considered as being leptospirosis, and also occurring
after heavy rainfalls (4). The rat-transmitted Seoul virus (SEOV) was
the most likely culprit. Wild rats (_Rattus rattus_ and _R.
norvegicus_ ) are the only Old World rodents ubiquitous in the New
World, thus representing a potential source of SEOV infection in the
Americas (3). Domestic hantavirus cases mimicking leptospirosis in
the USA were also due to SEOV (5). Moreover, of all known pathogenic
hantaviruses, SEOV targets most the liver together with the kidney,
another similarity with leptospirosis.

Since it appears that "many persons were showing up with symptoms
that mimicked leptospirosis but were not necessarily afflicted with
the disease," it would be highly interesting to screen these cases
for hantavirus (SEOV) infection.

[Dr. Clement makes a good case for considering Seoul hantavirus
infection in establishing diagnoses for these cases. And there is no
law against this being an outbreak of multiple etiologies. But
ruling out possible etiologies and establishing others requires
comprehensive laboratory support (one peek [in the lab] is worth a
thousand guesses). Jamaica may not have the capability of testing
for SEOV, but I am sure the CDC or other labs would be willing to
test for it. In any event, the response is the same -- rapidly
reduce the rat population. - Mod.TY]
