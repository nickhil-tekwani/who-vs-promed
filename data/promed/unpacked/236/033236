In a comment on the report of the isolation of a West Nile-like virus from
dead crows in New Jersey (ref. above), Dr. Thierry Work provided references
to early studies of West Nile in birds.
I had received a similar message from Dr. Martine Work, the wife of Dr.
Telford Work (deceased), to whom Thierry is related by birth. Tel was the
former Chief of the Arbovirus Unit at CDC/Atlanta, the predecessor
organization of the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases/Ft.
Collins, and had been working for the Rockefeller Foundation in Egypt with
Dr. Richard Taylor and others. Their studies provided 23 isolations of West
Nile virus from bloods of febrile children in the Sindbis area of Egypt.
They found West Nile disease in Egypt affected more children and young
adults.
Their isolation of West Nile virus from a hooded crow was a first, and they
also demonstrated that experimental infection of these birds produced a
viremia as high as 9 log [1 billion infectious particles per ml, with
100%mortality. During the winter months 80% of the crows were seropositive,
and it was assumed that during the transmission season there was in nature a
large mortality among crows.
Experimental studies showed that mosquitoes could be infected from viremias
in birds as low as 3.5 log [3000 infectious particles per ml and transmit
West Nile virus.
That early work is part of the legacy of the Rockefeller Foundation and
should be part of the institutional memory of CDC. Thus, the observation
that crows were dying in NY City might have rung a bell. I alluded to all
this in an earlier posting but it is good to hear it from as close to the
horse's mouth as we shall get.
