In a follow-up on the meningitis outbreak in Tshopo Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), health officials now report 2395 suspected meningitis cases, including 14 confirmed (_Neisseria meningitidis_ serotype W) and 200 deaths (case fatality ratio = 8.4%), in Banalia health district, as of [23 Oct 2021].

The case fatality ratio has decreased significantly from 100% at the onset of the outbreak (week 20 ending 23 May 2021) to 8.4% at week 42 (ending 24 Oct 2021). This decrease would be a result of intensified community sensitization for early health-seeking behavior by suspected cases and the improvement of case management practices.

The reactive vaccination campaign started on [9 Oct 2021 and a total of 153 052 people were vaccinated so far, giving coverage of 104.1% of the targeted population in the entire Banalia health district. This vaccination coverage is not uniform for all health areas of the Banalia health district and ranges from 79.5% to 172.4%, due to the fact that the vaccination campaign did not start at the same date in all health areas.

[Provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are divided into territories and cities. Banalia, the community affected by the current meningococcal meningitis outbreak, is a territory in the province of Tshopo, in the north-central part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banalia_Territory); the provincial capital of Tshopo is the city of Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), with an estimated population of 1.2 million residents in 2020 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisangani). A map showing the location of Tshopo can be found at http://goo.gl/DM2AT8. A map showing the location of Banalia can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/Yo1GJifUCGnZjsre9.

The "African Meningitis Belt" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and Eritrea in the east, where numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported each year during the dry season, between December and June, and every 5-12 years large outbreaks occurred (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/meningococcal-disease). Before mass preventive immunization campaigns with a meningococcal conjugate serogroup A vaccine, which started in 2010, serogroup A meningococcus accounted for an estimated 80-85% of all cases in the meningitis belt. As of June 2015, over 220 million persons aged 1 to 29 years received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in 15 countries of the African meningitis belt; since then, the proportion of serogroup A declined dramatically, but other meningococcal serogroups such as serogroups W, X, and C have replaced serogroup A, although at a lower frequency and smaller size of the outbreaks (https://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/meningococcal-meningitis and https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/220/Supplement_4/S274/5610778). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-meningitis-belt-of-sub-Saharan-Africa-and-meningococcal-serogroup-A-conjugate-vaccine_fig1_320819976.

Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis, many due to meningococcus serogroup A, have occurred in the DRC in the past (see ProMED posts listed below) and a mass meningococcal conjugate A vaccination campaign took place in 6 DRC provinces that vaccinated about 18 million people (aged 1-29 years) between 2016-2018 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822965/). Almost 1.7 million people aged between 1 and 29 years of age were vaccinated against meningococcus serogroup A in 2016 in Tshopo province. The pathogen in the current outbreak in Tshopo province has been determined to be _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W in the samples studied.

Meningococcal vaccines elicit immunity only to the meningococcal serogroup antigens included in the vaccine. Using a meningococcal vaccine that only contains the serogroup A capsular polysaccharide antigen will not be able to stop a serogroup W outbreak. To stop the spread of serogroup W, WHO initiated a rapid mass meningococcal meningitis serogroup W vaccination campaign in Tshopo province for at-risk populations (https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/meningitis---democratic-republic-of-the-congo).

There are several meningococcal vaccines available that target serogroup W; they each contain 4 meningococcal surface polysaccharides A, C, W, and Y chemically bonded ("conjugated") to a protein to produce a robust immune response to the polysaccharides. A new "pentavalent" conjugate vaccine that protects against _N. meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, W, Y, and X has been also mentioned (https://www.science.org/content/article/global-plan-aims-slash-meningitis-toll-help-new-five-one-vaccine). However, the specific vaccine being used in Banalia has not been stated. - Mod.ML
