Livestock markets stay banned for autumn
----------------------------------------
Livestock markets will remain banned this autumn in an attempt to contain
foot and mouth disease (FMD), the government said, but more animals will be
allowed to move between farms. The changes came as the number of cases in
the latest outbreak, detected in Allendale, Northumberland, last Thursday,
rose to 13 and 7 Scottish farms were under restriction amid fears of a
"dangerous contact" with a farmer from across the border near Hexham.
Lord Whitty, the food and rural affairs minister, said he was announcing
what he called the "extension" -- rather than the relaxation -- of rules
governing livestock movements to avoid welfare problems during the season
when animals are traditionally moved from high ground. He said, "We were
hoping we could move to a slightly more relaxed regime, but the resistance
of the disease and scientific advice leads us to conclude the risk is too
high." Farmers, who have been clamoring for a relaxation so they can move
animals from high ground where the grass will stop growing within weeks,
said the restrictions would undermine the determination of some farmers to
hold out through the winter.
Lord Whitty said the outbreak in the Allendale valley was not entirely
unexpected. "We always said there would be sparks arising at the tail end
of the disease's progress. It's nonetheless a serious situation and a
setback. And we expect continued outbreaks." Stock travelling between
disease-free counties will be restricted to movements of 250 miles. All
other movements will be limited to 150 miles.
In addition, the Government said it is considering how to make all animals
individually identifiable. Tim Bennett, the National Farmers' Union deputy
president, said: "Farmers accept that the priority must be to prevent any
further spread of the disease."
