Highly pathogenic avian influenza, USA
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 16 Dec 2014 from Dr John Clifford, Deputy Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, USA

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Dec 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 14 Dec 2014
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2004
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Whatcom County, Washington
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Dec 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Gyrfalcon, _Falco rusticolus_ (Falconidae) / - / - / - / - / -
Affected population: Captive wild Gyrfalcon

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As a precaution and in response to the recent HPAI outbreak in Canada, surveillance of poultry premises and of wild bird mortality events was enhanced by the USDA, and state personnel along the United States-Canadian Border. Through this surveillance, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 was identified in wild birds. Two serotypes were identified on enhanced surveillance, both with amino acid sequence at the HA cleavage site consistent with HPAI, H5N8 and H5N2. H5N8 was identified in a captive wild gyrfalcon that was fed hunter killed wild birds from Whatcom County, Washington, and H5N2 was identified in a wild pintail duck also from Whatcom County, Washington. Based upon direct sequencing from gyrfalcon specimens, an avian influenza subtype H5N8 of Eurasian lineage [was identified] (partial H5 99 percent similarity to A/coot/Korea/H81/2014 and partial N8 99 percent similarity to A/Baikal teal/Korea/H41/2014). The amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site is consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Preliminary data suggest that these virus strains (H5N2 and H5N8) may be related to the H5N8 strain, potentially representing the progenitor; however, further analysis is needed. Neither of these viruses have been found in any poultry in the United States. These H5N8 and H5N2 detections involve only wild birds. Further investigation and characterization of the HPAI viruses is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Gyrfalcon / gene sequencing / - / Pending
Gyrfalcon / haemagglutination (HA) test / 14 Dec 2014 / Positive
Gyrfalcon / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 14 Dec 2014 / Positive
Gyrfalcon / virus isolation / 15 Dec 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

Based upon sequence attempt from a virus isolate, an avian influenza subtype H5 of Eurasian lineage (partial HA 98 percent similarity to A/bean goose/Korea/H40/2014) and N2 of US wild bird lineage (partial NA 98 percent similarity to A/American green-winged teal/California/HKWF609/2007) [were identified]; the amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site is consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

[In November 2014, a novel H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus causing outbreaks on chicken and turkey farms in the Fraser Valley, British Columbia was confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Introduction of new strains of AI (avian influenza) viruses into North America through migratory waterfowl is possible via North Atlantic and Pacific flyways. The outbreak in Canada prompted heightened security and awareness on the US side of the border.

The increased awareness and alertness on the part of State and Federal officials, as well as bird hobbyists, hunters and producers along the northwestern US-Canadian border greatly assisted with the early detection of the virus in these wild species (Gyrfalcon and Pintail ducks). Increased surveillance and biosecurity in commercial poultry operations in the United States need to be maintained and/or strengthened to prevent an introduction into commercial poultry flocks. - Mod.CRD
