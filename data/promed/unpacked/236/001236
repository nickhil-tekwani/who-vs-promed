-----------------------------------------------
Apple trees (_Malus domestica_) from 5 orchards in Rio Negro province, Argentina were randomly tested for _Apple scar skin viroid_ (ASSVd) during December 2009 and January 2010. Four apple cultivars were examined. None of the 46 sampled trees had fruits yet, so no viroid symptoms were observed. When leaf preparations were analysed by hybridisation [assay] specific for ASSVd, 19 tested positive. Virus-free apple trees showed no reaction. Two preparations with intense signals were analysed by electrophoresis and revealed a band in the position expected for a viroid RNA.

The segment was excised, and (RT)-PCR amplification generated a product of the size expected (267 bp) for ASSVd. The consensus sequence of 267 bp of 4 clones [of the product] had 97 percent similarity with a Chinese ASSVd isolate from pear. This report of ASSVd, which to our knowledge is the 1st in Argentina and even in South America, indicates the need for careful testing of apple propagation material to avoid spreading of this pathogen.

[_Apple scar skin viroid_ (ASSVd; type member of genus _Apscaviroid_) causes scar skin, dimple and dapple apple diseases on apple. Variants affecting pear (crinkle fruit, rusty skin, dimple) and recently also stone fruit (cherry, apricot) have been reported. Symptoms may vary between viroid strains and are usually confined to the fruit, but some apple cultivars may occasionally show rolling or downwards bending (epinasty) of leaves. Economic losses are due to damaged and reduced quality fruit. Usually, the entire crop from an affected tree is unmarketable.

No insect vectors have been identified for ASSVd. The pathogen can be spread with infected propagation material and rootstocks, cutting tools, seed, and is also suspected to spread by root contacts. Disease management relies on the use of certified viroid free planting material and removal of pathogen reservoirs. Combinations of heat therapy and tissue culture techniques for elimination of ASSVd from host tissues have been described.
