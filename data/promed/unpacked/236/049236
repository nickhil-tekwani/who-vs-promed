[Accessing HandiStatus II (OIE data prior to 2005), there were 2 outbreaks of myxomatosis in 1999 with 180 cases and one outbreak in 2000 with 19 cases; there were suspect outbreaks in 2003 and 2004. There have been no more suspect cases until this new outbreak. When one has 11 sick rabbits and one death among your breeding colony, it will get noticed, as well as negatively impacting one's ability to sell rabbit meat in the local farmers' market. And thus, it gets reported and diagnosed. That it can go so long unreported in wild lagomorphs suggests that the covert infection is well established in Sergipe.

How it reached Brazil in the 1st place is not clear. It is seen in Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, and the USA (suspect). To get from Costa Rica (say) to NE Brazil would suggest that it might have involved imported infected breeding stock, or flea contaminated bedding in their shipping container. A massive die-off, such as occurred in my village in North Oxfordshire when it arrived in the UK, is hard to deny, but sporadic deaths will be dealt with by foxes, coyotes, and scavenging birds, and are easily missed. But there is more of this disease than we realise, thus, an excellent research topic for a graduate student to introduce him or her to lagomorph and wildlife diseases, capture and release, survey serology, and pathogen genomics for gene comparisons with agents recovered in other countries. - Mod.MHJ
