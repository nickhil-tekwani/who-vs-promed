Zika virus (ZIKV), a rare but benign mosquito borne illness, is spreading across the islands of the south pacific. The Disease Daily recently published a spotlight piece on Zika virus, highlighting current outbreaks on 15 different Polynesian islands including Tahiti and Bora Bora.

Most recently, according to local news reports and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, one confirmed and 40 suspected cases of the mosquito-borne virus were detected on Easter Island, also located in the south pacific. Easter Island, or Isla de Pascua, is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world; the nearest continental point lies in central Chile, more than 2000 miles [3219 km] away. The island is governed by Chile's Valparaiso Region and is most famous for its ancient monolithic rock statues carved by the indigenous Rapa Nui.

To control the outbreak, Chile increased preventive measures against both Zika and dengue virus, since they are both transmitted through a bite from the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. Travelers are advised to practice precautions such as applying insect repellent and wearing protective clothing. Additionally, Chilean health authorities strengthened surveillance methods by tracking and monitoring any cases of fever and rash on the island.

Authorities believe that tourists from other vacation islands in the area may have carried the virus onto Easter Island. From January to February, Easter Island celebrates its annual Tapati Festival, which attracts thousands of tourists due to the mix of dances, music, sports, and theatrical presentations, all of which pay homage to the island's rich history and people.

Chilean health authorities decided not to raise a health alert, stating that the outbreak is contained and under control.

[One hopes that the outbreak is indeed controlled. If the 40 suspected cases are indeed Zika virus infections, were they locally acquired on Easter Island, or imported from islands where Zika virus is being transmitted currently. If locally acquired, then there is a risk of infected tourists returning to their home localities, taking the virus with them. Given the spread of the virus among Pacific island populations, spread to other localities, including the Americas would not be surprising.

[2] French Polynesia and Guillain Barre syndrome

Oehler E, Watrin L, Larre P, Leparc-Goffart I, Lastere S, Valour F, Baudouin L, Mallet HP, Musso D, Ghawche F. Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome - case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.

Abstract:
Zika fever, considered an emerging disease of arboviral origin because of its expanding geographic area, is known as a benign infection usually presenting as an influenza-like illness with cutaneous rash. So far, Zika virus infection has never led to hospitalisation. We describe the 1st case of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) occurring immediately after a Zika virus infection, during the current Zika and type 1 and 3 dengue fever co-epidemics in French Polynesia.

Background [summarized]:
Infection is reported to be symptomatic in 18 per cent of cases only. When symptomatic, Zika [virus] infection usually presents as an influenza-like syndrome, often mistaken with other arboviral infections like dengue or chikungunya. The typical form of the disease associates a low-grade fever (between 37.8 C - 38.5 C [100 F - 101.8 F]), arthralgia, notably of small joints of hands and feet, with possible swollen joints, myalgia, headache, retroocular headaches, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous maculopapular rash. Digestive troubles (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation), mucous membrane ulcerations (aphthae), and pruritus [itch] can be more rarely observed. A post-infection asthenia [weakness] seems to be frequent.

Confirmed diagnosis is given by RT-PCR, which specifically detects the virus during viraemia. In-house ELISA serological tests can testify for the presence of ZIKA IgM and flaviviruses IgG, whereby specificity is determined by seroneutralisation.

Discussion and conclusion:
During this ongoing Zika fever outbreak in French Polynesia, we report the 1st case of GBS developing 7 days after an influenza-like illness evoking Zika [virus] infection. Based on IgM/IgG serological results and PNRT, which, according to our experience, is reliable and specific enough to differentiate a recent Zika [virus] infection from cross-reactions due to former infections to DENV, we believe that this is the 1st case of hospitalisation because of a severe Zika [virus] infection.

Since the beginning of this epidemic, and as up to 8200 cases of Zika [virus] infection have already been reported [out] of a 268 000 total population, the incidence of GBS has been multiplied by 20 in French Polynesia (data not shown), raising the assumption of a potential implication of Zika [virus infections].

Underlying physiopathological mechanisms of Zika-related GBS are unknown and could be of immunological origin as described with other infectious agents. There is also no explanation for the emergence of this previously un-described complication, which could lie in a genetic evolution of the virus to a more pathogenic genotype, or a particular susceptibility in the Polynesian population.

As suggested by DENV and Zika [virus] serological tests in our patient, the simultaneous epidemics of type 1 and 3 dengue fever may also be a predisposing factor for developing GBS during Zika fever, as DENV infection had also been associated with GBS. Our patient, like others who also presented with GBS, harboured serological markers of resolute dengue and recent Zika [virus] infections. This raises the hypothesis of a sequential arboviral immune stimulation responsible for such unusual clustering of GBS cases during concurrent circulation of Zika [virus] and 2 dengue [virus] serotypes. The risk of developing GBS would be consequently underlain by a specific sequence of DENV and Zika [virus] infections.

Therefore, in endemic areas, clinicians should be aware of the risk of diffuse demyelinating disorders [disorders involving damage to the myelin sheath of neurons] in case of Zika [virus] infection.

[Clinicians should be on alert for cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in areas where Zika virus is being transmitted.
