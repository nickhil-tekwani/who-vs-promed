RABIES VACCINE, REACTIONS - BRAZIL (SAO PAULO) (02)
***************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: "Dr. Oscar P. Larghi" <oplarghi@drwebsa.com.ar>

My original msg was posted in the Rabies List, Pasteur, Paris and
in ProMED-mail (29 Nov & 3 Dec 1999, respectively). I also sent it
to ProMED-Port but I have not seen it posted. [That will be rectified
- Mod.JW]
The response to the posts, so far, is as follows:
1. Dr. D. D. Joshi, Director of Zoonoses, Nepal, reported the
occurrence of neurological post-vaccinal reactions (PVR) due to BPL
inactivated sheep brain vaccine. In 1998, 29 000 persons received
PET but the number of PVR was not reported. Since the vaccine is
prepared with nervous tissue of adult animals, a high ratio of
reactions would be expected.
2. Dr. A. King reported PVR in Vietnam due to SMBV [suckling
mouse brain vaccine] among the 500 000 PET administered per
year. The actual ratio of neurological reactions and the quality
control of the vaccine are unknown.
3. Dr. Recka, one of the SMBV producers in Brazil, reported that
the Sao Paulo PVR cases for 1997 have not been filed at the
Federal Public Health Ministry in Brazil [neither have they been
reported to the PAHO/WHO INPPAZ Rabies Epidemiological
Surveillance for the Americas] and that the vaccine is prepared
today with the same procedure applied for more than 20 years.
As far as I see it, two possibilities would justify the few reports
received 15 days after the postings:
1. The Rabies List and ProMED-mail do not reach Latin American
colleagues.
2. The PVRs in Sao Paulo, Brazil was a local episode.
If number 2 is the case, health officers in that state should make an
effort to obtain samples of vaccines related to the reactions, to try
to identify in them mouse myelin or its basic protein.
