A total of 2 inmates have chickenpox at Two Rivers Correctional Institution, Umatilla [in Umatilla County], the Oregon Department of Corrections confirmed on Friday [12 Jul 2013] in a news release.

The cases have prompted the institution to move to modified operations, which means prison officials canceled visiting until further notice. Corrections spokeswoman Liz Craig said the prison also canceled this weekend's inmate/family events.

[Outbreaks of chickenpox are not uncommon in closed communities where contagious virus can spread rapidly. Chickenpox is a very contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a herpes virus. It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. It can also be spread by touching or breathing in the virus particles that come from chickenpox blisters. Chickenpox most commonly causes an illness that lasts about 5-10 days.

The classic symptom of chickenpox is a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters that eventually turn into scabs. The rash may 1st show up on the face, chest, and back, then spread to the rest of the body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area. It usually takes about one week for all the blisters to become scabs. Some people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease. However, the symptoms are usually milder with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. About 25 to 30 percent of vaccinated people who get chickenpox will develop illness as serious as chickenpox in unvaccinated persons.

Chickenpox vaccine is safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, it is usually mild -- with fewer blisters and mild or no fever. The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe disease (for further information, see: http://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/index.html).

Shingles, also known as zoster or herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Anyone who has recovered from chickenpox may develop shingles; even children can get shingles. However, the risk of getting the disease increases as a person gets older. About half of all cases occur among men and women who are 60 years old or older. People who have medical conditions that keep their immune systems from working properly, such as certain cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and people who receive immunosuppressive drugs, such as steroids and drugs given after organ transplantation, are also at greater risk of getting shingles. People who develop shingles typically have only one episode. In rare cases, however, a person can have a 2nd or even a 3rd episode. - Mod.CP
