The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) among cattle, even vaccinated animals, has been worrying the officials of the animal husbandry department.

According to sources, at least 4 FMD cases have been reported in the State [Andhra Pradesh] including one animal affected with the disease at the Frozen Semen Bull Station in Karimnagar. The rest were reported at a research centre in Nandyal of Kurnool district, Tirupati zoo [Chittoor district], and a private dairy in Ranga Reddy district.

The animals in South India are being usually vaccinated for O-type virus in addition to 3 other types -- C, A, and Asia 1 [see comment below]. The vaccination is being conducted twice a year with a 6 month gap following the strict protocols. FMD is one of the World Organisation for Animal Health's (OIE) listed diseases.

Continuous rain in the State in the recent past is being attributed as one of the causes of the outbreak of FMD in the incidents mentioned above. "Food, fodder, and water contamination may be one of the reasons for the outbreak. Though, not many animals were affected with FMD, we treat it as an outbreak. This was reported to national animal disease testing laboratories and we are waiting for their report," Dr Dasyam Venkateswarlu, Commissioner and Director, Animal Husbandry told The Hindu.

Stating that crossbred animals are susceptible to FMD, Mr Venkateswarlu said that this would be proven economically disastrous for the farmers as the animals would be crippled and milk yield would be reduced. More than 2000 animals reportedly died due to FMD in Karnataka in recent past.

[Andhra Pradesh (area, 275 045 sq km/106 200 sq mi; district map at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/andhrapradesh/andhrapradesh-district-map.jpg) is the 4th state in Southern India recently reporting FMD. The others are Kamataka (191 791 sq km/74 050 sq mi), Tamil Nadu (130 058 sq km/50 215 sq mi), and Kerala (38 863 sq km/15 000 sq mi); see maps at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/2JmE. The combined surface area of the 4 states is similar to the surface area of France.

The concerning news is the possibility that vaccinated animals are affected. This issue is in need of an immediate, careful investigation; if confirmed, the causative agent should be examined at the earliest opportunity by a national and, preferably, also international reference laboratories, to obtain a complete profile of the strain(s) and indication for the vaccine strains of choice. Results of the expected serotyping and genotyping will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
