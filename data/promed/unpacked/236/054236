The World Health Organization on Wednesday [3 Nov 2021] called for the urgent development of a vaccine against a bacterial infection responsible for nearly 150 000 stillbirths and infant deaths each year.

A fresh report by the UN health agency and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine [https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/immunization-analysis-and-insights/vaccine-impact-value/group-b-streptococcus-full-value-of-vaccine-assessment] found that the impact of Group B streptococcus infection (GBS) [_Streptococcus agalactiae_], which is estimated to live harmlessly in the intestinal tracts of up to 1/3 of all adults, is a far bigger cause of preterm births and disability than previously thought. The report confirmed a previous devastating finding from 2017 that the bacterium causes almost 100 000 newborn deaths and close to 50 000 stillbirths each year, although it pointed to significant data gaps suggesting the true figures could be higher.

And for the 1st time, it quantified the impact on preterm births, finding that GBS is behind more than half a million early deliveries each year, leading to significant long-term disability.

In light of such staggering numbers, the report authors lamented that more progress had not been made towards developing a vaccine. "This new research shows that Group B strep is a major and underappreciated threat to newborn survival and well-being, bringing devastating impacts for so many families globally," Phillipp Lambach of WHO's immunisation department said in a statement. "WHO joins partners in calling for urgent development of a maternal GBS vaccine, which would have profound benefits in countries worldwide."

Professor Joy Lawn, who heads LSHTM's maternal adolescent, reproductive and child health centre, agreed. "Maternal vaccination could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of babies in the years to come," she said, decrying the lack of progress since the idea of developing a jab against GBS was first raised 3 decades ago.

On average, 15% of pregnant women worldwide, or nearly 20 million annually, carry the GBS bacterium in their vagina. But even though most of these cases show no symptoms, an infected pregnant woman can pass GBS to her foetus via the amniotic fluid, or during birth as the infant passes through the vaginal canal.

Babies and foetuses are particularly vulnerable because their immune systems are not strong enough to fight the multiplying bacteria. If untreated, GBS can lead to meningitis and septicaemia, which can be deadly. Babies that survive may develop cerebral palsy, or permanent sight and hearing problems. Wednesday's [3 Nov 2021] report showed that the bacterium leaves some 40 000 infants each year with neurological impairments.

Currently, women with GBS are given antibiotics during labour to reduce the chance of it passing to their baby. But this approach poses problems in places where screening and antibiotic administration during labour are less accessible.

Tellingly, the highest rates of maternal GBS are found in sub-Saharan Africa -- which alone accounts for around 1/2 of the global burden -- and Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the study showed.

It suggested that a GBS vaccine that could be administered to pregnant women during routine pregnancy check-ups and that reached over 70% of pregnant women could avert 50 000 infant and foetus deaths each year.

[Group B streptococcus (GBS), or _Streptococcus agalactiae_, is a Gram positive, beta-hemolytic bacterium that is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule belonging to Lancefield group B. Capsular polysaccharide has been identified as a major virulence factor of GBS (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6919605/). There are 10 distinct GBS serotypes (Ia, Ib, II-IX), based on the immunologic specificity of the polysaccharide capsule (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2134722/?page=1).

GBS colonize the GI and genitourinary tract of many healthy humans, including pregnant women, but can cause severe invasive infections in newborns, the elderly, and people compromised by underlying diseases such as diabetes. Diseases caused by GBS include urinary tract infection, skin and soft-tissue infection, bacteremia, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and endocarditis. GBS can also cause serious infections in the mother during (for example, chorioamnionitis) and after (for example, endometritis and sepsis) delivery and in the baby during gestation and up to 3 months after delivery (for example, sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis). GBS can be transmitted to the fetus via the amniotic fluid or to the neonate during exposure to infected secretions in the course of vaginal delivery.

Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of early onset neonatal GBS infection (https://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0501/p1106.html) but does not protect against late-onset (after the 1st 7 days of life up until 3 months of age) GBS infection, which can be acquired postnatally (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4530403/).

A vaccine given to pregnant women to stimulate maternal anti-GBS IgG can protect the mother against maternal infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal IgG is also transported across the placenta, which can provide the infant with passive immunity that can protect against early onset and late-onset GBS disease. However, no vaccine is currently available, although several are in development (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32891191/).

There are several articles that discuss the current status of GBS vaccines, including (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470735/, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196769/, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314413/).

Abstract
--------
"Group B_Streptococcus_ (GBS) causes a high burden of neonatal and infant disease globally. Implementing a vaccine for pregnant women is a promising strategy to prevent neonatal and infant GBS disease and has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organisation (WHO). GBS serotype-specific polysaccharide - protein conjugate vaccines are at advanced stages of development, but a large number of participants would be required to undertake Phase III clinical efficacy trials. Efforts are therefore currently focused on establishing serocorrelates of protection in natural immunity studies as an alternative pathway for licensure of a GBS vaccine, followed by Phase IV studies to evaluate safety and effectiveness. Protein vaccines are in earlier stages of development but are highly promising as they might confer protection irrespective of serotype. Further epidemiological, immunological and health economic studies are required to enable the vaccine to reach its target population as soon as possible." - Mod.ML]
