Florida releases of Gulf hatchery-grown redfish are apparently dead in the
water
-----------------------------------------------
According to a Byron Stout article in the Fort Myers News-Press, the
discovery of cataracts in hatchery-raised redfish put a halt to releases.
Virtually all of the redfish fingerlings at the Port Manatee hatchery on
Tampa Bay were diagnosed as diseased, along with 30 to 50 per cent at
Sanibel's REDstart facility. As in humans, cataracts cause cloudy vision in
fish, possibly affecting their ability to find food or avoid predation.
"In 2005, we didn't release any of those fish with cataracts," said Luiz
Barbieri, head of fisheries research at Florida Marine Research Institute.
"We don't know the cause."
Genetic factors have been ruled out, leaving scientists to look at
environmental problems. Water for the facilities is drawn from adjacent bays.
Every redfish at the Sanibel REDstart facility later died in an unexplained
overnight event. Along with affected hatchery fish, samplings of wild
populations in Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor and the Atlantic coast's St
Lucie Estuary have also found cataracts. Coincidentally, Tampa Bay and
Charlotte Harbor were subjected to severe inundations from with red tide
algae in 2005, while the St. Lucie Estuary once again got blasted by Lake
Okeechobee releases, resulting in prolonged turbidity and toxic blue-green
algae exposure.
Of the unknown pollutants which cost Florida a year class of redfish
stocking, Barbieri noted, "I would be much more apprehensive if we were not
moving to a new facility with state-the-art filtration systems that will
allow us to have much better control of those kinds of issues." Bishop's
Harbor is being looked at as a possible relocation site.

[Causes of cataracts in fish unrelated to trauma usually include aging,
chronically poor water quality, and deficiencies of several vitamins,
including riboflavin. It would seem that the approach of examining the diet
and the environment may be the most appropriate. - Mod.TG]
