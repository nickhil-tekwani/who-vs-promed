Tuberculosis of cattle registered in 43 Arkhangelsk farms during 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Tuberculosis of cattle has been registered in 45 farms of the
Arkhangelsk region in 2006, in 43 cattle raising operations. This
information was provided by Ivan Lochekhin, head of the veterinary
administration office of Arkhangelsk during a meeting of
veterinarians on 14 Mar 2007.
The head of the office said that, according to tests performed by
specialists, 228 head of cattle have been found positive for
tuberculosis during 2006. The districts where the cases have been
registered are Velskiy, Shenkurskiy and Kargopolskiy. 26 animals were
compulsorily slaughtered for control purposes.
The reason given for the appearance of this dangerous disease was
"lack of responsibility by the managers of these farms," since, in
many cases, people with TB worked on the farms.

[Bovine tuberculosis is, unfortunately, still present in most
European countries. According to the most recent information
available on OIE's web site, 30 out of Europe's 46 countries were
still TB-infected in 2004. The TB-free countries were (in brackets,
last year of occurrence): Cyprus (1928), Austria (2002), Czech
Republic (2002), Denmark (1988), Estonia (1986), Finland (1982),
Iceland (1959), Latvia (1989), Lithuania (2001), Malta (2001),
Moldavia (2000), Netherlands (2002), Norway (1986), Slovakia (1968),
Sweden (1997), & Switzerland (2000). Russia is included among the
Bovine-TB infected countries.
For the procedures of TB-tests in bovines, particularly the commonly
applied intra-dermal tuberculine test, subscribers are referred to
chapter 2.3.3. of OIE's manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00054.htm>.
Though it might be assumed that the above information on TB in
Arkhangelsk (see map at
<http://www.nordictravel.ru/arkhangelsk/map.html>)
is related to bovine tuberculosis, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_,
the last passage therein -- attributing the cases to "people with TB
(who) worked on the farms" -- is rather puzzling. The scenario of
wide-spread human infection with _M. bovis_ as the source of
infection in cattle farms is rather doubtful; although infection of
dairy cows with _M. tuberculosis_ from infected dairymen is known to
occur, it is highly questionable whether the cattle on most or all of
the 43 mentioned farms were infected by the human strain. See also
moderator's commentary in 20061009.2896.
Firsthand, scientifically-based information, accompanied by test
statistics and results, will help to clarify the situation. - Mod.AS]
