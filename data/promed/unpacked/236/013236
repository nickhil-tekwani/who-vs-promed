As a practitioner of healthcare epidemiology from the public health
perspective, I am concerned that discussion of the sensitivity of additional
screening tools for the blood supply is causing us to lose sight of the
forest.
The U.K. Public Health Laboratory Service collects data on major
complications of blood transfusions in the U.K. called Serious Hazards of
Transfusion (SHOT). Its first annual report was in Communicable Disease
Report (CDR) Weekly, 8:20 March 1998,105. Of 141 adverse events reported to
SHOT, 8 cases (6%) were of infection, including one each of the 3 hepatitis
viruses and HIV. Three (HBV, HCV, and HIV) were due to donations collected
from donors in the window period.
In contrast, the most common adverse events were episodes in which patients
received a blood component intended for another patient (44%)!
Extrapolating from the Harvard Medical Practice Study in New York, medical
therapy results in unintended injuries in 1.3 million people each year in
the United States, with 180 000 annual deaths. A high percentage,
two-thirds in some estimates, of these events are preventable. Adverse drug
events are one of the most common categories of adverse events, with a major
cause being errors in the prescribing and management of drug therapy. Even
though preventing adverse events is cost effective, as adding additional
testing of the blood supply may be cost effective, there is little evidence
that the health care system in any country is addressing this effectively.
Much of the focus on the blood supply seems to be reflective of public
concern. Possibly public awareness of the risk of other adverse events
associated with health care, particularly in hospitals, would affect these
priorities.
Any opinions expressed are those of the subscriber and not of the California
