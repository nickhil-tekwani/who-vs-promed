A 3rd child from one family has been admitted to hospital with
suspected botulism after eating curry sauce. 2 of the child's siblings
have already been confirmed as having botulism, after they were taken
to hospital last week [week of 7 Nov 2011]. They had all eaten a Loyd
Grossman-branded korma sauce, made by Premier Foods.

NHS Forth Valley said the child is in the Royal Hospital for Sick
Children in Glasgow with suspected botulism and that further
investigations are being carried out. The 2 siblings, from the Forth
Valley area in central Scotland, were admitted to the same hospital
last week. Their condition is said to be improving.

The health board said the suspected source of the botulism for the new
case is the same jar of Loyd Grossman korma sauce used by the family.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) advised the public not to consume jars
from a batch of the sauce, which it has recalled from shop shelves.
The recalled 350g jars have a best-before date of February 2013 and
bear the batch code
1218R. Only one jar from the batch is known to have been contaminated
with the bacteria that causes botulism, the FSA said.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said preliminary tests on the used
jar identified the toxin that causes botulism. It has notified health
professionals across the UK of the situation and advised them to look
out for people of all ages with possible symptoms.

HPA said it is working with Scottish authorities and the Food
Standards Agency on the investigation. Dr Kathie Grant, a botulinum
toxin expert at HPA, said: "Cases of botulism are thankfully very rare
in the UK, although it can be a very serious infection in those that
are affected. We urge the public to take heed of this message and
ensure that they immediately dispose of this product and to be aware
of the signs and symptoms of botulism, which include blurred vision,
difficulty swallowing, headaches, and muscle weakness."

[A 3rd sibling has been diagnosed with botulism after ingesting some
of the implicated curry sauce. It is somewhat curious that no
additional cases related to this commercial product have occurred. The
article stated that the toxin had been identified in the used jar but
does not state the type of botulinum toxin (likely either A or B)
involved. - Mod.LL]
