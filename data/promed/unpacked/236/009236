Abstract
--------
While anthrax is typically associated with bioterrorism, in many parts of the world the anthrax bacillus (_Bacillus anthracis_) is endemic in soils where it causes sporadic disease in livestock. These soils are typically rich in organic matter and calcium that promote survival of resilient _B. anthracis_ spores. Outbreaks of anthrax tend to occur in warm weather following rains that are believed to concentrate spores in low lying areas where runoff collects. It has been concluded that elevated spore concentrations are not the result of vegetative growth, as _B. anthracis_ compete poorly against indigenous bacteria.

Here we test an alternative hypothesis in which amoeba, common in moist soils and pools of standing water, serve as amplifiers of _B. anthracis_ spores by enabling germination and intracellular multiplication. Under simulated environmental conditions, we show that _B. anthracis_ germinate and multiply within _Acanthamoeba castellanii_. The growth kinetics of fully virulent _B. anthracis_ Ames strain (containing both the pX01 and pX02 virulence plasmids) and vaccine strain Sterne (containing only pX01) inoculated as spores in coculture with _A. castellanii_ showed a nearly 50-fold increase in spore numbers after 72 hours. In contrast, the plasmidless strain 9131 showed little growth, demonstrating that plasmid pX01 is essential for growth within _A. castellanii_. Electron and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy revealed that spores germinate within amoebal phagosomes, vegetative bacilli undergo multiplication and, following demise of the amoeba, bacilli sporulate in the extracellular milieu. This analysis supports our hypothesis that amoeba contribute to the persistence and amplification of _B. anthracis_ in natural environments.

[This paper floats a very interesting hypothesis that soil amoebae facilitate the multiplication of _Bacillus anthracis_ in soil, and especially wet soil. While the paper is suitably conservative, Glomski optimistically sees it answering many, many questions in the field; see http://www.healthcanal.com/public-health-safety/33083-Anthrax-can-grow-reproduce-soil-School-Medicine-discovers.html.

While this is just a laboratory series of experiments which await confirmation and are a long way from the realities of actual circumstances in the field -- how often do we see successful laboratory observations that totally fail in the field? -- it is not unattractive. And there are parallels in spores being collected in the lung alveoli by macrophages and parallel plasmid functions. Pragmatically however, there is a great difference between an organism managing to persist in soil and on the other hand achieving an LD50 density adequate to kill a grazing cow. The former is merely interesting, the latter is relevant.

The ecology of _B. anthracis_ is an emerging subject of research which stimulates ever new questions. Other soil aspects are the x250 multiplication (and prompt re-sporulation) of the 3 percent of spores that germinate in soil, and the multiplication in contact with the root fimbriae of fescue plants. See http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299709000612.

There is a lot going on in the soil besides spore survival. But one must keep in mind that most contaminated sites have a job maintaining that level of risk, otherwise we would be annually vaccinating livestock on all those thousands of farms and ranches affected from 1900 through 1960. Once one prevents new-outbreak recontamination by vaccination the risk eventually goes away. But presented with a farm with a persistent contaminated site, such as, an old cattle grave, one should take the opportunity of considering more observations than merely counting the number of spores per gram of (grave) soil. - Mod.MHJ]
