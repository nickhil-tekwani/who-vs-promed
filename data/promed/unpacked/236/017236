A rare disease found in dogs is making its way around west Los Angeles County. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease, causing kidney failure and sometimes death. Animal health experts say they have seen an alarming increase of cases, calling it an "epidemic." Most cases are from the San Fernando Valley. There have been no reports of a death of a dog from the disease, but officials urge people to get their pets vaccinated as soon as possible.

Veterinarians on LA's Westside are baffled as dogs are coming into their offices sick with leptospirosis. It's a bacterial disease associated with the waste from rats; it is usually seen in rural areas where rats are more abundant. [Other animals can also carry and transmit the disease. - Mod.TG]

Lepto, as it's commonly known, can lead to kidney disease and can be fatal. However, it's easily treatable with common antibiotics, if caught early, which is problematic because it's not usually tested for.

[CK] took her dog to the emergency after the young retriever collapsed a couple of weeks ago. The dog stayed at the animal hospital for a couple of nights, as "they tested for everything, from his heart to his hips," she explains. It wasn't until he was diagnosed with lepto and put on antibiotics that he started getting better.

LA County Health has confirmed a sharp increase of cases during July [2021], with at least one doggie day care affected. Dr. Alan Schulman, a Westside veterinarian, says he knows of at least 2 facilities having had outbreaks.

"The good news is it's easy to clean the bacteria with a good cleaning in a facility like that. The bad news is that the bacteria can live for months in the dirt, like the dog parks where some of our sick dogs are also getting infected," he stated.

Dr. Schulman believes the sudden outbreak is the result of an increase in rats around homeless encampments proliferating in parks.

Animals can infect other animals and humans. LA County Health officials say they've had no human cases but are following the outbreak among dogs, which can be vaccinated.

Dr. Schulman fears a full-blown epidemic and predicts veterinaries may have to regularly start vaccinating dogs for lepto, just like they do for other diseases like parvo.

Common signs of lepto in dogs include excessive urination and drinking water. Fever and loss of appetite follow, with eyes yellowing as kidneys stop functioning. Younger dogs tend to get sicker. Again, if caught early, it's easily treatable with antibiotics.

["Leptospirosis in Dogs

"What is leptospirosis?
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease of dogs and other mammals that primarily affects the liver or kidneys. The bacteria (_Leptospira_) that cause leptospirosis, commonly called leptospires, thrive in water, and they have a helical or spiral shape with a characteristic hook on one or both ends. There are many species and serovars (strains) of _Leptospira_, some of which cause disease in dogs. Leptospirosis in cats is very rare and is not associated with clinical disease.

"How common is leptospirosis?
Leptospirosis is uncommon in areas where widespread vaccination of dogs is routine. Outbreaks of the disease are still seen from time to time, however, because vaccines protect only against the 4 most prevalent serovars of _Leptospira_. Leptospirosis is more common in rural, wooded areas. Increased numbers of cases are seen in the South, Midwest, East Coast, and Appalachian regions.

"How are dogs infected?
_Leptospira_ bacteria are carried mainly by rats and other rodents, but can be carried by almost any mammal, including people. Infected or recovered carrier dogs may act as a source of the infection.

"Ingestion of infected urine or rodent-contaminated garbage is the most important means of transmission, but some forms of the bacteria can penetrate damaged or thin skin. For instance, when dogs swim in contaminated water, they may become infected through their skin. The incubation period (from infection to onset of clinical signs) is usually 4-12 days.

"What are the signs of leptospirosis?
Many _Leptospira_ infections go undetected, but other cases can be life-threatening. Certain strains (serovars) of _Leptospira_ are more likely to be associated with disease than other strains.

"There are 3 main forms of the disease:
1. Hemorrhagic (bleeding). In hemorrhagic disease there is high fever with lethargy and loss of appetite. Multiple small hemorrhages (areas of bleeding) occur in the mouth and on the whites of the eyes. Bloody diarrhea and vomiting may occur. This form is often fatal.
2. Icteric or jaundice (liver). The icteric or jaundice form begins like the hemorrhagic form, and many of the clinical signs are the same. An additional clinical sign is the presence of a yellow color (jaundice or icterus) in the mouth and whites of the eyes. In severe cases, the skin will turn yellow.
3. Renal (kidney). The renal form causes kidney failure. These dogs are very lethargic, anorectic (unwilling to eat), and may vomit. Their breath may have an offensive odor, and ulcers often develop on the tongue. Other signs include diarrhea, excessive drinking (polydipsia), and excessively frequent urination (polyuria). There may be red staining of the urine (caused by blood). The dog may be reluctant to move and may show abdominal discomfort. Fever is variable, and temperature may actually be below normal in the more advanced stage. Dogs that survive the acute renal form may be left with chronic kidney disease.

"How is leptospirosis diagnosed?
Because the clinical signs are variable and easily confused with other diseases, definitive diagnosis can be difficult. There are 2 tests that can be used for the diagnosis of leptospirosis.

"The DNA-PCR test looks for the presence of genetic material from the _Leptospira_ bacteria in the blood or urine. The MAT (microscopic agglutination test) looks for the presence of antibodies formed against leptospirosis. Each of these tests has its own unique benefits and disadvantages.

"A single test finding of _Leptospira_ antibody, even if the blood level (titer) is high, may not mean the dog has leptospirosis, because infection with less harmful serovars can still result in high antibody.

"What is the treatment?
Antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin are reasonably effective against the acute stages of leptospirosis if begun early. These antibiotics treat the early stages of infection, making the dog feel better, although most affected dogs require intensive care in the veterinary hospital.

"An extended course of antibiotics, typically doxycycline, is then prescribed in the recovery period to ensure that all the _Leptospira_ bacteria are cleared, and the dog does not become a chronic carrier.

"How can leptospirosis be prevented?
The vaccine for leptospirosis is not always part of the routine vaccination program for all dogs. Your veterinarian will consider the risks and options for your pet. Revaccinating annually is often needed to maintain best immunity. The 4-serovar vaccine is currently the only vaccine recommended by experts.

"Can the vaccine cause side effects?
Modern vaccines are extremely effective and safe. Many pets experience mild side effects following vaccination, similar to those that humans experience. Other less common but more serious side effects can occur within minutes to hours after vaccination. Vaccine reactions can be controlled medically, so if you are concerned, call your veterinarian immediately.

"Vaccine reactions are more likely to occur if many different vaccinations are given at the same time. Vaccine recommendations should always be based on individual pet lifestyle, so speak to your veterinarian to determine whether this vaccine is recommended for your pet.

"Reactions to the leptospirosis vaccine usually take the form of lethargy for a few days and possibly loss of appetite. In some dogs, an anaphylactic shock-like reaction may occur shortly after vaccination. Miniature dachshunds and West Highland white terriers seem to have slightly increased risk for this type of reaction. Other dogs may develop a skin rash (urticaria), apparent on hairless areas.

"Leptospirosis can be transmitted to people, so owners of dogs [having or possibly having] the disease should avoid contact between the owner's bare skin and their dog's urine, and wear rubber gloves when cleaning up any areas the dog may have soiled. Any areas where the dog has urinated should be disinfected. The organism is readily killed by household disinfectants or a dilute bleach solution."

Dogs especially can easily pick up the bacteria. It can be in water or from other animals, including rodents, squirrels, and some reptiles. Dogs often sniff and then taste or lick an area before determining if the location is worthy of their urine. The canine habit of licking can infect them with this bacterium.

Dogs should be vaccinated against this disease if they frequent dog parks or play areas where any rodents could be. Since a dog may have lepto for a while before owners become aware of a difference in their pet, the dog could easily spread it for several weeks. In many areas it is standard practice to vaccinate against leptospirosis.

Owners can acquire this disease through cleaning of urine from their pet or stepping in a small puddle of rodent urine while barefoot, or by getting it on their skin while playing outdoor sports. The bacteria are very good at penetrating the skin. They are microscopic and easily could go unnoticed. - Mod.TG
