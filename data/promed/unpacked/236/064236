Orthoreovirus Co-infection in SARS patients
-------------------------------------------
On Fri 17 Oct 2003, Dr. Steve Berger drew attention to a recently-published
finding that 1.2 to 2.9 percent of healthy individuals tested in Guangdong
were seropositive for SARS-associated coronavirus [see: SARS - worldwide
(177): serosurvey China animal traders 20031017.2618].
A study published in China in July 2003 may be of interest in light of this
apparent anomaly. The study, conducted by the Academy of Military Medical
Sciences (AMMS), states that while the SARS coronavirus "has been
confirmed" as the cause of SARS, the presence of reovirus in 24 of 38 serum
samples taken from SARS patients, and only 1 of 35 subjects in a healthy
control group, suggests the possibility of co-infection. The authors
conclude, with due caution, that SARS could be a combination of the [SARS]
coronavirus and [a] reovirus.
This week, following a conference on SARS in Guangzhou on 14 Oct 2003,
Chinese media has given extensive coverage to this study, labeling reovirus
the other possible "culprit" behind SARS. The AMMS study is available
online in English in the Chinese Science Bulletin:

[The study in the Chinese Science Bulletin (Vol. 48 No. 13 1293-1296,
2003), referred to above by Dan Silver, states that the initial diagnosis
of reovirus infection was on the basis of electron microscopy. Subsequently
primers designed to detect reovirus (presumably the orthoreoviruses types
1, 2 and 3, which infect mammals) amplified several genome fragments, one
of which was sequenced (an S2 -- core protein -- gene fragment), confirming
the presumption of reovirus co-infection. Preliminary animal experiments
showed that inoculation of the orthoreovirus into mice caused death with
atypical pneumonia.
The significance of these data is unclear. It is conceivable that the
expression of the disease known as SARS is dependent on the presence of one
or more co-factors, which may or may not be other infectious agents.
Previously published data have suggested that Human metapneumovirus, a
common respiratory virus, might be such a co-factor, but this has not been
universally substantiated. The evidence for identification of an
orthoreovirus as a co-factor is similarly circumstantial; certainly the
frequency of detection of orthoreovirus in SARS patients was greater than
that in the normal population, but not all (14 of 38) SARS patients were
orthoreovirus-positive. The concern is that viruses such as human
metapneumovirus and the 3 types of mammalian orthoreovirus are ubiquitous
in the normal population. Whereas an orthoreovirus might be a good
candidate for inclusion in a general class of co-factors, it is less likely
to be a specific co-factor. The transmission of orthoreoviruses is by the
enteric or respiratory route. Orthoreoviruses infect a wide range of
animals and are distributed worldwide. Human orthoreoviruses are generally
benign, but may cause upper respiratory tract illness or rarely -- in
infants and children -- enteritis. Experimentally in mice, orthoreoviruses
may cause a wide spectrum of disease, and viruses isolated from primates
have been associated with neurological disease. Avian orthoreoviruses can
cause severe disease outbreaks in domestic flocks but do not infect
mammals. - Mods.CP/MPP]
