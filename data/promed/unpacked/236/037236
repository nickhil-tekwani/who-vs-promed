CDC Update: West Nile Virus Resurfaces in 24 U.S. States
--------------------------------------------
U.S. health officials reported on Mon 9 Jun 2003 that West Nile
virus had resurfaced in 2 dozen states, but they stopped short of
predicting another record outbreak of the deadly mosquito-borne
disease. West Nile has been detected in birds, horses and
mosquitoes in at least 24 states so far this year, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has tracked
the virus since it first emerged in the United States in 1999. No
human cases have been reported this year.

Dr. Stephen Ostroff, deputy director of the CDC's national center for
infectious diseases, said it was unclear whether the mosquitoes
responsible for spreading the virus would pose as much of a health
risk to the public as they did in 2002. "Whether or not this season
will be a replay of last year is a little early to say," Ostroff said. He
did, however, advise people to start draining pools of water where
mosquitoes breed and to wear protective clothing and repellents
outside.

There were 4156 cases of West Nile virus infection, including 284
deaths, in the United States last year, according to the CDC. The
outbreak was the largest since the virus first appeared in the
Western Hemisphere 4 years ago. During the 2002 outbreak, CDC
officials confirmed the first known cases in which West Nile was
transmitted through organ transplants and blood transfusions. The
possibility the virus could be spread through breast milk or sexual
contact also has been studied. Although most people who contract
West Nile have no symptoms and those who do normally suffer little
more than flu-like illness, it is believed they still can carry small
amounts of the virus in their blood for several days.

It is estimated that up to 200 000 Americans may have been
exposed to West Nile since 1999, when it killed 7 people in the New
York City borough of Queens. An estimated 4.5 million Americans
receive blood or blood products annually. The prospect that the virus
could spread through the nation's blood supply prompted officials
with the Food and Drug Administration, blood banks and laboratories
to work this past winter on a way to screen blood for the virus. Dr.
Jesse Goodman, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics,
Evaluation and Research, said on Monday that 2 new tests would be
available for use in high-risk areas this summer. "We're still very
concerned about this and we'll have to see how these tests perform,"
Goodman said.

Oklahoma: First Equine Case of West Nile Virus Infection in 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------
A female foal in eastern Oklahoma is the first confirmed case
of West Nile virus infection in 2003, officials said on Mon 9 Juun
2003.State Veterinarian Burke Healey and Dr. Kristy Bradley, public
health veterinarian for the state Health Department, believe that the
diagnosis of a female foal in Sallisaw so early in the season is an
ominous sign. "Our concern is that this early case could translate
into a more severe epidemic of the disease during this year's
mosquito season," Bradley said.

No animal or human deaths have been linked to West Nile virus so
far. Oklahoma is now the 18th state to already have the virus in the
bird or horse population in 2003. In 2002, Oklahoma's first West Nile
virus case in a bird was reported 0n 18 Jul 2002. The first equine
case was reported on 9 Aug and the first human case on 26 Aug
2002. In all, 441 dead birds submitted for testing to the Oklahoma
Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Stillwater were West Nile
virus-positive. More than 2450 dead birds were tested. West Nile
virus killed 135 Oklahoma horses last year. Blood samples
from 964 horses and one zebra were tested. Of the 21 cases
confirmed in Oklahoma residents last year, 2 died.

The Sequoyah County foal was born on 1 Mar 2003, and on 26 May
began displaying symptoms of equine West Nile virus infection --
wobbling, stumbling, staggering, listlessness and depression, Healey
said. The mare wasn't sick, so officials suspect the foal was bitten
by a virus-infected mosquito well after birth, he said. A local
veterinarian administered antibiotics and anti-inflammatory
medications. The young horse recovered, and a blood sample sent
to Stillwater confirmed the virus, Healey said.

Healey advised Oklahoma farmers and ranchers to have their
horses vaccinated against West Nile virus. Bradley said state
residents should eliminate or treat pools of stagnant water, which are
breeding grounds for mosquitoes. _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes contract
the virus when they feed on infected birds, then transmit it to
animals and humans when bitten by the mosquito, Bradley
said.

[West Nile virus tends to make its first appearance a little later in the
year as observed in 2002 in Oklahoma. However, the mosquito
season in Oklahoma has been in full swing for some time and the
current equine infection cannot be considered to be early. In fact, it
would not be a surprise to find equine cases of West Nile virus
infection in March, April or May in Oklahoma or Texas. - Mod.TG]

Illinois: Second West Nile Virus-infected Bird Reported
-------------------------------------------------------
The Illinois Department of Public Health has reported a dead
crow in Kankakee in Kankakee County has tested positive for West
Nile virus.

This is the second dead bird in Illinois to test positive for West Nile
virus since surveillance for the mosquito-transmitted virus began on
1 May 2003. The first positive bird was reported in Henderson
County. Kankakee County is 60 miles south of Chicago.

USGS Surveillance Update, as of Wed 11 Jun 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the USGS reflect
information for the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season that has
been submitted and verified to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) up to Wed 11 Jun 2003.

The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are
created from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance
database. The maps portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive
surveillance data reported to the CDC by cooperating health
departments and verified to ArboNET. In addition, maps for 2
surveillance categories (avians and mosquitoes) will portray
counties that have done "testing" of samples for WNV.

Discrepancies noted between these data and data presented from
other sources reflect local variations in reporting policies and
procedures. It is not unusual for cases to be announced in other
media before being reported and verified in ArboNET.

The following information is a synopsis of the results of West Nile
virus surveillance listed according to state. The original USGS maps
further locate both positive and negative surveillance reports by
county. (The data are provisional and may be subject to revision.)

Birds
-----
20 states are conducting surveillance, with 15 states reporting
cumulative positive test results as follows:

Alabama (4), Florida (1), Georgia (9), Illinois (1), Iowa (2),
Kentucky (0), Louisiana (38), Michigan (3), Mississippi (3), New
Hampshire (0), New Jersey (1), New York (1), North Carolina (1)
Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), South Carolina (2), South Dakota
(0), Tennessee (1), Washington (0), Wyoming (1).

Mosquitoes
----------
3 states are conducting surveillance, with 2 states reporting
cumulative positive results as follows: Georgia (2), New Jersey (1),
Pennsylvania (0).

Sentinel Flocks
---------------
2 states are conducting surveillance, both reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Florida (34), North Carolina (1).

Veterinary
----------
7 states are conducting surveillance and all 7 are reporting
cumulative positive test results [presumed to be equines] as follows:

Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Georgia (1), Kentucky (1), Minnesota
(1), Wisconsin (1), Wyoming (1).

Human
-----
There are no reports of surveillance activity or positive test results
from any state. [A suspected case of human infection in
Washington state (see: West Nile virus, human - USA
(Washington): suspected 20030601.1334) has not been confirmed.
