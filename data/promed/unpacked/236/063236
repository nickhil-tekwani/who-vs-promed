The 3 years of data from Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College [Uttar Pradesh] has confirmed that the majority of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) patients admitted to the hospital between August and October each year have scrub typhus. This finding is important, given that scrub typhus can be treated easily if detected early. The 1st indication of scrub typhus' role came during a 2014 study at BRD by researchers from Karnataka's Manipal Centre for Viral Research. But there was much scepticism about this hypothesis then.

In the following years, however, other researchers reported similar findings. In 2015, a team led by the director of Chennai's National Institute of Epidemiology [Tamil Nadu], Manoj Murhekar, found that out of 370 AES patients tested during September-October, 63 percent had antibodies to scrub typhus. The findings were reported in the Journal of Infection. In 2016, out of 407 AES patients during the same period, 65 percent had the illness.

Also, when all AES patients were given azithromycin, a treatment for scrub typhus, 35 percent of non-scrub-typhus patients died, while only 15 percent of scrub patients died, indicating that azithromycin was effective. These findings were published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal in May this year [2018]. Finally, in 2017, over 50 percent of patients admitted to BRD in August-September were positive for scrub typhus, according to data shared with The Hindu by the Indian Council of Medical Research.

Study of mites
--------------
Further evidence for the role of scrub typhus comes from a study of trombiculid mites in eastern Uttar Pradesh by Chennai's Vector Control Research Centre (VCRC). They found that the mites carried _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, the bacterium which causes scrub typhus. While this study was published in Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases in July 2018, P Jambulingam, VCRC director, also told The Hindu that unpublished research has shown an increase in infestation of rodents by trombiculid mites during August-October. This explains why scrub typhus incidence peaks during monsoon, he said.

[The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive over recent years. Although scrub typhus may be responsible for many cases categorized as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), other etiological agents, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, and lychee fruit consumption have been implicated in the past. Japanese encephalitis virus infections have also been shown to be responsible for some of these cases. Prospective studies should help to rule out or include these etiologies. Reliable and timely laboratory support in hospitals and private clinics attending these encephalitis cases is critical in order to obtain a reliable diagnosis. - Mod.TY

A letter to the editor of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases in 2017 (Murhekar MV. Acute encephalitis syndrome and scrub typhus in India. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017;23(8):1434. https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2308.162028) listed several studies that document the role of scrub typhus in acute encephalitis syndrome in various regions of India. This letter is extracted below:

"To the Editor: I read with interest the article by Khan et al (1). The National Vector-borne Disease Control Program reported over 60 000 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India during 2010-2016; 8 states (Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Manipur, and Tripura) accounted for most cases (2). In many states, outbreaks of AES occur during the rainy season and are associated with high mortality rates. Following the national surveillance algorithm, AES cases are investigated for IgM against Japanese encephalitis, which accounted for over 15 per cent of AES cases. Khan et al reported 20 per cent of AES cases [hospitalized in Assam, 2013-2015] were due to scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_ infection) [and orientia DNA was detected by PCR in 9 (8.6 per cent) of the samples that were IgM-positive against _O. tsutsugamushi_] (1). In Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, 62.7 per cent of AES patients had _O. tsutsugamushi_ IgM, with a case fatality rate of 16.2 per cent (3). Studies have reported central nervous system (CNS) involvement among a substantial number of scrub typhus patients from Dehradun, Uttarakhand; Vellore, Tamil Nadu; Puducherry; and Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh (4,5). Given these findings, managers of the national program should consider investigations for scrub typhus as part of the surveillance algorithm for AES cases.

"Higher mortality rates among patients with AES could be attributed to delayed care. In Gorakhpur, where outbreaks of AES occur seasonally, the median interval between fever onset and hospitalization was 7 days (interquartile range 5-10 days) (3). Although intravenous azithromycin has been recommended for AES patients in Gorakhpur since 2014, fatality rates continue to be high, indicating low response to treatment after CNS involvement. Early treatment of patients with acute febrile illness with antimicrobial drugs such as doxycycline before CNS manifestations is critical. Assessing the contribution of scrub typhus among patients with acute febrile illness, developing algorithms for administering appropriate antimicrobial drugs, and educating healthcare providers about the use of doxycycline are crucial for reducing deaths among patients with AES in scrub typhus-endemic areas.
