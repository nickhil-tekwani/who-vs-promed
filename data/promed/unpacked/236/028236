LEGIONELLOSIS, CRAFT FAIR - FRANCE (LORRAINE)

During September 2006, 12 cases of legionellosis in the small town of
Lorquin, district of Moselle, north east France, were identified by the
local health authority in charge of legionellosis surveillance. All
patients had pneumonia; 11 tested positive for urinary antigen, indicating
a _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 infection; 2 also had positive
cultures, and one was diagnosed by a positive culture (Lp1).
Dates of symptom onset ranged from 11 to 19 Sep 2006 [for figure, see
original URL - Mod.LL]. The median age of the cases was 69 years (range
33-78 years), 66 per cent were men. None of the patients has died. No
additional cases have been detected since the onset of the last case on 19
Sep 2006.
Local and national health authorities started an epidemiological
investigation on 20 Sep 2006, interviewing patients using a standard
questionnaire. Patients were asked about their activities, including work
and leisure, in the 10 days before the onset of symptoms. The 11 patients
who responded to the questionnaire reported visiting or working at a craft
fair in Lorquin. The fair was held on 9-10 Sep 2006 in a sports center,
which housed 37 stands and attracted about 10 000 visitors.
As 11 of the patients were known to have visited the fair, a list of
aerosol-generating devices demonstrated during the fair was drawn up. One
whirlpool spa filled with water from the municipal supply at the sports
center was displayed. Water samples from the municipal water supply, the
water source used to fill it, and from the showers at the sports centre
were taken on 23 Sep 2006, and on 25 Sep 2006 from the whirlpool spa. No
legionella was found in any of these samples. Disinfection treatment was
done during the fair with an oxygen-based product, and after the fair by
chlorination. This could have affected the detection of legionellae.
The source of the outbreak was not proven, but there is reason to believe
the spa was responsible: 11 patients had visited or stayed at the fair, the
spa was the only aerosol-producing device displayed and none of the cooling
towers identified in the area tested positive when these were sampled in
Aug and Sep 2006.
Discussion
The inevitable delay between exposure and the recognition of an outbreak of
legionnaires' disease always means that the conditions in the potential
sources may have changed dramatically by the time they are investigated.
This is particularly true of whirlpool spas (synonyms: spa pools, hot tubs)
that may have been repeatedly drained and disinfected or, if on display,
moved to a new site. Water samples alone are often not sufficient. For
example, in one outbreak, the pool water did not yield legionellae but
large numbers of _Legionella pneumophila_ were found in swab samples of
biofilm from within the piping (1) and in an outbreak on a cruise liner,
the outbreak strain was detected by swab samples of the air channels
embedded in the pool shell even after the pool had been drained and
disinfected (2).

[This posting illustrates the principles behind evaluating a cluster of
cases of legionellosis and the pitfalls of confirming a definitive source.
Moselle is part of the current region of Lorraine and is surrounded by the
French departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Bas-Rhin, as well as Germany
(states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate) and Luxembourg in the north.
