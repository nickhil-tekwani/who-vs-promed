[The Mongolian economy relies heavily on agriculture and livestock. The spread of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) into Mongolia would impact significantly on the food security of the nation and the livelihoods of a large number of small-ruminant holders (2015 OIE data: 24.8 million sheep, 23.5 million goats). This animal population is fully susceptible to PPR, a virulent viral disease which had never been experienced in this country.

PPR was recorded in China for the 1st time in December 2013. When its circulation there increased, the Government of Mongolia, sharing a long (4677 km [2906 mile]) border with China, requested the assistance of FAO to assess the preparedness of the country in the event of PPR incursion.

During April 2014, FAO's Crisis Management Centre for Animal Health (CMC-AH) fielded a rapid deployment team of 4 experts to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in order to identify the risk factors of the disease spreading into Mongolia and neighboring countries. The team commended Mongolia's solid animal health infrastructure and the Government's significant investments in animal health providing laboratories with diagnostic kits and vaccines, while underlining the need for additional support in training and improvement of disease surveillance "due to the increased threat of transboundary animal diseases like PPR." They recommended that the Government of Mongolia implement "a series of activities, including: i) improving syndromic surveillance for small ruminant respiratory and enteric diseases; ii) training and awareness-raising activities; iii) enhancing laboratory capacity and sample submission; iv) ensuring timely access to PPR vaccine; v) developing a contingency plan in the event of an incursion of PPR; vi) reviewing animal health conditions for the importation of small ruminants; vii) completing a draft on animal health legislation and supporting its introduction to parliament; and viii) enhancing small ruminant health through Mongolia's partnership in the regional initiative to improve transboundary animal disease surveillance."

In FAO's publication of the said, May 2014 (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/news_060514b.html), it was stated that the Government of Mongolia aimed "to establish a reliable response system in the event of an incursion of PPR according to the FAO assessment of its preparedness levels."

Mongolia's proactive animal health policy and transparency are exemplary.

The 2 reported outbreaks, both in the Khovd aimag (province), western Mongolia, are situated 100-200 km [60-125 miles] from the borders with China and Russia. The distance from Kazakhstan is about similar, though the countries do not share a common border: the easternmost point of Kazakhstan is within 50 km [30 miles] or so of the westernmost tip of Mongolia, separated by a small part of Russia and China. For an effective response to the PPR outbreaks in Mongolia, information on the source and the time of the incursion is required.

In April 2016, FAO and OIE concluded consultations to develop a Global PPR Control and Eradication Program, based on a Roadmap Strategy. Regional roadmaps for the 15-year campaign were planned to be discussed in (9) regional meetings (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160511.4215729). A meeting targeting ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) countries plus China, Mongolia and East Timor, is scheduled for December 2016 in Qingdao, China.

In south/central/east Asia, PPR is known to be endemic in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bhutan. In 2007, it was reported from Tibet. In 2013, Tajikistan and several provinces of China have been added to the list. Its spread in China has continued since.

Between January 2013 through August 2015, China reported 249 PPR outbreaks. According to China's final report, the PPR event is not resolved, but the situation is "considered sufficiently stable," which means the disease is endemic in the country. See final report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015554_20151109_165525.pdf.

The situation in Asian countries west of China deserves to be assessed. PPR has not been officially reported from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, which belong to the Central Asian Roadmap region.

All outbreaks of PPR reported from 1 Jan 2014 to date can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/go3ad72 (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in).
