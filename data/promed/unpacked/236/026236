[2] Vaccine approved in Mexico
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2015
Source: New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/business/first-dengue-fever-vaccine-approved-by-mexico.html


A dengue fever vaccine developed by the French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi has been approved for use by Mexico, the 1st approval in the world for any vaccine for the disease, which afflicts 10s of millions of people around the world and is becoming an increasing threat.

Sanofi said in a news release Wednesday [9 Dec 2015] that the vaccine, which it is calling Dengvaxia, was approved by Mexico's Federal Commission for the Protection against Sanitary [Health] Risk for prevention of dengue in people 9-45 years old living in endemic areas.

"Today, with this 1st marketing authorization of Dengvaxia, we have achieved our goal of making dengue the next vaccine-preventable disease," Olivier Brandicourt, chief executive of Sanofi, said in a statement. "This is a historic milestone for our company, for the global public health community and, most importantly, for half the world's population who lives at risk of dengue."

In clinical trials, the vaccine reduced the risk of developing dengue by about 60 percent. Some experts have said this is less effective than desired, raising questions about how widely the vaccine would be used. And in one trial the vaccine seemed less effective in young children, who are most susceptible to the disease.

But Sanofi itself and some other experts said that that level of effectiveness would be welcomed, given that there is now no treatment for dengue. In one trial involving children 9-16 in Latin America and the Caribbean, the vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization from dengue by 80 percent.

Sanofi said it had begun manufacturing Dengvaxia and that it would eventually be able to produce 100 million doses annually.

[Although there are several dengue vaccines under development currently, the Sanofi vaccine is the 1st to enter the commercial market. Producing a tetravalent vaccine that provides immunity against all 4 dengue virus serotypes is a challenge. The debate within public health circles, as mentioned above, is whether 60 percent efficacy is adequate enough to justify its use in national campaigns. The Mexican experience with it will be watched with considerable interest. - Mod.TY

Currently there are 2 WHO pre-qualified oral *cholera* vaccines (OCVs) (Dukoral and Shanchol)... Shanchol provided 67 percent protection against clinically significant _V. cholera_ O1 cholera in an endemic area for at least 2 years after vaccination. A field trial in Kolkata, India obtained protective efficacy (65 percent) of the vaccine up to 5 years http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs107/en. So perhaps 60 percent efficacy would be acceptable. - Mod.JW]
