[No cases of hemorrhagic septicemia (HS) in bovines have been reported from Israel between 1948 (the year of the State of Israel's establishment) and 2016, when the disease was reported as "suspected" in the annual report to the OIE. The 1st immediate notification to the OIE of a HS event (4 outbreaks) in Israel was submitted on [Sun 5 Mar 2017] (see 20170306.488300). The current follow-up No 1 report just adds another location where cases initially appeared on [Mon 20 Feb 2017], about the same time as the 4 earlier reported outbreaks and in their vicinity.

HS was common in the north eastern region during the 1st half of the 20th century among the water buffaloes population maintained in the marshes around Lake Hula (Huleh) and on the north eastern shores of the Sea of Tiberias, namely the Bteihah marshes (for a map dated to the said period, see http://tinyurl.com/js29fu8). The disease was declared reportable. In 1942 the bacterium caused a major epizootic, killing about 1000 head out of about 6300 susceptible animals. This outbreak was controlled by the application of a killed homologous vaccine prepared by the veterinary laboratory (of the then ruling British Mandatory Government of Palestine). Annual revaccinations followed.

After the establishment of the State of Israel, in 1948, drainage of the Hula swamps started, accomplished in 1958 when most of the Hula Lake itself was also drained. This was followed by a severe reduction in the size of the local water-buffalo population. Since then, HS has not been recorded in Israel until 2016. While in Israel's' annual OIE report for 2015, HS was included among the diseases "absent" ("last event, 1948"), according to the 2016 report, HS is "suspected but not confirmed and limited to one or more zones".

The current cases relate to grazing beef cattle. The locations of all outbreaks are available in the interactive map at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=23116.

It will be interesting to note if similar cases have been/are being seen in the adjacent Syrian and Jordanian regions.
