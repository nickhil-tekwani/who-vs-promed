At: 1 WHO Country Office for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo, Bosnia and
Herzegovina;
2 Institute of Immunology, WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and
Research on Measles Infections, WHO European Regional Reference Laboratory
for Measles and Rubella, National Reference Laboratory for Measles and
Rubella, Luxembourg; 3 Public Health Institute Republika Srpska, Banja
Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina

Between 24 Mar and 31 Jul 2009, 342 clinically diagnosed cases of rubella
were notified in 5 municipalities in Republika Srpska, Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH). 14 cases were laboratory-confirmed by positive IgG
against rubella virus. 4 virus isolates were obtained and identified as
genotype 2B strains, with one isolate differing by a single mutation in the
E1 gene. This ongoing outbreak revealed gaps in the immunisation programme
during the war in BiH (1992-1995) and highlights the need to revise
legislation to permit immunisation of children above 14 years of age with
measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine and to introduce supplemental
immunisation activities.

Introduction
Rubella is a notifiable disease in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH; estimated
population 3.9 million) and is reported on the basis of clinical symptoms.
Rubella immunisation was introduced in the 1980s. In 1999-2000, a 2-dose
schedule with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine was implemented,
with the 1st dose given at the age of 12 months (since 2008 at 11 months)
and the 2nd dose at the age of 7 years and no later than 14 years.

Between 24 Mar and 31 Jul 2009, 342 clinically diagnosed cases of rubella
were notified in 5 municipalities in Republika Srpska (RS), which is one of
2 governing entities in BiH. At the time of publication of this report, the
outbreak is ongoing, with circa 4 cases per week. Epidemiological and
laboratory investigations were started in early May 2009. Preliminary
results are presented below.

Materials and methods
Serum samples were collected from 20 suspected rubella cases (6 from
Dubica, 5 from Kotor Varos, 3 from Prijedor, 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale and
2 from Trebinje). Throat swabs were obtained from the 3 patients from
Prijedor and from 2 of the 5 patients from Kotor Varos. All sera were
tested for IgM against measles and rubella and for rubella IgG (Dade
Behring Enzygnost immunoassays) at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL)
of the World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) in
Luxembourg, and 10 serum samples were also analysed for rubella IgM at the
laboratory of the Public Health Institute of Republika Srpska (PHI RS). The
throat swabs were used for PCR analysis as described previously [1] and for
virus isolation [2]. Phylogenetic analysis based on the rubella virus E1
glycoprotein gene was done with MEGA [3], and sequences were compared to
published sequences by BLAST.

Results
Outbreak profile: On 28 May 2009, the PHI RS declared a rubella outbreak in
3 municipalities in the Banja Luka Region: Prijedor, Dubica and Kotor
Varos. Later, an outbreak occurred in the East Sarajevo region including
the municipalities Pale and Sokolac. In addition, 4 suspected cases were
reported in Banja Luka and 8 in Doboj.

In Dubica, 44 rubella cases were reported between 24 Mar and 15 May 2009
(illustrated graphically in the original text) on the basis of a clinical
case definition -- that is, acute onset of generalised maculopapular rash,
body temperature higher than 37.2 C and arthralgia/arthritis,
lymphadenopathy, or conjunctivitis. The outbreak in this area appears to be
over. The index case was not identified.

In Kotor Varos, Prijedor and East Sarajevo, where the outbreaks are still
ongoing, 117, 116 and 65 rubella cases, respectively, were reported until
the end of July 2009. The last case to date was reported on 15 Sep 2009 in
Sokolac, East Sarajevo.

45 per cent of the cases were male. The age ranged from those born in 1971
to those born in 2007. Most cases (82 per cent, n=282) were observed among
teenagers born between 1990 and 1994 still attending high school: 66 per
cent (29/44) in Dubica, 90 per cent (105/117) in Kotor Varos, all of them
attending the same school, 87 per cent (101/116) in Prijedor and 72 per
cent (47/65) in East Sarajevo.

In Prijedor only 5 of the notified rubella cases had received one dose of
MMR, while all the other patients were not immunised. The vaccination
status of the cases in Dubica, Kotor Varos and East Sarajevo is still under
investigation.

Laboratory findings
Eight samples were positive for rubella IgM, including 3 from Kotor Varos,
one from Prijedor and 4 from East Sarajevo-Pale, confirming that the
outbreaks in these regions were caused by rubella. Four sera were
equivocal, and 8 were IgM-negative for rubella. There was a 100 per cent
concordance between the test results obtained at PHI RS and the Luxembourg
RRL for the 10 sera tested in both laboratories.

The rubella-positive samples were from 7 patients aged 15 to 17 years and
from one aged 24 years. Five of them had received one dose of rubella
vaccine, 2 were not vaccinated against rubella, and for one patient no
information on the vaccination status was available. One rubella
IgM-positive patient was negative for rubella IgG, while the other 7 showed
relatively low titres of rubella IgG (less than 77 IU/ml). In total, 14
patients were positive for rubella IgG, and 6 were negative. All 20 serum
samples were negative for measles IgM.

Four of the 5 throat swabs were positive in the diagnostic PCR, and for all
4 positives, virus isolates were obtained. These samples were collected
between one and 4 days after onset of rash from patients aged 16 or 17
years, only one of whom reported having been vaccinated against rubella
more than 9 years earlier. Of all 4 PCR-positive samples, nearly complete
E1 gene sequence data were obtained. Three of the sequences were identical
from Prijedor, and the 4th showed one mutation at position 303 of the E1
gene and was from Kotor Varos. Phylogenetic analysis attributed the
sequences to genotype 2B. According to a BLAST analysis, the most similar
previously published sequence was an isolate obtained in the United States
9 years ago (RVi/WA.USA/16.00, GenBank accession number AY968220) with a
Kimura distance of more than 2 per cent.

Discussion
This preliminary report describes a fairly large laboratory-confirmed
outbreak of rubella affecting mainly unvaccinated or partially vaccinated
schoolchildren aged 16 to 17 years in 3 contiguous municipalities and one
distant region in RS. As the clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable,
the real number of cases may be somewhat overestimated, as for a few
suspected cases, there may have been different reasons for the symptoms
observed. This may also explain why some of the sera tested negative for
rubella IgM. On the other hand, several cases may have remained undetected
due to a subclinical course of disease. No cases of rubella were diagnosed
in BiH in 2008 nor in January and February 2009.

Due to lack of laboratory confirmation, the outbreak was recognised in the
1st community (Dubica) on 24 Mar 2009. The index case was not identified,
and, therefore, it is not clear when and from where the virus was
introduced. As the most similar published sequence was found in the United
States in 2000 and the genetic distance to that isolate was more than 2 per
cent, the origin of the virus remains obscure.

In early April 2009, the 1st cases were observed in 2 other municipalities,
Kotor Varos and Prijedor, and in June 2009 in another 2 located 250-400 km
away. In all of these areas, the epidemic is ongoing. Local epidemiologists
speculate that the virus may have spread among teenagers during their stay
in Mrakovica, Kozara mountain (56 km south from Dubica), which is a very
popular place for regular school excursions in spring.

To date, there is no information on occurrence of rubella in pregnant women
or abortion in connection with the current rubella outbreak. Due to the
risk of congenital rubella infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy,
which can lead to miscarriage, stillbirth, or infants with birth defects,
rubella is of high public health importance.

Before the war in 1990, coverage with MMR vaccine was 93.6 per cent in BiH.
Vaccine procurement and implementation of the immunisation programme were
difficult during the war, and in the last 2 years of war, MMR vaccine
coverage was only 56.8 per cent. The age groups primarily affected in the
current outbreak were born during the war, and most of them were not even
vaccinated with the 1st dose of MMR. Surveys done in RS in 1999 and in 2006
showed MMR vaccination coverage rates of only 54 per cent and 79 per cent,
respectively, among children aged 12 to 23 months [4]. Annual statistics
from PHI RS show varying vaccination coverage rates in recent years (2006:
1st dose 83 per cent, 2nd dose 83 per cent, 2007: 92 per cent and 93 per
cent, 2008: 78 per cent and 52 per cent), indicating that other age groups
may also contain people at risk for infection.

As a result of the outbreaks, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare and
the PHI RS have initiated immediate actions to improve the coverage with
the 2nd dose of MMR vaccine in children under the age of 14 years and have
alerted the Regional Public Health Institutes and primary health care
providers of the emerging outbreak. An action plan to initiate
supplementary immunisation of children and young adults with measles and
rubella vaccine or rubella vaccine is presently being developed with
support from WHO/Europe. The ongoing rubella outbreak also highlights the
need for a revised legislation that permits MMR vaccination in children
older than 14 years as well as the need to improve the surveillance of
congenital rubella syndrome.

[This outbreak is unusual in that deficiencies in the coverage of measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination are usually revealed by outbreaks of
measles virus infection, or less commonly mumps virus infection. In Bosnia
and Herzegovina, a breakdown in childhood immunisation during a period of
civil strife has resulted in a large ongoing outbreak of rubella virus
infection. About half the cases are males, and it has yet to be determined
whether infection of pregnant women will be manifested as an increase in
abortions or congenital rubella syndrome.
