The Regional Health Agency (ARS) of Reunion issued an alert on Tuesday [19 Apr 2022]. It identified an upsurge in cases of leptospirosis on the island. Since the beginning of the year [1 Jan 2022], 99 cases of leptospirosis have been declared, the majority of which occurred in recent weeks (43 in March and 35 cases in April [2022], according to the press release), reports BFMTV [BFM TV is a 24-hour rolling news and weather channel based in France].

"Leptospirosis is a serious disease. If it is not treated in time, it can lead to hospitalization or even death," warns the ARS.

This increase in cases is due to recent episodes of heavy rains on the island. Humans contract the disease through contact with a damp environment that has been contaminated by the urine of rats and other rodents. Mud, puddles, or stagnant water are favorable grounds. These heavy rains promote "soil leaching and environmental contamination," points out the ARS.

The bacterium enters the body through the skin in the event of even small cuts or wounds. The disease can lead to kidney failure, "even to death in 5 to 20% of cases," specifies the Institut Pasteur. Among the 99 cases in Reunion, 18 people were admitted to the intensive care unit. One death is mourned. Contaminations are more numerous than in 2021, when 74 cases of leptospirosis were declared during the same period.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is distributed widely throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Reunion experiences seasonal outbreaks of leptospirosis related to heavy rainfall, consequent flooding, and a large population of rats (https://www.lifebiodivom.fr/en/lancement-de-la-deratisation-a-la-reunion/). A study that compared the genotypes of _Leptospira_ in human cases (66) of leptospirosis to genotypes of _Leptospira_ in 5 species of wild small mammals (n = 995) and domestic animals (n = 101) found rats to be the major reservoir of _Leptospira_ on Reunion Island, with a few human cases attributed to dogs, cattle, and mice (https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004733).

Reunion, one of the overseas departments of France, is an island with a population of about 800 000 located in the Indian Ocean, about 943 km (586 mi) east of Madagascar and about 200 km (120 mi) southwest of Mauritius, the nearest island.
