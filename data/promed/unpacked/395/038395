Islamic State (IS) Extremists Again Accused of Using Poison Gas
-----------
Kurdish commanders in eastern Syria say Islamic State militants used poison gas Wed 2 Sep 2015 to attack Kurdish fighters. The accusation came as civilians in the northern Syrian town of Marea, 10 kilometers from the Turkish border, also said they have, for the 2nd time in recent weeks, come under a barrage of shells filled with mustard gas.

Syrian Kurdish leaders sent a specialized investigation team to the alleged gas attack site in the Salihiya area of Syria's Hasaka province, which has seen fierce fighting for weeks between Islamic militants and the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG).

"I felt the gas; it was really pungent and had a nasty smell. I was barely breathing and I thought I was choking," a civilian told Rudaw, a Kurdish news site.

Mustard gas
-----
The attack Wednesday in Hasaka came 2 days after a rocket suspected of carrying chemical substances was fired by the Islamic State at Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga positions near Mosul Dam. Mustard gas causes serious damage to the skin, eyes, respiratory and other internal organs.

In a statement, the Kurdistan Region Security Council said the rocket used near the Mosul Dam was homemade and "the impact produced considerable yellow smoke at the scene of the attack, leaving 1 Peshmerga requiring treatment."

"We are working with the international coalition to collect samples for immediate tests abroad. This is one of an increasing number of attacks... suspected of carrying chemical substances," the council said.

Mounting allegations
-----
Since early August 2015, allegations have mounted about the Islamic State group's use of mustard gas, the infamous chemical agent initially used in combat in World War I. On 12 Aug 2015, during a battle near the northern Iraqi city of Makhmour, 60 Peshmerga troops were exposed to mustard gas, according to Kurdish officials.

During a long artillery bombardment on 21 Aug 2015 in which 59 shells landed on Marea, the northern Syrian rebel stronghold which is being besieged by IS, at least 25 people suffered some of the symptoms associated with the chemical weapon banned under the 1925 Geneva protocol. The symptoms include blistering and weeping skin, a burning rash and breathing difficulties.

U.S. and German officials have concluded the allegations about the use of mustard gas in the August 2015 attacks are credible. A senior U.S. military official said the ordnance fired at the Peshmerga produced injuries with "wounds consistent with a blister-producing agent" and that preliminary testing of mortar shell fragments from Makhmour showed traces of sulfur mustard.

Testimony from doctors and chemical weapons experts is adding weight to the claims of IS mustard gas use. They say the skin lesions and other symptoms suggest exposure to a chemical agent.

The non-profit Syrian-American Medical Association, in a statement after the initial Marea attack, said the agent used was likely mustard gas. The association runs a field hospital in the town just north of Aleppo. The French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said its doctors treated a family exhibiting symptoms of exposure to chemical agents. All4 family members had respiratory complications and developed weeping skin blisters several hours after the mortar barrage.

Dutch-born IS fighter Omar Yilmaz last week acknowledged the extremist group's use of mustard gas, saying in a Tumblr post, "The regime uses chemical warfare on a regular basis these days, and nobody bats an eye -- yet when [IS] captures it from them and uses it against them it's all of a sudden a huge problem?"

Still an open question
---------
Despite the claim that the chemical weapons used were seized from captured Syrian government bases, U.S. and NATO officials say it is still an open question as to where IS got the mustard gas. Although the Syrian regime cooperated with the destruction of most of its chemical arsenal after the threat of U.S. airstrikes 2 years ago, following a sarin gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, United Nations inspectors have expressed concern that not all mustard gas stocks were burned away in sand pits as the regime claimed.

Experts argue that any stockpiles that may have escaped international weapons inspectors still around in Iraq from the Saddam Hussein era would be degraded by now. Some experts have speculated that mustard gas-filled shells may have been smuggled out of Libya. The likely low concentrations of gas used in the alleged IS attacks suggest the chemical weapon was developed by IS itself using precursor chemicals bought on the black market.

Since the Syrian government's destruction of its chemical arsenal under a deal brokered by Russia, there have been persistent claims that forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have also been using poison gas mainly in airstrikes. Syrian civil defense workers and doctors have documented dozens of cases and Syrian rebel commanders say that between March and May 2015, more than 1000 people were wounded in chlorine gas attacks, which claimed at least a dozen lives.

During August 2015, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution setting up a team to investigate chemical weapons attacks in Syria. On Wed 2 Sep 2015, Russia, a key foreign backer of President Assad, held up final approval for the probe on technical grounds. Russian diplomats said the probe should also focus on the alleged IS attacks and be extended to investigate claims of poison gas use in neighboring Iraq as well.

[The lesions, the smell of the clothing and the gas in the air as mentioned in the article point to a chemical weapon, most likely mustard gas. This seems to be a credible report with the clinical signs and symptoms of the victims consistent with mustard gas poisoning.

The source of the chemical seems to be in question, but the issue of a chemical weapon being used does not appear to be in question, based on this article. Where it came from, how old it is, or how was it made and from what, are questions the investigation will have to answer.

The more immediate concern is treating the people that were exposed to the gas and Doctors without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres) is filling that role. These physicians apparently believe this was mustard gas, according to the article, although testing on the substance is incomplete as of this writing. Given the clinical signs and symptoms and the belief of the physicians, it seems likely it will be confirmed as mustard gas.

This article also seems to confirm the previous attack which ProMED-mail posted in 20150826.3602420.

Readers are referred to the moderator's comments on the previous chemical weapons posting [20150826.3602420] for more information on the signs and symptoms of mustard gas poisoning. - Mod.TG
