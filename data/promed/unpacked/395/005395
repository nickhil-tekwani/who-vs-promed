New Maize Viruses in USA
-------------------------------------------
[Scientists at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center
(OARDC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have discovered two new
[maize viruses, one of which remains to be characterized.
The first virus, [provisionally named maize necrotic streak virus [MNeSV,
was found in Arizona crops of maize (_Zea mays_) suspected of being
infected with maize dwarf mosaic potyvirus, [a virus that has caused
severe crop losses throughout the U.S. [It induces pale green, yellow, or
cream-colored streaks on the leaves that eventually become translucent and
necrotic around the edges. [The disease has not been recorded in Ohio,
[but researchers are taking measures to ensure [that farmers are aware of
its potential threat, said Dr. Peg Redinbaugh, research plant molecular
biologist. Redinbaugh is part of a joint program between OARDC and USDA
dedicated to tracking the emergence of corn diseases worldwide. [Estimated
annual yield reductions in maize attributable to infection by maize
viruses range from 5-15 percent in the U.S.
[MNeSV is transmitted in soil by means currently unknown. It is not
manually transmissible. Redinbaugh says researchers have found a
[tropical corn line that is resistant to the virus, but [that line is not
well adapted to Ohio soil.
[The second corn virus, [discovered in Georgia, USA induces symptoms
similar to several [maize diseases, including those caused by maize
mosaic nucleorhabdovirus, maize chlorotic dwarf mosaic waikavirus and maize
rayado fino marafivirus, [thus confounding identification according to
Redinbaugh. Research [on this virus is ongoing.

[Maize crops in California have also been reported to express symptoms
similar to those of MNeSV. The virus appears to be a species in the genus
Tombusvirus (Tombusviridae). Virions are 32 nm in diameter, the virion
ssRNA contains 4.3 kb, and there is a single capsid protein (29.5 kDa).
Interestingly, the virus is readily transmitted experimentally to corn by
vascular puncture inoculation (VPI), and resistant and susceptible lines
can be distinguished by the technique. In correspondence with Redinbaugh
about the inoculation experiments, she does not know if plants of the same
cultivar that are resistant to VPI are also resistant in infested soil.
[Experiments have been designed to determine whether the same resistance
genes are operative in both infection systems.
The provisional name of the virus must be proposed by the Plant Virus
Subcommittee for approval by the ICTV.
