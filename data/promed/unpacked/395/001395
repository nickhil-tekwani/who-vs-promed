Just wondering if _B. abortus_ was confirmed in these caribou mentioned below. _Brucella suis_ biovar 4 is endemic in western arctic caribou in Alaska, and has spilled over to reindeer in the area. I also believe _B. suis_ biovar 4 has been found in the reindeer of circumpolar Eurasia.

[Dr. Brignole has thoughtfully brought it to my attention that while it was definitely _Brucellosis sp_ confirmed in the caribou, the specific type of brucellosis was not mentioned in the article.

While _B. suis_ is prevalent in the western arctic caribou there has not been any announced confirmation as to _B. abortus_ or _B.suis_ in the caribou in Southampton Island, which is on the north-eastern side of Canada.

If someone of authority in the Southampton area could let us know which species of _Brucella_ is in these caribou, it would be appreciated. – Mod.TG]
