Cholera outbreak in Northeastern Cambodia: laboratory confirmation.
Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa was identified in 6 out of 7 stool samples taken
from suspect cases in Rattanakiri province, and in 4 samples from 4 cases
living in a remote village in Stung Treng province, close to Rattanakiri.
The detected strains share an almost similar resistance pattern with the O1
Ogawa strains identified in Poipet (West of Cambodia, at the Thai border)
in June 1998, and they will be compared using ribotyping
analysis.
