Plague continues to cause anxiety in Aruu town. Medical reports from
Aruu health centers indicate that at least 20 people have been
infected by suspected plague. The report says 5 people have been
killed as a result of the outbreak.
The commissioner for Community Health, Dr Sam Okware said, "It
[plague] is endemic [in the region]. It happens at this time of the
year, especially when the rains start falling in June. It is caused
by rats that cross from DR Congo," he said.
Arua DDHS (Divisional Director of Health Services) Patrick Anguzu
told Daily Monitor yesterday, 12 Sep 2007, that a health team from
Arua has set up emergency plans to deal with suspected cases. The
infected area, 'Kampala', is a popular market that attracts traders
from West Nile and Congo for cross-border trade.
"Yes, there is that scare because it can spread faster in our places.
So our medical personnel have to be ready for any suspected cases
that may spill off to our area. That area (Kampala) is not far from
us in Arua," Dr Anguzu said.

[Formal documentation that these illnesses are plague is still
pending. But, as can be seen on a map, the Arua district of Uganda
and across the border from the Orientale (Eastern) province of Congo
DR are both areas where plague occurs
(<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/uganda.pdf>).
The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in the cases are
unstated but, with a substantial fatality rate, more invasive forms
of the disease such as septicemic and pneumonic plague may be
present. It is the pneumonic form that can spread from
person-to-person. - Mod.LL]
