In a press release issued by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) last week, the agency urged the public to take precautions against scrub typhus when doing outdoor activities such as cleaning graves, camping, hiking, and visiting chigger-infested areas such as bush areas that facilitate exposure to chiggers and increase the risk of acquiring scrub typhus.

To prevent chigger bites, Taiwan CDC advised that the public wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and pants, apply officially approved insect repellents to exposed skin, and change clothes and take a shower immediately after a visit to the bush area.

As of 25 Mar 2018, a total of 67 scrub typhus cases have been confirmed in Taiwan this year [2018], including 20 cases in Taitung County and 15 cases in Hualien County, according to the agency's surveillance data. Scrub typhus cases are reported in Taiwan throughout the year, which usually begin to increase during April and May and peak during June and July, the agency said, citing the data, adding that during 2015 and 2017, Penghu County, Taitung County, Hualien County, and Kinmen County reported more cases.

Scrub typhus is a disease that is transmitted by chiggers, which like to stay at the tips of weeds, waiting for an opportunity to attach to passing humans or animals, Taiwan CDC said. Therefore, the chance of becoming infected with scrub typhus is much higher when people walk through bush areas, the agency said. After being bitten by the chigger, a painless eschar [a dark scab over the site of the chigger bite] will form over the bite, and the incubation period usually ranges from 9 to 12 days, the agency said. Subsequently, symptoms such as persistent fever, headache, sweating and swelling or inflammation of the lymph gland will begin to develop, Taiwan CDC said. Infected individuals start experiencing rashes after one week, sometimes developing complications such as pneumonia or liver problems. The infection reportedly can be fatal if left unattended.

If symptoms such as persistent fever, headache and eschar develop, please seek medical attention immediately and inform the doctor of your travel and exposure history to serve as a reference for clinical diagnosis.

For more information, please call the toll-free Communicable Disease Reporting and Consultation Hotline, 1922 (or 0800-001922).

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Scrub typhus has been reported from regions that extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multi-organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html), and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test may continue to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. The most rapid and specific diagnostic assays for scrub typhus is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect _O. tsutsugamushi_ DNA in a blood, eschar swab, or tissue sample.

Tomb Sweeping Day (Qingming Festival) of 2018 falls on 5 Apr 2018 (https://www.chinahighlights.com/festivals/qingming-festival.htm). It is a traditional Chinese festival when people tend to family graves and pay respect to the dead person with offerings. The dead person's favorite food and wine are taken, along with paper resembling money, which is burned in the hope that the deceased are not lacking food and money. Weeds around the tomb are cleared away, and fresh soil is added to show respect for the dead. It is also a time for outings to appreciate the spring season. In Taiwan, the public holiday is now always observed on 5 April to honor the death of Chiang Kai-shek on that day in 1975 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingming_Festival).
