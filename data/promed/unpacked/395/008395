Update: St Louis Encephalitis Outbreak in Louisiana
---------------------------------------------------
The St Louis encephalitis (SLE) outbreak is now in its sixth week with 51
cases in Monroe and West Monroe and 2 additional cases in 2 small towns
about 30 miles from Monroe East and North. The epidemic curve based on
blood collection date (date disease was suspected) shows a definite slowing
down. Week 1 = 9 cases, week 2 = 18 cases, week 3 = 12 cases, week 4 = 5
cases and week 5 (which has just ended) = 7 cases. Cases are now found at
the rate of approximately 1 per day.
An epidemic curve was constructed for date of infection (date of onset Â­- 7
days). It showed that by the time the first case was diagnosed, 34 cases
(67% [of total cases so far) were already infected. Most of the cases come
from low socio-economic areas. Houses are often run down, many with screens
in disrepair. Backyards are usually large, with heavy brush, some garbage
or small containers filled with polluted water and many trees. There is an
abundance of sources of mosquito larvae, particularly for _Culex
quinquefasciatus_, which is thought to be the main vector. Small containers
filled with heavily polluted water are commonplace. Houses are built on
short posts with leaking plumbing or air conditioning creating puddles
under the houses. There are also many drainage ditches clogged with
vegetation and garbage.
Clinically most cases presented with fever, meningitis syndrome with
altered mental status. Tremors were a very common sign (56% of cases).
There were 2 deaths. Age group distribution shows a predominance among
[those 45 and older. Cases are presumptively diagnosed on the basis of a
positive IgM for flavivirus. The first 4 cases were further tested by the
CDC lab in Fort Collins by neutralization. Acute and convalescent sera were
collected and forwarded to the CDC lab for confirmation. Brain tissue from
one of the deceased patients was also forwarded to the CDC lab. Mosquito
pools (_Cx. quinquefasciatus_) have been sent to the CDC lab also.
As soon as the first case was reported, a campaign of health education and
increased mosquito adulticiding were implemented. Within 3 weeks, more than
95% of the population interviewed was aware of the problem and of the
precautionary measures. However, riding through the affected areas in the
evening, one could see people sitting in their front porch socializing,
children playing in the streets.
Adulticiding targeted against pest mosquitoes was ongoing before the
outbreak with pyrethroid applications by trucks. After the first cases were
reported to mosquito control, truck applications were increased and aerial
applications were started (Anvil). A team of CDC entomologists came on site
on 28 Aug 2001. Ovitraps showed that the vector species was still present
in large numbers and modifications were made to adulticiding, including
aerial applications of dibrom and house-to-house spraying with back-held
machines. Adulticiding and larviciding activities are strengthened almost
daily. It is unclear whether the mosquito control activities are
responsible for the decrease seen about one week after their
implementation, since the early activities were not thought to have been
very effective [on the vector species.
