200 children have contracted serous meningitis in Chelyabinsk Oblast
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The NTV [television] channel has reported the occurrence of an outbreak of
serous meningitis [acute meningitis with secondary external
hydrocephalus/viral meningitis] in the Chelyabinsk Oblast. This disease is
most dangerous for small children. Since the beginning of this year [2009]
200 preschool children have fallen ill with this disease. Currently 80
children are being treated in local hospitals. 44 local kindergartens have
been closed as a quarantine measure.

Doctors say that the main reason for the spread of infection is lack of
adherence to elementary rules of hygiene. However Rospotrepnadzor [public
health] officials suggested that the spread of infection is a consequence
of lowered immunity. In most cases the disease is mild and presumed to be a
consequence of enteroviral infection. The deputy head of the Chelyabinsk
Oblast Rospotrebnadzor stated on NTV television that a diagnosis of
enteroviral meningitis had been confirmed only in 15 cases.

[The rise in serous meningitis morbidity at the end of the summer and start
of the fall is a usual seasonal phenomenon as a consequence of enterovirus
infection. Transmission 1st occurs during the swimming season, and then
shifts to person-to-person contacts. The latter occurs most frequently in
schools. - Mod.NP
