Health Department confirms 3rd [actually 4th] case of yellow fever in Goias this year [2015]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The State Department of Health (SES) confirmed on Monday [1 Jun 2015] the 3rd case of yellow fever [YF] in Goias this year [2015]. The last record was made in rural Alexania close to the Federal District, where a man of 31, who had not been vaccinated, contracted the disease.

Also according to the SES, the patient originates from Piaui, but has resided in the municipality for 3 years. He got the diagnosis in Brasilia, where he received treatment. A few days later, he returned to Alexania. His family members have been immunized [in case there are infected mosquitoes in the house. YF is not contagious. - Mod.JW]

To try to prevent cases in the city from increasing, the department is calling on residents and city visitors to take the vaccine at any health center. Those heading to the city should seek prevention at least 10 days before arriving.

The last cases in the state were registered in 2008, when 17 people were infected and 10 died.
