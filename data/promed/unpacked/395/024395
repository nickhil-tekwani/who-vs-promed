Mysterious illness kills 20 miners
----------------------------------
A mysterious illness sweeping through a remote town at the center of
a diamond rush in Democratic Republic of Congo has killed more than
20 miners and infected nearly 1000, a UN aid worker said overnight.
UN agencies, aid workers and government health officials are making
their way to Libayakuyasuka, 84 km north-east of Punia, a town in the
north of Maniema province, where 1000 miners are digging in a new
mine.
"There have been 21 deaths and there are over 970 cases amongst the
miners," Gerson Brandao Azevedo, the head of the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said by phone from Kindu, the
capital of Maniema.
"We suspect that this is a pulmonary infection caused by people
working in terrible conditions in the diamond rush. The World Health
Organization and some aid agencies are trying to help but the
situation is not yet under control," he added.
Brandao Azevedo said the infection was not contagious. He put the
deaths and the large number of infections down to thousands of miners
searching for diamonds in the bush without proper equipment or
healthcare.
The diamond rush began several months ago but the 1st recorded case
of a miner falling ill was on 25 Jul 2005, he added.
There are hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners in Congo, a
country rich in natural resources but torn apart by years of war and
chaos.
Congo's last war officially ended 2 years ago, but the central
government has not yet stamped its authority on much of the east,
where armed groups still roam and thousands continue to die every
month, mostly from war-related hunger and disease.
An outbreak of plague in a diamond-mining town in a neighboring province
killed at least 61 miners and infected 400 people in February 2005.

[With 21 deaths associated with 970 cases, assuming all the illness is of a
single etiology, the case fatality rate is 2.1 percent. If this is the case,
neither pneumonic plague nor a filovirus infection (Marburg or Ebola) is
likely. ProMED awaits further evaluation of this cluster of illness.- Mod.LL]
