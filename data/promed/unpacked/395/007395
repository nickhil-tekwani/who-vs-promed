PATIENT DIED OF LASSA FEVER
---------------------------
In a Wiesbaden (town near Frankfurt am Main, capital of Hesse) hospital a
57-year old Nigerian man died of Lassa fever last Saturday [1 Apr 2000.
According to information released by the Social Ministry, the highly
contagious virus was discovered only today. The brain of the patient had
been infected, but the virus had not been detectable in the blood.
The Nigerian man had been admitted to the Horst Schmidt Hospital in
Wiesbaden on 27 Mar 2000for diagnostic purposes. All contacts have been
traced according to the ministry and precautions have been instigated. The
risk of infection was low in this case.

Nigerian with Lassa fever dies in German hospital
-------------------------------------------------
I found this in a German online news magazine today and have not been able
to confirm it from any other German news source I tried. Here are the facts
I could gather from the news item:
On 1 Apr 2000, a 57-year-old Nigerian man died of Lassa fever in a hospital
in Wiesbaden, Germany (near Frankfurt). He had been airlifted from Nigeria
with "symptoms not indicative of Lassa fever" on 27 Mar 2000. His condition
had improved until he suddenly died on Saturday, apparently because Lassa
virus infected his brain. Indeed, the virus was not to be found in his
blood at all. Contact persons are being monitored. The last case of Lassa
fever in Germany was a female 23-year-old German tourist returning from
Africa, who died in a Wuerzburg tropical medicine unit in January.
