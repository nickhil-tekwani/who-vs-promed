The Burundian Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock alerted on Monday [23 May 2022] of the detection for the 1st time in the country of Rift Valley fever (RVF), with an estimated loss of at least 100 head of cattle.

"Since the end of April 2022, cases of an animal disease mainly affecting cattle with an unusual clinical picture have been reported in the provinces of Kirundo and Ngozi, in the north of the country," underlined Serges Nkurunziza, Managing Director of Breeding.

Symptoms include abortion, nasal bleeding, hyperthermia, diarrhea often mingled with blood, generalized weakness and inappetence leading to death. According to him, since the outbreak of this disease, 100 cases of cattle mortality have been recorded.

Currently, this disease has already spread to other provinces of the country, such as Kayanza (north), Karusi (center), Cibitoke (west), Bujumbura (west) and Makamba in the south of the country.

"The 1st cases reported are generally located in cross-border areas and sites," he said, noting that this is the 1st time that this disease has appeared in Burundi. To deal with it, Serges Nkurunziza calls on the Ministry of Public Health to take collaborative steps to carry out joint surveillance of this disease.

In the meantime, field technicians are recommended to take all the necessary personal protection precautions, particularly in biosecurity measures. "Farmers must inform the technical services of all clinical cases for their management. They are requested to regularly spray their animals," he recommended, further stressing that in the affected areas, the restriction of all movement for ruminants and the prohibition of their slaughter must be respected until further notice.

In Burundi, this disease occurs less than a year after the start of the implementation of stable breeding at the national level. According to experts, Rift Valley fever can cause other illnesses in humans. Contaminated livestock must therefore be incinerated.

[The clinical signs described are generally compatible with previous descriptions of RVF in cattle, as accumulating since 1931 from various countries, including Kenya, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Sudan, Egypt and others.

Notably, RVF has initially been reported from northern Burundi, neighboring southern Rwanda, from where RVF was reported, similarly in cattle, in April 2022 (20220413.8702590). Rwanda's OIE notification said that the affected population "are mostly cattle and possibly human." No reports on human disease have become available so far.

Laboratory confirmation of RVF in Burundi is warranted. In case confirmed, infections in humans attending the animals would have been expected. - Mod.AS
