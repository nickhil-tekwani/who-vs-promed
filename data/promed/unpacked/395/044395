On Mon 6 May 2013, the patient (male, 52 years) was bitten on his right hand by a small dog on a compound in Port-au-Prince, Haiti (further information about this dog is as of yet missing). He had cleaned the bleeding wound with water and alcohol. He had not been vaccinated against rabies before the accident and had not sought medical attention afterwards.

On 19 Jun 2013 (34 days after the bite), he developed fever and malaise, with headache and a painful right arm. Upon touch, he had dysaesthesia on his right arm and shoulder and on the right side of the trunk. On 20 Jun 2013, he developed hydrophobia and one day later, he developed swallowing problems, with reflex vomiting upon attempting to drink. He was admitted to a local hospital (Diakonessenhuis Utrecht, The Netherlands), where the attending neurologist suspected rabies. He was then transferred to our hospital (Academic Medical Center [AMC], Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Presence of rabies virus (genotype 1) was confirmed in skin biopsies of the neck, liquor [CSF - cerebrospinal fluid] and saliva, at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. He is currently treated at the intensive care unit of the AMC in Amsterdam, according to a 'modified' Milwaukee protocol (rabies immunoglobulin, iv ribavirin, and hypothermia).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Abraham Goorhuis for reporting this confirmed case of human rabies contracted in Haiti by a person now being treated in hospital in The Netherlands. The patient had not been vaccinated prior to or after suffering a dog bite in Haiti. The patient developed classical symptoms of rabies virus infection beginning 19 days after injury. We hope that the current treatment of the patient according to the Milwaukee protocol will succeed, although the prospects for recovery are bleak in view of the patient's condition prior to initiation of treatment.

We hope that the reporting of this case will alert travellers to the necessity of obtaining post exposure prophylaxis immediately following injury by an animal in countries where rabies is known to be still prevalent. - Mod.CP]
