[1] Argentina
Date: Thu 2 Apr 2009

Argentina is suffering its worst epidemic of dengue fever since 1998
in terms of the number of people and the size of the area affected.
And on top of that, the most dangerous form of the illness [DHF],
never recorded [there] before, has made its appearance.

"There is a major outbreak of the disease and it is more serious than
in other years, because the number of infected people is larger and
more provinces are involved," Dr Alfredo Seijo, a specialist in
infectious diseases in charge of the Dengue Unit at the Muniz
Hospital in Buenos Aires, told IPS.

But official information about the epidemic is confusing. The figures
mentioned so far by the national authorities are much lower than
those communicated by local officials and other healthcare personnel.

Argentina's Health Minister, Graciela Ocana, admitted this week that
the situation "is serious" and sent extra help to the northern
province of Chaco, the most affected area, in spite of the provincial
government's reluctance to acknowledge the problem.

Ocana said Monday [30 Mar 2009] that 4147 people had contracted the
dengue virus in 6 provinces, and that most of them had been infected
on Argentine soil. Only about 400 are "imported" cases, that is,
people who have acquired the virus in another country or region.
However, a confidential report by the Chaco provincial emergency
committee for dengue prevention and control stated that there were
already 11 363 confirmed cases. In Charata alone, a town of 35 000
people in southwestern Chaco, the local authorities have recorded
more than 4000 dengue sufferers.

In Argentina even the most conservative figures, such as those
reported by the Health Ministry, lead to the conclusion that the
epidemic is the worst since the virus reappeared in the country in
the late 1990s. In the intervening period, the worst outbreaks
occurred in 2004 and 2007, with nearly 2000 cases reported on each
occasion, according to the ministry's Epidemiology Department.

So far the Health Ministry has not reported any fatal cases, but in
Chaco, 2 women are said to have died from the illness, and another
death has been reported in the adjacent province of Salta.

The Health Ministry in Salta reported 8 cases of DHF in March, but
the national ministry only recognises 3 cases in Chaco, and none in
Salta.

Rolando Nunez, of the non-governmental Nelson Mandela Research and
Study Centre based in Resistencia, the provincial capital, told IPS
that Chaco province combines several of the factors that can fuel the
spread of dengue fever. "Nearly 70 percent of the population lacks
piped water," the activist said. And at times of drought, the
situation is even worse. Last July [2008] the Provincial Water
Administration announced that it was building reservoirs to collect
rainwater in the wet season. Meanwhile, the health authorities are
encouraging people to get rid of the pots and containers they use to
collect rainwater for their own consumption, in order to eliminate
mosquitoes.

The dengue cases in Bolivia have declined in the most recent weeks
and health authorities estimated on Monday [30 Mar 2009] that within
a month the worst epidemic of this disease in the country in 20 years
will end. It has taken the lives of 22 people since December [2008].
The epidemic, which at its peak exceeded 1500 cases daily, has begun
to be controlled and in the past week declined to 200 new cases
reported each day, said authorities. "We are very satisfied because
we are improving the dengue containment levels. We have had good
news; however we must not lower our guard," said the minister of
health, Ramiro Tapia in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, where more
than 75 percent of the cases were reported.

To date, the number of classical dengue cases totaled more than 53
000 and 127 DHF [cases].

[It is gratifying to see the sharp decline in the number of dengue
cases, which have been so great recently as to overwhelm medical
facilities and providers, especially in the city of Santa Cruz. It
would be of interest to know the economic impact of dengue in this
area, which is an economic engine of Bolivia, in terms of both lost
workdays and in direct and indirect medical costs. Of course, it is
not possible to accurately calculate the value of lives lost in human
terms.

The dengue epidemic, which has affected the Brazilian state of Bahia
(in the northeast) has caused at least 29 deaths and 32 306 [dengue
virus] infections since the beginning of the year [2009], according
to official sources. The number of deaths might be double that, given
that the regional Secretariat of Health indicated that through the
3rd week of March [2009] another 36 suspected dengue deaths are under
investigation. The number of dengue infections is over 305 percent of
the [dengue] infections recorded as of the 3rd week of March of 2007,
according to regional government figures.

In total, 7 cities are in a state of emergency due to the disease and
272 municipalities, about 65 percent [of all municipalities], have
registered at least one case. The [health] authorities fear that
there may be a recrudescence [of dengue virus transmission] within
the next months because the rainy season is now beginning in
northeastern Brazil, a situation that favors the rapid multiplication
of the mosquito [vector].

Queensland Health reported a local scientist has been diagnosed with
dengue virus infection. The researcher was infected while working with
the virus in a laboratory, as part of the dengue fever eradication
program. Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says they're not sure
yet how he caught the virus, so safety precautions in the lab have
been stepped up.

The scientist was sick enough to be admitted to hospital but has been
released. Dr Young says he's recovering well. "Because we don't know
how he got it, we've increased the use of personal protective
equipment in that laboratory," she said. "That means they'll wear the
gear all the time -- masks, double gloves, gowns, all those sorts of
things....no one outside that lab is at any risk," she said.

Laboratory infections with dengue viruses are extremely rare, and the
4 types of dengue viruses can be handled routinely with minimal risk,
with the possible exception of needle sticks and of handling dengue
virus infected _Aedes_ spp. vector mosquitoes by less experienced
laboratory personnel, or in the case of escape of infected mosquitoes
from less than optimal insectaries.

Cases of dengue continue to rise
--------------------------------
The number of dengue fever cases in HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City in the 1st
quarter of this year [2009] has increased by 8 percent compared with
the same period a year ago [2008], according to the municipal
Department of Health. To date, the department has recorded 2250
people hospitalised with dengue fever, one of whom died.

Many hospitals in the city have reported increasing numbers of dengue
fever cases over the last several months. Dr Tran Van Ngoc, head of
the HCM City Tropical Disease Hospital's Paediatrics A Ward, says the
ward has been receiving an average of 10 dengue fever patients per
day.

Dr Vu Quang Vinh, deputy head of Paediatrics Hospital No 2's general
accounting department, says that the hospital has received 124 cases
so far this month [March 2009].

The situation is rather serious, says Dr Nguyen Dac Tho, deputy
director of the city's Preventative Health Centre. He says a survey
conducted by the centre in districts 12, 6, and Binh Thanh found
disease-carrying mosquitoes in more than 90 percent of the houses.

To discuss ways to prevent new outbreaks in the upcoming rainy season
in southern provinces, the Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine
Department held a meeting on Friday [27 Mar 2009] with
representatives of provincial health departments on implementing the
National Dengue Fever Prevention Programme.

A representative from the Preventive Medicine Department said this
year [2009], the ministry would run the National Dengue Fever
Prevention Programme in all provinces and cities nationwide at a cost
of more than VND 91 billion (USD 5.2 million).

The programme aims to reduce, by the end of this year [2009], both
the number of people infected and those dying from dengue fever by 10
percent over the average during the 2003-07 period.

[Control of mosquito vectors would be the most important measure in
order to reduce the morbidity and mortality of dengue infection as
mosquitoes were found in more than 90 percent of the houses during a
survey in Ho Chi Minh City. As the monsoon season is approaching, the
mosquitoes and their breeding places should be eliminated to prevent
dengue outbreak in the incoming rainy season. As of 10 Feb 2009,
there had been more than 3000 cases of dengue fever reported
nationwide in Viet Nam during 2009 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue
- Viet Nam 20090211.0614).

Dengue fever season is back, with patients thronging Jakarta hospitals.

In Central Jakarta, the 300-bed-capacity city-owned Tarakan Hospital
worked at full stretch to treat 68 dengue patients over the weekend
[28-29 Mar 2009]. "We're running out of nurses, and all of our
economy-class beds are occupied. Some patients have to use portable
beds," head nurse Zuraidah told The Jakarta Post.

The hospital has recorded 654 dengue cases between January and March
[2009], 7 of them fatal. The city-owned Pasar Rebo Hospital in East
Jakarta recorded 551 dengue cases in the same period. Tarakan
Hospital receives 15-20 new dengue patients daily, Zuraidah said,
adding it had prepared 70 portable beds, 16 of them now in use. The
hospital's 260 nurses are barely enough, she said, since they do not
work at the same time. Zuraidah said the hospital had been
overwhelmed since January [2009].

"In February [2009], dengue cases began declining due to the rains,
but they soared again 4 weeks ago," she said, adding the rains helped
kill dengue-carrying mosquitoes. [It is not clear why rains would
kill _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes that transmit dengue viruses. In some
sites exposed to rain, larvae, and pupae might be washed out of the
containers they are in. However, one would expect additional
peridomestic sites to collect rainwater and facilitate vector
mosquito breeding. - Mod.TY] "We're on alert, though, because last
year 2008], the peak of the dengue cases was in April," she said.

At Budhi Asih Hospital in East Jakarta, one of 17 city-owned
hospitals, the number of dengue patients has risen to 340 this month
[March 2009], up from 320 last month [February], while in January
[2009] it was 228.

"We have the highest daily number of patients this week [30 Mar
2009], with 95 people being treated," said medical service head
Hamonangan Sirait. The hospital treated 89 dengue patients Friday [27
Mar 2009], while the daily intake of new patients is 20 people.

Cengkareng Hospital in West Jakarta treated 32 patients Friday [27
Mar 2009]. "There's no lack of health workers or medicine. As a
city-owned hospital, we can just ask for extra workers or medicine,"
he said, adding the hospital had some 60 doctors, 48 of them dealing
with dengue fever. He called the past few months an "extraordinary
situation."

But Jakarta Health Agency head Dien Emawati said the city's dengue
profile was still considered normal. "We don't need to declare an
emergency status yet," she said. The agency recorded 8086 dengue
fever cases between January-March [2009], 16 of them fatal. Agency
spokeswoman Tini Suryani said that 30 percent of the cases occurred
in East Jakarta.

With warmer weather returning to Punjab, Pakistan's most populous
province, the vector-borne dengue fever virus has also returned, say
officials. Six patients have been diagnosed with dengue in 2009 so
far, according to Anwar Saeed Mirza, an additional medical
superintendent at Services Hospital in Lahore, the Punjab capital.

The most recent case was reported 27 Mar [2009], when the virus was
detected in a man at the Services Hospital. The status of this
patient is considered critical.

Last year 1240 cases of dengue fever were reported in the province.
The disease also caused 6 deaths.

Experts urge action to prevent an epidemic of dengue in 2009. With
the first cases of the viral disease already coming in, doctors fear
the situation could worsen rapidly.

"We need to remind people of the need for safety measures, like
ensuring there is no standing water in their homes. The government
must also urgently begin a spraying campaign at [mosquito] breeding
places," Faiza Riaz, a family physician, said.

In the Al-Moaisem area of Makkah (Mecca), 3 Bangladeshi workers have caught
dengue fever. One of them is in critical condition.

Nawar Al-Qurashi, a Saudi, attributed the spread of the disease to
the absence of a sewage system. He said this results in stagnant
water, which causes mosquitoes to thrive. [The _Aedes_ spp.
mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus are doubtless breeding in
catchments of relatively clean water in and immediately around houses
and other buildings, rather than in raw sewage. - Mod.TY]

[One dengue virus infected person said,] "The residents in this place
are suffering from mosquitoes. We can't go outside or leave the
windows open at night," he added. [The _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes that
transmit dengue viruses usually feed during daylight hours especially
at dawn and dusk, rather than at night. Other human-feeding pest
mosquito species that are not dengue virus vectors appear to be
attracting the resident's attention. - Mod.TY]. Muhammad Shamsulhaq,
a Pakistani, said the solution lies in small planes spraying the
entire area with pesticide. [This would, at best, provide temporary
reductions in the vector mosquito populations. Effective control of
the vector mosquitoes needs to be focused on elimination of
peridomestic breeding sites. - Mod.TY]

Abdul Salam Mashat, deputy mayor of Makkah, told Arab News that the
Makkah Municipality has intensified its operations to combat insects.

According to press reports, there were 84 cases of dengue fever in
Jeddah in the past 4 weeks. Health officials said the number of
mosquitoes that carry the fever have increased, particularly in the
underdeveloped areas of Jeddah, because of a rise in stagnant water
and construction in the city.
