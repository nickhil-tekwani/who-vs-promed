Abstract
--------
_Leishmania donovani_ is the responsible agent for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Indian subcontinent (ISC). The disease is lethal without treatment and causes 0.2 to 0.4 million cases each year.

Recently, reports of VL in Nepalese hilly districts have increased as well as VL cases caused by _L. donovani_ from the ISC1 genetic group, a new and emerging genotype.

In this study, we perform for the 1st time an integrated, untargeted genomics and metabolomics approach to characterize ISC1, in comparison with the Core Group (CG) [_Leishmania donovani_ added by Mod.EP], main population that drove the most recent outbreak of VL in the ISC.

We show that the ISC1 population is very different from the CG, both at genome and metabolome levels. The genomic differences include SNPs [single nucleotide polymorphism], CNV [copy number variation], and small indels [insertions or deletions] in genes coding for known virulence factors, immunogens, and surface proteins.

Both genomic and metabolic approaches highlighted dissimilarities related to membrane lipids, the nucleotide salvage pathway and the urea cycle in ISC1 versus CG. Many of these pathways and molecules are important for the interaction with the host/extracellular environment.

Altogether, our data predict major functional differences in ISC1 versus CG parasites, including virulence. Therefore, particular attention is required to monitor the fate of this emerging ISC1 population in the ISC, especially in a post-VL elimination context.

[The study underlines how important it is to correctly identify the _Leishmania_ genotype in clinical trials. So far it is not clear how the metabolic differences between _L. donovani_ and the new variant _Leishmania_ affects pathogenicity, drug susceptibility, or transmission. - Mod.EP
