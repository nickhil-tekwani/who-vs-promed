[Response to a previous posting: British officials fear BSE water
contamination. - Mod.TG
-------------------------------
The only reference to deactivation of prions in soils I know of I give
below. This reference has often been quoted to show prions are not
deactivated in soil, when in fact it shows 100 to 1000-fold decrease in 3
years.
Survival of scrapie virus after 3 years' interment. Lancet (British
Edition) 1991 337 8736 169-270
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.
Supernatant fluid from a scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenate was
mixed with soil, packed into perforated petri dishes that were then
embedded within soil-containing pots, and buried in a garden, in the
Washington DC area, for 3 years. Between 2 and 3 log units of the input
infectivity of nearly 5 log units survived this exposure, with little
leaching of virus into deeper soil layers. These results have implications
for environmental contamination by scrapie and by similar agents, including
those of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD).
------
My understanding is infective prion fibrils are completely insoluble in
water. In any case any significant leakage from the sites would show gross
contamination from bacteria and putrifaction products that would surely
effectively render water quite unpotable long before one need worry about
purported trace prionic contamination. Bearing in mind the extensive
exposure of UK cattle to infective levels of BSE prion one should remember
prions are, in fact, not very infective when taken orally.
I would agree more experiments to properly evaluate the movement and
degradation of prions in soil are long overdue.
