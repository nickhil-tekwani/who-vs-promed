Cruise Ship Oceana Outbreak: A Total of 212 Passengers and Crew Affected
--------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Mon 9 Dec 2002
that 197 passengers and 15 crew members aboard the cruise ship Oceana
have come down with a gastrointestinal illness. A CDC field team
boarded the ship on Sat 7 Dec 2002 in Barbados to gather more
information on the outbreak. "We conducted interviews with passengers
and crew members and gathered samples," said CDC spokeswoman Susan
McClure. "The investigation continues." There are 1859 passengers and
868 crew aboard, according to a statement released by the CDC.
The Oceana left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on 29 Nov 2002 and is
scheduled to return on Fri 13 Dec 2002, said a spokeswoman for P&O
Cruises, the company that owns the ship. The spokeswoman said crew
members were trying to keep sick passengers comfortable and hydrated.
According to a spokeswoman for the cruise line, the ship left Antigua
on Monday [bound] for St. Maarten. On 29 Nov 2002 the Oceana
underwent a routine unannounced inspection and scored 95 out of 100
points, the CDC statement said.
The Oceana was the latest cruise ship to be stricken by outbreaks in
recent weeks. Passengers and crew on 4 consecutive cruises of Holland
America's Amsterdam and 2 cruises of Disney's Magic were sickened by
a Norwalk-like virus. A Norwalk-like virus is also suspected in a
recent outbreak aboard Carnival's Fascination.
A shipboard laboratory determined that _Salmonella_ bacteria caused a
recent outbreak of stomach illness on the Seven Seas Mariner, but the
CDC has yet to confirm that finding. _Salmonella_ bacteria cause a
food-borne illness with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal
cramps.

[While the Oceana outbreak resembles those believed to be caused by
Norwalk-like virus on other cruise ships, the etiology of these cases
has not yet been established. ProMED-mail would appreciate any
further details of the Oceana outbreak. - Mod.LM]
