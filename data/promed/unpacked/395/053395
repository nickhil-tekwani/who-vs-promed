HEPATITIS C - CHINA (04): (ANHUI, HENAN), REUSED NEEDLES

More than 200 villagers, many of them children, have been found
infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) in east and central China over
the past 2 weeks, with the reuse of old needles by a rural clinic
suspected as the cause.

Between 17 Nov and 1 Dec 2011, 105 people from the Dancheng township
of Woyang county in the eastern province of Anhui tested positive for
the disease, a spokesman with the Woyang Health Bureau said on Sat 3
Dec 2011. But no serious cases have been reported, he said.

Earlier, 104 people in the neighboring Maqiao township of Yongcheng
city in the central province of Henan had also tested positive for the
virus, and 6 of them had been confirmed as HCV patients.

Investigators are focusing on a 60 year old doctor at a privately-run
village clinic in Maqiao (Henan province). He is suspected of causing
the infection by reusing old needles. Local residents said the village
doctor for 4 decades seldom changed needles and is known as the
"miracle doctor" for his ability to alleviate patients' fever and
diarrhea through injections and a few tablets.

HCV is mainly transmitted through contact with infected blood. It can
also spread through sex and from mother to baby during delivery. The
infection may lead [eventually] to liver cancer.

[Since the previous report of this localised outbreak on 30 Nov 2011,
the number of cases in Henan province has increased from 56 to 104,
and from 70 to 105 cases in an adjacent region of Anhui province.
Most, perhaps all, of these cases are being attributed to malpractice
by a village doctor in Maqiao, Henan province. This physician is
believed to have used unsterilised needles habitually during the past
40 years, apparently according to this account without detriment to
his patients. However, it is the long term consequences of hepatitis C
virus infection that are the most threatening, notwithstanding the
fact that some forms of hepatitis C virus infection can now be treated
successfully. More precise diagnostic information would be welcomed.
