Florida officials have already tallied 51 confirmed cases of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) in 2005 as of 17 Jun 2005 (46 of them since 1 May), and
the state could be approaching a record year for EEE infections. Florida
practitioners received a letter last week from Michael A Short, DVM,
veterinarian manager of equine programs in Florida's Division of Animal
Industry, urging them to submit samples from suspected cases.
The situation is reminiscent of the high-level years 1982 and 2003, when
reports topped 200 EEE cases. At least 20 of the 2005 cases have died or
been euthanized as a result of the infection. Central Florida has
experienced the most cases so far, and most of the affected animals have
not been current on their EEE vaccinations.
EEE is caused by a virus found in wild birds that is transmitted to horses
and humans via the bite of an infected mosquito. Horses do not develop high
enough levels of the EEE virus in their blood to be contagious to other
animals or humans.
Onset of clinical signs can be rapid and severe; signs can include fever
and neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), head pressing, or
muscle fasciculations (twitching).
"Most of the animals that contract EEE die," said Short. "The majority of
EEE cases that we follow up on have either been euthanized or died from the
disease. I believe the literature usually states the EEE is fatal in
approximately 90 per cent of cases, and this is accurate in my own experience.
"Please be aware that any form of equine encephalitis is a reportable
disease," Short added. "All suspected encephalitis cases should be reported
by submitting the completed Arboviral Encephalitis Case Information Form
and serum to the Kissimmee Diagnostic Lab (the form was sent with the email
to veterinarians, but the form also can be obtained from the Division of
Animal Industry at 850/410-0952 or 850/410-0901 or the Kissimmee Diagnostic
Lab at 321/697-1400)."
He said he sent the form out to encourage better compliance in reporting
cases, as he knows not all cases are reported and the actual number of
cases is probably much higher than the current count. "The case information
is placed in a database, which is used to keep the equine community
informed and utilized by the Florida Department of Health in assessing the
human risk associated with the arboviruses (viruses spread by mosquitoes),"
added Short.

[There is an approved and effective vaccination for prevention of EEE. As
Dr Short pointed out, most of the cases were unvaccinated horses. Generally
the vaccine is a combination for eastern, western, (and some times
Venezuelan) equine encephalitis. This vaccine can also be combined with
West Nile virus vaccine. With this many cases this early in the summer, it
would be a proactive, protective measure for owners to be sure they have
vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
