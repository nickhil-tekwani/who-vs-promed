I've found this report very interesting. I agree with the Moderator's
considerations about rodent populations. I don't believe that such extreme
temperatures (up to 33C) can promote tick activity. _Ixodes ricinus_ has
its maximum host seeking activity when the average [temperature is about
20C and the humidity is high. Rainfalls and special ecological conditions,
such forestation, altitude and availability of special hosts such
_Capreolus capreolus_ [roe deer ( at least in Italy), that can tolerate
great masses of parasites can probably contribute to increase the activity
of the ticks more than high temperature itself. On the other hand, high
temperatures are more likely to increase human outdoor activity and
consequently the exposure to the ticks' bite ( temperature could act here
as a confounder, being related both to exposure and to tick activity).
About bare-head: it is certainly possible that not wearing an hat does not
increase the probability of being bitten by a tick but, in a preliminary
study on patients presented at a local emergency unit for tick bite (_Ix.
ricinus_), I've found that bites on the head (14% of all the observed
localizations) are 7.5 [times more frequent in children (up to 16) than in
adults (chi-square Yates-corrected gave a P of 0.00002955). Wearing a hat
could anyway prevent bites on the head, in particularly in children!
