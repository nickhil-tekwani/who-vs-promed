PARAMYXOVIRUS, PIGS - AUSTRALIA (NEW SOUTH WALES)

Emergency report
Text of a fax received on 22 September 1997 from Dr G. Murray, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Primary Industries and Energy, Canberra:
A virus in the family Paramyxoviridae has been isolated from stillborn
piglets with abnormalities of the brain, spinal cord and skeleton at a New
South Wales piggery at Menangle.
Over a 4-month period, starting in mid-April 1997, the affected piggery
experienced a substantial reduction in farrowing rate, associated with
birth of mummified fetuses and stillborn piglets, some with deformities. No
other clinical signs have been detected in pigs of any age. Measures have
been taken to contain infection on the affected farm and to test for its
presence at other piggeries in Australia. No evidence of the disease
elsewhere in Australia has been detected.
Studies to characterize the virus are progressing and experimental
transmission trials are underway.
[This seems to have occurred on a large piggery. We will watch for other
outbreaks. Any information would be appreciated. - Mod. pc]
