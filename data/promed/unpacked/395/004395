Pulaski Police are warning residents about a deadly distemper outbreak. Five dogs in the last 6 months were euthanized by Animal Control after testing positive for distemper. "We have had several complaints from citizens about raccoons being in their yard, possibly rabid," said officer Megan Jennings.

But the animals were tested, and animal control says that, while results were negative for rabies, they were positive for distemper, which is why local police on Monday [13 Feb 2012] notified pet owners in Pulaski. "We heard of a problem; we just want to get the information out there," said Jennings.

"Most common signs that you are going to be seeing are fever, snotty nose, crusties around the eyes, diarrhea," said Dr Jared Morgan. Morgan, a local vet who runs Tipton Ridge Veterinary Medical Center, says he received plenty of calls when word got around. "People have gotten very concerned, [saying] 'hey, what do we need to worry about, what do we need to look for?' What we are telling people is that if they are vaccinating their dogs in a proper fashion, then they are getting good protection," said Morgan.

But if you are concerned that your pet is not feeling well, police encourage people to call their vet.

[Clinical signs of distemper in dogs include a transient fever, which usually occurs 3-6 days after infection, and there may be a leukopenia (especially lymphopenia) at this time; these signs may go unnoticed or be accompanied by anorexia. The fever subsides for several days before a 2nd fever occurs, which lasts less than one week. This may be accompanied by serous nasal discharge, mucopurulent ocular discharge, and anorexia.

Gastrointestinal and respiratory signs may follow and are usually complicated by secondary bacterial infections. An acute encephalomyelitis may occur in association with or following the systemic disease, or in the absence of systemic manifestations. Hyperkeratosis of the footpads (hardpad disease) and epithelium of the nasal plane may be seen.

Neurologic signs are frequently seen in those dogs with hyperkeratosis. CNS signs include the following: 1) localized involuntary twitching of a muscle or group of muscles (myoclonus, chorea, flexor spasm, hyperkinesia), such as in the leg or facial muscles; 2) paresis or paralysis, often most noticeable in the hindlimbs as ataxia, followed by tetraparesis and tetraparalysis; and 3) convulsions characterized by salivation and often chewing movements of the jaw (chewing-gum fits). The seizures become more frequent and severe, and the dog may fall on its side and paddle its legs; involuntary urination and defecation (grand mal seizure, epileptiform convulsion) often occur. A dog may exhibit any or all of these neurologic signs in addition to others in the course of the disease.

Infection may be mild and inapparent or lead to severe disease manifest by most of the above signs. The course of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days, but the onset of neurologic signs may be delayed for several weeks or months.

Chronic distemper encephalitis (old dog encephalitis, [ODE]), a condition often marked by ataxia, compulsive movements such as head pressing or continual pacing, and incoordinated hypermetria, may be seen in adult dogs without a history of signs related to systemic canine distemper. The development of neurologic signs is often more progressive. Although canine distemper antigen has been detected in the brain of some dogs with ODE by fluorescent antibody staining, dogs with ODE are not infectious, and replication-competent virus has not been isolated. Genetic methods may be needed to document infection. The disease is caused by an inflammatory reaction associated with persistent canine distemper virus infection in the CNS.

Treatments are directed at limiting secondary bacterial invasion, supporting fluid balance, and controlling nervous manifestations. Antibiotics, balanced electrolyte solutions, parenteral nutrition, dietary supplements, antipyretics, nasal preparations, analgesics, and anticonvulsants are used. No single treatment is specific or uniformly successful. Dogs may recover completely from systemic manifestations, but good nursing care is essential. Despite intensive care, some dogs do not make a satisfactory recovery. Unfortunately, treatment for acute neurologic manifestations of distemper is unsuccessful. If the neurologic signs are progressive or severe, the owner should be appropriately advised. Dogs with some of the more chronic progressive or vaccine-induced forms of neurologic disease may respond to immunosuppressive therapy with anti-inflammatory or greater dosages of glucocorticoids.

Successful immunization of pups with canine distemper modified live virus (MLV) vaccines depends on the lack of interference by maternal antibody. To overcome this barrier, pups are vaccinated with MLV vaccine when 6 weeks old and at 2 to 4 week intervals until 16 weeks old. Measles virus induces immunity to canine distemper virus in the presence of relatively greater levels of maternal distemper antibody. An MLV measles vaccine and a combination of MLV measles and MLV canine distemper vaccine are available. Measles vaccines must be administered IM. Pups 6-7 weeks old should receive the measles or combination vaccine and at least 2 more doses of MLV distemper vaccine when 12-16 weeks old. Many varieties of attenuated distemper vaccine are available and should be used according to manufacturers' directions. MLV vaccines can produce postvaccinal illness in some immunosuppressed dogs. A recombinant canarypox vector vaccine expressing distemper virus proteins is available. Annual revaccination has been suggested because of the breaks in neurologic distemper that can occur in stressed, diseased, or immunosuppressed dogs. Longer than yearly intervals of administration have been suggested with MLV vaccines; however, this should be tempered with the prevalence of the disease and other potential risk factors.

Canine distemper virus infection is probably the commonest viral disease in raccoons. The clinical signs, and gross and histopathologic lesions in raccoons are similar to distemper in dogs. Neurologic signs due to distemper virus infection in raccoons are virtually indistinguishable from rabies induced neurologic disease. Diagnosis is based upon histopathologic lesions in brain, lung, spleen, and small intestine. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmicinclusion bodies can be visualized in many cells including epithelial cells in the respiratory epithelium, gastric mucosa, and transitional epithelium lining the renal pelvis and urinary bladder. The best tissues for fluorescent antibody testing and virus isolation of canine distemper virus are lung, brain, stomach, small intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder.

The best protection is vaccination for your dog. However, don't take chances with raccoons. This disease can look like rabies clinically, and an affected raccoon should be tested for rabies.
