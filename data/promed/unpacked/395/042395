Ribavirin for treatment of suspected Nipah cases
------------------------------------------------
The anti-viral drug ribavarin, which was widely used in Malaysia when Nipah
struck there in 1999, is being used in Nadia to treat the suspected cases.
Health officials here said ribavarin, a tablet of which costs around Rs 75
[USD 1.84], will be given to the 30 patients down with fever at Betai
village and in Krishnagar. Their blood samples have been sent to the
National Institute of Virology, Pune, for confirmatory tests.
Of the 30 patients, 20 are from Betai, close to the Bangladesh border,
about 150 km from Calcutta. Nadia chief medical officer Mrinal Kanti Biswas
said the decision to procure ribavarin was taken following advice from
experts at the Pune institute. "We are buying the drug from Hyderabad and
will distribute it free to those who show symptoms of the affliction or run
temperature for days," said Biswas.
A 3 member medical board has been set up to monitor fever cases being
reported to hospitals and health centres in the district. Suspected
patients will be kept under observation in isolation wards. Besides a
district hospital in Krishnagar, Nadia has 4 subdivisional hospitals and 7
block hospitals.
Nipah has no cure, but ribavarin would alleviate the symptoms of nausea,
vomiting, and convulsion, said doctors. The virus, which has claimed 3
lives in the district and afflicted many, could have come from Bangladesh.
Tapas Majumder, the first victim from Betai, had been to the neighbouring
country on a business trip in February. "He was running a temperature
within days of his return," district magistrate S Meena said.
The virus, 1st detected in Malaysia in 1999, has since been known to strike
only 2 other places, Bangladesh and Bengal. It killed 105 of the 265
patients in Malaysia, 18 of 30 in Bangladesh in April 2004, and [75 per
cent] of the 66 it infected in Siliguri in 2001.

[Ribavirin (Virazole) is a nucleoside analog considered to have broad
spectrum antiviral activity against several DNA- and RNA-containing
viruses. It is relatively toxic and accordingly its use has been
restricted. Notably it has been used in life-threatening respiratory
syncytial virus infection in infancy, against certain exotic viruses such
as Lassa fever virus and more recently Nipah virus, and in combination with
pegylated interferon against certain genotypes of hepatitis C virus.
Although first synthesized in 1972 its node of antiviral activity is
unclear. Among other effects, ribavirin monophosphate is a competitive
inhibitor of cellular monophosphate dehydrogenase which results in
reduction of GTP (guanosine triphosphate) pools in treated cells. The use
of ribavirin for treatment of the symptoms of suspected Nipah virus
infection in patients in West Bengal with undefined fevers seems a rather
extreme responds at this juncture. - Mod.CP]
