North Carolina's 2nd case of eastern equine encephalitis this year [2015] was confirmed on [Mon 17 Aug 2015] after a Scotland County horse exhibiting signs was euthanized last week [week of 10 Aug 2015].

According to Mike Neault, director of livestock for the NC Department of Agriculture's veterinary division, the 18-month old thoroughbred had not been vaccinated.

"This is one of those mosquito-borne diseases that people can get," Neault said. "It's preventable with vaccines in horses, so we would encourage that when it comes to EEE and other diseases like West Nile virus, horse owners work with a veterinarian to develop a vaccine schedule for their animals."

EEE causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord and is usually fatal. Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions, and death. Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

The state recorded 12 EEE cases in horses in 2014. In Scotland County, the disease was last recorded in a horse in 2009. The county saw a non-fatal human case in 2006.

The virus has been detected in North Carolina for many years and is considered endemic, meaning the virus is now commonly found in the state and owners should take appropriate measures to protect their horses. State veterinary officials recommend that horses receive the initial 2-dose vaccine protocol, followed by booster shots every 6 months.

"If your horses exhibit any signs of EEE, contact your veterinarian immediately," said State Veterinarian Doug Meckes. "Several serious contagious diseases, such as West Nile virus, equine herpes virus and rabies, have similar signs and should be ruled out."

The vaccinations initially require 2 shots, 30 days apart, for horses, mules, and donkeys that have no prior vaccination history. Horses in North Carolina should receive a booster shot every 6 months because mosquitoes can be active for a large part of the year.

People, horses, and birds can become infected from a bite by a mosquito carrying the disease, but there is no evidence that horses can transmit the viruses to other horses, birds or people through direct contact.

In the United States, equine encephalitides for which vaccines are available include eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile Virus encephalomyelitis.

The distribution of EEE has historically been restricted to the eastern, southeastern, and some southern states (but disease incidence is also reported in the upper Midwestern states of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin). Outbreaks of WEE have been recorded in the western and mid-western states. Variants of WEE have caused sporadic cases in the northeast and southeast, most notably Florida. VEE occurs in South and Central America but has not been diagnosed in the United States for more than 35 years. The availability of licensed vaccine products combined with an inability to completely eliminate risk of exposure justifies immunization against EEE and WEE as core prophylaxis for all horses residing in or traveling to North America and any other geographic areas where EEE and/or WEE is endemic.

Transmission of EEE/WEE/VEE is by mosquitoes, and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects, to horses from wild birds or rodents, which serve as natural reservoirs for these viruses. Human beings are also susceptible to these diseases when the virus is transmitted to them by infected mosquitoes; however, horse-to-horse, or horse-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is highly unlikely, because the amount of virus in the blood of horses affected by EEE or WEE is small. The viremia that occurs with VEE is higher and direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission is possible. Of these 3 encephalidites, WEE has the lowest mortality (about 50 percent). Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the most virulent for horses, with mortality approaching 90 percent. Epidemiological evidence indicates that young horses are particularly susceptible to disease caused by EEE. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis can also be lethal, however some horses develop subclinical infections which result in lasting immunity.

The risk of exposure and geographic distribution of EEE and WEE vary from year-to-year with changes in distribution of insect vectors and reservoirs important in the natural ecology of the virus. EEE activity in mosquito and birds, and resultant disease in humans and equids, continues to cause concern along the East Coast and demonstrates northward encroachment. WEE has caused minimal disease in horses in the last two decades; however, the virus continues to be detected in mosquitoes and birds throughout the Western states. In addition, variants that cause clinical disease in equids have been detected in the eastern US.

VEE is a reportable foreign animal disease. Epidemics of VEE occur when the virus undergoes genetic change and develops greater virulence in avian and mammalian hosts. These viral variants are able to multiply to high levels in the horse and then the horse becomes a reservoir in these outbreaks. Areas of Southern Texas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the West Coast of Florida are likely at the most risk for natural VEE encroachment from central and south America.

Vaccination against VEE is controversial because:
1. Vaccination against a foreign animal disease may confound testing in the event of an outbreak. However, vaccination against EEE/WEE will also cause cross-reaction in VEE antibody testing.
2. Experimental and field data have demonstrated that previous infection with either EEE or WEE may provide cross protection against VEE. It is therefore possible that EEE/WEE bivalent vaccination may provide partial cross-protection, although it is likely to be less than that following infection.
3. A conditionally available modified live (MLV) vaccine has been released during previous outbreaks. Should an outbreak occur it is likely that this highly attenuated MLV would be released, and this MLV provides superior protection against transmissible viremia.

In summary, horses that receive annual EEE/WEE vaccines may be partially protected against VEE infection. In the event of an outbreak, the availability of and vaccination with the highly effective MLV product would induce rapid, complete immunity while allowing for accurate surveillance before VEE specific vaccination. The use of killed VEE vaccine should be performed only in high risk areas of the US, at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, or when necessary, with input from state agriculture officials. The use of the inactivated VEE vaccine is less effective that the MLV VEE vaccine, and will blunt responses to the MLV VEE vaccine.

Vaccines
--------
EEE/WEE vaccines currently available are formalin inactivated adjuvanted whole virus products. Early testing of bivalent (EEE/WEE) vaccines was performed by intracranial challenge with either EEE and WEE; the formalin inactivated preparations were shown to be highly efficacious protecting against clinical disease. Currently, the only available VEE vaccines are killed products; an MLV would be conditionally released in the face of an outbreak.

Vaccination schedules EEE/WEE
-----------------------------
Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals of high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4 week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs first.

Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

In the southeastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4 week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day [8-week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma.
