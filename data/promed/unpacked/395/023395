Indonesia and Myanmar this week joined their neighbours in the region in
banning meat, poultry and dairy imports from several European countries.
France said on Tuesday its tests on food products and animal feedstuffs had
uncovered no contamination by the cancer-causing chemical, but Asian
nations were taking no chances.
China has launched a nationwide effort to track down any meat, poultry and
dairy products imported from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany
since January 15, the official China Daily newspaper reported on Tuesday.
The newspaper also said China would only allow meat, dairy and poultry
products from the four countries to be sold after they have been certified
as dioxin free. Otherwise, they would be destroyed, it said.
Europe's most serious food scare since the ``mad cow'' crisis broke after
it emerged that chickens on about 400 farms in Belgium had been given feed
contaminated with the toxic chemical dioxin.
Countries around the world have now shut their borders to Belgian meat and
dairy products and some have widened the temporary bans to include other
European Union countries.
Hong Kong, which suspended the sale of poultry, pork, beef and dairy
products from the four countries effective June 4 and is considering
banning the import of eggs, began recalling suspect eggs from local
retailers late last week. One million eggs had been recalled by late
Tuesday. They were to be marked, sealed and stored by the importers
until investigations into the food scare in Belgium were complete.
The Australian New Zealand Food Authority said import bans on egg, poultry,
beef pork and dairy products from Belgium, France and the Netherlands were
still in place, but would be reviewed on Thursday.
In Malaysia, health officials said $2.8 million worth of foodstuffs had
been detained since June 9 at border points. Another $700 million was taken
off shop shelves, they added. But on Tuesday, the health ministry said
51 imported products had been certified dioxin-free and would be allowed
back in.
Singapore lifted its ban on Swiss products, except for eggs, some brands of
Irish-produced infant milk formula, and products from Norway including egg
and dairy products.
Full bans remained in place in the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand.
