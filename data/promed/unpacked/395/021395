Officials in Manitoba are reporting what they say is the province's 1st case of chronic wasting disease, a nervous system disorder affecting large game animals. The province says in a news release on 14 Oct 2021 as part of its wildlife health surveillance program, a male mule deer was observed to be unhealthy and was euthanized in western Manitoba, near Lake of the Prairies.

Testing found the animal to have chronic wasting disease, the release says, adding it's the 1st time it's been found in Manitoba. The province is immediately implementing a ban on hunting deer, moose, caribou and elk in the area to ensure the disease is not spread through the transport of a diseased carcass.

Chronic wasting disease, or CWD, infects animals like deer, moose and caribou, and an afflicted animal can appear normal for years until it begins to lose weight and co-ordination before dying. It was first found in Canada in 1996, and since then it has appeared in deer and elk in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Quebec.

"The province has immediately begun to plan for additional CWD surveillance actions in the area surrounding this finding and has reached out to multiple stakeholders, First Nations, Metis and other groups who need to be aware," the provincial news release stated. "The province will need the full co-operation of the public, including hunters, producers and land-owners to ensure this disease is contained or even eradicated from the area."

For the 1st time, a wild deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Fond du Lac County, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The deer was located in the town of Eldorado, within 10 miles of the Winnebago County border. State law requires the DNR to extend baiting and feeding bans in both counties.

A landowner reported the deer to the DNR in early October [2021]. It was an adult doe. "The deer showed outward signs of disease and possible injury by car collision," reads a statement from the DNR.

CWD is a fatal nervous system disease that impacts deer, moose, elk, and reindeer.

Baiting and feeding bans already existed in the 2 counties due to prior CWD detections in adjoining counties. The new detection will extend the ban for 3 years in Fond du Lac County and 2 years in Winnebago County.

"To help slow the spread of CWD, the DNR enacts baiting and feeding bans in counties where deer have tested positive for CWD as required by state law. Bait piles can encourage deer to congregate unnaturally around a shared food source where sick deer can spread CWD through direct contact with healthy deer or by leaving behind infectious prions in their saliva and urine," says the DNR.

The DNR is asking hunters in the counties to help them identify potential cases of CWD. They're asking hunters to have harvested deer tested for the disease.

On Tuesday [9 Nov 2021], Wisconsin's Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) released information regarding a deer testing positive for chronic waste disease (CWD). Test results confirming the discovery of the disease were done by the National Veterinary Service Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

The 3-year-old white-tailed deer came from an Eau Claire County hunt ranch. The herd of about 15 deer is currently under quarantine, according to the release. An epidemiological investigation is currently being done by both the DATCP with assistance from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The ranch has confirmed the deer was received from a deer farm in Waukesha County, which has also been placed under quarantine.

Throughout this year [2021], the DATCP has reported multiple CWD cases appearing at different deer ranches throughout the state. In the month of September, 2 different outbreaks of CWD were reported. A doe in Langlade County [at a ranch with] about 57 deer tested positive, and then the next day another doe was confirmed to have CWD at a ranch in Outagamie County. During the month of October, the DNR expanded a baiting and feeding ban in Fond du Lac County when a wild deer in Eldorado was discovered with CWD.

CWD is a neurological disease fatal to deer, elk, and moose alike. It is caused by an infectious protein referred to as "prion" affecting the animal's brain. Authorities explain typically testing for CWD is usually done after the animal's death.

[4] Wyoming: new hunt areas

https://oilcity.news/community/animals/2021/11/01/chronic-wasting-disease-confirmed-in-three-more-wyoming-elk-hunt-areas/


The presence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been confirmed in 3 new Wyoming elk hunt areas, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said on Monday [1 Nov 2021].

The presence of the disease was confirmed based on testing of lymph node samples from 3 hunter-harvested bull elk. The disease was confirmed in Elk Hunt Area 98 in the Pinedale Region. That elk hunt area overlays Deer Hunt Area 138, where chronic wasting disease was confirmed in January [2021].

Chronic wasting disease was also confirmed in Elk Hunt Areas 36 and 129 in the Sheridan Region. "Elk Hunt Area 36 is surrounded on 3 sides by Elk Hunt Areas 37, 46, and 35, which have been CWD-positive since 2019, 2020 and 2009, respectively," Game and Fish said. "Elk Hunt Area 129 overlays 9 CWD-positive Deer Hunt Areas (8, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29) and one CWD-negative Deer Hunt Area (31)."

The department announces when chronic wasting disease is confirmed in new hunt areas to ensure hunters are aware. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discourages people from consuming meat from any animal "obviously ill or testing positive for CWD," according to Game and Fish.

The department provides a map of CWD-endemic areas online. Game and Fish adds it relies on hunters to help monitor the spread of the disease.

"Throughout the fall, Game and Fish has been asking hunters to collect lymph node samples from harvested deer and elk for CWD testing in focused monitoring hunt areas across Wyoming," the department said. "Hunters are an important component in helping Game and Fish understand the disease and achieve CWD monitoring goals. When hunters submit samples, they are entered into a prize raffle."

Game and Fish has been conducting efforts to monitor the spread of chronic wasting disease for over 2 decades. The department said wildlife managers believe the disease will be found in new deer and elk hunt areas based on past surveillance.

"In 2020, Game and Fish personnel tested 6496 CWD samples and continue to evaluate new recommendations for trying to manage the disease," the department said. "So far, over 3600 samples have been tested in 2021."

"Please visit the Game and Fish website for more information on chronic wasting disease testing, transmission and regulations on transportation and disposal of carcasses."

A mule deer buck that was euthanized in Baker city limits in Hunting District 705 has been found to have chronic wasting disease (CWD). Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) officials euthanized the deer on 27 Oct 2021 after residents reported it was acting lethargic and visibly emaciated and had droopy ears, which are signs of the disease.

An initial test came back positive for CWD, and results for a 2nd confirmation test should be available next week FWP said. "We are awaiting a 2nd test to confirm the positive, but given the animal was symptomatic and we are in the middle of hunting season, we wanted to get the information out to the public as quickly as possible," said Baker-area wildlife biologist Melissa Foster.

FWP is reminding hunters the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hunters harvesting a deer, elk or moose from an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested for CWD prior to consuming the meat, and to not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.

Information on sample collection, the submission form and ways to submit your samples can be found on FWP's website.

This season, southeast Montana's Hunting Districts 700 and 703 are within the Priority Surveillance Areas for CWD sampling, but hunters harvesting an animal in any area can seek sampling services. Hunters in southeast Montana can have their deer, elk or moose tested at the regional office in Miles City during normal business hours or at the check station in Hysham, which is being operated on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays from 9:00 am until dark throughout the remainder of the hunting season.

Chronic wasting disease, a fatal brain disease affecting deer, elk, and moose, has been confirmed in a new area in central South Dakota. The disease was detected in an adult female mule deer in Stanley County. Stanley County is now considered in the CWD-endemic area.

South Dakota has now confirmed CWD in 18 counties of western and central South Dakota. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission recently modified carcass transportation and disposal regulations for the entire state effective beginning with the 2021 hunting seasons. The goal of the new CWD regulations is to help reduce the artificial spread of the disease into new areas of South Dakota.

The Idaho Fish and Game says 2 mule deer bucks have tested positive for chronic wasting [disease] (CWD). The bucks were harvested in October [2021] near Lucile.

Both hunters have been notified of the positive tests. This marks the 1st time an animal in the state of Idaho has tested positive for chronic wasting disease, though the disease has been known to exist in the USA for over 40 years, according to the Department of Fish and Game.

Fish and Game advises anyone hunting in Unit 14 to have any harvested deer or elk tested for the disease. Chronic wasting disease is a contagious neurological disease that is fatal in 100% of cases. The disease affects deer, elk, moose, and reindeer.

The signs of chronic wasting disease in deer, elk, and caribou are:

- Excessive salivation
- Drooping head and ears
- Tremors
- Extremely low body weight
- Unusual behavior such as having no fear of humans and a lack of coordination

[8] Michigan (Kent County): elk
Date: Thu 18 Nov 2021

https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/0,4610,7-125--572624--,00.html


Today [18 Nov 2021] the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) confirmed 2 cases of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in elk from a farmed cervid facility in Kent County. The 2 infected elk, a 2.5-year-old and a 3.5-year-old, were discovered through disease tracing efforts resulting from finding CWD in a different Michigan farmed cervid herd. These are the 1st cases of CWD in Michigan elk.

CWD is a fatal neurological disease that affects different cervid species, including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. The disease can be transmitted directly from one animal to another and indirectly through the environment. While an infected animal may appear healthy for months or years, it will eventually display abnormal behavior, progressive weight loss, and physical debilitation in the latter stages of the disease.

"The discovery of chronic wasting disease in elk housed at a facility linked to a positive animal is not surprising," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, DVM. "MDARD's main priority is to limit the spread of this disease by working together with other state departments, farmers, and ranchers. These findings underscore how important it is to pay attention to CWD and the movement of animals possibly allowing the disease to spread."

The presence of CWD in farmed cervid facilities and free-ranging deer is not new to Michigan. Since 2008, including these new cases, CWD has been detected at 9 Michigan cervid farms in the following counties: Kent (2), Mecosta (3), Montcalm (3), and Newaygo.

No wild elk have tested positive for CWD in Michigan. The disease was first discovered in free-ranging deer in May 2015; cases have been found across 9 counties in Michigan's Upper and Lower Peninsulas. To date, 37 free-ranging white-tailed deer have tested positive for CWD in Kent County.

As part of MDARD's disease response, investigations are ongoing to rule out any possible exposure to other farmed cervids.

Currently, there have been no reported cases of CWD infection in humans. However, as a precaution, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that animals that have tested positive for CWD should not be consumed as food by either humans or domestic animals.

More information about CWD can be found at http://Michigan.gov/CWD and http://Michigan.gov/MDARD-Cervid.

[Sometimes hunt areas are not necessarily counties but rather geographic areas on a map because of some geological feature. In other cases, the disease is tracked using counties. Essentially, it is the area being infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) recognized for the 1st time in a particular locale (hunt area or county).

"CWD is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environment contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)" (https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-chronic-wasting-disease). - Mod.TG
