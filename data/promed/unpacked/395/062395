[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 830 051, with reports of cases by 214 countries and territories worldwide. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 97.1% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 32.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 197 245 deaths have been reported, 192 613 (97.7%) outside mainland China.

Noteworthy is that in the past 24 hours, Ecuador has doubled the number of cases, going from 11 183 to 22 719. According to a media report, more testing became available and this reflects the situation better. This brings Ecuador just behind Brazil, and will probably surpass Brazil in the coming days (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/ecuador-test-results-are-in-and-confirmed-cases-have-doubled (see part 2 of today's summaries, COVID-19 update (129): China, S. Korea & high local transmission countries 20200425.7265865, for more discussion of the outbreak in Ecuador.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2, and Italy is number 3, followed by France, Germany, UK, Turkey, Iran, China, and Russia as number 10. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Countries not reporting cases
Date: Fri 24 Apr 2020
Source: Gideon Blog [edited]
https://www.gideononline.com/2020/04/19/but-there-are-no-cases-in-turkmenistan


If you search the Internet for countries which have reported COVID-19, an endless variety of sources will describe the status of this disease in 207 countries and their dependencies. Few if any of these sites mention countries where this disease does not exist!

As of [19 Apr 2020], GIDEON lists 24 countries (10.4% of the global total) that had not yet encountered a single case. Ironically, at this point, these countries enjoy a form of "medical isolation" -- thanks to the disease itself! The chance that a traveler -- let alone an infected traveler -- can arrive in a new country is vanishingly-small because the idea of international travel has been erased by COVID-19.

In most cases, countries that are not reporting COVID-19 cases have instituted travel restrictions, surveillance, and preventive measures (masks, social distancing, etc.). Several Pacific Island Nations listed below are geographically isolated, lack sufficient medical resources, and enforce similar forms of restriction and enforcement.

The approach of 2 European countries - Tajikistan and Turkmenistan -- is notably different. Although Tajikistan enforces restricted travel and quarantine for arriving travelers, large public gatherings and sporting events are not restricted. Face masks, though not required, are commonly seen in the streets. In contrast, a report by Reporters Without Borders stated that Turkmenistan had banned the use of the word "coronavirus" and that people wearing masks could be arrested. Nonetheless, Turkmenistan does ascribe an absence of COVID-19 cases to strict enforcement of travel restrictions and announced in early April [2020] that all citizens will be tested for the virus.

A seeming absence of COVID-19 in North Korea has led to considerable speculation and even conspiracy theories. The fact that this country shares a border with China would suggest that infected individuals are likely to have entered the country; however, North Korea did impose closure of the border at an early stage of the Chinese outbreak, and imposes strict control, surveillance, and quarantine over potential cases.

[Once again, Dr Stephen Berger of Gideon Online (http://www.gideononline.com) comes to the rescue .... I am sure people have been wondering why I persist in keeping the section on new countries reporting cases... Steve's discussion explains why beautifully. There are still 24 countries that haven't reported cases as yet. Many are Island nations, but not all.

So, thank you, Steve. - Mod.MPP]

[4] WHO situation report 95 (as of 24 Apr 2020)
Date: Fri 24 Apr 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200424-sitrep-95-covid-19.pdf


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 24 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- WHO has published an interim guidance 'COVID-19 and Food Safety: Guidance for competent authorities responsible for national food safety control systems.' The guidance document provides advice and recommendations for national food safety authorities to optimize food control functions and prioritize critical services that preserve the integrity of food safety systems (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331842/WHO-2019-nCoV-Food_Safety_authorities-2020.1-eng.pdf).

- WHO has published an interim guidance 'Water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management for the COVID-19 virus' (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331846/WHO-2019-nCoV-IPC_WASH-2020.3-eng.pdf). This interim guidance is the 2nd edition and supplements existing infection prevention and control documents (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/infection-prevention-and-control) by summarizing the latest evidence on COVID-19 in water supplies and sanitation. It highlights WHO guidance on water, sanitation, hand hygiene, and healthcare waste which is relevant for viruses (including coronaviruses).

- WHO's Health Security Learning Platform (https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/) offers a number of online courses to help enhance knowledge on specific issues related to the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005). A new course, "Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak in aviation", is available (https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/course/view.php?id=328) and is the topic for today's 'subject in focus', below.


Subject in focus: new online course released on the management of COVID-19 in aviation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new, interactive e-learning course titled "Operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak in aviation" (https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/course/view.php?id=328) has been developed based on the guidance document of the same name. It can be downloaded on personal computers and mobile phones and complements the COVID-19 at Points of Entry course "Management of ill travelers at points of entry in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak" (https://extranet.who.int/hslp/training/course/view.php?id=325). It is intended for a range of audiences, including:
- national International Health Regulation (IHR) focal points;
- airport health authorities;
- local, provincial and national health surveillance and response systems;
- civil aviation authorities;
- airport operators;
- aircraft operators;
- airports;
- airlines.

The course is easy to navigate and takes approximately one hour to complete. It is organized systematically with clearly identified chapters that highlight the main concepts and case definitions, management of suspected cases at airports and on-board aircraft, cleaning and disinfection, and other key topics.

There are 6 scenarios dispersed throughout the course that challenge the learner to respond appropriately to realistic situations. The course ends with a 15-question quiz that assesses the learner's comprehension of the material and provides a review of key points.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 is stable at 212. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
The Americas region reported 38 108 new cases (46.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 2787 deaths (44.5% of the global newly reported deaths). Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 76.4% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 7.0% and Canada at 5.0%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 29.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Canada at 21.0%, Peru at 15.7%, and Mexico at 11.6%.

The European region reported 32 758 new cases (40.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 3187 deaths (50.9% of the global newly reported deaths). Russia reported 17.9% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, Spain 14.1%, the UK 14.0%, Turkey 9.5%, and Italy 8.0%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4845 new cases (5.9% of the global newly reported cases) and 139 deaths (2.2% of the global newly reported deaths). Saudi Arabia reported 1158 new cases representing 23.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran at 21.3%, Pakistan at 13.3%, Qatar 12.9%, and the United Arab Emirates at 10.7%. Saudi Arabia surpassed Iran for the 1st time.

The African region reported 1405 new cases (1.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 40 deaths (0.64% of the global newly reported deaths). there were 22 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, Nigeria reported 31.3%% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 22.6%, Cameroon at 16.9%, and Guinea at 7.2%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1880 new cases (2.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 51 deaths (0.81% of the global newly reported deaths). Singapore reported 55.2% of the newly reported cases, followed by Japan at 24.9%, and the Philippines at 14.4%. Given the high proportion of cases reported by Singapore, removing Singapore from the denominator, Japan represents 55.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by the Philippines at 32.1, and Malaysia at 8.4%.

The South East Asia region reported 2533 new cases (3.1% of the global newly reported cases) and 56 deaths (0.89% of the global newly reported deaths). India reported 66.5% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 16.3% and Indonesia at 14.1%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 48.8% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 42.0%, Sri Lanka 4.5%, and Thailand 1.8%.

Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region through (24 Apr 2020]) at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend the European region increased following the weekend but to lower levels than the prior week. The America's region does not appear to have decreased. One sees a gradual increase in the number of cases from the Africa Region. One wonders if the cases globally may have peaked near 6 Apr 2020. Time will tell.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
