An unvaccinated 10-year-old quarter horse mare developed a fever and lack of appetite while attending the Montcalm County Fair this past June [2018]. The horse was isolated and placed under veterinary care. The horse developed nasal discharge and draining submandibular lymph nodes (glands) after the fair.

Melanie Rodenhouse, a Montcalm County 4-H horse leader, said the local horse is now fine. The barns, grounds, fences, gates and all horse-related equipment were disinfected in accordance with Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (MDARD) standards and all horse shows were postponed for 2 weeks after the incident.

A total of 12 horses have been diagnosed with equine strangles in Michigan this year [2018], including an unvaccinated 13-year-old quarter horse in Shiawassee County and 2 adult Arabian geldings from the same farm in Wayne County. No quarantines were issued with any of the cases, according to MDARD.

According to Megan Sprague, a communications representative with MDARD, strangles isn't a new disease, but MDARD started reporting cases this year [2018]. "Strangles is a common horse disease," Sprague explained. "It didn't use to be reportable, but it was made reportable for the purpose of tracking and keeping data for educational purposes."

Strangles is a bacterial infection affecting the respiratory system, according to MDARD veterinarian Dr. Cheryl Collins. "It causes abscesses in the lymph nodes under the horse's jaw. Typically, they'll get fairly large, burst open, puss will come out of the nose and drain out of the abscesses," Collins explained.

Signs include fever, swollen lymph nodes, nasal discharge or pus draining from the abscesses.

Collins said she, other veterinarians and horse owners deal with equine strangles annually and it's not uncommon. The new reportable status is just giving the disease more attention.

"On a national level, they wanted us to track cases on it," Collins said. "We put diseases on (the reportable diseases list) for a variety of reasons, and one is we have to report where the disease is at."

Collins hopes an increased awareness of equine strangles reminds horse owners to practice better biosecurity and makes them more vigilant on checking their animals.

[This disease spreads very rapidly. We applaud the BLM for taking the health of the horses, these as well as those they may come into contact with, seriously.

_Streptococcus equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F/39.4-41.1 deg C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.
