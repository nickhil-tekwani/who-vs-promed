Swine flu deaths higher in elderly
----------------------------------
People age 50 and older who were hospitalized with swine flu [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection] in California had the highest
fatality rate from the illness, while those younger than 18 had the lowest
death rates. Researchers from the California Department of Public Health
looked at 1088 cases of hospitalization and death attributed to [pandemic]
H1N1 from 23 Apr 2009, shortly after the virus was discovered, to 11 Aug
2009. The findings are published in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association [JAMA 2009; 30(17): 1896-902, 4 Nov: Factors associated
with death or hospitalization due to pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
infection in California. JK Louie, M Acosta, K Winter, et al;
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/302/17/1896>; for Abstract
see comment below. - Mod.CP]

While hospitalization rates in California were highest for infants and
young adults ages 18 to 29 and lower for older people, the findings suggest
older people who are hospitalized are more likely to die. "Despite reports
that elderly persons may be "protected" by pre-existing immunity,
clinicians should closely monitor and promptly treat hospitalized patients
with pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 infection," researchers wrote.

Still, similar to statistics collected by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), data in California show [that pandemic] H1N1
is hitting young people harder than what's typically seen for seasonal flu.
The median age of hospitalized patients in California was 27. Of the 1088
hospitalization and death reports in California, 118 were deaths, which
translates into a fatality rate of 11 per cent, researchers said. For
people age 50 and older, the fatality rate was as high as 20 per cent. 8 of
the 118 deaths were reported in children younger than age 18, whereas the
remainder were in people age 18 and older. The most common causes of death
were viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are
complications of influenza.

The proportion of deaths seen over the spring and summer in California
differs from a recent analysis conducted by the CDC involving 292 deaths
reported by 28 states from 30 Aug 2009 to 10 Oct 2009. The percentage of
deaths in people age 24 and younger was 24 per cent, and in those ages 25
to 64, it was 64 per cent. 12 per cent of the deaths occurred in people age
65 and older.

[The higher death rate in the hospitalised elderly in the state of
California may be a consequence of a higher rate of comorbidities peculiar
to the inhabitants of that state. As elsewhere, the pattern remains true
that that the elderly appear to be less susceptible to infection by the
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus than the younger age groups, possibly due to
protection by preexisting immunity.

The abstract of the JAMA paper referred to above reads as follows:

"Context: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) emerged rapidly in California in
April 2009. Preliminary comparisons with seasonal influenza suggest that
pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) disproportionately affects younger ages
and causes generally mild disease.
"Objective: To describe the clinical and epidemiologic features of pandemic
2009 influenza A (H1N1) cases that led to hospitalization or death.
"Design, setting, and participants: Statewide enhanced public health
surveillance of California residents who were hospitalized or died with
laboratory evidence of pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection reported
to the California Department of Public Health between [23 Apr and 11 Aug
2009].
"Results: During the study period there were 1088 cases of hospitalization
or death due to pandemic 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection reported in
California. The median age was 27 years (range, younger than 1-92 years)
and 68 per cent (741/1088) had risk factors for seasonal influenza
complications. 66 per cent (547/833) of those with chest radiographs
performed had infiltrates and 31 per cent (340/1088) required intensive
care. Rapid antigen tests were falsely negative in 34 per cent (208/618) of
cases evaluated. Secondary bacterial infection was identified in 4 per cent
(46/1088). 21 per cent (183/884) received no antiviral treatment. Overall
fatality was 11 per cent (118/1088) and was highest (18-20 per cent) in
persons aged 50 years or older. The most common causes of death were viral
pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
"Conclusions: In the 1st 16 weeks of the current pandemic, the median age
of hospitalized infected cases was younger than is common with seasonal
influenza. Infants had the highest hospitalization rates and persons aged
50 years or older had the highest mortality rates once hospitalized. Most
cases had established risk factors for complications of seasonal influenza."
