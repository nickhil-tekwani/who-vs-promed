The death toll from dengue fever in the Philippines has reached 534
this year [2010] so far, up nearly 40 percent from the same period in
2009, officials said Wednesday [15 Sep 2010]. Last year, 383 people
died of the disease between 1 Jan-4 Sep [2009] the Department of
Health said. The department had recorded a total of 77 012 cases of
dengue infections as of 4 Sep [2010], more than double last year's 36
887 for the same period.

Among the fatalities were 118 school children, according to the
Department of Education. More than 11 000 students from 359 schools
nationwide fell ill from dengue. Doctor Eric Tayag, director of the
health department's National Epidemiology Centre, said new infections
were already on a decline amid intensified mosquito control. But he
stressed the need for communities to carry out clean-up drives to
remove breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carry the dengue virus.

More than 200 Ho Chi Minh City residents per week have contracted
dengue fever, and outbreaks of the mosquito-borne infection have been
recorded in many districts.

Medical workers of the city's Children's Hospital No. 1 are being run
off their feet, as nearly 20 kids are being rushed to the hospital
each day. Over 130 toddlers can be found in the ward daily being
treated for dengue fever, while the number of beds in the ward is 85;
accordingly, 2 or 3 child patients have to stay in one bed.

The hospital's deputy head, Le Thi Bich Lien, fretted about the
increasing number of patients but also about more serious
complications. For example, the emergency room received a 10-year-old
boy in a critical state of shock. The patient's condition had
deteriorated after 3 days of fever; his temperature had dropped on
the 4th day, but he experienced vomiting, cold hands and feet, pain
in his belly, and the patient rapidly went into a critical state of shock.

<http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2010/09/15/272609/Dengue-fever.htm>


The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warned yesterday [14 Sep 2010]
that the number of domestic dengue fever cases could exceed 1000 by
the end of the year [2010] and urged the public to get rid of
standing water, especially around residential areas.

Speaking at a weekly briefing, [Taiwan] CDC Epidemic Intelligence
Center director Chuang Jen-hsiang also said there had been a record
high number of imported cases of dengue fever in southern Taiwan this
year [2010] and predicted that the number will peak in November.

So far this year, there have been 169 cases of domestic dengue fever,
including 18 new cases reported 2 weeks ago and 49 confirmed in the
most recent week. In the same period, the CDC also recorded 202 cases
of imported dengue fever, the highest number in Taiwan's history for
the period. Chuang pointed out the number of imported cases has never
exceeded 200 in past years.

According to the CDC, the biggest epidemics of dengue fever were in
2002 with 5000 domestic cases, followed by 2007 with 2000 cases, and
2009 with 848 cases.

The CDC urged the public to clear standing water from their
neighborhoods and to avoid places that could be potential breeding
sites for the disease-carrying mosquitoes.

Health authorities in South China's Guangdong province have warned of
a possible outbreak of dengue fever after a local city reported 11
cases of the disease last week [week of 6 Sep 2010]. The warning was
issued after 11 cases of dengue fever were reported last Friday [10
Sep 2010] in an urban village of Dongguan. A local resident was
diagnosed with the disease on 22 Jul [2010] after suffering from
recurrent fever and pain following a trip to Singapore and Malaysia.
10 further cases were reported in the same neighborhood. As of
Thursday [16 Sep 2010], 6 people had recovered from the disease,
while the rest remained in hospital, sources at the Dongguan health
bureau said.

In Guangzhou [capital of Guangdong province], 6 cases of dengue fever
have been reported this year [2010], according to Yang Zhicong,
deputy director of the Guangzhou Disease Prevention and Control
Center. "They are all separate cases," said Yang, adding that no
further cases had been reported in the city in September [2010].

The underlying fears of the vector borne disease dengue, affecting
the Common Wealth Games, seems to be turning into a grim reality. The
dengue menace in Delhi continues unabated with 76 more patients
testing positive yesterday [14 Sep 2010], taking the total number of
those infected to 1933. With 5 falling prey to the virus so far and
700 cases emerging in the last 10 days, the national capital is
witnessing one of the worst outbreaks of the deadly disease in the
last 5 years. According to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD),
the number of dengue cases this year [2010] will cross the 2006
figure of 3366 cases.

The present situation in Delhi is bothering several countries and
nearly 24 have issued travel advisories, alerting travelers about the
outbreak ahead of the Commonwealth Games.

With patients increasing in number, the medical institutions are
working overtime to cope with the disease. The situation is
particularly bad in government hospitals where beds are being joined
together to accommodate more patients.

People are now heading to the Delhi University campus to get a
check-up. According to official sources, on an average 450 to 475
people come to the general medical OPD [outpatient department] at the
University Health Centre every day.

The media reports alleged that the civic body officials ... are
deliberately playing down the dengue outbreak figures and hiding the
actual number of infections. Just 2 of Delhi's testing laboratories
have around 3000 confirmed cases since mid-July, which is much more
than the 1794 being claimed by the MCD from across the city. Dr
Naveen Dang of Dr Dang's Pathology Labs, stated, "Since mid-July
[2010], our lab has tested 1000 positive dengue cases, and there are
hundreds of such labs in the city. Apart from these labs, hospitals
also test samples. "This in itself speaks volumes about the number of
cases not making to the official record books."

However, denying the allegations, Dr VK Monga, chairman of MCD's
Public Health Committee stated, "Why would we conceal figures when we
have already registered 1700 cases so far? Hospitals and clinics
claiming of higher cases can submit their data and we will analyse it."

[The situation in Delhi illustrates the difficulty in accruing
accurate case data in the face of an ongoing outbreak. Apparently,
there are many laboratories in the city doing tests for dengue virus
infection, and the comments above suggest that they are not reporting
their findings to a central public health office in the MCD. That
significantly under-estimates the number of cases and puts the public
health officials at a serious disadvantage in tracking the outbreak
in time and space and responding to what is happening in the field.
Development of a system to facilitate information flow needs to be in
place before an outbreak occurs, not during an epidemic. In this
electronic age, and with India a world leader in computer software
development, devising such a system should be possible.

The 20 Sep 2010 edition of the IC Tech News
(<http://ic-technews.com/health/1461-dengue-continues-to-claim-lives-in-ncr-2296-people-affected-till-now>)
reported more patients with dengue virus infections, taking the total
number of cases to 2296. The capital has reported 5 dengue deaths this season.

Cote d'Azur (Alpes Maritimes) in the same area of the city as the 1st
[case] in Magnan in the Carlone district near the Faculty of Letters.

This confirms, however, that local transmission of dengue virus by

being infected by the bite of an infected mosquito (_Aedes
albopictus_ female) is well and truly established. The prefecture
reminds people that "there is no direct transmission that has

We are awaiting the results of blood tests for other suspected cases
reported to the LRA. [l'Agence Regionale de Sante; Regional Health

After 19 cases of suspected dengue fever -- and at least one death --
reported in the St Thomas-St John District, the VI Health Department
issued a statement Friday [17 Sep 2010] saying that the district is
experiencing a dengue fever outbreak. According to the Health
Department statement released [Fri 17 Sep 2010], 9 of the 19
suspected cases have been laboratory-confirmed as dengue fever in the
St Thomas-St John District since June [2010]. On St Croix, there have
been 4 suspected cases with no confirmed cases. There is no
requirement in the territory that people with suspected dengue fever
undergo testing to confirm whether or not they have the
mosquito-borne virus, said Health Department epidemiologist Eugene Tull.

His experience with a 2005 outbreak on St Croix leads him to believe
that the number of dengue cases this year [2010] is higher than
reported, Tull said, adding that he is now receiving anecdotal
information about more cases in the community.

According to the release, the strain causing the current outbreak is
[dengue virus] type 2, which was responsible for the 2005 outbreak on St Croix.

of last year [2009]. But what draws attention of the specialists is
that the number of reported [cases] continues rising during this dry
season, when it should be falling.

The [dengue virus vector] mosquito which before reproduced only in
clean water now is beginning to reproduce in dirty water, including
in septic tanks. This mutation of the mosquito is bringing us an
extra problem, stated the director of Basic Action of the Health
Secretariat, Felipe Alves Cesario. [This change of breeding habitat
is surprising, and one wonders if it is accurate. - Mod.TY]
