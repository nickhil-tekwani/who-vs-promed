State health officials have confirmed that plague was responsible for the death of a Durango-area child. The 10-year-old girl was a member of a local 4H group, the Weaselskin 4H Club, confirmed one of the club's leaders, Mike Latham.

A statement released Friday evening [9 Jul 2021] from the Colorado Department of Health and Environment [CDPHE] said the investigation of the case to determine how and when the girl contracted plague is continuing. "We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan and our deepest condolences go to the family," said Dr. Jennifer House of CDPHE. "Public health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes, and to seek medical care if you have symptoms."

This is the 1st human plague death in the state in 6 years. While exceedingly rare, when infections and deaths do occur, they disproportionately occur in La Plata County, home to Durango. Residents of La Plata County made up almost half of Colorado's plague cases between 2005-2020, according to CDPHE.

San Juan Basin Public Health [SJBPH] Director Liane Jollon said her agency is working with the state to be sure there is no greater threat to residents of La Plata or elsewhere in southwest Colorado. "On behalf of all of us at SJBPH, our hearts go out to the family while we support the state's thorough investigation to keep residents safe," Jollon said in a statement.

The Durango Herald reported that the girl died on Monday [5 Jul 2021]. CDPHE confirmed Friday afternoon that they were notified of the death by Mercy Regional Medical Center, a Centura Hospital, on Wednesday afternoon [7 Jul 2021].

[The epidemiological and clinical aspects of this suspected fatal case are not given. It is not clear whether the death was related to septicemic or pneumonic plague. Some cases occur without a primary bubo, which makes diagnosis more difficult as rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobials is required to minimize morbidity and mortality.

For _Yersinia pestis_ infection, gentamicin and fluoroquinolones are typically first-line treatments in the USA. Duration of treatment is 10 to 14 days, or until 2 days after fever subsides. Oral therapy may be substituted once the patient improves. - Mod.LL
