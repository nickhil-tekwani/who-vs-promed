At the opening of the 18th Annual Conference of the Chinese Committee
of Breeding Techniques for Giant Pandas in Chengdu, Sichuan,
researcher Zhihe Zhang, director of the Committee, presented this
year's [2007] Committee work report to the conference.

It was stated at the conference that there has been an outbreak of an
unknown infectious disease among pandas in some nature reserves and
protective units in China this year [2007]. The health and safety of
the captive and wild giant panda species has therefore become a key
issue at this year's conference.

"Small scale outbreak[s] of disease this year [2007] in China alert
us to the need to pay active attention to the safety of the [giant
panda] population." Zhihe Zhang stated that population safety is one
of the most important issues affecting the survival of the giant
panda. To avoid the emergence of vicious infectious diseases similar
to SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] or avian influenza in the
giant panda population, it is extremely important to immediately
strengthen monitoring, prevention, and treatment/research of canine
distemper virus and other known and unknown infectious diseases. It
is also extremely urgent to organize response teams, equipment, and
emergency systems.

has referred this story to William Karesh of the Wildlife
Conservation Society for further comment. - Ed.LM]

[Unfortunately, the news report provides little for interpretation.
If indeed the problems being mentioned are due to an infectious
disease, there are quite a few that have been reported over the years
that can infect giant pandas. Serological evidence of exposure to
canine viruses such as morbillivirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, and
coronavirus has been reported. Of course, test validation for pandas
is unlikely and the possibility of cross-reaction to related viruses
is quite possible. Bacterial septicemias due to _E. coli_ have been
reported in captive pandas also.

Given the behavioral ecology (mostly solitary animals except during
an extremely brief breeding season and living at low densities)
contact rates among wild pandas would be very low. Though not
impossible, it would seem unlikely that that same infectious agent
was spreading among pandas unless it had an extremely long incubation
and/or period of shedding and not rapidly fatal. More likely is that
they are being exposed to organisms from other species, including
domestic animals that may be contaminating the limited remaining
panda habitat, which may lead to cross-species transmission of the
agents. Non-infectious causes such as environmental contaminants
should not be completely discounted either.

Possibly, the more valuable piece of information in this news report
is the official recognition for the need for better surveillance and
response teams to investigate morbidity and mortality. If coordinated
with local domestic animal health monitoring or reporting systems
around protected areas, it may shed light on prevalence of a number
of diseases and sources of infection.
