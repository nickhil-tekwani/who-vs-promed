Unknown disease grips Hatiya village in Sankhuwasabha
-----------------------------------------------
By this time, the entire field used to be covered by paddy and
millet, but in Hatiya Ward No. 9 and 10 of Sankhuwasabha, fields are
still barren. The reason behind this is that most residents of this
village are suffering from an unknown disease. So, they have been
unable to cultivate their land this time.
From the information given by the district health office in
Sankhuwasabha, the symptoms of the unknown disease are headache, high
fever, dizziness. and after 14 or 15 days, the patient suffers from
diarrhea, which makes the patient weak and can even lead to death.
The disease has spread through nearly the entire village.
According to the chief district officer, Mukunda Adhikari, 4 people
have been reported officially dead with the disease. According to a
letter of the Hatiya VDC secretary, altogether 7 people have died.
According to the letter, out of 42 houses in Ward No. 9, family
members of 32 houses are suffering from this unknown disease,
including 4 women. Similarly, in Ward No. 8, there are 48 people
seriously affected with this unknown disease.
Such symptoms also surfaced in Ward No. 5 and 6. The letter by the
VDC secretary stated that if proper action was not taken in time, it
could result in serious trouble to the population of this village.
The people of this village are dependent on millet for life. The
local health post lacks necessary medicine.
After the increase in the incidence of this unknown disease, a team
of 6 health personnel headed by a senior health assistant left for
the village on [24 Jul 2006], according to Dr. Sushilnath Pyakurel.
The chief district officer, Adhikari, said that the number of dead
could increase; he said that rescue efforts were in place and gave
assurances of more help.
According to the acting director, Satya Narayan Shrestha, Regional
Health Directorate, the Directorate was always ready and prepared for
providing all necessary support.
The local people believe that the government must provide necessary
support to this remote place soon.

[While it is always hazardous to try to do armchair differential
diagnoses based on limited clinical information provided in
newswires, the description of the disease process with the delayed
onset of diarrhea as presented above has one lean towards typhoid
fever as a likely diagnosis. Typhoid fever, caused by _Salmonella
enterica serovar typhi_ (also known as _salmonella typhi_), often
presents with constipation in adults preceding the onset of diarrhea
and is marked by high fevers. The untreated mortality seen with
typhoid fever (10 to 20 percent) can be reduced to one percent with
the use of appropriate antibiotics. Of note, ProMED-mail reported on
an outbreak of typhoid fever in the Dhankuta district of Nepal in
1998 (see below) and typhoid fever activity in Dang district in 2005.
Another possibility, although significantly lower on the differential
diagnosis list based on the symptoms presented above, would be
Japanese encephalitis. This is the JE season, although the district
involved is in the Himalayan areas (Lesser Himalayan and Greater
Himalayan, geologically, and therefore not identified as JE zones due
to the geography).

More information from knowledgeable sources would be very much
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
