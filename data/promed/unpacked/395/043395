The cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_, which was thought to be almost eradicated, has been detected at another Mid-Canterbury property. Just last month [May 2022], it was believed the infection had been isolated to only one property -- the Five Star Beef feedlot near Ashburton -- following a 4-year mission having seen more than NZD 220 million (USD 138 million) paid in compensation.

In its weekly update this afternoon [16 Jun 2022], the _Mycoplasma bovis_ Programme said the disease had been detected at a new property in Mid-Canterbury, bringing the total infected properties to 2. The infected property was detected through its Bulk Tank Milk (BTM) surveillance, the update said.

The update did not provide any details about the farm, but it said _M. bovis_ programme was working closely with the farmer to manage and remove the infection. It was looking at cattle movements onto the property to try to identify how the infection arrived onto the farm and tracing animals off the property.

Based on previous years, it was not unexpected to find further infected farms at this time of year, the update said. The disease, which could cause lameness and mastitis in cows, was first found on a farm in South Canterbury in 2017. More than 270 farms have been found to have the disease and more than 176 000 cows have been culled.

When contacted, Ministry for Primary Industries' (MPI) _Mycoplasma bovis_ eradication programme director Simon Andrew said the property was the 1st to become a confirmed property in 2022. Following the initial detection, 2 rounds of herd-level testing of the spring-calving dairy herd were undertaken that both returned positive results. The property was now under a restricted notice to prevent animal movements and MPI would work closely with the farmer through the depopulation, compensation and restocking process.

[_Mycoplasma bovis_ is a pathogen causing respiratory disease, otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear), arthritis, mastitis (infection of the mammary gland and udder tissue), and various other diseases in cattle worldwide. It is increasingly recognized by the veterinary and livestock communities as having an important impact on the health, welfare, and productivity of dairy and beef cattle. _M. bovis_ diseases can be difficult to diagnose and control because of inconsistent disease expression and response to treatments and vaccines, and large gaps in the current understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, which tend to become chronic and do not respond well to antibiotic treatments. Also it sometimes works in conjunction with other pathogen organisms.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ was detected for the 1st time in New Zealand in July 2017. The bacterial disease is harmless to humans and not transmitted through milk or meat but can cause untreatable mastitis, abortion and arthritis in cattle. It is present on both the North and the South islands. - Mod.TG
