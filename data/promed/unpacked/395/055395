A total of 3645 [pregnant] goats will be culled tomorrow [Fri 20 Mar
2010] on a dairy goat farm in Siebengewald. This has been announced by
the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) of the Ministry
of Agriculture.

The farm has been found Q-fever infected. The total number of animals
on the farm is 3900. The kidding [parturition] season has not yet
started on the farm. This Limburg farm is the 77th farm in the
Netherlands where pregnant animals are culled due to Q fever.

[Siebengewald is a village situated on the German border; in fact, its
5 km radius area, wherein the population is officially being advised
(in the Dutch territory, in writing) to take precautionary measures
around infected farms, stretches into German territory. In the
adjacent German area, precautionary measures have already been earlier
applied; see "Bulk tank milk testing in German dairy plants," item 2
in posting 20100227.0656.

The previous infected Dutch farm, No 76, was detected on 26 Feb 2010
in Zegveld, Utrecht province. The total number of commercial dairy
goat and sheep farms in the entire country is between 300 and 400.

The fact that this farm has been identified infected before the
commencement of the parturition period, should be regarded as
fortunate because the agent, _C. burnetii_ is known to be disseminated
principally when kids/lambs are born or aborted. On the other hand,
since no abortions have apparently been reported from the flock, there
may be a possible -- but not decisive -- indication that the infection
rate within the animals in this farm is limited.

Increased number of chronic Q-fever patients
--------------------------------------------
A total of 40 patients with chronic Q fever are currently being
treated in the Jeroen Bosch hospital in Den Bosch. The figure of last
year was 15.

Chronic Q fever occurs in about 1 to 3 percent of the patients. It
starts insidiously with complaints such as feeling oppressed, fever,
transpiring, fatigue and weight loss. A common complication is cardiac
valves inflammation [endocarditis].

As of 17 Mar 2010, 247 infections in humans have been recorded during
2010. Out of these, 52 patients experienced their 1st day of illness
during 2010.

[For a recent description of the human Q fever situation in the
Netherlands, including results of serosurveys in the general
population and in targeted professional groups, such as veterinarians,
carried out before the outbreak and recently, subscribers are referred
to the presentation titled "The story of human Q-fever in the
Netherlands" by Yvonne van Duynhoven (RIVM). This presentation was
delivered during the Q fever conference held in Breda, Netherlands, on
25-26 Feb 2010. The conference was organised by the Central Dutch
Veterinary Institute, the Animal Health Service Deventer and the
Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. The purpose of the
conference was to collect and share the worldwide knowledge about Q
fever in order to find a continuing policy to fight against Q fever.
