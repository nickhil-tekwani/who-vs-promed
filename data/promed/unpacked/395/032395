Occurrence of _Podosphaera xanthii_ Race 2 on _Cucumis melo_ in Brazil.

Powdery mildew is an important disease of melons (_Cucumis melo_ L.)
cultivated in greenhouses in Brazil. Currently, there are 5 races of
_Podosphaera xanthii_ (formerly known as _Sphaerotheca fuliginea_) and 2
races of _Golovinomyces cichoracearum_ (formerly known as _Erysiphe
cichoracearum_) described on melons worldwide, but only race 1 of _P.
xanthii_ has been reported in Brazil (1).
However, typical whitish powdery fungal growth was observed on an
experimental hybrid yellow melon resistant to race 1 of _P. xanthii_ during
the summer of 2000 in a greenhouse in Braganca Paulista, State of Sao Paulo.
Conidia collected from diseased leaves were spread onto 0.5 percent water
agar medium and maintained at 22 deg C for 24 h with 12 h of light and 12 h
of darkness. Most of the germinated conidia displayed fibrosin inclusion
bodies when observed in a solution of 3 percent potassium hydroxide (KOH),
and approximately 1 of 50 also displayed forked germ tubes. These features
allowed us to identify _P. xanthii_ as the causal agent.
Conidia raised on the susceptible yellow melon 'Amarelo CAC' were used to
inoculate cotyledons of the differential melon lines (2) 'Hale's Best Jumbo'
(susceptible to races 1, 2, and 3 of _P. xanthii_), 'PMR-45' (resistant to
race 1 and susceptible to races 2 and 3), and 'PMR-' 6 (resistant to races 1
and 2 and susceptible to race 3). Inoculations were performed on 10 plants
of each differential line and replicated 4 times. The presence or absence of
symptoms was evaluated 18 days after inoculation. 'Hale's Best Jumbo'
and 'PMR-45' were rated as susceptible while 'PMR-6' was rated as resistant,
thus indicating the presence of race 2 of _P. xanthii_ in Brazil.
During field surveys from 2001 to 2003, this race was found on squash
(_Cucurbita moschata_), summer squash (_C. pepo_), and melons in Sao Paulo.

[Cucumber powdery mildew, caused by the fungus _Podosphaera xanthii_ [Px] is
1 of the world's most widespread and damaging cucumber diseases. Px consists
of several races, some of which attack all cucurbits, while others have a
host range restricted to certain types of cucurbits. 997 cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_ L.) accessions from the U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS)
collection were tested for resistance to powdery mildew. Plants were
evaluated and classified for their resistance to Px. 3 susceptibility
grades were used: susceptible (S), intermediate (I) or resistant (R). 94 of
977 accessions (9.6 percent) contained at least 1 I or R-type plant and 17
of the 20 most-resistant accessions originated in Asia. Disease management
depends upon use of resistant cultivars and application of both systemic and
protectant fungicides, alternating among systemic fungicides in at least 2
chemical classes and including a protectant fungicide in at least every
other application. Resistant varieties are being developed and are becoming
an increasingly important component of management programs. There is the
danger, however, that strains may develop which could overcome the genetic
resistance of some cultivars.
