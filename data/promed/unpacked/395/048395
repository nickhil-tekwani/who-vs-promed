Farmers are hampering attempts to check whether BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy) has spread from cows to sheep by failing to report a
similar disease in their flocks, a report by government veterinarians
suggests. They conclude only about 1 in 8 sheep farmers who suspect their
livestock is suffering from scrapie is obeying the law by telling the
authorities, raising concerns over the effectiveness of efforts to control
the disease.
The veterinarians, who surveyed more than 7000 sheep farmers, found many
who did not think any of their animals had experienced scrapie did not know
the clinical signs of the disease, which include rubbing up against posts
because of skin irritation, nervous and aggressive behavior and an unsteady
gait.
The investigation was demanded by scientific advisers on BSE and its fatal
human equivalent, variant CJD (Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease, vCJD), which is
probably caused by eating infected beef. They want more checks on brains of
slaughtered sheep to see whether they have BSE too, and improvements to
scrapie surveillance. BSE has never been proven to exist in sheep outside
of the laboratory, while scrapie has been endemic for more than 250 years
and never linked to human disease.
But some scientists believe scrapie may have caused BSE through recycling
of infected sheep in animal feed. The diseases are hard to distinguish and
if BSE were found, the only method of control would be culling affected
animals and their lambs.
There would be disastrous economic implications. Even with scrapie, the
veterinarians say "many farmers may be reluctant to report cases owing to
the possible loss of markets, both national and international, and the
potential loss of livelihood".
As with BSE and vCJD, there is no test for live animals and the government
is belated in introducing the compulsory tagging of sheep to improve checks
on their provenance. Failure to report scrapie can attract unlimited fines.
Last year there were 593 confirmed cases compared with 328 in 1993, 508 in
1997 and 499 in 1998.
This is a small proportion of the 40 million sheep and lambs, and far fewer
than the 2250 BSE cases in cattle confirmed last year, but the disease is
most likely to be a problem in the 20 million breeding flock where the
animals are older than most sold for slaughter.
Peter Smith, acting chairman of the spongiform encephalopathy advisory
committee (SEAC) on BSE-like diseases, said: "We have always been aware
scrapie was likely to be quite substantially under-reported. "I don't think
this came as a great shock to us. We are looking at ways to eradicate it
from Britain and we would feel a lot more comfortable if it was not around."
The veterinarians, from the government's veterinary laboratory agency and
the institute of animal health in Compton, Berkshire, analyzed responses to
a questionnaire sent to farmers with flocks of more than 30 breeding ewes.
Nearly 15% thought they had experienced scrapie and 2.7% thought they had
had it in the past year.
A comparison with the number of farmers who reported suspect cases to the
Ministry of Agriculture suggested only 13% of those with suspect cases were
doing so. The findings, published in the Veterinary Record, said flocks in
Yorkshire, Humberside and the Shetland Islands appeared to be most at risk.
These are areas involved in anti-scrapie measures, including attempts to
breed resistant stock.
Officials believe the rise in scrapie cases recorded in recent years may be
due to improved reporting. But the ministry said yesterday: "The reporting
rate is unacceptably low." In 1998, it introduced compensation for farmers
whose suspect animals were destroyed, and it was issuing publicity material
to increase awareness of the disease.

[If owners do not know the clinical signs of scrapie and are not calling
veterinarians and are not reporting the disease, what other diseases are
going unreported. Undoubtedly there needs to be some animal handler/owner
education with regard to diseases as well as with regard to what is a
reportable disease.
The issue of Scapie in sheep as it relates to BSE in cattle is somewhat
gray. There is the question of Scrapie and BSE perhaps being the same
disease in different animals, yet the pathological lesions and
manifestation of the diseases are somewhat different. This is important
because of scrapie getting into the food chain of humans.
Further, it is important because apparently there is a buy out plan for
animals with BSE but not with scrapie. Without a compensation package in
place there is little incentive for animal owners to report a disease and
have their flock wiped out. There is also the issue of BSE in Sheep as
demonstrated in the laboratory and if BSE is a real disease in sheep, then
there is another mechanism for the disease to be potentially transmitted to
human beings. - Mod.TG
