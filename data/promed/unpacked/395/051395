HK steps up measures against avian flu threat
---------------------------------------------
With the theme "Raise hygiene awareness, guard against influenza,"
cleaning events will run from Sunday [20 Nov 2005] until early next
year in all 18 districts in Hong Kong.
Activities on Sunday [20 Nov 2005] included cleaning operations,
inspection of back lanes, roving exhibitions, bus parades, health
talks and distribution of publicity materials.
On the same day, the Housing Department held an Estate Cleanliness
Day with Fu Cheong Estate in Sham Shui Po and Tin Yuet Estate in Tin
Shui Wai as the focal estates for the event.
As more and more avian flu cases were reported in the neighboring [mainland],
the Hong Kong government has stepped up a package of measures to keep the
disease outside its territories.
Temperature screening at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau border crossings have
already been reactivated, after China's Ministry of Health Wednesday
[16 Nov 2005] confirmed 2 human cases of H5N1 bird flu.
Noting wild pigeon droppings may help spread harmful germs, avoiding
feeding pigeons is the best way to minimize their flocking. So any
wild bird feeders in common areas at public rental housing estates
and markets will be served a 1500 HK dollars [USD 194] fixed-penalty
notice and 5 penalty points under the Marking Scheme for Tenancy
Enforcement when caught, and no prior warning will be given, Hong
Kong's housing department said.
The government also has updated its website on avian flu with a
Really Simple Syndication application to allow subscribers to receive
automatically the latest news updates on avian flu via their personal
computers, smart phones or personal digital devices.
Besides, the government has widely distributed a number of leaflets
with different themes and in different languages to ensure a proper
understanding of the differences between seasonal flu, avian flu and
flu pandemic, as well as give health tips to guard against the
diseases.
"The government alone could not build a strong defense against
infectious disease, We need each and every individual to contribute
his/her part in making our overall plan effective and sustainable,"
said Carrie Yau, Permanent Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food.
"Although there is no outbreak of bird flu in our local poultry, we
should not let our guard down, particularly at a time when more bird
flu outbreaks are being reported on the mainland and in the region,"
she added.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority launched on 8 Nov 2005 its 1st ever drill on the
Special Administrative Region's preparedness for a possible avian influenza
pandemic. The drill, code-named "Exercise Flamingo," was aimed at testing the
response of the public hospital's disease control and the procedures for the
treatment of the patients.
Chief Executive Donald Tsang said after seeing the drill that Hong
Kong had made enormous headway since the outbreak of SARS, not just
in terms of resource acquisition, but deployment of resources,
communication between various units, and even the equipment and
facilities within the hospitals have all been improved.
According to the Hospital Authority, a 2nd drill code-named "Exercise
Poplar" will be staged on 24 Nov 2005 for testing Hong Kong's
capacity in tracing the source of avian influenza patients.
So far, the government has invested over 3 billion HK dollars [USD
386 million] to enhance the city's preparedness against emerging
infectious diseases, including an avian influenza-induced influenza
pandemic, Hong Kong Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food York Chow
said.
Noting that the presence of live poultry in "wet markets" is a potential
threat for an outbreak of avian influenza, the government is considering
setting up a regional slaughtering hub in Hong Kong, Chow said. Consultants
have recently completed their study for such a slaughtering hub, and the
government hopes the process for the hub could start early next year [2006],
he added.

[Hong Kong's energetic approach in controlling avian influenza is exemplary,
particularly in the public-health related aspects; however, one should keep in
mind that most of the territory's poultry is imported for local slaughter,
with only small local production. - Mod.AS]

China Issues Stringent Rules Meant to Control Animal Epidemic
-------------------------------------------------------------
Provincial governments should report major animal epidemic cases to
the State Council, China's highest governing body, within 4 hours
after having learned of them, according to a new State Council
regulation.
The regulation, which was released on Sunday [20 Nov 2005], also
requires county or city governments to report such cases to
provincial authorities within a matter of just 2 hours. It was issued
when China reported an increasing number of avian flu outbreaks; on
Sunday [20 Nov 2005], the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed another 2
outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 subtype avian flu in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region and central Hubei Province [see [3] below].
The regulation is aimed at "controlling and stamping out major animal
epidemic cases as soon as possible, ensuring the safety of breeding
industry, protecting people's health and lives and safeguarding the
normal social order."
The animal epidemic includes avian flu and other animal diseases with
a high incidence or fatality, it noted.
The regulation said that local government officials who neglect the
performance of their duties will be removed from their official posts
and even be prosecuted. Those who take the chance to embezzle
emergency funds or drive up goods prices and cheat consumers will
also be penalized.
It lists detailed preparations and emergency measures to cope with
animal epidemic cases.
Army and police across China should support the efforts made by local
governments to control animal epidemics, the State Council regulation
said.

2 new bird flu outbreaks reported in Inner Mongolia, Hubei
----------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture Sunday [20 Nov 2005] confirmed
bird flu outbreaks in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region and central China's Hubei Province.
It noted in a statement that a total of 176 chickens, ducks and geese
died Tuesday [15 Nov 2005] in the banner [county] of Morin Dawa in
Inner Mongolia before they were confirmed by a state avian flu lab as
being H5N1 subtype highly pathogenic bird flu cases.
In a separate incident, the same kind of bird flu killed 3500 geese
on Wednesday [16 Nov 2005] at a development zone in Shishou City of
Hubei Province.
The Ministry of Agriculture has sent a team of experts to help
contain the disease, and local veterinary departments have culled the
poultry near the affected area, the statement said.

[4] Thailand, fighting cocks

Cockfighting can resume on New Year's Day [2006]
------------------------------------------------
Cockfighting is expected to resume from New Year's Day 2006 if owners
register their roosters and have their health checked before placing
them in competitive matches, Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister
Khun Ying Sudarat Keyuraphan said here on Friday [18 Nov 2005].
Cockfighting is a popular sport in many areas of rural Thailand, and
the competitors -- the birds themselves -- are much prized, honored,
and loved by their owners and others admirers.
Khun Ying Sudarat said officials would meet with breeders to agree on
government guidelines so that the fighting cocks could compete again
in fighting arenas beginning from the upcoming New Year.
However, she warned that Livestock Development Department statistics
show that only some 40 000 out of a million fighting cocks have been
registered.
Explaining the government's vaccination policy regarding reemerging
bird flu, Khun Ying Sudarat said research conducted both in and
outside Thailand had shown that the vaccine could not prevent the
fatal virus from spreading.
She said vaccinated chickens contracting the virus would not develop
symptoms and could transmit the virus without the owners' awareness.
For this reason, the government has decided to impose a ban on
vaccination and apply a 3-year plan of action, endorsed by
international agencies, to control the disease instead.
Khun Ying Sudarat stressed that her ministry plans to control the
outbreak of avian influenza within 3 years.
The minister also reported that there had been no new areas at risk
of avian flu in the kingdom over the past weeks, and that Tevaraj
sub-district of Chaiyo District in the central Angthong Province had
already been withdrawn from an official list of areas at risk of
avian flu.

[The figure cited -- a million fighting cocks! -- illuminates the significant
role of this sector in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Thailand.
Similar situations may prevail in other southeast Asian countries, and
probably elsewhere (comes to mind the past involvement of smuggled fighting
cocks in relation to Velogenic Newcastle disease in California) -- see
