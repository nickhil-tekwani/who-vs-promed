The Ministry of Health of Tucumán confirmed in the last few hours a new case of bilateral pneumonia, of which there are already 11 cases detected in recent weeks, including 3 deaths.

Meanwhile, the tests carried out by the Malbrán Institute indicate that the samples taken from patients affected by the pneumonia outbreak in Tucumán tested positive for _Legionella_.

Another of the patients died of bilateral pneumonia of unknown origin in Tucumán: he is the 3rd victim.

According to La Gaceta, the last case was detected in a 64-year-old man with comorbidities. "He remains hospitalized in serious condition, with mechanical respiratory assistance, in the private sector," indicates the Public Health report.

The arrival of the Minister of Health Carla Vizzotti was expected for this Saturday [3 Sep 2022].

The Gazette anticipated that the analyses of the samples detected a condition caused by the bacterium _Legionella pneumophila_, which fundamentally presents 2 totally different clinical forms: one is pulmonary infection or "legionnaires' disease", which is characterized by pneumonia with high fever; the other, the form known as "Pontiac fever", which manifests as an acute febrile syndrome.

It [_Legionella_] can be spread by air, by inhaling aerosols contaminated with the bacterium. Infection can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or ice, especially in vulnerable hospitalized patients, or by exposure of the newborn during water births. There is no direct person-to-person transmission, as pointed out on the World Health Organization website.

Argentina's Minister of Health, Carla Vizzotti confirmed that the outbreak of pneumonia in Tucumán was due to _Legionella_. From Government House, Vizzotti, together with her counterpart from the province, Dr. Luis Medina Ruiz, confirmed that it is an outbreak of [legionellosis], possibly [due to] _Legionella pneumophila_.

Carla Vizzotti and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) representative in Argentina, Eva Jané Llopis, this Saturday [3 Sep 2022] confirmed that the samples taken from patients affected by bilateral pneumonia tested positive for _Legionella_ bacteria.

Vizzotti explained at a press conference that, for now, they have preliminary information and there is still progress to be made in the final diagnosis using serological pairs. However, "in 4 samples (3 respiratory and a puncture biopsy of 1 of the deceased) a bacterium called _Legionella_ has been identified by PCR and its surname is being typified and will be known today," she said, adding: "The suspicion is that it is an outbreak of _Legionella pneumophila_."

The Minister of Health commented that it is a bacterium that is transmitted by inhalation through water or air conditioning. It has an antibiotic treatment and a significant impact on people at risk, older than 50 years, smokers, diabetics and people who are immunocompromised or have respiratory diseases.

"All the actions are being generated and the recommendation that we agree with the provincial team is that, having the diagnosis means it is safe to transfer these patients to another hospital to follow their evolution, to be able to generate an exhaustive study of the health center and thus carry out the actions in the building both in the water and in the air conditioning system so that it is completely safe to return to work in such a health center," said Vizzotti.

For his part, the Minister of Public Health, Dr. Luis Medina Ruiz, highlighted the joint work with the national government and contextualized stating that since last Saturday [27 Aug 2022], when they became aware of 2 patients with bilateral pneumonia who did not have a known etiology from the 30 tests done in Tucumán and who came from the same place of work, "it caught our attention and we began to work, activele searching for patients who meet the same conditions and we found 6".

"So it was that on Monday [29 Aug 2022] we confirmed that it was neither COVID-19 nor flu nor hantavirus, and on Tuesday [30 Aug 2022] we made the decision to make this new epidemic situation known and we generated a contingency plan together with the federal government to evaluate the etiology," he explained.

Along these lines, he continued: "We developed a patient control strategy, we decided on the sanitary isolation of the private sanatorium and we sent samples to the National Institute of Microbiology Dr. Malbrán and the National Institute of Human Viral Diseases Dr. Julio I. Maiztegui.

Finally, the representative of the Pan American Health Organization, Dr. Eva Jane Llopis, praised the speed and efficiency with which these cases were worked on both in the province and in the federal government. "This demonstrates an optimal way to identify the problem and respond, in addition to notifying the world in a timely manner, through the mechanism of international health regulations. There you can see the commitment of Tucumán and Argentina to global public health and I think this is very important", she emphasized.

The outbreak of bilateral pneumonia that claimed 4 deaths and triggered 11 infections in a private sanatorium in the capital of Tucumán was caused by the _Legionella_ bacterium. This was stated today [3 Sep 2022] by the president of the Senate Health Commission and former Minister of Health of Tucumán, Pablo Yedlin, who indicated that the samples of the patients sent to the Malbrán Institute in Buenos Aires yielded positive results for _Legionella_.

For her part, the Argentina Minister of Health, Carla Vizzotti, confirmed moments ago that the samples taken from infected patients at the Luz Médica sanatorium in the capital of Tucumán and analyzed at the Malbrán Institute yielded positive results for _Legionella_ . And she clarified that there are still some samples left to confirm that it is of the [_Legionella pneumophila_] type. "We have preliminary information, pending more information from final diagnosis using serology. Of the 4 samples, 3 are respiratory and one is a biopsy: a bacterium called _Legionella_ is being identified by PCR and the last name of that bacterium is being typified. The suspicion is that it is _L. pneumophila_. From a health point of view, it is confirmed that it is an outbreak of _Legionella pneumophila_, possibly", explained Vizzotti, who arrived in Tucumán to make the announcement.

In radio statements, the senator from Tucuman said that "it was important to remove the fear" with the confirmation of the pathology that caused the chain of pneumonia infections and asked "to stop calling it an unknown disease." And he added: "The fear of this disease is over, because if you call it unknown, you don't know how to treat it or how it spreads, and this is known."

The Ministry of Public Health of Tucumán confirmed this afternoon [3 Sep 2022] the death of another patient from bilateral pneumonia, which raised the number of fatalities to 4 due to the outbreak of infections registered in a private sanatorium due to _Legionella_.

In a statement, the health portfolio reported that the new death corresponds to "a male patient, 48 years old, with comorbidities, who was hospitalized in serious condition in the public sector."

In addition, the Ministry of Health reported this morning [3 Sep 2022] a new case in the outbreak of pneumonia that keeps the people of Tucuman in suspense, for which there are already 11 infected, all with an epidemiological link in the Luz Médica sanatorium, located in the downtown area of the provincial capital.

The new case, according to the official report, "is linked to the conglomerate of cases" that was triggered in that medical center earlier this week and "corresponds to a 64-year-old man, who has comorbidities and remains hospitalized in serious condition, with mechanical respiratory assistance, in the private sector".

Legionellosis is a condition caused by a bacterium, _Legionella pneumophila_, which proliferates in contaminated water sources and poorly maintained artificial water systems, especially in cooling towers or steam condensers of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, and in building water pipes.

According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), legionellosis is not spread from person to person, but the infection can occur by air, through inhalation of aerosols contaminated with the bacteria. Infections can also occur by aspiration of contaminated water or by exposure of newborns during water births. The bacterium can attack the body in 2 very different ways: one, the infection can cause severe pneumonia with lung disease and is known as "Legionnaires' disease"; the other can lead to an acute febrile syndrome, called "Pontiac fever", which is like a common flu and is not serious.

The development of _Legionella_ can range from a mild cough to severe pneumonia that causes death, caused by progressive shortness of breath in the lungs, shock and multiple organ failure. According to the WHO , Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days (although periods of up to 16 days have been reported in some outbreaks). In the case of Tucuman, the 1st patients affected by the outbreak began to have symptoms between [20 and 23 Aug 2022]. Initial symptoms are fever, loss of appetite, headache, cough, malaise, and lethargy. Some patients also report muscle pain, diarrhea, and confusion.

A report from that body indicates that the severity of the disease ranges from a mild cough to pneumonia with a rapid fatal outcome. Death occurs from progressive pneumonia accompanied by respiratory failure and/or shock and multi-organ failure.

The WHO warns that, if left untreated, Legionnaires' disease usually worsens in the first week. Currently, there is no vaccine available against legionellosis. According to the agency, the non-pneumonic form of the infection is self-limited and does not require medical intervention, not even antibiotics. In contrast, Legionnaires' disease always requires antibiotic treatment once the diagnosis has been established.

An article published on the official site of the national government on legionellosis warns that temporary closure or reduced operation in normal water use can favor the stagnation of water in a plumbing system which can increase the risk of growth and spread of the bacteria that cause that disease and other agents. In addition, he points out that _Legionella_ bacteria grow best between temperatures of 20°C to 45°C [68-113F].

Anyone can get _Legionella_ infection; however, pneumonia and severe pneumonia are associated with vulnerable groups such as the immunosuppressed, older adults, individuals with chronic lung problems, and smokers.

Showers, faucets, whirlpool tubs, water fountains, sprinkler systems, cooling towers in commercial or industrial buildings can pose a high risk for transmission of _Legionella_ if maintenance treatments have not been performed during periods of inactivity via cleaning and disinfection.

According to this report from the national government, in our country, there is a history of legionellosis outbreaks, such as the one that occurred in the Buenos Aires city of Carmen de Areco in 2011, and during 2019 and 2020 nosocomial cases have been studied in 2 institutions, isolating _Legionella pneumophila_ in the shower of one of the institutions. According to a report prepared by the WHO, the threat that legionellosis poses to public health can be controlled by the authorities responsible for the safety of buildings or water supply systems through the application of plans to guarantee the safety of the water.

In addition, it points out that the prevention of Legionnaires' disease depends on the application of control measures that minimize the proliferation of _Legionella_ and the diffusion of aerosols.

Suspecting that the outbreak is related to this bacterium, the Tucumán health authorities ordered 7 days of preventive isolation for the sanatorium where the chain of infections occurred. In addition, samples of the water deposited in the storage tanks of the sanatorium were taken and inspections were carried out in the air conditioning duct to confirm or rule out the presence of the bacterium. The medical executive secretary of the Provincial Health System, Miguel Ferre Contreras, had assured yesterday [2 Sep 2022] at a press conference that the Luz Médica sanatorium had the go-ahead to function from a health point of view. "The clinic has certified inspections, which includes the cleaning of the water tanks, issued in July [2022] and that have an expiration date in October [2022]. They are in order with the municipal health regulations that they have to comply with. The inspections are constant and periodic", he remarked.

Ferre Contreras reported that staff from the Environmental Health Directorate were also present at the sanatorium to obtain water samples and perform microbiological tests.

[The pneumonia outbreak at a hospital in Tucumán, Argentina now involves a total of 12 affected individuals, including 4 deaths (case fatality rate 33%).

The news reports above say that the Malbrán Institute indicate that the samples taken from 4 patients affected by the pneumonia outbreak in Tucumán tested positive for _Legionella_. _Legionella_ was identified by PCR in respiratory specimens from 3 patients and a puncture [lung?] biopsy in one of the deceased. The results for the other 8 patients presumably will be forthcoming. If the specimens to be tested are urine, the tests can only identify urinary antigen of one _Legionella_ species (_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, the most common cause of Legionnaires' disease) and there will be no organisms available for subsequent molecular typing. Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help establish that the outbreak likely has a common source, if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can then help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of a building's plumbing system pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as following inhalation of a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources within the hospital that contain _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gonçalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ in hospital outbreaks, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ are not detectable by culture of the hospital water (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/wmp/control-toolkit/routine-testing.html). However, the fact that most of the affected people in this outbreak were medical staff suggests _Legionella_-contaminated aerosols were generated by equipment to which both staff and patients were exposed. Aerosol generating equipment in hospitals could be heater-cooler machines used in some surgeries, hospital lobby fountains, or cooling towers, to mention just a few.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
