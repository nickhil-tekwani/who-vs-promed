[On 31 Oct 2000, The Monitor (Kampala)
<http://allafrica.com/stories/200010310051.html> (Byline Carolyne
Nakazibwe) reported that the chairman of the National Task Force, Dr. Sam
Okware, told the press at the Ministry of Health headquarters on 30 Oct
2000, that other cases had been reported in Mbarara and Kitagata hospitals
in Western Uganda. These, however, were investigated and found to be false.
"Two people died on Friday from high fever, but investigations show they
had never come into contact with any victim and they didn't die of Ebola,"
Okware said. He also said cases reported in Rakai, Nebbi, Kakira and
Kajjansi have been confirmed as false. It is not entirely clear from the
WHO report whether the death in Mbara is reassessment of a previous case or
a new case. - Mod.CP
