The Japanese pearl oyster industry is suffering from a severe drop in
quality & quantity of cultured pearls being grown. This mysterious disease
is killing Japanese oysters and causing a worldwide pearl shortage. Some 70%
of the pearl oysters in Japan have been lost.
The problem first became apparent five years ago, when oyster farmers
noticed that the meat of affected oysters was changing from white to orange,
and their organs were shrinking. Three years ago this was ascribed to
abnormally warm temperatures caused by unusual ocean currents.
Investigators then discovered that formalin was being used to treat blowfish
parasites and had been allowed to drain into some of Japan's major pearl
oyster-producing bays.
Scientists suspected the warm temperatures, chemicals or other
environmental factors were killing oysters whose biodefense systems already
were weakened by something else. Formalin was thought to be a triggering
mechanism but not a direct major cause.
In the past two years, Kochi University researchers announced they found a
viral cause, but their findings haven't been verified, says Toshihiko
Matsusato, who heads the team studying the disease for Japan's National
Research Institute of Aquaculture. The research team isn't even sure that
what's killing oysters now is the same thing that was killing them in 1993,
he notes.
Some have speculated that pollution, over farming or breeding problems are to
blame. However scientists Kochi University don't think formalin caused the
disease.
There are hopeful signs. Pearl farmers haven't seen as many affected oysters
this year as last. The generally smaller and less expensive akoyas cultured
in China are so far unaffected by the disease.
