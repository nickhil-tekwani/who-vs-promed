The BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control is warning that travellers at Vancouver's airport on [Sun 9 Jun 2019] may have been exposed to measles.

The centre says a passenger with the disease had a layover at Vancouver International Airport on [9 Jun 2019].

The passenger went through Canada Customs and Immigration so the centre says people in the main terminal may also be vulnerable.

[2] USA (New York): legislation
Date: Sat 15 Jun 2019

https://www.thedailystar.com/news/local_news/n-y-bans-religious-waivers-for-vaccination/article_43da0e77-153a-5086-acf3-de4ef2a528ee.html


Non-medical exemptions for vaccination requirements for children were ended in New York [Thu 13 Jun 2019] after fierce statehouse debate pitting religious freedom concerns against public health priorities.

The legislation was approved in the final days of the 2019 legislative session after an outbreak of measles this year [2019] in the New York City region and its suburbs.

"While I understand and respect freedom of religion, our 1st job is to protect the public health, and by signing this measure into law we will help prevent further transmissions and stop this outbreak right in its tracks," Gov Andrew Cuomo said.

The New York legislation came amid a national debate over the effectiveness of vaccines. The legislation ended an option allowing parents to cite religious beliefs as a way to prevent their children from getting inoculated.

The state requires children to receive immunizations for not only measles, but also poliomyelitis, mumps, diphtheria, rubella, hepatitis B, pertussis, tetanus, and varicella before they are allowed to attend all levels of school or day care.

[3] USA (New York): summer camp
Date: Mon 17 Jun 2019
Source: Syracuse.com, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.syracuse.com/state/2019/06/ny-summer-camp-is-latest-hit-with-measles-outbreak.html


The battle to contain the worst US measles outbreak in 27 years has a new front: summer camp.

Vaccinations have been made mandatory this summer [2019] for campers and staff in several counties north of New York City that annually fill up with kids from the Orthodox Jewish communities that have been hit hardest by measles.

Ulster county took the extra step of mandating the measles vaccine or proof of immunity at all day camps and overnight camps, becoming the latest county in the area to issue immunization requirements. Rockland county announced a similar order this month [June 2019], following mandates from Sullivan and Orange counties.

"We have to make sure our t's are crossed and our i's are dotted in making sure all these vaccination records are in and have been fine-combed through to make sure everything is in compliance," said Rabbi Hanoch Hecht, of Ulster county's Camp Emunah, which hosts many girls from a Chabad community in Brooklyn's Crown Heights.

"In the past where we accepted religious exemptions for certain things," said Hecht, who is getting his own blood checked for immunity, "now we cannot."

The state of New York requires summer camps to keep immunization records for all campers, but doesn't bar children from attending if they haven't gotten a measles shot.

Children are required to get the measles vaccine to attend schools in New York, however, and Gov Andrew Cuomo signed legislation [Thu 13 Jun 2019] eliminating an exemption for kids whose parents object to vaccinations on religious grounds.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, as of 1 Jun 2019, more than 1000 measles cases had been reported in the US since the start of the year, up from fewer than 100 cases a year a decade ago. The bulk of those cases have been diagnosed in ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn and suburban Rockland county.

Hecht and others stressed that vaccinations are widely accepted by most members of the Orthodox community, echoing rabbis in Brooklyn and Rockland county who say it is a relatively small group of parents influenced by anti-vaccination propaganda -- not religious teachings -- who have resisted inoculations.

The Orthodox Union said it has previously required up-to-date vaccinations, including the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine, for its 37 summer programs.

"Most of the leaders and rabbis have taken the approach that vaccination is required," Hecht said.

Health officials in New York City have taken a tough approach, making measles vaccinations mandatory for everyone living in the Brooklyn neighborhood that is the epicenter of the outbreak, fining people for failing to get inoculated and closing 12 schools for failing to exclude staff and students who couldn't document immunity. The city announced the 2 most recent closures [Thu 13 Jun 2019].

The disease that has affected the Orang Asli of Kg Kuala Koh in Gua Musang [Kelantan] has been identified as measles by the Health Ministry.

Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said up until [15 Jun 2019], the ministry has confirmed that 37 people have tested positive for measles based on laboratory tests.

"The main factor that has caused the spread of measles among the Orang Asli in Kg Kuala Koh is the low coverage of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) immunisation among them.

"Only 61.5% have received their 1st dose of MMR vaccine and 30% have received their 2nd dose," said Dr Dzulkefly at a press conference [in Putrajaya].

"Our medical teams find it difficult to reach out and provide health services in a more wholesome way to the Bateq tribe due to their nomadic lifestyle," said Dr Dzulkefly.

Dr Dzulkefly said so far, the ministry has tended to a total of 112 cases related to the disease that has ravaged Kg Kuala Koh since early June [2019].

There have been 3 deaths that have been officially reported to the ministry, although unofficially there are about 15 casualties.

The most recent case saw the death of a 3-year-old toddler on Sunday evening [16 Jun 2019] due to measles and pneumonia with multi-organ failure.

Another 7 Aucklanders contracted measles over the weekend [15-16 Jun 2019], bringing the total number of cases in the region to 115.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) announced the new cases on Monday afternoon [17 Jun 2019].

The Auckland region is experiencing an outbreak of the highly contagious and potentially life-threatening viral illness.

The majority of cases have been in people from West Auckland.

Last week [week of 10 Jun 2019], ARPHS and the Ministry of Health announced the vaccination age would be brought forward in the region, to 12 months.

In a post on the Immune Advisory Centre website [http://www.immune.org.nz/hot-topic/measles-overseas-and-new-zealand], ARPHS also said it would be changing its response in the next fortnight, "as contact tracing is not stopping the spread of the virus."

The most recent figures from ESR [Institute of Environmental Science and Research ], the science agency which tracks measles notifications, show there were 195 cases across the country as of [7 Jun 2019].

In a follow-up on the measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UN health officials report an additional 7500 suspect cases in the past 2 weeks, bringing the total cases since the beginning of the year to 106 870.

The death toll due to the measles outbreak has reached 1815 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.7%).

Two thirds of the cases notified since the beginning of 2019 come from the provinces of Tshopo (27%), Kasai (16%), Haut-Lomami (11%), and Lualaba (9%). Children between 12 and 59 months account for 77% of cases and 90% of measles-related deaths in the country.

In addition, the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, which are battling the 2nd largest Ebola outbreak ever, are also in the midst of a measles outbreak, reporting thousands of cases.

A vaccination campaign in April [2019] reached some 2 million children.

The WHO says response efforts to contain this outbreak face many logistical difficulties in the face of the vast territory and the structural weaknesses of the health system, all within the context of a prolonged humanitarian crisis. Furthermore, vaccination coverage for measles vaccine remains inadequate in several health zones, which favors the simultaneous resurgence of measles across the country.

[The total number of measles cases in the DRC since the beginning of 2019 (106 870), dwarfs the number of Ebola cases (2168), in spite of the number of vaccinations against measles (2 million in April 2019 alone). Both diseases are vaccine preventable, yet control of the outbreaks remains elusive. - Mod.LK
