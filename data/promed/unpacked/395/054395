Anthrax cases reported in Fata livestock
--------------------------------------------------
Several cases of anthrax in livestock have been reported from the
Orakzai and Kurram agencies, prompting an urgent need to control the
disease in the affected and adjoining areas, official sources told
Dawn here on Friday.
The anthrax outbreak, in livestock, has been reported in at least 2
villages -- Guldara and Danaikhula -- in the Orakzai agency of Fata.
prompting the need for vaccination on an urgent basis to control the
spread of the bacteria, said official sources. Besides, said the
sources, the Veterinary Research Institute (VRI), Peshawar, had also
received a demand from Kurram agency for vaccine to control anthrax.
The veterinary doctors in Kurram agency, said the sources, had asked
for the vaccine after several anthrax infected animals were brought to
them.
Anthrax was a common disease in Pakistan, as far as the animals were
concerned, said the sources. However, the mortality rate in animals
appears to be far more higher than human beings. According to a
veterinary researcher, the anthrax infected animals hardly survive for
48 hours. [But Peshawar has no history of [human anthrax
infection, said a senior doctor of the Lady Reading Hospital,
Peshawar.
However, a senior veterinary officer of NWFP said that hundreds of
animals had ben killed due to a high rate of anthrax in Kurram agency,
North Waziristan agency and the Frontier Region of Kohat district.
The director VRI, Peshawar, Dr Nasir Hussain Shah, confirmed the
report of anthrax hit cattle in parts of NWFP and Fata, besides
confirming the demand for [cattle vaccine from Kurram agency. There
is no shortage of vaccine at VRI, he said.
