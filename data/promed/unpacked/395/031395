[1] Illinois (Lake County): bat, human death

Be aware if you've got bats in your home. That's the message from the Illinois Department of Health as it announced an 80-year-old man died of rabies after waking up to find a bat on his neck. [Other sources report the bat that but him tested positive for rabies. - Mod.TG] It is the 1st human case of rabies in the state since 1954.

The man refused rabies treatment at the time of the incident in mid-August [2021], health officials said in a press release. A month later, he started experiencing rabies symptoms such as neck pain, headache, difficulty controlling his arms, finger numbness, and difficulty speaking.

Rabies infections in humans are extremely rare in the United States since the disease is preventable and treatable. Typically, 1 to 3 cases are reported each year, and there were no cases reported in 2019, according to the most recent data available from the CDC.

But rabies exposure is far more common; 60 000 Americans receive the post-exposure treatment every year. Without prompt treatment, though, the virus infects the nervous system and is typically fatal [without post-exposure treatment].

Lake County Health Department Executive Director Mark Pfister said the case of the man who died this week emphasizes the need for more public health awareness of the risks of rabies.

"Rabies infections in people are rare in the United States; however, once symptoms begin, rabies is almost always fatal, making it vital an exposed person receive appropriate treatment to prevent the onset of rabies as soon as possible," Pfister said.

Illinois health officials say bats are the most common animal found with rabies in the state. The man who died had a colony of bats living in his home.

Two Marcy [Oneida County] residents have received medical care to treat rabies after being exposed to a rabid cat.

The cat was sent to the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center, which reported the positive rabies test results on [8 Sep 2021].

According to the CDC, rabies treatment postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) includes a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and a rabies vaccine.

Two dogs were also exposed to the rabid cat.

Health Department officials recommend vaccinating all cats, dogs, and ferrets older than 3 months. The Oneida County Health Department offers rabies vaccination clinics throughout the year for the convenience and safety of county residents.

Signs of rabies include animals acting strangely, getting too close, and drooling or foaming at the mouth. If you see an animal exhibiting these signs do not approach it; call your local animal control officer for help.

A stray cat that attacked a person in Frederick has tested positive for rabies. The Frederick County Health Department says it happened on Hansonville Road last Thursday [16 Sep 2021]. It's a small gray intact male cat with black stripes, probably a young adult.

Anyone who came into contact with it this month [September 2021], should contact their doctor and the health department.

Rabies is almost always deadly if it's not caught and treated early.

[4] Pennsylvania (Berks County): cat, human exposure
Date: Fri 24 Sep 2021

https://berksweekly.com/news/cat-in-birdsboro-tests-positive-for-rabies-virus/


A Birdsboro resident has received medical care to treat rabies after being exposed to a rabid cat, Animal Rescue League (ARL) of Berks County officials announced Friday night [24 Sep 2021].

The ARL was notified earlier in the day of a cat impounded in Birdsboro by ARL's Department of Animal Protection tested positive for rabies.

The cat, a medium-sized short hair calico, was captured near the intersection of E Main Street and N Water Street after a call for assistance from the Birdsboro Police Department.

"We immediately responded to the patrol officer's call and secured the cat," said Sergeant Hayden Carroll from the ARL's Department of Animal Protection. "At the moment, we know this cat bit a resident, who was already notified and received proper treatment. If anyone else was bitten or scratched by an animal in this area they should seek medical attention immediately."

According to the CDC, rabies is a neurological virus infecting the central nervous system of mammals, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death in 99.9% of human cases if left untreated. Although 90% of reported cases of rabies in animals occur in wildlife -- mainly skunks, raccoons, bats, coyotes, and foxes -- the virus can be transmitted to dogs, cats, and cattle who have not received vaccination.

Common signs of rabies in animals include general sickness, problems swallowing, excessive drool or saliva, an animal who bites at everything, an animal who appears tamer than you would expect, an animal who is having trouble moving or may be paralyzed, or a bat on the ground. (Source: CDC)

"The most important action to prevent rabies in dogs and cats is to make sure that their rabies vaccine is up-to-date and keeping them away from unknown animals, especially wildlife," said Dr Jason Banning, Medical Director of the ARL.

"If an owner suspects their pet was bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, they should call animal control or their local police department to capture the animal and seek immediate veterinary care."

For humans who have been exposed to rabies, the incubation period could last for weeks to months and may vary based on how far the exposure location is from the brain. Common symptoms of rabies in humans include discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of the bite, progressing within days to acute symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, and agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, hydrophobia (fear of water), and insomnia.

"Residents should be alert for other animals in the area with signs of rabies and should not allow their pets outside unsupervised," said Sergeant Carroll.

If you suspect that an animal is infected with rabies, call immediately the animal control provider of your municipality or your local police department and do not approach the animal by any means.

[5] Florida (Martin County): raccoon, dog
Date: Mon 27 Sept 2021

A raccoon found 20 Sep 2021 at Indian RiverSide Park in Jensen Beach has tested positive for rabies, according to the Florida Department of Health in Martin County.

Results from testing the trapped raccoon came back Friday [24 Sep 2021] showing the animal was positive for rabies, spokeswoman Renay Rouse said Sunday.

There was no human exposure to the raccoon, Rouse noted, and a dog having had contact with it had been previously vaccinated for the viral disease and is expected to be treated with a booster shot.

Rabies, often carried by wild animals, is a disease of the nervous system and is fatal to warm-blooded animals and humans. The only treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immune globulin and rabies immunization. Appropriate treatment started soon after exposure will protect the person from the disease.

The majority of rabies cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention each year occur in wild animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes, although any mammal can get rabies.

The 1st symptoms of rabies may be nonspecific and include lethargy, fever, vomiting, and anorexia. Signs progress within days to weakness, paralysis, seizures, difficulty breathing, excessive salivation, and abnormal behavior, according to the CDC.

Residents can avoid rabies by:
- Avoiding contact with wild animals.
- Keeping outside garbage cans sealed.
- Calling your local animal control agency to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood. Martin County Animal Control is at 772-463-3211.
- Keeping rabies vaccinations up to date for all pets.
- Keeping your pets under direct supervision so they do not come in contact with wild animals.
- If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately and contact Martin County Animal Control at 772-463-3211.

The news of this man in Illinois dying for lack of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is very sobering. One wonders if he was aware of the bats in his home before one bit him or if this was a bat colony in the attack and there was an access point into the house and he was unaware of it.

While officials cannot force someone to obtain treatment, it serves as a warning to all of us to have our homes and attics checked. Bats can make it through very small spaces and into our homes. Tiny holes in window screens can also sever as a place of ingress to the dwelling. Especially our elderly may be unaware of some noises or cracks in a roof or ceiling or window screen. We need to be checking on our older family, friends, and neighbors, keeping an eye for bats.

Rabies is a deadly disease when untreated in human beings. It is also deadly for our unvaccinated pets. Please vaccinate your pets and follow your veterinarian's recommendations on the interval between vaccinations. Please protect yourself and your pets. Protecting your pet with vaccinations can build a barrier between you and the disease.

Wild animals can come at us, or our pets, at very unexpected moments in places we may think are safe. The only way to build the barrier of protection is to vaccinate your pets, and report any bites you receive.

If you are bitten, wash the wound with soap and water and seek medical attention. The post-exposure prophylaxis treatment must be given within a short time from the bite. It is very effective and can save your life.

"In the United States, PEP consists of a regimen of one dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of the rabies vaccine over a 14-day period. Rabies immune globulin and the 1st dose of rabies vaccine should be given by your healthcare provider as soon as possible after exposure. Current vaccines are relatively painless and are given in your arm like the flu or tetanus vaccines; rabies vaccines are not given in the stomach."
(https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/index.html)

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities."
