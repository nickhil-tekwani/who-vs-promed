Health authorities have warned against eating a brand of pre-packaged
nachos, after a Melbourne man was struck down with the potentially
deadly food poisoning, botulism.
The 26-year-old from Melbourne's western suburbs has been in
intensive care for more than 2 weeks after being diagnosed with the
rare but dangerous condition, which usually leaves survivors with
long-lasting symptoms.
Victoria's chief health officer Dr. Robert Hall today, 17 Feb 2007,
warned people to avoid eating the Nachos To Go brand, made in South
Australia and distributed widely. The Nachos to Go products marked
"best before April 19" should be discarded or returned to the place
of purchase for a refund.
Dr. Hall said evidence so far suggested the cheese component of the
product may have been responsible for the condition, which could lead
to death. The leftovers of the packet were found in a rubbish bin and
used to confirm the presence of botulism.
"It's quite a serious, severe disease," Dr. Hall said. "The disease
is spread through contaminated food; it's caused by a toxin produced
in the food, should this contamination occur."
Dr. Hall said the victim became ill on 19 Jan 2007, but his condition
was not confirmed until 31 Jan 2007 because it was difficult to
diagnose. Dr. Hall defended the time taken to inform the public,
saying all the information needed came together yesterday afternoon,
16 Feb 2007.
"This is a complicated disease to diagnose, and to get even
confirmation of the diagnosis in the patient took over a week because
of the kind of tests that needed to be done," he said. "We also
needed to investigate the production process in the factory, and that
information came together yesterday [16 Feb 2007], and we acted
through the evening yesterday to withdraw this product from the market."
The department was not aware of any other cases related to the same
batch. Dr. Hall said overseas recorded outbreaks showed a percentage
of people could die from the condition.
South Australian food producer Mexican Express has agreed to
voluntarily recall a batch of their product. Managing director Ian
Young told ABC radio he believed his products were safe. "We test
every batch; it's part of a clearance program," he said.
Mr. Young said questions remained about the source of the botulism,
saying the packet linked to the disease had been in a public waste
bin for 5 days before it was tested.
