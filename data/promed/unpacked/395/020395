1st cases of bubonic plague in 20 years have been reported in Turkmenistan
-----------------------------------------------
An epidemic of plague began in May 2004. There have already been more
than 20 deaths in Turkmenistan. News about the plague was delivered
by a German humanitarian aid company that works at the Uzbek-Turkmen
border in the north Karakums in the Tashhovuz region. According to a
specialist, this is the most serious outbreak in the last 20-30 years.
According to radio "German wave" (Nemezkaya volna), during a recent
week, 7 people died, in the Turkmen city Mari, from plague. There
have been fatal cases in Ashgabad (capital of Turkmenistan) as well.
Unfortunately, there is no reliable information from Turkmenistan,
from the Russia epidemiological surveillance center, or from WHO.
According to the chief sanitary physician of Russia, Gennadiy
Onishenko, everything associated with acute diseases in Turkmenistan
is kept secret.
Turkmenistan officials have made some efforts to prevent the spread
of the epidemic. Quarantine was introduced in several of the
hospitals of Ashgabad, and public pools are closed.
According to Gennadiy Onishenko, carriers of plague in Central Asia
are camels. If a camel dies, people usually eat the meat. However,
people will not be infected with plague if they cook the meat
thoroughly [and avoid contamination with the uncooked meat - Mod. LL].
Uzbekistan has taken serious measures to prevent the spread of this
dangerous infection. Transportation of domestic animals across the
border, including camels, is prohibited, and people living near the
borders have been assessed. So far, according to official data, there
have been no human cases of plague registered in Uzbekistan.
There are no quarantine measures established in Russia. According to
Onishenko, all elements of the transportation system of Central Asia,
including airports and trains, have been notified.
The last case of plague in Turkmenistan was reported 25 years ago.

According to the moderator (LL), Kazakhstan is the only former Soviet
republic reporting plague. This is, in part, because the Soviet Union
actively suppressed all reports of plague outbreaks. In fact, in
1949-50, there was a sizeable outbreak of pneumonic plague, which may
have killed upwards of 100 people, according to Dr. Lev A. Melnikov,
who was an eyewitness. Melnikov attributed the outbreak to the
dangerous plague reservoir _Rhombomys optimus_ (the great gerbil.). I
reported this in my recent book, Plague: The Mysterious Past and
Terrifying Future of the World's Most Dangerous Disease, pp. 27-29.
[The Free Press, New York, USA, 2004]
Plague, and its reservoirs, are no respecters of borders, and the
conditions prevailing in Kazhakstan (the presence of ancient
reservoirs of gerbils and marmots) are also found in Turkmenistan.
Atabekov is certainly correct that the territory of Turkmenistan is
an endemic focus of plague, and there is no reason to discount
reports of plague in Turkmenistan out of hand.
