The Pueblo City-County Health Department has temporarily closed All Seasons Catering, citing a variety of violations found after 35 people were sickened by food the company served at a luncheon on 24 Apr 2012. The health department said the illness was caused by _Clostridium perfringens_ toxin found in a stool sample submitted by one of the sickened individuals.

Based on interviews with everyone who became ill, the department found a statistical association in several foods that could have been the culprit: a beef-and-gravy dish, butter, tomatoes, and lettuce the caterer served during last week's Pueblo Community Health Center's annual meeting and luncheon. 80 people attended the event. All were interviewed about what they ate that day.

Although the bacterium is present in small amounts in most healthy individuals' intestinal tracts, _C. perfringens_ can produce a toxin that causes diarrhea and intestinal cramping when consumed in larger amounts. The resulting illness may lead to serious complications among the elderly and very young.

_C. perfringens_ is one of the most common causes of foodborne illness in the USA, and is commonly found on raw meat and poultry and in food that is prepared too far in advance of consumption and kept at improper temperatures, according to a news release issued by the health department.

[Unlike staphylococcal foodborne illness where the preformed toxin is ingested, in _C. perfringens_ disease the enterotoxin is formed _in situ_ in the gastrointestinal tract. The following discussion is obtained from the FDA Bad Bug Book http://www.fda.gov/food/foodsafety/foodborneillness/foodborneillnessfoodbornepathogensnaturaltoxins/badbugbook/ucm070483.htm:

1. Name of the organism: _Clostridium perfringens_ is an anaerobic, Gram positive, spore-forming rod. It is widely distributed in the environment and frequently occurs in the intestines of humans and many domestic and feral animals. Spores of the organism persist in soil, sediments, and areas subject to human or animal fecal pollution.

2. Nature of acute disease: perfringens food poisoning is the term used to describe the common foodborne illness caused by _C. perfringens_. A more serious but rare illness is also caused by ingesting food contaminated with type C strains. The latter illness is known as enteritis necroticans or pigbel disease.

3. Nature of disease: the common form of perfringens poisoning is characterized by intense abdominal cramps and diarrhea which begin 8-22 hours after consumption of foods containing large numbers of those _C. perfringens_ bacteria capable of producing the food poisoning toxin. The illness is usually over within 24 hours but less severe symptoms may persist in some individuals for 1 or 2 weeks. A few deaths have been reported as a result of dehydration and other complications.

Necrotic enteritis (pigbel) caused by _C. perfringens_ is often fatal. This disease also begins as a result of ingesting large numbers of the causative bacteria in contaminated foods. Deaths from necrotic enteritis (pigbel syndrome) are caused by infection and necrosis of the intestines and from resulting septicemia. This disease is very rare in the USA.

Infective dose: the symptoms are caused by ingestion of large numbers (greater than 100 0000 000) vegetative cells. Toxin production in the digestive tract (or in test tubes) is associated with sporulation. This disease is a food infection; only one episode has ever implied the possibility of intoxication (that is, disease from preformed toxin).

4. Diagnosis of human illness: perfringens poisoning is diagnosed by its symptoms and the typical delayed onset of illness. Diagnosis is confirmed by detecting the toxin in the feces of patients. Bacteriological confirmation can also be done by finding exceptionally large numbers of the causative bacteria in implicated foods or in the feces of patients.

5. Associated foods: in most instances, the actual cause of poisoning by _C. perfringens_ is temperature abuse of prepared foods. Small numbers of the organisms are often present after cooking and multiply to food poisoning levels during cool down and storage of prepared foods. Meats, meat products, and gravy are the foods most frequently implicated.

6. Relative frequency of disease: perfringens poisoning is one of the most commonly reported foodborne illnesses in the USA. There were 1162 cases in 1981, in 28 separate outbreaks. At least 10-20 outbreaks have been reported annually in the USA for the past 2 decades. Typically, dozens or even hundreds of person are affected. It is probable that many outbreaks go unreported because the implicated foods or patient feces are not tested routinely for _C. perfringens_ or its toxin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10 000 actual cases occur annually in the USA.

7. Course of disease and complications: the disease generally lasts 24 hours. In the elderly or infirm, symptoms may last 1-2 weeks. Complications and/or death only very rarely occur.

8. Target populations: institutional feeding (such as school cafeterias, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons, etc.) where large quantities of food are prepared several hours before serving is the most common circumstance in which perfringens poisoning occurs. The young and elderly are the most frequent victims of perfringens poisoning. Except in the case of pigbel syndrome, complications are few in persons under 30 years of age. Elderly persons are more likely to experience prolonged or severe symptoms.

9. Food analysis: standard bacteriological culturing procedures are used to detect the organism in implicated foods and in feces of patients. Serological assays are used for detecting enterotoxin in the feces of patients and for testing the ability of strains to produce toxin. The procedures take 1-3 days. - Mod.LL]
