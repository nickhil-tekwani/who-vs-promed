Viruses infecting cassava in Kenya

A survey of cassava viruses was conducted in major cassava-growing
regions of Kenya. A total of 185 leaf samples, and 62 stem cuttings,
from plants with viral disease symptoms were collected and analyzed
by biological, electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay, and polymerase chain reaction. All samples from western Kenya
had cassava begomoviruses (African cassava mosaic virus [ACMV], East
African cassava mosaic virus [EACMV], and Uganda variant [EACMV-UG]
in single or in mixed infection. However, all samples from the Coast
region were infected with only EACMV, a begomovirus. In addition, 15
samples had mixed infections of EACMV and 3 other hitherto
unidentified filamentous viruses. The viruses were 200, 500, and 750
nm long, respectively. In addition to rod-shaped and some flexuous
viruses, as seen in a crude sap preparation, pinwheels also were
observed, indicating a possible association of some of the viruses in
the _Potyviridae_ family. The symptoms induced by these viruses in
_Nicotiana benthamiana_ were very severe and often caused about 50
percent death of the test plants. Back inoculation onto cassava
resulted in 100 percent infections. This finding provides evidence
that, other than begomoviruses that cause serious diseases of cassava
in Africa, filamentous viruses also are present, and, despite their
limited distribution, they could reach local significance, and, most
probably, be as serious as begomoviruses. The implications of these
findings are discussed, and, recommendations for future work
suggested.

[Cassava is the staple food crop that supports the poorest, and most
food-insecure, households worldwide. According to the authors, world
production in 2002 was 185 million metric tones, of which 100 million
were produced in Africa. In western Kenya, the incidence of cassava
mosaic disease (CMD) can be 100 percent, and at the coast it ranges
from 25-50 percent. In Western and Nyanza provinces, all 3
begomoviruses (ACMV, EACMV, and a Kenyan isolate of EACMV-UG[KE])
were found, many of them in mixed infection with ACMV and EACMV. The
detection of potyvirus-like particles, and possible carla- and
potex-viruses, is of considerable interest, especially in terms of
possible added or synergistic effects in infected cassava crops. An
array of antisera failed to decorate any of the filamentous virus
particles in immunoelectron microscopy, possibly because of the lack
of specific antisera. Despite earlier reports, the geographic
distribution of EACMV and ACMV were shown to overlap. The presence of
EACMV in the coastal areas of Kenya appears to be a minor problem,
but ACMV and EACMV-UG [KE] are distinct threats to the survival of
the crop in the western part of the country. - Mod.DH]
