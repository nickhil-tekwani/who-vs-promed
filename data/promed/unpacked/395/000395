ProMED-mail recently carried a news report of a polio case due to
wild poliovirus in China. WHO wishes to provide the following
information so that the details of the case are available to all
interested persons.
Please note that the initial sequencing data on the isolate indicate
that it is related to viruses originating in India and is significantly
dissimilar when compared to earlier isolates from China. This,
combined with the epidemiological history is consistent with a
recent importation into China. The Chinese Ministry of Health
invited a team from WHO, UNICEF and JICA to investigate the
case in late December. The Ministry is conducting very aggressive
outbreak response immunization campaigns and is searching
thoroughly for additional cases.
Beyond the exception of the cousin of the index case who was
infected but not paralyzed, there is no evidence of widespread
circulation of the virus. WHO will report on additional
epidemiological and virological information as it becomes available.

Since this is apparently an importation with limited circulation, the
question of when China and the Western Pacific Region can be
certified free of polio will be decided during reviews of the complete
data by the National Certification Committee and the Regional
Certification Commission later this year.
We believe that this situation has highlighted the need for all
countries to remain extremely vigilant for importation of wild
poliovirus from polio-endemic countries. High quality AFP [acute
flaccid paralysis surveillance must be maintained and surveillance
staff alerted to the ever-present possibility of importation.
The detection of this case in a sparsely populated rural area of
China is a credit to the AFP surveillance system in that country, but
no country can afford to relax and all should continue efforts to
ensure high quality surveillance until polio is eradicated globally.

The case was first reported to the County EPS in Geizi Township,
Xunhua County, Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai Province, on 13
October 1999, and reported to the Provincial EPS on the following
day. The case was born on 13 June 1998, had onset of paralysis
on 12 October, after a day of fever on 11 October. The parents
took the boy to a local private clinic in a neighbouring township
when a sudden onset of flaccid paralysis made him unable to stand
or walk (both of which he had been capable of before). Two stool
samples were taken, the first on 14 October and the second on 25
October. They were analyzed in the provincial laboratory. Both
samples yielded poliovirus isolates, which were later typed and
differentiated as P1 wild viruses at the national laboratory in
Beijing. At the time that the second sample was taken five contacts
were sampled, one of which, a four year old cousin of the infected
child, was also positive for wild poliovirus. The case child was
unregistered and had received zero doses of polio vaccine.
The case belongs to the Sala minority group, a Muslim group of
Turkic speaking people whose ancestors migrated to Qinghai from
the area of Turkmenistan about seven hundred years ago. There
are around 80 000 Sala in China, 60 000 in Qinghai Province
(nearly all of which live in Xunhua Sala Autonomous County) and
nearly all of the remainder in neighbouring Gansu Province. Adult
male Sala travel widely as traders and workers, within Qinghai
province and outside to other provinces, including Gansu, Sichuan,
Xinjiang, and particularly Tibet, even as far as the border area with
Nepal.
Neither the case nor the direct family reported a history of travel
outside the county in the two months prior to onset. No visit to the
family by a traveler from outside the county was reported to occur
during the same period. However, the family, including the case,
attended a major festival of Sala people in the county capital during
the period 25 to 28 September 1999. Up to 30 000 Sala are
reported to have attended this gathering.
Despite intensive investigation in the area of the case, including
searches of health facilities, no evidence of wide-scale circulation
of wild poliovirus has yet been found. Surveillance quality including
laboratory proficiency in Qinghai Province and in neighbouring
provinces is in general good. Indications are therefore that the
virus has been recently imported.
The Ministry of Health of China is actively collaborating with the
global laboratory network including CDC Atlanta, NIID Tokyo and
the national laboratories in India. Initial sequencing information on
the wild poliovirus show a close similarity to viruses recently
circulating in India. The virus is significantly different from those
that have been circulating in China up to the last case in 1994.
Further genomic sequencing work is proceeding.
A combined MOH/WHO/UNICEF/JICA mission visited Qinghai
Province from 20-25 December 1999 to review the response to
the case. Initial case response immunization has been carried out,
achieving high coverage of the target group. Extensive additional
activities are planned, including large scale immunization across
several provinces, intensified surveillance, retrospective review of
hospital records at all levels in several provinces,and active search
for cases of acute flaccid paralysis.
