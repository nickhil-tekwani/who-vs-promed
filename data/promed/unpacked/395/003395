Equine Infectious Anemia found in 3 SC horses
---------------------------------------------
Three horses have been confirmed positive for infectious anemia (EIA), the 1st such infection in a South Carolina animal since a donkey in Aiken County acquired the disease in 2014, State Veterinarian Michael Neault said. The 1st case was in a quarter horse in Berkeley County and the 2 contact quarter horse cases were in Barnwell County.

The blood-borne illness does not infect humans but is potentially fatal to horses and other equine species. The virus that causes EIA is often transmitted by bloodsucking insects like biting flies but also can be introduced by infected needles or other medical, dental or tattoo equipment.

The infected Berkeley County horse has been euthanized, said Neault, who directs Clemson University's Livestock Poultry Health (LPH) regulatory agency. LPH is discussing options with the Barnwell County owners.

"This is a very serious disease," Neault said. "There is no treatment for EIA, so if an infected animal does not die from the disease, it will become a lifelong EIA carrier and serve as a reservoir for the disease, putting other equines at risk. For this reason, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized."

LPH encourages equine owners to have an annual Coggins test -- a blood test that screens for EIA antibodies -- performed on their horses even if the animals don't leave the farm. That is especially important if they are housed at a boarding facility, said Sean Eastman, LPH Field Services director.

State law requires a negative Coggins test any time horses cross state lines and when owners take their horses to in-state gatherings of animals belonging to more than 2 horse owners -- such as trail rides, horse shows or competitions. Owners should bring Coggins test documents with them when traveling with horses.

EIA is a reportable animal disease in all 50 states, meaning that positive cases must be reported by the testing laboratory to local state or federal animal health officials within 2 days of discovery. LPH maintains an animal reportable diseases list online at <www.clemson.edu/public/lph/ahp/reportable-diseases/>.

"All these diseases pose a significant health threat and are communicable to other animals," Neault said. "Thankfully we have effective equine vaccinations available against deadly diseases like Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis, West Nile Virus and rabies. So it's a good idea for horse owners to plan a regular Coggins test just like they do their animals' annual vaccinations."

Clinical signs of EIA vary and it is often hard to differentiate EIA signs from those of other diseases. The incubation period for the disease can range from a week to 60 days or longer.

An acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. More severely affected horses may have weakness, depression and additional signs that may include jaundice, rapid breathing or heart rate, swelling of limbs, thrombocytopenia, red or purple spots on mucous membranes, bleeding from the nose or blood-stained feces. Anemia can occur, although it is more likely to be severe in chronically infected animals.

Tips from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to prevent infection and spread of EIA include:
• Separate symptomatic horses from others and contact your veterinarian immediately.
• Keep the area in and around your barn clean and dry to reduce the insect population.
• Apply fly sprays and insect repellants as needed.
• Only use sterile needles and licensed blood products; never reuse needles or syringes.
• Use a sterile needle each time you puncture a multi-dose medication bottle.
• Do not share surgical or dental equipment that are contaminated with blood or debris between horses.
• Allow only licensed veterinarians using blood from confirmed EIA-negative donor horses to perform blood transfusions.
• Disinfect bits and lip chains between horses.
• Clean and cover open wounds.
• Test every horse at least annually.
• Require proof of a recent negative EIA test for new horses entering the premises or when purchasing a new horse.

Equine infectious anemia confirmed at horse facility in Clark County
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nevada Department of Agriculture (NDA) has confirmed a detection of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in a horse at a facility in Clark County during routine testing. A quarantine has been issued for the facility and all horses on the premises will undergo testing to prevent potential spread of the disease. Horses that attended an event in Washoe County within the month of June 2022 are also encouraged to test.

"We are working closely with local veterinarians and the facility to address the situation and prevent the potential spread of disease," said NDA State Veterinarian Dr. Amy Mitchell.

Equine species, including horses, donkeys and mules, are required to have a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection and submit proof of a negative EIA test within 12 months prior to entry as part of Nevada's entry requirements. Negative EIA tests are required for movement between all states and the U.S. Department of Agriculture lists EIA requirements for importation into the U.S.

EIA is transmitted through blood contact and cannot be spread through coughs, sneezes or casual contact. This is a reportable disease, meaning when veterinarians diagnose it, they are required to notify the NDA, per NRS 571.160. A list of reportable diseases can be found at https://agri.nv.gov/. EIA is a disease transmitted in equine species causing fever, weakness, swelling, irregular heartbeat and low red blood cell count. It cannot be transmitted to humans and is not a public health risk, therefore details about the facility cannot be released, per Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 571.160.

"While there is no treatment for EIA, it can only be spread by contaminated blood of an infected horse," said Dr. Mitchell. "Infected horses may not show symptoms but remain carriers for life, making routine testing key to prevention of spread of this disease."

Horse owners are urged to practice good horse health safety measures to reduce chances of an infectious disease being transferred, and get as much background information as possible before purchasing horses. Basic practices include:
- Never share equipment between horses. Single-use medical equipment such as needles, syringes, and IV lines should never be re-used, and should never be shared between different horses. Dental tools and other instruments should be fully sterilized between horses.
- Practice good fly control by keeping stalls dry, removing standing water, managing manure, and using fly deterrents and repellants.
- Horses should have a routine testing schedule for EIA and should be tested prior to attending events.
- Test horses at the time of purchase examination. Work with a veterinarian on a quarantine and/or retesting protocol prior to introducing a new horse to current horses. Before purchasing, get as much background information on the horse including any domestic or international travel or importation.
- Any horses entering the U.S. from other countries require testing and quarantine prior to entry.

More SC horses found to have contracted Equine Infectious Anemia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Two more South Carolina horses have tested positive for Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA), bringing the number of confirmed cases in the state to 5 in the past month, State Veterinarian Michael Neault has announced.

All 5 cases stem from a bush track horse racing training facility, Neault said. All 5 horses have been euthanized.

The virus causing EIA is often transmitted by bloodsucking insects like biting flies but also can be introduced by infected needles or other medical, dental or tattoo equipment.

"We know how the disease spreads, so we also know how to minimize or even stop the spread," said Neault, who directs Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (LPH), a state regulatory agency responsible for protecting animal health by controlling disease.

"Horse owners sometimes re-use needles when vaccinating multiple animals because it's cheaper and easier. That's an open invitation to the spread of disease," he said. "Only use sterile needles and syringes; never reuse them. Proper insect control also will help mitigate the spread."

Prior to the 5 cases identified this summer [2022], which infected horses from Barnwell and Berkeley counties, the most recent case of EIA in South Carolina was in a single donkey infected in Aiken County in 2014.

The blood-borne illness does not infect humans but is potentially fatal to horses and other equine species.

"There is no treatment for EIA, so if an infected animal does not die from the disease it will become a lifelong EIA carrier and serve as a reservoir for the disease, putting other equines at risk," Neault said. "For this reason, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined from other animals or they must be euthanized."

LPH encourages equine owners to have an annual Coggins test -- a blood test that screens for EIA antibodies -- performed on their horses even if the animals don't leave their own farm. This is especially important if they are housed at a boarding facility, said Sean Eastman, LPH Field Services director.

["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the Equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often inapparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health. EIA is a reportable animal disease in all states.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer.

"Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include
- jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes);
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate;
- swelling of limbs;
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes; and
- blood-stained feces.

"Horses surviving the acute phase of the disease become chronic, in-apparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress: illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical."

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood-feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen.

"There is no treatment for EIA. Because infected animals become lifelong carriers, they must be permanently isolated and quarantined or euthanized.

"Reducing exposure to biting flies through management practices may reduce the spread of infection. To prevent iatrogenic spread, never reuse needles, syringes, or IV sets; use only new, clean needles with injectable medicines and use only licensed and approved blood products. Blood transfusions should be performed only by licensed veterinarians using donor horses tested negative for EIA and other blood-borne infections like equine piroplasmosis.

"Surveillance and testing are the best methods of prevention. Since EIA control efforts began over 40 years ago, the reactor rate has fallen from 4% to 0.004% in 2017 among tested animals. USDA recommends testing every equid annually.

"There is no vaccine approved for use in the US." (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/equine/eia)

It is unfortunate that there is no vaccine in the US. Equine owners have pleaded for a vaccine for decades now and wonder why their cries are ignored. Equine groups have often lamented the lack of technology or funding, but there seem to be no answers from those who research, fund, or develop vaccines.

However, there may now be a form of treatment, or certainly some hope on the horizon. Readers are requested to see the following ProMED post: Equine infectious anemia: potential treatment 20211209.8700153. - Mod.TG
