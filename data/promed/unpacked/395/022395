--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the spring of 2013, a severe disease outbreak with virus-like symptoms (chlorosis and plant stunting) was observed in a tomato field located in the Dominican Republic. The transplants were produced in house. The disease has reached an epidemic level with many diseased plants pulled and disposed of accordingly.

Three samples collected in May 2013 were screened by ELISA against common tomato viruses, bacteria and _Phytophthora_ spp. No positive result was observed, despite the presence of symptoms typical of a virus-like disease. Further analysis by pospiviroid group-specific RT-PCR resulted in positive reactions in all 3 samples. To determine which species of pospiviroid was present in these tomato samples, 8-10 full-genomic clones from each isolate were sequenced. Sequences were nearly identical and the predominant sequence shared 97 percent sequence identity to PSTVd isolates identified in wild _Solanum_, cape gooseberry [_Physalis_] or _Capsicum_ [from other countries worldwide], and 96 percent identity to the tomato-infecting PSTVd isolate from the United States.

The relatively lower sequence identity to the tomato-infecting PSTVd isolate from the US suggests that PSTVd in the Dominican Republic was likely introduced from a different source, although the exact source that resulted in the current disease outbreak remains unknown. It may be the result of an inadvertent introduction of contaminated tomato seed lots or simply from local wild plants. Further investigation is necessary to determine the likely source and route of introduction of PSTVd identified in the current epidemic.

The detection of this viroid disease outbreak in the Dominican Republic represents further geographic expansion of the viroid disease in tomatoes beyond North America.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd.

Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf chlorosis and discolouration, leaf distortion, shortening of internodes and stunting of plants; flower and fruit initiation stops. In potato, shoots are spindly and may show distortions and proliferations; plants are stunted; tubers are small, elongated, cylindrical, spindle, or dumb-bell-shaped, with prominent eyes evenly distributed over the tuber; sprouting is slower than in healthy tubers. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd available in either host. However, mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Tomato seed has recently also been shown to constitute a considerable quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insects, plant sap during handling procedures) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd and other pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material.

Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops. Commercial seed imports carry a high risk of an incursion and the importance of reliable certification and screening schemes before release to growers has been recognised.

It is uncertain if the report above is the 1st time PSTVd was recorded in the Dominican Republic, or if this was only the 1st time it has been identified in commercial tomato cultivations.
