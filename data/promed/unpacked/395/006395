A deadly skin disease has arrived from Syria: it has reached Macedonia and Montenegro, heading to Serbia. Cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL], which has spread in Syria and the Middle East is approaching the Balkans, and there are already several cases in our area [the Balkans].

The main reservoirs of the disease are dogs, and the infection is transmitted to humans by sand flies. The symptoms are open wounds, bleeding from the nose and, according to the epidemiologist, diagnosed in Macedonia and Montenegro.

"If it hasn't come yet, it will come. This fact is absolutely not [discussed]. It spreads mainly from dogs and small rodents. Thus, we are talking about the disease, which are in the veterinarian's area of interests. Taking in account that this disease is confirmed in Macedonia and Montenegro. If we still have people who are infected in these countries then we will have leishmaniasis, " says the Professor. Dr. Teodorovic.

Leishmania, may carried by sand flies, and the main route of transmission from dogs to people. Infection is not transmitted from person to person. It can only theoretically be transmitted through blood (transfusion).

[In Macedonia, between 1996 and 2009, 85 Leishmaniasis cases were diagnosed, with 50 percent coming from the central part of the country. In a survey held in 2005, 13 percent of dogs were found to be infected. The species is L. infantum (http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/THE_FORMER_YUGOSLAV_REPUBLIC_OF_MACEDONIA.pdf).

In Montenegro, from 1992 to 2013, 66 cases of leishmaniasis were identified of which only one was cutaneous the rest was visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) (Medenica S, Jovanovic S, Dozic I, Milicic B, Lakicevic N, Rakocevic B. Epidemiological Surveillance of Leishmaniasis in Montenegro, 1992-2013. Srp Arh Celok Lek. 2015;143:707-11. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26946766).

In Serbia, a few cases of VL are seen and most have a travel history to the coastal areas of Montenegro (Dakic ZD, Pelemis MR, Stevanovic GD, et al. Epidemiology and diagnostics of visceral leishmaniasis in Serbia. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2009 Dec;15(12):1173-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2009.02768.x. https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(14)64863-1/pdf).

From the text it is not clear why it is hinted in the news article that the Leishmaniasis cases come from Syria. Only Macedonia and Montenegro is mentioned, but the news is published in Serbian media. Clearly they are speaking of Balkan nationals and one possibility is that the persons infected participated in relief work, but it is also known that mercenaries from these countries participate in irregular military activity, and ProMED has previously reported cutaneous leishmaniasis in all participants in the Syrian civil war (see below). - Mod.EP
