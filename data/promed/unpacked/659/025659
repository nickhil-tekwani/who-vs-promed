Canadian officials posted an expanded recall, including additional distribution information, indicating recalled roe may have been distributed nationwide. Imperial Caviar & Seafood has expanded its [3 Jan 2017] warning to include retail locations in New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec and possibly the entire nation because of concern with regard to the distribution of recalled roe that carries a risk of botulism poisoning.

Initially, Imperial Caviar & Seafood recalled VIP Caviar Club brand recalling a limited amount of trout roe that had been distributed in Quebec in November 2017. Soon after, the company expanded the recall in December 2017 to include additional trout roe in Ontario.

The [3 Jan 2018] recall included certain lots of Whitefish Roe and Salmon Roe listed below, that had been distributed across Canada in 50-gram containers:

Brand Name / Common Name / Size / Product codes / UPC
VIP Caviar Club / Salmon Roe / 50 g / 27017-02 BB: 27 Sep 2018 / 1 86866 90024 8
VIP Caviar Club / Salmon Roe / 50 g / 19417-01 BB: 13 Jul 2018 / 1 86866 90024 8
Imperial Caviar & Seafood / Whitefish Roe / 50 g / 17917-02 BB: 28 Jun 2018 / 1 86866 90027 9

The above items remain under recall with only the update of additional distribution information, according to yesterday's [10 Jan 2018] recall by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).

To date [11 Jan 2018], no illnesses have been confirmed in relation to the recalled roe.

"Check to see if you have recalled products in your home. Recalled products should be thrown out or returned to the store where they were purchased," according to the recall notice on the CFIA website. "Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or smell spoiled but can still make you sick. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of illness, people may die," according to the notice

In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can occur as soon as 6 hours or as long as 10 days after exposure. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled fish eggs and developed symptoms of botulism poisoning should immediately seek medical attention and inform their doctors about the possible exposure.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

The following recent publication highlights classical and non-classical manifestations of human botulism in the USA:

Abstract
--------
"Background: Botulism is classically described as a bilateral, symmetric, descending flaccid paralysis in an afebrile and alert patient without sensory findings. We describe the reported spectrum of clinical findings among persons older than 12 months of age in the USA during 2002-2015.

"Methods: The CDC collects clinical findings reported by physicians treating suspected cases of botulism nationwide. We analyzed symptoms and signs, and neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results. A case was defined as illness compatible with botulism with laboratory confirmation or epidemiologic link to a confirmed case, and presence or absence of at least 1 sign or symptom recorded. Physicians' differential diagnoses were evaluated.

"Results: Clinical information was evaluated for 332 botulism cases; data quality and completeness were variable. Most had no fever (99 percent), descending paralysis (93 percent), no mental status change (91 percent), at least 1 ocular weakness finding (84 percent), and neuroimaging without acute changes (82 percent). Some had paresthesias (17 percent), elevated CSF protein level (13 percent), and other features sometimes considered indicative of alternative diagnoses. A total of 5 of 71 (7 percent) cases with sufficient information were reported to have atypical findings (eg, at least 1 cranial nerve finding that was unilateral or ascending paralysis). Illnesses on the physician differential included Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (99 cases) and myasthenia gravis (76 cases) and, rarely, gastrointestinal-related illness (5 cases), multiple sclerosis (3 cases), sepsis (3 cases), and Lyme disease (2 cases).

"Conclusions: Our analysis illustrates that classic symptoms and signs were common among patients with botulism but that features considered atypical were reported by some physicians. Diagnosis can be challenging, as illustrated by the broad range of illnesses on physician differentials."
