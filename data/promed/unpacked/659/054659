Antibodies to squalene in Gulf War Syndrome
-------------------------------------------
Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) is a multisystemic illness afflicting many Gulf
War-era veterans. The molecular pathological basis for GWS has not been
established. We sought to determine whether the presence of antibodies to
squalene correlates with the presence of signs and symptoms of GWS.
Participants in this blinded cohort study were individuals immunized for
service in Desert Shield/Desert Storm during 1990-91. The included 144 Gulf
War-era veterans or military employees (58 in the blinded study), 48 blood
donors, 40 systemic lupus erythematosus patients, 34 silicone breast
implant recipients, and 30 chronic fatigue syndrome patients.
Serum antibodies to squalene were measured. In our small cohort, the
substantial majority (95%) of overtly ill deployed GWS patients had
antibodies to squalene. All (100%) GWS patients immunized for service in
Desert Shield/Desert Storm who did not deploy, but had the same signs and
symptoms as those who did deploy, had antibodies to squalene. In contrast,
none (0%) of the deployed Persian Gulf veterans not showing signs and
symptoms of GWS have antibodies to squalene. Neither patients with
idiopathic autoimmune disease nor healthy controls had detectable serum
antibodies to squalene. The majority of symptomatic GWS
patients had serum antibodies to squalene.

An article by Pamela Asa, Yan Cao, and Robert Garry, "Antibodies to
Squalene in Gulf War Syndrome," appears in Experimental & Molecular
Pathology, 2000;68(Feb):55-64. The authors claim to create an assay that
detects antibodies to squalene, but their test was not validated with
proper positive controls (that assuredly contain such antibodies) nor proper
negative controls (that assuredly do not). Thus, the assay by Asa and
colleagues remains unproven. Critically, the investigators jumped directly
to evaluate patients without first validating the test. Given
thesefundamental problems, one cannot claim to detect antibodies against
squalene in sick people and not in healthy people. In other work, a DoD
team is
studying the feasibility of a validated test for antibodies to squalene.
This study should provide adequate scientific evidence to resolve whether
squalene antibodies exist and can be detected in human serum. Only if this
kind of preliminary evidence indicates it is possible to create and measure
anti-squalene antibodies can one contemplate further research.

[Before jumping in, members are strongly recommended to read this paper
first as it is on a tendentious subject. There are clearly no valid
positive controls (they merely quote results of two individuals vaccinated
once and thrice with a squalene-containing adjuvant in an NIH trial); nor
are there negative trials using (1) human serum without the presumed
antibodies, (2) the avidin-conjugated horse radish peroxidase is ommitted,
and (3) with a specificity control for nonbinding of IgG, i.e. for normal
IgG molecules sticking nonspecifically to squalene. The test results were
scored at +++, ++, +, +/-, and -, that is without titres, raising the
possibility that at high concentrations most normal sera might give a
positive result; and a total absence of antibodies in a "normal" population
must regarded with some
suspicion. If squalene or derivatives are associated with Gulf War
Syndrome, one may expect titres to parallel severity of symptoms. The paper
gives no evidence of this. MHJ]
