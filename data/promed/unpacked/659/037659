[Avian infectious laryngotracheitis has never been reported to the
OIE from the other Central American countries. Mexico has reported
the disease in some areas since 1996. The United States and Canada
both regularly report the disease to OIE. Amazingly, ProMED-mail has
only reported this disease once before; see references.
The following description of avian infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT)
is taken from the British Columbia (Canada) Emergency Preparedness
Information Exchange Website at
<http://epix.hazard.net/topics/animal/i_l_t.htm>:
Infectious larynotracheitis (ILT) is a herpesvirus infection that can
affect chickens, pheasants, and peafowl. The disease has been
reported from Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, and North
America, and is probably worldwide. Transmission is from bird to
bird, and as with other herpesviruses, the infection can become
dormant and the infected birds carriers. Outbreaks can range from
peracute to mild or asymptomatic and are characterized by varying
degrees of coughing, gasping, nasal discharge, and possibly cyanosis.
The birds are depressed, and egg production may drop. Vaccination is
generally effective, although carrier birds can develop amongst
vaccinates. Eradication is generally the best approach in designated
areas, and effective biosecurity in commercial poultry establishments
is essential. The presence of small flocks of "show" birds near
commercial poultry establishments may provide foci of infection. - Mod.PC]
