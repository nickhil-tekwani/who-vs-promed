Is this the same as "disinfection"? I notice that the above spelling is
used throughout the article. If it is a new term, would you please define
it for those of us who aren't familiar with it?

[Just as 'disinFection' means to remove infection from a wound, instrument
or place, 'disinSection' is a recognized term in public health meaning to
remove insects from a place. DisinFection does not necessarily remove
insects, any more than disinSection removes infection that is not carried
by the insects, so the term 'disinFection' is not adequate to describe
insect removal. - Mod.JW
