Renewed transport ban of live poultry
--------------------------------------
The transport ban of live poultry throughout the entire country has been
renewed due to further spread of the disease. Initial rapid tests have
confirmed the presence of the animal disease in Beneden-Leeuwen
(Gelderland), which means that the virus has managed to cross more than 20
km and 2 rivers.
Minister Veerman (Agriculture) assumes that the virus was transported
across the Rhine and Waal rivers on a visitor's clothing. This demonstrates
the concern that the seriousness of the epidemic is not yet understood
everywhere. "I would have wished to paste the warning on everybody's
forehead", he said. Almost 6 million chickens have been already destroyed.
To prevent new outbreaks, a total ban on the transport of live poultry was
implemented yesterday [26 Mar 2003] afternoon. During previous weeks, the
minister had lifted the previous transport restrictions.
Only day-old chicks and chicken for slaughter may still be transported. The
minister wants to restrict visits to infected areas by veterinarians, feed
suppliers, and other professionals.
Today the minister is to discuss the course of the fowl plague crisis with
the parliament. The minister has rejected the requests of PvdA, VVD and LPF
[political parties] to create fowl plague-free buffer zones in
North-Brabant in order to limit the spread of the virus. [see comment below].

Avian influenza in the Netherlands: Some restrictions lifted
-------------------------------------------------
The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health voted in favour
of a European Commission proposal to lift some of the restrictions put in
place after reports of outbreaks of avian influenza in the Netherlands.
Under the strict conditions, day-old chicks can now be exported and the
measures in the surveillance zone have been slightly modified.
Outbreaks of avian influenza in the province of Gelderland have been
confirmed since 28 Feb 2002. To date, the number of infected holdings is 96
and another 43 are seriously suspected to be contaminated. In total, 254
holdings, with approximately 5 million birds, have been depopulated since
the start of the epidemic. The outbreaks are thus concentrated in the
"Gelderse Vallei" in the province of Gelderland.
Since the start of the epidemic, protective measures have been put in
place. No live poultry or hatching eggs may be exported from the
Netherlands to other Member States or third countries, nor may they be
transported within the Netherlands. However, as of 4 Mar 2003, movements of
day-old chicks and poultry for immediate slaughter within the Netherlands
are authorized, and since 21 Mar 2003 spent laying hens, pullets, and
hatching eggs may be transported within the Netherlands in areas outside
the surveillance zone.
At the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal
Health, Member States agreed to a Commission proposal to further ease some
of the restrictions. As of 28 Mar 2003, day-old chicks hatched outside the
surveillance zone and at least 25 km from any suspected or infected holding
can be exported to other Member States or third countries. Live poultry and
hatching eggs from holdings in the surveillance zone can be transported to
a slaughterhouse or a hatchery within the same zone. Furthermore, to avoid
further spread of the disease outside the Gelderse Vallei area, a buffer
zone will be created at the north and south borders of this area. To this
end, the Netherlands will preventively depopulate about 30 poultry holdings
situated in those 2 zones.
The measures, which are in force until 10 Apr 2003, will be reviewed at the
next meeting of the Committee, scheduled for 8 and 9 Apr 2003. The
Commission, in close cooperation with the Dutch authorities, will continue
to follow the disease situation in the Netherlands.

[One may wonder whether the potential of the current virus strain to infect
humans may have played a role in its current spread -- namely by infected
people and not necessarily passively transmitted on clothing.
So far, the Dutch authorities have been successful in their endeavors to
prevent the fowl plague (highly pathogenic avian influenza, HPAI) virus
from traveling to other parts of the Netherlands. They have been less
successful in the efforts to contain it within the initially infected area.
Its current detection outside the Gelder Valley is indeed a cause for great
concern, since the adjacent North-Brabant province is the largest
poultry-producing province in the Netherlands, with 28 million chickens.
This is the rationale behind the current industry demand, backed by
political parties, to depopulate poultry farms within a buffer zone,
creating a firebreak area separating Gelderland from North Brabant.
The need to change policy, as reflected in the 2 publications above,
demonstrates the difficulty of tackling HPAI in a densely populated area.
Vaccines designed to contain or prevent HPAI are specifically banned by the
EU because they may interfere with stamping-out policies. The recent
decision to allow the use of avian influenza vaccine in Italy is intended
to limit the spread of low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). However,
most HPAI control regulations reserve the right to use vaccines in
emergencies. - Mod.AS]
