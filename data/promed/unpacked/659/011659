[Since the start of the event, reportedly on 12 Aug 2013, Greece has reported a total of 92 outbreaks of sheep pox, initially scattered along the northeastern border with Turkey's Ederne region, but later spreading to adjacent regions and further. The updated total outbreak statistics, summarising, are:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 20 856 / 1790 / 252 / 20 604 / 0
Goats / 1293 / 0 / 0 / 1219 / 0

The summary report, covering all 92 outbreaks reported in an immediate notification and 19 follow-up reports, updated as of 10 Jul 2014, with an interactive map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015513_20140710_111340.pdf.

Since sheep pox is regarded to be endemic in Turkey, which is regarded the source of the Greek event, Greece, as opposed to Turkey, applies the EU prescribed policy of stamping out (with compensations paid to the owners) while prohibiting vaccination. As can be seen in the summarising report, this has led to the destruction, so far, of 20 604 sheep and 1219 goats. Though the causative agent in this epizootic is a sheep pox virus strain, not affecting goats, according to European Commission regulations, goats in the affected flocks are destroyed as well (and owners compensated).

In view of the situation with sheep pox spread continuing, reevaluation of the said policy may deserve consideration. - Mod.AS]
