The 7 people in France part of a _Listeria_ outbreak linked to organic dairy products fell ill over a period of 18 months, according to public health authorities. Those infected with the same strain of _Listeria_ were identified by the National Reference Center for Listeria, with an 8th case still under investigation.

Sante Publique France [Public Health France] reported 2 people have died, but the agency does not have any evidence to attribute the deaths to _Listeria_ infection.

People fell ill between February 2018 and August 2019 and are aged between 36 and 93 years old; 5 are women. Four live in Alsace, while Burgundy, Ile-de-France, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur all have one case.

Investigations by Sante Publique France found these people had consumed organic dairy products in the weeks before contracting listeriosis. Analysis of food samples from a company, based in Bas-Rhin, Alsace confirmed contamination with _Listeria_. Raw milk cheeses are the suspected source of the contamination.

Testing by the National Reference Center for _Listeria_ confirmed strains found in products had the same genetic characteristics as those isolated in the patients. Consumption of Ferme Durr products was also confirmed by several patients.

Ferme Durr recalled all dates of Durr brand organic dairy items, including natural yogurt and yogurt with fruit, cream, cottage cheese, and cheese. Products were sold directly at the firm, in markets and stores throughout France. Products were also distributed in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.

The action was extended a few days later to include puddings and food such as cheese and cold meats resold but not produced at the site.

All production by the company has been stopped until further notice, according to French authorities after an investigation revealed "serious shortcomings," and results of official controls found "widespread contamination" of the facility and food products.

It can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of the infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people who have weakened immune systems are more at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections, and other complications.

Meanwhile, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission has released a Certified Reference Material (CRM) to be used as quality assurance for analysis of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in food control laboratories. The aim is to support EU member states when monitoring listeriosis and ensure collection of comparable data on the disease.

Evaluating the subtype of _Listeria monocytogenes_ is essential in epidemiological investigations or source tracking contamination from food factories. One of the methods used by labs for subtyping is pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The material was certified using an interlaboratory comparison study, in which all participants used PFGE.

In the EU, 2480 cases were reported in 2017, with a mortality rate of 14%. The disease is often severe with high hospitalization and mortality rates. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods such as smoked fish, deli meats and soft cheeses are the main routes of transmission.

[The 7 patients infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria_ live in eastern France: 4 in Alsace, an historical region located in Grand Est (Grand Est is one of the 12 mainland regions of France) and 1 each in the regions of Burgundy, Ile-de-France, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. A map showing these locations can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_France. Patients fell ill between February 2018 and August 2019.

The source of this listeriosis outbreak is believed to be raw milk cheeses produced by a facility in Bas-Rhin, Alsace. Products from this facility were consumed by several of the patients, and _Listeria_ isolated from some products had the same genetic characteristics as those isolated from the patients. Products were sold directly at the facility, as well as distributed throughout France and in Belgium, Germany, and Luxembourg.

The company ceased operation and recalled all its dairy items including cheeses, yogurt and yogurt with fruit, cream, cottage cheese, and cheese; the recall was extended a few days later to include food resold but not produced at the site.

Bas-Rhin is a department in northern Alsace (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas-Rhin). The exact date of the recall is not given, but may be very recent. Because the incubation period for listeriosis is up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_, more cases can be expected. - Mod.ML
