PFIESTERIA AND POLLUTION: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (02)
------------------------------------------------------
[see Toxic algae - North Carolina: an update 970331100029
and Paul Millikin's original RFI ]
Date: Sat 26 Apr 1997
From: Peter Cowen <Peter_Cowen@ncsu.edu>
In response to Paul Millikin and Hans Anderson's requests for information
about Pfiesteria, I have gather some information about hog waste and
Pfiesteria. I am in the process of talking with people about what is
actually know about human health effects.
Hogs do not excrete Pfiesteria cysts. Pfiesteria is an algae which only
poses a threat when there is a massive overgrowth in coastal rivers. So,
there is no threat of "Red Tide", a coastal phenomenon occurring in the
Middle West. The putative link between hogs and Pfiesteria is that algal
blooms are encouraged under conditions of high nitrogen concentration in
rivers and hog waste adds to the concentration of such organic material in
rivers. There is a great deal of misinformation and hysteria about
Pfiesteria generated by the recent publication of a popular book on the
subject "And the Waters Turned to Blood".
A couple of important points to remember about hog excreta. A 500 pound
sow will obviously produce more waste than a 200 pound human but a piglet
will produce much less. A good number to use is that pigs produce 2.3
times the volumne of excreta than do humans.
More importantly, however, is the complex multifactorial contributors to
the nitrogen and phosporous loads in the river. To take nitrogen for
example, factors other than hog waste include human sewage discharge
(treatment reduces concentration, not total amount of nitrogen put into the
water), fertilizers from plant agricultural and other i.e. golf course
sources, just plain old decay of organic matter as well as industrial point
source discharge of nitrogenous wastes. Up to 60% of the nitrogen load may
come from atmospheric nitrogen which has been sublimated and recycled into
the river. Furthermore, the river characteristics concerning flow, course
and turbidity may be the most important factor in determining the
Pfiesteria loads resulting from a given nitrogen concentration.

Two facts argue against simplistic conclusions about hog waste "causing"
Pfesteria. First, the Neuse River was involved in the 1995 outbreak while
it is the Cape Fear River which runs right throught Sampson and Duplin
Countries in North Carolina - the nation's most dense hog producing areas.
The Neuse drains areas which have recently had a rather large increase in
human population. Secondly, the 1995 Nuese expereience which include
massive fish kills was not repeated last year nor has it ever occurred to
such an extent on the Cape Fever River. Algal blooms occurs during the
summer while most hog farms pollution prolems occur in the spring during
the heavy rains. Anyone who believes in a multifactorial nature of disease
will have a hard time accepting the rather simplistic conclusion that hog
farm waste results directly in a Pfesteria threat. It is a part of the
problem but how large is not yet understood scientifically. However,
simplistic solutions appear to be the order of the day in public discusions
of health matters. This is an ecological problem which probably won't go
away, seems to be powering to some degree a North Carolina ban on new hog
farm construction and is critically in need of much better data to sort out
what is really going on. I will follow with a posting containing some
information about what we know about human health effects.
