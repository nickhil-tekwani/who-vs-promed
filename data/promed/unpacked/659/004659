In September and October 2022, the Institut Pasteur in Dakar confirmed 4 yellow fever cases from Niger, including one death. The cases were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and were reported from Dosso, Zinder, Tahoua, and Agadez [regions]. The date of onset of symptoms for the last case was 14 Aug 2022. 2 probable cases were reported during the same period.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever that is spread through the bites of infected mosquitoes.

Symptoms of yellow fever (fever, chills, headache, backache, and muscle aches) develop 3-6 days after infection. About 12% of people infected with yellow fever virus will develop severe illness that can lead to liver disease, bleeding, shock, organ failure, yellowing skin (jaundice), and sometimes death. Among those who develop severe disease, 30-60% die.

There is no medicine to treat or cure the infection. To prevent getting sick from yellow fever, use insect repellent, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and get vaccinated.

[ProMED has not reported yellow fever cases in Niger since 2013. These 4 cases in 2022 were reported as probable in a WHO table of probable and confirmed cases of yellow fever and deaths by country in the WHO African Region, 1 Jan 2021 to 26 Aug 2022 (see https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON405). These 4 cases are now confirmed. The report above does not indicate if vaccination campaigns are planned in the 4 districts where the cases occurred.

Vaccination is the most practical and cost-effective measure to prevent yellow fever (YF). Inclusion of YF vaccine in routine childhood vaccination programs would be ideal but has not yet been universally achieved. Vector mosquito control by reduction of adult _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes provides only short-term protection. Some of the newer measures to control _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes, such as genetic modification, release of sterile males, or blockage of the ability to transmit the virus by introduction of _Wolbachia_ bacteria, offer some hope in preventing the urban/suburban cycle of transmission that can quickly get out of control when these mosquitoes are abundant and a significant proportion of the human population is unvaccinated. - Mod.TY
