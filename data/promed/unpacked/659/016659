E. coli outbreak in in Washington County, NY. Source still unknown
according to NYDOH.
-------------------------------------
A 3-year-old [girl] became infected at the Washington County Fair; 33 other
cases have been confirmed in one of country's worst outbreaks since 1993
The girl, who died at 3:30 p.m. Saturday, was admitted to the hospital
Friday with the outward symptoms of the infection -- diarrhea, aches and
nausea.
"We cannot at this time say _E. coli_ caused the death," Richard Puff,
spokesman at Albany Medical Center Hospital said. "We have to wait for an
autopsy [and bacteriological analyses] to be performed for the official
cause."
The victim was the youngest of 16 people who were in area hospitals
suffering from the infection early Saturday, but that number quickly grew
to 33 later in the day as more cases surfaced. All the stricken attended
the fair on one or both of its final two days Aug. 28 and 29, said Kristine
Smith, spokeswoman for the state Health Department.
State environmental health workers also checked three water wells in the
town of Greenwich, where the fair was held.
Most victims are children between the ages of 3 and 14, Smith said. There
also are a number of older and elderly victims. The bacteria usually
afflicts the very young and very old with the greatest seriousness, Smith
said. It was a large number of reported cases in local children early
Friday that alerted health officials to the outbreak.
The source of the bacteria has not been determined, but officials have
ruled out hamburger and the fair's petting zoo. More cases are likely to
surface, Smith said.
"We have a very large outbreak to deal with here," Smith said Saturday. "We
are scrambling to find the origin because 27 000 were at the fair on its
last day of the weeklong fair alone."
"We were able to determine that not all of the victims ate hamburger at the
fair," Smith said. Smith said it also was determined that the bacteria was
not in any way associated with the petting zoo. But that still leaves many
possible sources -- ranging from apple cider to the local water added to
juice concentrates or used to make ice to salads prepared at a booth. The
outbreak could even be related to just one infected worker who did not wear
the mandatory plastic food-handling gloves, Smith said.
"We have to complete our interviews with all these people, then sit down
and sort through all the information about their day at the fair and find
the common thread," Smith said.
Health officials feel the number of cases may grow for two reasons -- the
incubation period for _E. coli_ bacteria is three to nine days, leaving
time for symptoms to surface, and a secondary infection could develop,
caused by carriers who are not afflicted with the symptoms but who may pass
the infection on to other people.
Albany Medical Center Hospital on Saturday was still treating 14 patients
-- 7 adults and 7 children. One adult and one child were admitted and were
in fair condition; others were treated and released or were being evaluated
in the emergency room, Puff said.
St. Mary's Hospital in Troy and St. Peter's Hospital in Albany each
reported treating one child showing symptoms. The children were treated and
released from both hospitals.
Smith said most of the victims are from the Washington-Warren-Saratoga
counties area and some are from Albany and Rensselaer counties.
Anyone experiencing possible symptoms should seek medical care immediately.
Transmission of the infection can be curtailed by regularly washing hands
before, during and after food preparation and visits to the bathroom, Smith
said.
Smith said the bacteria appeared to be the most commonly transmitted form
_E. coli_ 0157:H7.
There are no specific treatments, and the disease tends to run its course
of three to five days. But the very young and very old can experience
severe dehydration and kidney failure, which can lead to death.
People who fear they or their children may be affected should first call
their doctor. If the diarrhea or cramps are severe, or if the patient is
unable to take in fluids, they should seek immediate medical attention. In
most cases, Smith said, the bacteria is not life-threatening. O'Brien
contributed to this report.

E. coli source discovered, 112 ill
----------------------------------
The New York state Health Department said a water well by the Washington
County Fairgrounds, located 30 miles from Albany, is believed to be the
source of _E. coli_ bacteria contamination in the capital district.
One child has died from the _E. coli_ infection, one is in critical
condition and 111 appear to be stricken by the infection that has no cure.
Health Department officials said an underground water well that supplied
water to the fairgrounds has shown elevated levels of _E. coli_ bacteria.
However, Health Department officials said it still isn't known where the
_E. coli_ originated but animal waste is considered the likely source.
_E. coli_ lives in the intestinal system of humans and other mammals and
while many strains are harmless, the one identified as O157:H7 that has
infected many in the capital district, is deadly.
Health department officials are advising anyone experiencing symptoms to
seek medical attention. The infection is spread by contaminated food or
water, an infected person handling food or direct contract with an infected
person.
