On 22 Aug 2006, the Rescue Service with the Ministry for Territorial
Administration of Armenia reported that 10 to 15 head of livestock in a
pasture at Artikskiye Dachi were found to have FMD. The results were
verified by the Veterinary [office] of the city. Sick animals have been
isolated and disinfection is taking place. Measures for averting the
spread of the disease are also being carried out.

[On 17 Jul 2006, ProMED-mail posted a newswire on suspected FMD cases in
bovines in 2 villages in Shirakskaya region (Shirak) of Armenia, stating
that quarantine measures (and probably vaccinations) had been applied.
However, the said information was denied on 24 Jul 2006 by the FAO Regional
Project Coordinator for FMD Control and Surveillance, who reported that the
previously observed clinical cases of stomatitis and lameness were probably
caused by dry weather conditions. It was not clear if this information was
supported by laboratory investigations.
A reassessment of the situation on the ground will be helpful.
Shirak region is situated in northwest Armenia, bordering Turkey to the
west and Georgia to the north; map at

The latest information on the FMD situation in Armenia, available in OIE's
epidemiological data base ("Handistatus"), relates to 2002. - Mod.AS]
