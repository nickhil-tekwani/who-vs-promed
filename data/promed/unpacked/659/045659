Another horse has died at a Doylestown Township [Bucks County] farm placed under quarantine by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

The horse, boarded at Mile View Farm off Ferry Road, died at about 1 am [Thu 31 Dec 2015], farm co-owner Douglas Raymond said, adding the cause of the animal's death wasn't known though he suspects the culprit may be a highly contagious virus that killed 3 other horses on the farm recently. The virus is an aggressive neurological form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) called equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

A post on the farm's Facebook page [Thu 31 Dec 2015], however, was definitive: "We regret to report that last night we lost another horse. That is the 4th horse we have lost to the EHV-1 virus. We continue with the most thorough measures of disinfecting, isolation, and other biosecurity, with the full cooperation of the PA Department of Agriculture and local veterinarians."

Raymond said he believes the quarantine procedures at the farm have been effective, despite the recent death of a 4th horse.

Reached [Thu 31 Dec 2015], a spokeswoman for the state Department of Agriculture was unable to provide information about the animal's death.

The death comes roughly a week after initial reports surfaced that the farm had been placed under quarantine following the illness of 3 horses. All were euthanized.

The virus can be deadly if contracted by horses, but it poses no health risk to humans.

Once biosecurity is put into place, whatever is incubating will continue. This is likely what has happened here. It is a sad loss for the owners, the farm, and the caretakers. - Mod.TG
