As Dr. Sarah Cleveland begins the mass vaccination against rabies and
canine distemper virus (CDV), the name of each dog and owner is recorded.
The dogs are among the 30,000 vaccinated since 1995 in a British-funded
project aimed at saving them but, more importantly, the lions whose kingdom
is the 5600 square miles of the Serengeti.
CDV, akin to rinderpest and measles, reached the great Kenyan and Tanzanian
game reserves in 1994 with devastating consequences. More than one-third of
the Serengeti's 3000 lions succumbed to the dreadful disease.
Video of one of the first male lions to contract the disease shows its
agonizing death: lying helpless, rigid and shaking in seizures, each one
progressively worse. The pattern that subsequently emerged was vomiting,
seizures, coma and death within 24-hours.
Sarah Cleveland originally came to east Africa to study cheetahs and had
special knowledge of rabies, reasoned that the village dogs were the
reservoir for the airborne CDV. It was being spread from the dogs to hyenas
who scavenged the villages, and from the hyenas to the lions.
The only way to stop the lion population from being destroyed was to begin
a mass vaccination program for both lions and dogs. Life Lion was set up in
September 1996 to provide funding for the vaccination campaign.
Coordinated by Mr. Sampson with financial help from Disney, MGM and the
World Society for the Protection of Animals, Life Lion has provided the
wherewithal for the program.
The Life Lion project came too late to save more than 1,000 lions in the
Serengeti and the Masai Mara, but through the immunization program the
scientists believe they now have the disease in check.
Dr. Cleveland, who works for the London Zoological Society, said: "The
vaccination program has been hugely successful. Through immunization of
domestic dogs against CDV and rabies and the creation of buffer zones
around the Serengeti and the Ngorongoro crater, we have managed to prevent
a further outbreak of the disease. We have provided significant and
demonstrable results, but the big question is whether we can sustain the
effort."
In Tanzania the CDV outbreak is thought to have originated from the Mara
region where more than a million people keep an estimated 150,000 dogs.
It is the expansion and encroachment of the villages that is putting the
wildlife reserves under massive pressure.
