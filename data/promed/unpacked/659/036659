Oilseed rape [osr] growers could suffer substantial losses after a study revealed an important source of genetic resistance against phoma stem canker is becoming less effective. Researchers from the University of Hertfordshire have declared that host resistant gene Rlm7 has become less successful in controlling stem canker.

The disease is caused by 2 closely related fungal pathogens, _Leptosphaeria maculans_ and _L. biglobosa_ [see comments below], with Rlm7 the most dominant gene to give oilseed rape resistance. Growers rely on varieties that have good resistance against phoma, after some effective fungicides for treating the disease have been withdrawn.

Georgia Mitrousia, lead author of the study said, "This acts as a warning to the oilseed rape industry and they will hopefully develop strategies to prevent the loss of commercially available cultivars."

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) is the most serious disease of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. Severe disease is caused by the fungus _Phaeosphaeria sowerbyi_ (previously _Leptosphaeria maculans_), while _Plenodomus biglobosus_ (previously _L. biglobosa_) has been reported in association with milder symptoms. The disease can also affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family (such as cabbages, turnip, some weeds), which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse (lodging) of the crop. Root infections have also been reported (ProMED-mail post 20010819.1959). Symptomless infections may also occur.

The fungi are seed borne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal, mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment) and infected crop litter. They may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum and fungicides.

Rape cultivars with different levels of disease resistance are available and are placed into groups according to which resistance genes they carry (see link below). However, the pathogen is extremely diverse and new strains evolve frequently, both overcoming host resistances and developing new fungicide resistances. Pathogen adaptation may be counteracted by frequent changing of cultivars and/or mixing fungicides with different modes of action.

A similar problem of loss of host resistance in oilseed rape due to reliance on resistant cultivars as sole disease control is currently also being reported for clubroot disease in Canada (ProMED-mail post 20180503.5780419).

In the UK, an alert has also been issued for light leaf spot (caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), the most common disease to affect oilseed rape in the country (see link below).
