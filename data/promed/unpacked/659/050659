After the damage done by the floods, now the paddy crop has a new
problem ahead. In the last few days, a disease has struck the crops in
the district, which could further dent the paddy production. In fact,
this might prove a setback for those farmers who escaped from the fury
of the floods.

Termed bacterial blight of rice, it can easily spread through water
and attacks the roots of the seedlings stopping the further growth of
plants. Incessant rain and overflowing rivers in Punjab have created
favourable conditions for the disease. For the past few days, farmers
in the area had been complaining about the spread of disease in the
rice farms. Punjab Agriculture University [PAU] had also confirmed the
spread of disease in the farms.

SK Thind of PAU said that the disease could prove dangerous impacting
on 20-25 percent of rice production during the season. Only sunshine
could aid the farmers to protect their crops. Heat evaporates extra
water from the fields and decreases the moisture in the air. Besides,
he said, farmers should try to stop draining water from the affected
field to other fields as the disease spreads with it. If possible,
farmers should try to lower the water level in the fields.

An affected farmer said, "It is like a bad dream. It is raining more
than the expectation, which is helping disease to spread in more areas."

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_
pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern Australia,
Africa, and the USA. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are
severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60
percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and
wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate
over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance.
Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small
leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various
saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage.
Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged
appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity,
standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is
short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be
short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as
rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated irrigation systems are
thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by
windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting
seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management includes
phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts,
removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant
spacing and fertilizers), and use of resistant crop varieties.

Outbreaks of BLB were reported from Punjab also in previous years
(ProMED-mail posts 20090903.3101, 20080923.3002, and 20071005.3293).
