The Central Kentucky farm that had the 1st discovered case of
contagious equine metritis (CEM) in the recent outbreak, which set
off the investigation that now includes 680 horses nationwide, has
declared the all-clear. The 4 formerly positive stallions at DeGraff
Stables/Liberty Farm Equine Reproduction Center LLC in Midway,
Kentucky, have all completed treatment. No stallions remain under
quarantine at the facility.

"Based on the testing evidence, the stallions have been released from
all restrictions imposed," said Rusty Ford, equine programs manager
in the office of Kentucky State Veterinarian Robert Stout, DVM. "The
Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office is proclaiming that each of the
exposed stallions and all of the previously infected stallions that
had resided at DeGraff Stables Liberty Farm have been determined to
be free of the contagious equine metritis disease-causing organism,
_Taylorella equigenitalis_.

"Animals are released from quarantine only after they have completed
an extensive testing protocol and clearly demonstrate the organism is
not present," Ford stated.

The University of Kentucky's Livestock Disease Diagnostic Center
first detected _Taylorella equigenitalis_, the causative organism for
CEM, in a culture from Liberty Farm Quarter Horse stallion Potential
Investment on [10 Dec 2008], prior to his semen being exported to the
European Union.

Other stallions at the farm that tested positive included: Hot Lopin
Sensation, Indian Artifacts; and Repeated in Red.

Overall, the stallion testing and treatment protocol at the farm was
completed in 3 months. The final 2 stallions were released from
quarantine 10 Mar 2009.

Kentucky State Veterinary officials' epidemiologic investigation
concluded the disease-causing organism was introduced to the farm by
a Paint stallion that had stood the preceding seasons in Wisconsin.

The Liberty Farm owner and her business partner are now turning their
focus to incoming mares. While the stallions are cleared, the farm is
offering maintenance of mares that are considered under quarantine,
including accommodating mares for testing, treatment, and clearance.
"You may have full confidence that housing and turnouts are separate
with no 'nose-to-nose' contact as prescribed," they stated. "We
welcome all visitors."

Ford noted that the statewide investigation seems to be winding down
as well, with 6 exposed stallions still under quarantine awaiting
results from their final set of cultures, which were recently
collected. "We think we can see the light at the end of the tunnel,
and we have no reason to believe it is a train coming at us," Ford
noted.

Locations have been confirmed for 686 horses exposed to _T.
equigenitalis_. The 686 horses are located in 46 states. There are
121 exposed or positive stallions in 19 states and 565 exposed or
positive mares in 44 states. 8 exposed mares are still actively being
traced.
Including the 4 in Kentucky, 16 stallions have now completed their
entire testing and treatment protocol and been determined to be
negative for _T. equigenitalis_.
