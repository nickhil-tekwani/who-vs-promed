Mbarara fights banana wilt
--------------------------
The Mbarara agriculture and production department has launched a
campaign to control the banana bacterial wilt in the district. A team
headed by the district agricultural officer, Grace Byarugaba,
recently launched a task force for Nyamitanga division in Ruti. The
task force mobilises and sensitises the community on how to control the wilt.

Byarugaba said the disease had spread to all parts of the district
and it required a combined effort to control it. The disease has
forced farmers to sell off their plantations cheaply. Many farmers
have reportedly shifted to Mubende district.

Byarugaba advised farmers to the cut and bury the affected banana
plants. She added that the tools used for cutting the affected plants
must be washed in Jik [South African brand of household bleach] or
heated in fire to prevent the spread of the disease. "Farmers should
stop planting suckers for 3 months. Whoever wants to plant suckers
should first consult the task force committee. This will reduce the
spread," Byarugaba added

The LC5 [local council] vice-chairperson, Stephen Kamanyire, said 95
percent of Mbarara farmers depended on matooke [cooking bananas]. He
called for an emergency fund specifically for the banana bacterial
wilt from the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) to help
in the sensitisation of farmers.

Disease hits Kenyan crops
--------------------------
Residents in western Kenya's Nyanza province, hit hard by last year's
poor maize harvest, are now reporting the outbreak of a disease that
is destroying banana trees there.

Many Kenyans rely on bananas to supplement their diets. But the
once-plentiful fruit is prematurely ripening and rotting on trees
infected with a disease called banana bacterial wilt. On some
plantations, yield losses of 90 percent are being reported.

Banana farmers say they need the government to urgently release funds
to help fight the diseases threatening to impoverish them and to
leave east Africa's largest economy in even greater need of food aid.

Kenya bans Ugandan banana suckers
---------------------------------
Kenya has banned importation of banana suckers from Uganda due to the
banana wilt disease that it believes originated from Uganda. The
Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) said the banana wilt
disease had reached an alarming rate. It said it would fight people
who do not declare their goods on arrival into the country. The
agency said the importers use porous routes along the borders of
Busia, Malaba, and Lwakhakha to smuggle in non-inspected suckers or
goods with pathogen contents.

The KEPHIS service general manager, Dr Joseph Ahenda, told a
stakeholder's seminar in Malaba that a lot of maize grains, beans,
and banana suckers had entered Kenya through the illegal routes.
Ahenda revealed that high-profile people were responsible for the
importation of agricultural bacteria into the region by not declaring
what they were carrying. The seminar that had stakeholders from Kenya
and Uganda heard that the increased movement of plant materials was
due to rapid expansion of the global economy, relaxed trade barriers,
and efficient and rapid means of transport.

The Malaba-Uganda agriculture inspector, Martin Charles Odera, said
the wilt disease had devastating effects and advised Kenyan farmers
not to use unorthodox means of securing banana suckers. "There is
need to be cautious," Odera said.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of
banana bacterial wilt (BBW) in Uganda and other East African
countries. It affects all banana types causing wilting and premature
ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 percent in many plantations
and yield losses of up to 90 percent have been reported. The pathogen
survives in soil and plant debris and is mainly spread via infected
planting material, insects, mechanical means, and contaminated tools.
A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management using an integrated approach is needed, including
cultural methods like crop rotation, use of certified clean material
for replanting, and phytosanitation to reduce inoculum as well as
prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen.
The increase of plant biosecurity measures suggested above is a good
attempt at limiting spread to new regions.

In Uganda, the disease started in Mukono district in 2001 and has
been spreading since at a rate of up to 75 km [approx. 47 mi] per
year. In Kenya, BBW is thought to have appeared for the 1st time in
2007 (see ProMED-mail post no. 20080612.1851). BBW is now also
present in several other countries in the region posing a significant
threat to food security. For more information on BBW see previous
ProMED-mail posts and links below.
