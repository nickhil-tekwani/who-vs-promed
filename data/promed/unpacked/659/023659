The hemorrhagic disease affecting livestock and humans in Kenya and
Somalia, still not positively identified, has been found for the first time
in wildlife - the gerenuk. The mortality rate is 100%. The gerenuk
(Litocranius walleri) is a very elegant little antelope with a very long
neck. It shares a habitat with several other species - Grant's gazelle,
oryx, greater kudu, lesser kudu, dik dik and Hunters' antelope, the last of
which is a seriously endangered species.
[I am tempted to defer comment but ProMED-mail's resident anthrax expert
and moderator, Martin Hugh-Jones is away. While the inclusion of a wild
ruminant in the list of susceptible species makes one suspect anthrax, a
couple of puzzling things remain. First, unless it is impossible to obtain
fresh samples, diagnosis of anthrax is not normally difficult and should be
established by now. However, reports do indicate extreme flooding and lack
of accessibility to the region. Additionally, national elections started
today. A second concern is that the gerenuk feeds by standing on its' hind
legs and nibbling at the acacia tree. We usually think of ruminants
getting anthrax by grazing.
However, large outbreaks of human disease with symptoms similar to what is
being described have occurred upon the ingestion of anthrax infected meat.
Animals can die in a per acute fashion, thereby reducing suspicions of
disease. We are very grateful to the Kenya Wildlife Service for the
information and would like to hear new information from any of several
veterinary institutes in Nairobi. - Mod.PC
