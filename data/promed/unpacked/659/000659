Inquiry has been announced into the south Wales _Escherichia coli_ outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
There is concern over the rising number of cases (75), and the number of
affected schools has risen to 29. Officials said on Friday night, 23 Sep
2005, that the case total was likely to go up again.
A meat supplier linked to the outbreak, John Tudor and Son of Bridgend, has
been told to stop trading, and any business receiving cooked meat from the
firm has been told to withdraw it.
Announcing the inquiry earlier on Fri, 23 Sep 2005, Health Minister Brian
Gibbons said he hoped there would not be any further increase in the number
of cases in the Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend and Caerphilly
areas. Politicians in the valleys were demanding an assembly inquiry into
Wales' worst _E. coli_ outbreak.
At lunchtime on Fri, 23 Sep 2005, Roland Salmon of the National Public
Health Service confirmed the number of cases had risen overnight from 68 to
75. He had already described the earlier rise to 68 as "dramatic and
discouraging". In the latest update on Friday night, officials announced
that 2 new schools had been affected -- Glyntaf Infants and Brynna Primary.
Both are in the worst-hit area of Rhondda Cynon Taf.
In a statement, the outbreak control team said: "It is probable that the
number of cases will increase further. This is not because the source of
the outbreak remains live. It is because, it takes time for the germ to
incubate -- sometimes more than a week -- and new cases are emerging [in
people] who caught the germs before the control measures were taken at the
beginning of the week," it added.
The team -- made up of council officers, health and food safety officials
-- said it had also unanimously agreed that all schools should remain open
"because with the control measures in place, it was safe to do so." The
officials said this decision would remain under review, and cooked meat
would be reintroduced to schools as new suppliers were found.
The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said any business which had received cooked
meat from John Tudor and Son should withdraw it immediately and contact
their local authority. The FSA also asked all Welsh local councils to
contact any small to medium-sized business to ensure they have not bought
any cooked meat from the company.
The majority of the cases are schoolchildren, 3 of whom are in hospital and
seriously ill.
Meanwhile, an examination of the premises of John Tudor and Son -- which
supplies schools and council premises with food -- continues, although
there is no conclusive evidence that it is the source of the infection.
In 1999, there were 13 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 at a tourist farm
park on Anglesey and in 2002, 4 children at a nursery in Bangor contracted
the bacterium. In Wales, the normal annual number of cases is 30.
