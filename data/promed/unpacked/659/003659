Smuggled livestock could have caused the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infection of a Bangladeshi expatriate, who died last week in Buraimi [Al Buraimi governorate], according to reliable sources. Sources at the Buraimi Hospital said the death of an illegal Pakistani resident, who was involved in handling livestock, could also have been caused by CCHF 2 week ago. "There is a thriving trade of illegally imported livestock as it comes much cheaper than the livestock imported with proper certification from the authorities." An unidentified source claimed that mostly these smuggled livestock come from the Horn of Africa.

The unclaimed body of the Pakistani was still lying in the Buraimi hospital morgue but no investigation was carried out to determine his death although his symptoms were similar to CCHF. It is believed that the infected livestock smuggled into country could have infected the deceased as Oman is believed to be largely free of such tick-borne viral infection.

The middle-aged Bangladeshi who died last week was not a woman as reported earlier. He was a cook working with a restaurant in Buraimi. The health authorities are confused about how the restaurant employee contracted the infection when he had no direct contact with livestock. However, a source believes that the Bangladeshi could be working part time in loading/unloading of smuggled livestock and could have contracted infection while handling the 'illegal cargo'.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) has cautioned the public about misleading information about CCHF. "A lot of the information is exaggerated," a statement issued by the MoH said on Sun 22 Jan 2012. The Ministry statement said that the disease is transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus, _Hyalomma_, which is both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, and hares, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood or ticks. The fever can be transmitted from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood or body fluids. Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in hospitals due to improper sterilisation of medical equipment, re-use of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

The MoH statement stressed that only one case was reported with CCHF. "The victim presented late for medical attention and passed away within few hours, on Wednesday [18 Jan 2012], in Buraimi hospital. No other cases with similar presentation are reported," the statement reiterated. Scoffing at rumours, the Ministry spokesperson said that anti-viral medicine was only given to the healthcare providers in Buraimi Hospital and the immediate contacts including the colleagues of the deceased Bangladeshi cook. "The doctors and nurses are working in a safe environment and there is no case of CCHF among healthcare providers," the spokesperson added.

Urging residents of Buraimi, which borders with Al Ain, not to panic, the MoH spokesperson said: "There is no need to worry as no new cases [have been] reported among the community in Burami, or the staff of the hospital, or the health centre."

The Ministry also [said that] reports in a section of the media that restaurants in Buraimi had been closed down [were incorrect]. The only restaurant that was closed for further investigation is the one where the infected individual was working.

[The account of this incident remains confused. Little appears to be known about the victim who was previously reported to be an expatriate woman, and is now variously described as an illegal Pakistani resident and a Bangladeshi expatriate cook, whose body remains unclaimed in a mortuary. (N.B. Bangladesh separated from Pakistan in 1971. - Corr.SB).

It seems probable that the victim was infected in handling illegally imported livestock or meat in the course of his occupation. Clarification is awaited regarding the identity of the victim and confirmation of the illegal importation of livestock.

For other information on human cases of CCHF, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html.

Al Buraimi is a governorate in the north west corner of the Sultanate of Oman, on the border of the United Arab Emirates. The HealthMap interactive map of Oman can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/1FWS. - Mod.CP]

[CCHF virus (CCHFV) circulates in an enzootic tick-vertebrate-tick cycle; members of the tick genus _Hyalomma_ seem to be the principal vectors. The virus can be found in many species of wild and domestic mammals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, and dogs. There is no evidence that the virus causes disease in animals. Domesticated ruminants including cattle, sheep, and goats are viremic for one week after experimental infections; the only symptom was a transient, mild elevation in body temperature. The introduction of viremic, symptomless animals to slaughterhouses can expose their personnel to infection. Otherwise, infected ticks are the main link between infected animals and humans; acaricides can be used on livestock and other domesticated animals to control ticks, particularly before slaughter or export.

In meat, CCHFV is usually inactivated by post-slaughter acidification. It is also killed by cooking. Unpasteurized milk should not be drunk.

Most species of birds are seronegative and are thought to be resistant to infection; however, antibodies can be found in ostriches, and these animals become viremic after experimental inoculation.

In 2006, the OIE added CCHF to its list of notifiable diseases; this, due to its zoonotic impact and potential international spread. A useful report on CCHF from OIE's ad-hoc group (February 2010) is available at http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D11186.PDF.
