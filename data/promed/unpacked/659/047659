An outbreak of anthrax has affected 150 cattle since early in November this year [2014] in the locality of Maka-Mombolo, some 29 km [18 mi] north of Balombo municipal headquarters in central Benguela province. Speaking to Angop in Maka-Mombolo, the head of the veterinary services in the region, Alcides Daniel Martinho, said the disease has so far killed 5 cattle.

He said a specialised team will work in the locality to vaccinate the cattle in order to prevent the disease from spreading further.

The official stated that the 150 cattle infected are being treated for the disease.

Balombo veterinary services have a stock of 2000 doses of vaccines and are expected to vaccinate about 300 cattle in ox-stalls next to those keeping the animals infected [sic], the source added.

[Benguela Province in on the central western coast of Angola; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/angola_rel90.jpg
and Balombo is east of Benguela City on the eastern side of the province and in the hill country.

Angola has yet to submit its report for 2013 but the past pattern has been to vaccinate between 1.1 million and 2.8 million cattle each year. The last reported outbreaks in Benguela were in 2006 when there were 2 outbreaks with 85 cases. The wording of this report suggests a local confusion between exposed, infected, and affected. As this disease declares itself by killing cattle acutely one seldom has the opportunity to observe sick and moribund animals. And unless promptly treated with antibiotics, the sick are dead. I suspect that the deaths occurred in a herd of some 150 head and fearing further cases the remaining 145 exposed animals will be vaccinated, and hopefully any off-colour stock treated first with antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ
