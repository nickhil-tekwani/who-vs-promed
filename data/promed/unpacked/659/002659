Horse in Oklahoma isolated as infection fear grows
--------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials have quarantined a 3rd
horse in a month due to concerns about contagious
diseases. A horse is being tested for the
neuropathogenic strain of equine herpesvirus-1,
also known as EHV-1, said Jack Carson, a
spokesman for the Oklahoma Department of
Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Results should be announced in a few days.

No case of neuropathogenic EHV-1 has ever been
reported in Oklahoma, Carson said. The most
recent case was confirmed in Louisiana last year [2008].

The dangerous strain is characterized by nerve
damage and a high death rate, Carson said. Many
horses with it cough and have trouble with motor
skills, though signs may not appear immediately.
The normal strain of EHV-1 is more common and
isn't deadly in most horses, he said. A vaccine
is available, though it doesn't protect against the more dangerous strain.

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as
rhinopneumonitis and is a viral disease (EHV-1)
caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a
severe respiratory infection, but it may also
cause a neurological disease, or abortion in
pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity conferred by the disease or the vaccine
are relatively short. Horses on the show or
racing circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months.

ProMED-mail posting number 20081120.3669 reports
a neurological case of EHV-1 in Kentucky as
recently as 8 Nov 2008. Although Kentucky may not
be geographically closer to Oklahoma, it
certainly is chronologically. - Mod.TG]
