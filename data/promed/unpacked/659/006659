(The Health Protection Agency (HPA) of the United Kingdom on 25 May
2006 reports on chikungunya cases diagnosed in travelers returning to
the UK at the above URL. More information, such as a graph showing
the number of imported chikungunya cases diagnosed in travelers
returning to the United Kingdom from 1999 until present and a tabular
summary of the number of cases found in the different regions in the
Indian Ocean, is also given in the above document. Two paragraphs
from this report follow. - Thomas Roesel)

Chikungunya: increase in imported cases
-----------------------------------------------
As of 15 May 2006, there have been 48 cases of chikungunya in the
United Kingdom in 2006, confirmed by the HPA Special Pathogens
Reference Unit. Of those, 9 have been additionally confirmed by
developmental PCR and/or virus isolation, and the remainder were from
suspect cases in which there has been serological evidence (presence
of IgG) of chikungunya infection. This compares to 19 suspect cases
identified in 2005 and an average of 6 suspect cases identified each
year between 1999 and 2004 (figure 1).
The majority of cases since 1999 for whom travel history was
available reported recent travel to Africa or Asia. Eleven of the 19
positive samples identified in 2005 were members of the Royal Marines
who had acquired chikungunya on exercise in Senegal. In 2006, the
majority of samples were from cases who had reported recent travel to
Mauritius (32 samples), with other cases from the Seychelles (5),
Madagascar (4), Africa unspecified (3), and one to the Antipodes.
Five other positive samples had no travel history.

[We thank Dr. Thomas Roesel for the above information. The UK also
reported imported cases of chikungunya. In 2006 alone, there have
been 48 cases. Most of them are laboratory confirmed and foreign
travel related. The main origins of the infections are in the Indian
Ocean region. The interesting part of this survey is that 5 cases did
not have any travel history. I wonder whether any further work has
been done to track down the origin of these unaccounted cases. Could
they be derived from any as yet unproven secondary infection? -
