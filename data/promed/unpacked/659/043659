[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for this very informative figure.

It is assumed the data include all enteroviruses that cause HFMD, including polio virus, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. It would be interesting to see a breakdown by virus to determine whether one is most responsible for the significant increase in case numbers observed. The risk factors that might explain the current increase are likely demographic and spatial as well as environmental (particularly weather). Intermixing of asymptomatically infected children in schools might also contribute to the spread of HFMD. - Mod.LK
