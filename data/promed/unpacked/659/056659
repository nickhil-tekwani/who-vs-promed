A new outbreak of FMD
---------------------
On 6 Jul 2009, information was received on clinically suspected foot
and mouth disease (FMD) cases in a sheep flock in the village
Deir-el-Asad. An FMD virus has been isolated from samples sent to the
[National FMD laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet-Dagan]. A
10-km [6.2-mile] radius area around Deir el Asad has been declared
infected; booster vaccinations are being carried out within the said
area.

A circular [document] with the said information has been distributed
by the [√çsrael] Veterinary Services and Animal Health (VSAH).

[The above item includes links to the circular No 16/2009 of the VSAH,
dated 12 Jul 2009. The circular includes the above information, as
well as a map of the declared 10-km infected zone and a list of the
(52) places in the Zone. For the location of Deir-el-Asad, see the
interactive map at <http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>
(go to square 2, where Deir el Asad can be seen bottom-centre, just
north of Karmiel).

According to Israel's FMD vaccination policy, all cattle older than 2
months are compulsorily vaccinated at least once a year with a
trivalent vaccine (O, A, Asia1). Small ruminants (sheep and goats) are
compulsorily vaccinated annually with FMD vaccine serotype O. As is
apparent from unofficially available information, the Deir-el-Asad
flock has been vaccinated within the last 6 months with the serotype O
vaccine.

Information on the serotype involved in the current outbreak is
pending. Similarly, the serotyping of the virus isolated from an
outbreak in goats in the village Kefar Tappuah, West Bank, which had
started on 14 Jun 2009 and was confirmed on 25 Jun 2009, is still
pending (see RFI in 20090705.2415). Final serotyping of those 2
outbreaks in small ruminants is anticipated soonest.

An outbreak in Israel of FMDV serotype O, which started on 1 Feb 2009,
was declared resolved on 21 May 2009; according to Israel's reports to
the OIE, this epizootic involved a total of 12 outbreaks. Its summary,
with map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7765>.

Subscribers are reminded that, according to the 2009 Molecular
Epidemiology (ME) report of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD
(WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK), besides the FMDV serotype O, known to be
endemic in the region, another serotype, namely serotype A, topotype
Asia, strain Iran-05, is currently spreading within the Middle East.
This strain, against which previous vaccine strains did not provide
satisfactory protection, has already been identified in Bahrain,
Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, and Turkey. The ME reports
(2009) page is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009.htm>.
According to the said page, 60 samples from Israel and 34 samples from
the Palestinian Autonomy are currently included under the title
"sequencing in progress." - Mod.AS]
