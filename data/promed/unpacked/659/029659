[2] USA (New Jersey): 1st death linked to monkeypox
Date: Tue 8 Nov 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
https://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-jersey-reports-first-death-linked-to-monkeypox-77551/


Monkeypox was found to be a contributing factor in the October [2022] death of a New Jersey resident with a history of underlying medical conditions, the New Jersey Department of Health announced Monday [7 Nov 2022]. This is the 1st reported death in New Jersey tied to monkeypox.

The individual, a northern New Jersey resident, was confirmed to have had monkeypox in mid-September [2022].

Cases of monkeypox have been declining over the past weeks in New Jersey. However, it is important to note that the disease is still circulating and, in some cases, may cause severe illness or death. Those at risk of severe disease include people with weakened immune systems; children, especially those under 8 years old; pregnant or nursing people; and individuals with certain conditions that affect skin integrity.

While risk has remained low for the general public, it is important for individuals who may be most at risk to get vaccinated in advance of exposure. The 2-dose monkeypox vaccine can help prevent monkeypox or reduce severity of the disease. Free vaccines are available at community partner vaccination sites throughout the state. Individuals should continue to take precautions to further reduce the spread of monkeypox.

[3] USA: FDA authorizes Roche's test

The US health regulator on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022] issued an emergency use authorization to Roche's (ROG.S) test for the detection of DNA from monkeypox virus in swab specimens collected from people suspected of the virus infection.

The tests will be conducted on the Swiss company's cobas systems, which can also detect HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses.

The Food and Drug Administration said testing will be limited to laboratories that meet the requirements to perform moderate- or high-complexity tests.
