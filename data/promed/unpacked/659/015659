At least 30 fowl have been affected by Newcastle's disease in the
region. In order to fight the virus, SAGARPA (Agriculture, Farming,
Rural Development, Fishing and Food Secretariat, according to its
Spanish initials) personnel are currently immunizing the animals,
announced Manuel Guerrero-Pando, an authorized officer of the
secretariat. He remarked that this viral disease is not transmissible
to humans, and that there is no risk when eating poultry or their eggs.
Mr. Guerrero-Pando also informed that rooster fights are indefinitely
suspended. He announced this after the representative of gamecock
farmers said that his group is willing to collaborate.
Mr. Reyes Ramon Cadena-Payan, secretary for Rural Development in the
State Government said that the local outbreak has been properly
detected, since it has been characterized in gamecocks and in fowl
kept in the households; in Jimenez Municipality, the viral disease is
under control. He added that an educational program and a vaccination
program are necessary.
"It is not avian flu", Mr. Cadena-Payan emphasized, in order to
reassure the population with respect to eating poultry and eggs,
since these products can be consumed without any risk.
Mr. Guerrero-Pando stated that it is important to remember that Dr.
Jorge Canes is the SAGARPA Regional Coordinator of the program
against foot and mouth disease and other exotic diseases, and that
all personnel present in Jimenez, Coronado, and Villa Lopez areas had
moved to Rosales and Meoqui.
According to the report, 30 fowl were affected with Newcastle
disease. The problem started in gamecocks. The outbreak has been
fully identified; however, fowl within the "red area" will be
sacrificed, farms will be inspected, and a peripheral zone will be
designated in which inspections will be held and sanitary measures
implemented in all areas containing domesticated birds and gamecocks,
and movement of such animals will be prohibited.
The Federal Officer clarified that the problem in this region is not
as severe as it is in Jimenez; however, appropriate measures have been taken.
With respect to the previously announced fights, they have been
cancelled per the request of gamecock farmers.

[Newcastle disease is an RNA virus, paramyxovirus-1.
The virus can be shed during incubation, the clinical phase, and for
a period of time during the bird's recovery. The virus is present in
exhaled air, respiratory discharges, feces, eggs laid during clinical
disease, and all parts of the carcass during acute infection and at
death. Thus, it is not unexpected that chickens become infected
through aerosols, contaminated feed, or water.
Clinical signs usually appear rapidly and move as rapidly as 2 days
to infect the entire flock, or may take as long as 12 days. But all
birds appear to be in the same stages of clinical infection almost
simultaneously.
Tentative diagnosis of a rapidly spreading, respiratory-nervous
disease and may be confirmed by virus isolation.
Vaccination has been used during out breaks to gain control, as well
as on a regular basis in endemic areas to build immunity.
Newcastle disease virus may produce a transitory conjunctivitis in
people. The condition has generally been confined to laboratory
workers and teams exposed to large quantities of virus such as those
eviscerating poultry in processing plants. The disease has not been
reported in those consuming poultry products. - Mod.TG]
