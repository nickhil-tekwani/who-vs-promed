African swine fever (ASF), a deadly contagious disease infecting hogs and having no known cure or vaccine, is spreading rapidly in East Asia. The ASF outbreak that has trickled from North to South Korea is akin to an "apocalypse", according to Ahn Chan-il, leader of World Institute for North Korea Studies and a former North Korean service member.

On [Tue 15 Oct 2019], the South Korean government ambushed contagion-carrying pigs near the country's northern borders, using snipers and thermal-imaging drones. The attack was carried out after wayward pigs that had wandered across the buffer region between the Korean neighbors were found to be carrying the ASF virus.

Pork constitutes 80 percent of protein consumption in East Asia. As the epidemic spreads unabatedly, the Korean neighbors are witnessing the worst-ever food crisis in recent times. For North Korea, this is a particularly difficult time as the country is still reeling from the poor harvests of the 1990s in which almost 10% of its population died.

The reticent North Korean government has tried to downplay the hog crisis but unofficial reports reveal that the hemorrhagic virus is spreading uncontrollably. While North Korea lives in denial, South Korea has taken an aggressive stand on the matter by ordering its snipers to eliminate the influx of boars across its borders.

China, the world's top pork producer and consumer, is facing a severe economic downturn due to the swine fever epidemic which threatens to perish nearly half of its pig population if not contained soon, reports CNBC. Last month [September 2019], pork prices in China surged by 69.3% causing the nation's consumer price index to increase by 3%, the highest jump witnessed in the last 6 years.

Chinese officials are deploying strategic measures to combat, including pulling pork reserves from its reserves and consolidating pork supply from far-flung farms. But Dutch Bank Rabobank paints a grim picture: it might take more than 5 years for the Chinese pork industry to return to its pre-swine fever glory.

[2] South Korea: wild boar, domestic pigs, control measures

South Korea said [Wed 16 Oct 2019] that a 7th wild boar found dead near the border with North Korea has tested positive for African swine fever [ASF].

The confirmation came a day after the wild boar carcass was found in the central border town of Cherwon, the Ministry of Environment said.

The deadly animal disease has been detected in 7 dead wild boars near the border, including 2 in Cherwon, about 90 km [about 56 mi] north of Seoul.

South Korea has begun to mobilize hundreds of soldiers and civilians to hunt down wild boars near the border to try to contain the further spread of ASF.

The move comes amid rising suspicions that wild boars may be responsible for the spread of the animal disease in South Korea.

In May [2019], North Korea reported its 1st outbreak of the disease at a farm near its border with China to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Still, it remains unknown how the virus traveled into South Korea.

The number of wild boars killed every month [throughout South Korea?] has increased to around 8000 since July, up from 4000 over the 1st half of 2019, according to the environment ministry.

South Korea has confirmed 14 cases of ASF at local pig farms since 17 Sep 2019, when the country confirmed its 1st case of the deadly hog disease at a farm near the border with North Korea. So far, all reported cases have been in areas bordering the North.

In the latest suspected case, blood tests of pigs from a farm in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province, came back negative late on [Wed 16 Oct 2019].

The virus is not harmful to humans but causes hemorrhagic fever in pigs that is almost always fatal. There is no antidote or vaccine and the only known way to prevent the disease from spreading is a mass cull of affected livestock.

The government has strengthened efforts to disinfect farms and transport vehicles and ordered several rounds of a 48-hour standstill on all pig farms, slaughterhouses and feed factories across the country to prevent the spread of the disease. There are around 6300 pig farms raising more than 11 million pigs in South Korea and pig farming accounts for 40 percent of the total livestock industry.

South Korea, Asia's 4th-biggest pork consumer, has slaughtered and buried more than 150 000 pigs since the outbreak started.

[South Korea has reported 14 confirmed cases of ASF at local pig farms since mid-September 2019, when the country experienced its 1st-ever outbreak of the highly contagious disease. So far, all of the outbreaks came from areas bordering North Korea. No new cases have been reported in domestic pigs since Thu 10 Oct 2019.

According to an earlier (14 Oct 2019) report by Yonhap, on Sun 13 Oct 2019, the agricultural ministry (MAFRA) designated 2 towns from the north of Seoul as areas vulnerable to infection through wild boars. In such zones, quarantine authorities will make all-out efforts to hunt down wild boars by using traps and guns.

The ministry vowed to speed up the purchase of pigs from farms in the affected areas as well, which will be slaughtered and inspected before their meat is released to the market. Pigs that are not purchased will also eventually be culled.

The ministry has been culling all pigs within a 3-km [2-mi] radius of infected farms. More than 150 000 pigs have been culled since the outbreak started.

According to a press release by MAFRA (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs), published 16 Oct 2019 (in Korean, at https://tinyurl.com/y29722vg), by 15 Oct 2019, there were requests for purchase from 76 farms out of 150 farms in 3 regions (Gimpo, Paju, and Yeoncheon). The numbers of purchased, culled, and "in progress" farms in each region are presented.

The press release further stated that, in cooperation with the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Environment, the Forest Service, and local governments, 79 civil-military joint capturing teams consisting of 11 to 12 executives, including civilians, military capturing personnel, guide personnel, and wild boar surveillance equipment operators, are to be deployed. As of 09:00 am, 16 Oct 2019, 57 boars were killed by 29 teams. After the 48-hour trial, the plan is to be reviewed in relation to safety, effectiveness, and adequacy of mission performance.

MAFRA and the Ministry of Environment have stepped up cooperative measures. - Mod.AS

[3] Preventive measures at international airports: Australia

A 45-year-old Vietnamese woman has been expelled from Sydney Airport after biosecurity officers discovered a stash of undeclared pork and food items in her luggage.

This is the 1st overseas traveller to be deported under strict new quarantine laws intended to keep African swine fever (ASF) out of the country.

The woman was carrying 4.6 kg [about 10 lb] of pork and 470 grams [about 1 lb] of eggs, along with kilograms of quail, pate, fruit, garlic, and squid.

Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie said the woman was stopped at the airport for a routine inspection on arrival.

"We need to keep our pest-and-disease-free status as a country, strong," Ms McKenzie said.

Ms McKenzie said ASF was potentially the worst animal health disease the world had ever seen.

International travellers who import high-risk items can be refused entry into Australia and have their visas cancelled for extended periods of time.

A spokesperson from the Federal Agricultural Department confirmed that new test results reveal ASF has been detected in around 50 per cent of pork products stopped at international airports, up from 15 per cent from 9 months ago.

Australian Pork Chief Executive Margo Andrae has commended the government's response to the pork discovery. "The department has recently done testing in the last 2 weeks and in that 2-week period there were 157 seizures that covered 418 individual products and almost 49 per cent of those products had ASF," Ms Andrae said.

"I'm outraged that someone thinks they can bring 10 kg [about 22 lb] of pork products in their suitcases and not declare it and risk our entire AUD 5.3-billion [about USD 3.6 billion] industry."

ASF is a highly contagious disease and is estimated to have wiped out 25 per cent of the world's pig population.

The pig-killing disease is on Australia's doorstep, with outbreaks in Timor-Leste.

According to Timor-Leste's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, there have been 100 reported outbreaks of ASF in the Dili municipality, in which 405 pigs have died.

Ms McKenzie said Australian veterinarians were in Timor-Leste helping with an eradication program.

The Minister said there were 2700 pig producers in Australia and nearly 36 000 people employed in the local industry.

She said Australia needed to make sure the disease did not reach our shores and affect the local industry.

[International travellers are expected to be informed about ASF and their own responsibility in adhering to their obligations in relation to transferred food products. Detection mechanisms have been put into operation in international airports, harbors, and other border posts in various countries. In fact, South Korea was one of the 1st countries which applied such measures, publishing interceptions of suspected food products brought by passengers from infected countries (20180826.5988921; see also 3 reports from Japan, in the "see also" section below). Unfortunately, in Korea the virus managed eventually to find its invasion route elsewhere. It remains to hope, that the local wild boar population in South Korea remains free.
