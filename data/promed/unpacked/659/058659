On 7 Jun 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, Veterinary Department declared the territory of the Municipality of Bujanovac an infected area and the territory of the Pčinja administrative districts as at risk of the infectious disease nodular dermatitis (dermatitis nodosa) or lumpy skin disease (LSD).

Pursuant to the decision designating the protection and surveillance zones, the veterinary administration began implementation of all measures necessary to prevent spread, to control, and to eradicate LSD pursuant to the provisions of the Veterinary Act (Official Glasnik SR nos. 91/2005, 30/2010, 93/2012) and the recommendations of international organizations, namely the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

[The spread of lumpy skin disease (LSD) from Turkey westwards in Europe, so far affecting Greece, Bulgaria, and FYR of Macedonia has now reached Serbia. In the absence of preventive vaccination, the further spread of this vectorborne virus is likely.

Subscribers are referred to the presentations of Greece, Bulgaria, and FYR of Macedonia during the recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed (SCPAFF), Section Animal Health & Welfare, held in Brussels from 1-2 Jun 2016. The presentations are available online at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/health/regulatory_committee/presentations_en.htm#20160601.

Greece, an EU member with the longest experience with LSD, included in its presentations reservations from the policy of the EU requiring stamping out and not allowing preventive vaccination in susceptible adjacent territories at risk. To cite some of the text included:

"Prevention is closely related with vaccination."
"Vaccination is an effective measure to prevent the spread of LSD and eliminate the devastating effects."
"LSD is mainly transmitted by vectors; neither the virus nor the vectors recognize national borders."
"Waiting until the disease enters the country when it is outside the borders is not a good veterinary practice."
"Preventive vaccination should be reconsidered for countries close to the areas with outbreaks."
"Modified stamping out in vaccinated animals should be reexamined."
"Decision 2015/2055 should be amended; alternatively, amendment of the Decision on Emergency Vaccination."

The Bulgarian report included the following text, indicative of similar attitudes in relation to vaccination:

"The BFSA [Bulgarian Food Safety Agency] has also started discussions with Onderstepoort Biological Products, South Africa for possible delivery of additional 350 000 doses of vaccines to vaccinate the remaining territories of Bulgaria (the whole country)."

It may be interesting to note whether the experience gathered in the other infected countries is different. - Mod.AS]
