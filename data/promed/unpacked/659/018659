Afghanistan
- Up to 2 new wild poliovirus one (WPV1) positive environmental samples were reported in the past week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]. One sample was collected on [Sat 23 Sep 2017] from Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province, and the other on [Sun 24 Sep 2017] from Behsud district, also located in Nangarhar province.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 is currently 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [Mon 10 Jul 2017], from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan.
- An advance notification of a WPV1 case, received from Batikot district in Nangarhar Province (paralysis onset on 15-Sep-2017), is likely to raise the case count to 7 in the coming days.

Pakistan
- Up to 3 new wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) positive environmental samples were reported in the last week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]. The samples are from Sindh province, 2 from Sukkur district, and one from Karachi district.
- No new wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 5.
- A vaccination campaign is underway, targeting more than 3.5 million children aged less than 5 years in 29 selected districts of 4 provinces and Federally Administered Tribal Areas, in response to the most recent polio case (Lakki Marwat, KP) and positive environmental samples.
- A bOPV-IPV Campaign is being implemented in selected areas of Rawalpindi and Islamabad targeting about 0.2 million children, to boost the immunity among high risk populations.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.
- Subnational immunisation days took place last week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017], providing protection to over 50 percent of children under the age of 5 nationwide.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Synchronised immunisation activities took place last week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017], using bOPV to vaccinate children aged 0 to 5 years in all countries in the Lake Chad Basin.
- A large livestock vaccination campaign targeting international nomads is planned for the end of November [2017].
- The 2nd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in CAR and Nigeria is scheduled for [29 Oct 2017 - 10 Nov 2017].

Central Africa

- Outbreak response continues to take place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- The next immunisation activities are scheduled for the end of October [2017], using bOPV vaccine to immunise over 10 million children.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- In Syria, one new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV2) case has been reported this week [week of Sun 8 Oct 2017]. The case was reported in Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate, and had onset on [Sat 19 Aug 2017]. At the time of infection, the child was 19-months-old, and no history of polio vaccination.
- The bulk of all cases continue to be from Mayadeen, the epicentre of this outbreak.

[Take away messages from the above report(s):
- WPV1 is still circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The isolation of the WPV1 in environmental samples confirms this. In the most recent isolations in Afghanistan, there is also an early report of a new WPV1 associated case in Nangarhar province, but from a different district (Batikot) than the where the environmental isolates were from (Jalalabad and Besud). Of note is that the 3 districts (Batikot, Jalalabad and Besud) are contiguous with one another. Nangarhar province borders with Pakistan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_Province#/media/File:Map_Nangarhar_Province.svg).

In contrast, the positive environmental samples in Pakistan are coming from Sindh province (Sukkur and Karachi districts). (http://www.mappk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sindh-Province-Complete-Map-District-Wise.jpg). The most recent case of WPV1 paralytic disease in Sindh had onset of paralysis on [Fri 11 Aug 2017] and was in Karachi. Of note is that in recent updates, there have been other positive environmental samples for WPV1 in Sindh province, involving multiple different districts. (see Poliomyelitis update (26): global (Syria, DR Congo) 20170922.5334914, Poliomyelitis update (27): global (Pakistan, Afghanistan), Syria 20170928.5347795).

- The cVDPV2 is still circulating in Syria, predominantly in Mayadeen, Deir Ez-Zor governorate where one new case was confirmed, and 2 asymptomatic children also had cVDPV infections.
