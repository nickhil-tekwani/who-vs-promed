Iowa: rabies infection kills Cedar Rapids resident
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials are trying to learn how a Cedar Rapids musician was
infected with the rabies that killed him this weekend. The 20 year old man
was the first person to die of rabies in Iowa in more than 50 years, state
health officials said on Sun 29 Sep 2002.
The man died on Sat 28 Sep 2002 at St Luke's Hospital, where he was
admitted on 17 Sep 2002. Linn County officials said tests of saliva and
brain tissue confirmed the virus late on Saturday. Tom Hart, environmental
supervisor for the Linn County Health Department, said officials tested
dogs the victim had contact with, including one that bit him. They found no
trace of rabies. There have been no documented cases of human-to-human
transmission of rabies, officials said, but they believe it is possible
through saliva. A bat or other animal is the most likely culprit in this
case, Hart said. The victim lived with his parents on the north east side
of Cedar Rapids in a house with a peaked attic, officials said. Attics are
common hiding places for bats, and officials expect to spend the next week
examining the house.
Rabies travels through the nervous system and produces seizures or comas,
St Luke's Hospital spokesman Mike Humbert said. Hospital employees who had
contact with this patient are being tested, said Mary Ann Osborne, vice
president of administration at the hospital. No other patients were
exposed, hospital officials said.
In 2000, 5 people died of rabies in the United States, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [1 case in 2001. - Mod.MPP].
Officials ask anyone who might have had contact with the victim's saliva
since 7 Sep 2002 to call the Iowa health department at (800) 362-2736.
