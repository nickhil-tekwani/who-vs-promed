The Osaka Prefectural Government sent a research paper to a U.S.
medical journal on the 1st case in Japan of a genetic mutation of
swine flu [virus] resistant to Tamiflu about a week before making the
finding public, officials said Sunday [5 Jul 2009]. "It's not that we
intentionally placed priority on the manuscript and delayed the
announcement," said Tatsuya Oshita, an official in the prefectural
government's health and medical care department. "As it turned out, we
dealt with the matter in a way that could be criticized, and we are
sorry."

The H1N1 virus resistant to Tamiflu was found in a woman in her 40s in
Osaka Prefecture on 18 Jun 2009 -- 2 weeks before the announcement --
through virus sample analysis at the Osaka Prefectural Institute of
Public Health, the officials said. A staff member of the institute
submitted a manuscript on the analysis result to the U.S. journal on
24 Jun 2009, but it had not been run in the magazine as of Sunday [5
Jul 2009], the officials said.

The prefectural government reported the case to the Health, Labor and
Welfare Ministry last Wednesday, a week after it sent the manuscript
to the U.S. journal, and held a news conference the next day to make
it public based on advice from the ministry, the officials said. The
prefectural government had said its report to the ministry was delayed
because it took some time to study the methods for examining
abnormalities in viruses.

[The oseltamivir resistant influenza virus A(H1N1)v seems to have been
detected more than 2 weeks ago in Japan. The reason for the delay in
release of this information is unclear.

Osaka in the Kansai region of the main island of Honshu can be located
