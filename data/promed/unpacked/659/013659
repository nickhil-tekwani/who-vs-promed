Outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 infection associated with a music
festival in the south west of England
Eight cases of Escherichia coli O157 phage type 2 infection and one case of
haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) have been reported among people who
attended a music festival at Glastonbury (25 to 30 June 1997 ) in the south
west of England. Seven of the eight isolates were indistinguishable in
tests carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service Laboratory of
Enteric Pathogens. Interviews with all cases have identified no common
source of food, differing use of water sources, and the fact the cases had
not camped close to each other.
The festival is held on a working dairy farm and over 500 cows grazed on
the site until a
week before the festival. The field was heavily contaminated with cattle
faeces and heavy rain from the weekend before the festival turned it into a
quagmire. Cases reported getting muddy hands and faces and being unable to
wash before eating. The cows have been sampled and the results of culture
are awaited. E. coli O157 is known to survive for more than 20 weeks (1) in
soil samples and consideration should be given to the earlier removal of
cows from festival sites. The risks of such infections and high standards
of hygiene needed to prevent them should also be brought to the attention
of people who attend open air festivals.
Glastonbury festival, which has been held each year for over 20 years was
associated with outbreaks of campylobacter infection linked to the
consumption of unpasteurised milk in the early 1990s (2).
