The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is recalling trout eggs as they may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause paralysis. No cases of disease have been reported so far, but some Imperial Caviar and Seafood and VIP Caviar Club branded containers may promote the growth of the botulism bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, according to the results of inspections carried out by the company and the federal agency.

"The symptoms are: facial paralysis or loss of facial expression, non-reactive or fixed pupils, difficulty swallowing, droopy eyelids, blurred or double vision, difficulty speaking, blurred vision. speech and a change in the sound of the voice or the hoarse voice, "says the organization in a statement.

Containers of 100 g [3.52 ounces] of Imperial Caviar and Seafood trout eggs stamped "BB 24 APR 2018", 50 g [1.76 ounces] of the same brand stamped with the same mention, and VIP Caviar Club 50 g jars stamped "BB 08 NOV 2018" must not be consumed. People who have eaten must contact their doctor. All were sold in Quebec.

The agency adds that it is conducting an investigation that could lead to further recalls.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
