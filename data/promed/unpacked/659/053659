This public health notice has been updated to include 8 additional cases that have been added to the investigation. There are now 52 cases in 4 provinces [British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec] involved in this investigation and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has updated the food recall warning to include additional information for chia seed products.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Health Canada to investigate 52 Canadian cases of salmonellosis linked to the consumption of sprouted chia seed powder. Sprouted chia seed powder is made from ground, dried sprouted chia seeds.

As a part of this investigation, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued food recall warnings for various products containing chia seeds and sprouted chia seed powder under the brands Organic Traditions, Back 2 the Garden, Intuitive Path SuperFoods, Harmonic Arts Botanical Dispensary, Naturally Organic, Pete's Gluten Free, Noorish Superfoods, MadeGood, and Dietary Express. These products have been recalled and are being removed from the marketplace due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination.

The risk to Canadians is low, but those who have bought the recalled products sold under the recalled brands should not consume these products and should consult their health professional if they suspect they have symptoms of salmonellosis.

Ongoing investigation
---------------------
In Canada, 4 serotypes of _Salmonella enterica_ causing illness have been associated with this outbreak: Newport, Hartford, Oranienburg, and Saintpaul. In total, 52 cases have been reported in British Columbia (13), Alberta (10), Ontario (26), and Quebec (3). 6 cases have been hospitalized; 5 cases have been discharged and have recovered or are recovering. The status of 1 case was not provided to the Agency. No deaths have been reported. The investigation is ongoing but currently, 37 of 39 cases that have been interviewed have reported consumption of chia seeds or sprouted chia seed powder. More information on the epidemiological investigation is also available.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are also investigating similar cases of salmonellosis, and have recalled sprouted chia seed powder products linked to their investigation.
