Bacteriological analyses have confirmed the diagnosis of anthrax in a
woman from the Western Region [oblast] of Kazakhstan. Laboratory
results on a 2nd ill person are awaited, according to a report from
the regional department of sanitary epidemiological supervision
(RSES).
On 14 Jul 2006, 2 inhabitants of the Syrymskiy district of Western
Kazakhstan were hospitalized in the regional infectious [diseases]
hospital under suspicion of anthrax. According to RSES, doctors
describe the condition of one patient as [serious] and that of the
2nd as satisfactory.
Experts assume that meat from an infected cow slaughtered without
veterinary controls could have been the source of infection.
Meanwhile a specially created investigative commission has visited Symryskiy;
7 people in contact with the 2 sick persons have been identified and are
receiving preventive treatment. [Why? Anthrax is a zoonosis, and does not pass
from person to person. Maybe they shared meat with these patients? - Mod.NP].
Also vaccinations of cattle are being carried out, [according to the]
RSES.
A total of 154 settlements are considered to have unsuccessful anthrax
[control] in Western Kazakhstan.

[Western Kazakhstan oblast borders 5 Russian regions (Astrakhan, Volgograd,
Saratov, Samara, and Orenburg) and 2 regions in the Republic of Kazakhstan
(Aktyubinsk & Atyrausk). The total area of the region is 151 300 sq km. Uralsk
is the capital of Western Kazakhstan. The major part of the oblast is located
in the Pre-Caspian Lowland - Mod.NP]
[Further details have been sought from RSES in Almaty. While livestock anthrax
is now reported at a fraction of past levels, it is still a regular performer
in the country, and where you get (silent) bovine cases you get attending
(public) human cases. - Mod.MHJ]
