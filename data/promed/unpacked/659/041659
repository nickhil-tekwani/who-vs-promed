Taipei City's Department of Health on [Mon 17 Apr 2017] warned of an enterovirus outbreak this spring [2017], and urged the public to practice good personal hygiene to prevent infection.

Enterovirus infections are common among infants and children and usually peak in spring and summer months, especially between April and June, the department said.

In Taiwan, enterovirus outbreaks occur approximately every 3 to 4 years. In 2005, the nation reported 142 cases of enterovirus infection with severe complications, in 2008 there were 373, and in 2012 a total of 153 cases were reported.

Last week alone [10-16 Apr 2017], a total of 419 patients sought out emergency treatment at hospitals for enterovirus infection, almost 70 percent higher than the average number for the previous 4 weeks, according to government data.

The Director of the city's health department Huang Shih-chieh stressed [Mon 17 Apr 2017] that enteroviruses are highly contagious, and infants and children aged below 5 are more susceptible to the infection and more at risk for severe complications.

The enteroviruses are spread from person to person by coughs, sneezes, or by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them. Therefore, practicing good personal hygiene -- washing hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water -- is the best and most important way to prevent from getting and spreading the infectious disease, the department said.

Huang also advised parents to watch for prodromal signs of severe complications in children with enterovirus infection to ensure prompt treatment, including drowsiness, fever, chills, headache, disturbed consciousness, inactivity, flaccid paralysis, myoclonic jerk, continuous vomiting, tachypnea, and tachycardia.

["Most people who are infected with non-polio enteroviruses do not get sick, or they only have mild illness, like the common cold. Infants, children, and teenagers are more likely than adults to get infected and become sick because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposures to the viruses. Adults can get infected too, but they are less likely to have symptoms, or their symptoms may be milder. Symptoms of mild illness may include:
- fever;
- runny nose, sneezing, cough;
- skin rash;
- mouth blisters;
- body and muscle aches

"Some non-polio enterovirus infections can cause:
- viral conjunctivitis;
- hand-foot-mouth disease;
- viral meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain);
- viral encephalitis (infection of the brain);
- myocarditis (infection of the heart);
- pericarditis (infection of the sac around the heart);
- acute flaccid paralysis (a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs);
- inflammatory muscle disease (slow, progressive muscle weakness)

"Infants and people with weakened immune systems have a greater chance of having these complications. People who develop myocarditis may have heart failure and require long-term care. Some people who develop encephalitis or paralysis may not fully recover.

"Newborns infected with a non-polio enterovirus may develop sepsis (the body's overwhelming response to infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death). But this is very rare."
(https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/symptoms.html)

It is also worth noting that a total of 55 deaths among infants and young children were reported in July 1998 in relation to an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease, which began in April 1998 in Taiwan. A total of 271 cases were hospitalised with serious complications (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis). 90 percent of deaths and 86 percent of hospitalised cases were below 6 years of age.

Enteroviruses, in particular EV-71, were isolated from throat and rectal swabs, stools, cerebrospinal fluid and other specimens from fatal and non-fatal cases
