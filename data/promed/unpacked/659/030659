SCRUB TYPHUS (3)
================
Re: Scrub typhus--a reply to the initial question!
Scrub typhus has been prevalent in Northern Thailand for a very long time
and is a common cause of fever there. The 1992 Institute of Medicine
Report, "Emerging Infections, Microbial Threats to Health in the United
States," defined emerging infections as "new, reemerging, or drug-resistant
infections whose incidence in humans have increased over the past two
decades or whose incidence threatens to increase in the near future."
I can envisage Rickettsia tsutsugamushi being an emerging infection in
Thailand at the present time only if there is an increase in the incidence
of drug-resistant strains.
To the best of my knowledge, this is not a problem.
