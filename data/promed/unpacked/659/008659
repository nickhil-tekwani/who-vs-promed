[According to the media statement from South Africa's Department of Agriculture, Land reform and rural development, published on 9 May 2020. This is the first time that an outbreak of ASF has been recorded in the province of Eastern Cape.

"In the past 3 years, outbreaks of ASF outside of the ASF controlled area occurred in the Free State, North West, Northern Cape, Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces. It has not yet been determined whether this outbreak in the EC is linked to the outbreaks in other provinces.

"This outbreak occurred in a communal setting, which makes movement control and biosecurity between the respective pig herds difficult. Control measures currently in place include that all infected pigs should be as far as possible from those that are not and must be housed alone to avoid contact with other pigs in the area, to limit the spread of the disease.

"The areas where the outbreak occurred have been quarantined; no pigs are allowed to move into, through or out of the area. Follow-up investigations by provincial veterinary services are underway, to determine the extent of the outbreak." (source: https://tinyurl.com/y99ubge7)

In addition to this latest African swine fever (ASF) event, since April 2019 to date (11 May 2020), South Africa continues to have 2 active events. The status of each of these events is as follows:

Event 1 started on 15 Apr 2019; 18 outbreaks have been reported. The event is still continuing. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=30214

Event 2 started on 3 Sep 2019; 1 outbreak has been reported. The event is still continuing. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=31717

These 19 outbreaks are located outside of South Africa's ASF control zone, affecting the provinces of North West, Northern Cape, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, and Free State.

The spread of ASFV is facilitated by a number of factors, including its persistence for long periods in uncooked pork products, which may be fed to pigs in food scraps ("pig swill"). According to a local media report, S. African veterinary authorities have urged farmers to pre-cook their pigs' swill for at least an hour before feeding them. https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/investigation/2281969/african-swine-fever-outbreak-reported-in-eastern-cape/. - Mod.AS
