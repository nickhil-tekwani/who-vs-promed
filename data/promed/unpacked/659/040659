Yellow dragon disease [is devastating] Colombia's citrus plantations. Citrus producers in the department of Atlantico have had to suspend the production on 1270 hectares [about 3138 acres] due to the plague and have reported losses of millions of dollars a day.

According to municipal leaders, the alternatives that the ICA [Colombian Agricultural Institute] has proposed do not respond to the needs. One of the options has been to replace the plantations with new trees, and the other one is to coexist with the vector that [transmits] the disease. Given the situation, and taking into account the high impact of the disease on the sustainability of the crops, a state of emergency and agricultural calamity must be declared.

According to the regional director of the ICA, Ovidio Rondon, last year [2018], 19 900 infected plants were eradicated in 19 municipalities [of Atlantico], 65% of which gave positive results for the disease.

The secretary of Economic Development, Anatolio Sanchez, said that they had raised the alarms and asked the national government to help them counteract the disease. "We are working with all the entities to find solutions, especially looking to give small producers access to financing so that they can implement good agricultural practices."

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods. Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause symptoms similar to greening disease in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been recorded (see ProMED-mail posts 20180214.5629251 and 20190329.6392077). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology, and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both, pathogens and vectors, can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, as well as chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Antibiotics as leaf sprays, seed treatments, or trunk injections are being used occasionally to treat citrus greening (see for example, ProMED-mail posts 20181119.6154764 and 20190320.6377319), but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal, and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

Both CaLas and _Ca._ L. americanus are spreading in South America. CaLas appears to increase at a disproportionally higher rate which is thought to be due to this species being more heat tolerant, but mixed infections have also been detected in the region. In Colombia, CaLas was reported for the 1st time in 2016 in La Guajira department (ProMED-mail post 20160209.4005503).
