was isolated from aubergines (eggplant: _Solanum melongena_)
showing mild leaf mosaic (Mansour et al., 1998).

[70 thousand metric tonnes [tmt] of cowpeas were grown in Jordan
in 1998. Other countries in the Middle East also produce cowpea
(Egypt, 560; Greece, 75; Iraq, 155; Israel, 48; Kuwait, 11; Lebanon,46;
Saudi Arabia, 68; Syria, 50; and Turkey, 850). All data are in tmt, for
the 1998 production year, and were obtained from the FAO website.
Cowpea mild mottle carlavirus is transmitted to host plants by
_Bemisia tabaci_ (whitefly) and to the next generation of plants
through seed from infected plants. The natural host range of the virus
consists of leguminous hosts (bambera groundnut, cowpea, peanut and
soybean) and solanaceous species (eggplant and tomato). What may be
important here is possible transmission from eggplant to other
solanaceous species such as potato, tobacco, etc - Mod. DH]
