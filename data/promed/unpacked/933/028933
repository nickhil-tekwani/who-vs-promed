The 1st report of 'acute myalgia' appeared in early December [2016] with an initial cluster of 4 members of a family (older father, mother, and children, 20 and 14 years old) who presented with acute pain in the trapezoidal area, back, and legs. The pain was severe enough that the mother could not walk. These patients did not exhibit fever, arthralgia, and no respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Palpation of the muscles elicited pain. Laboratory values of note: extremely elevated CK [creatine kinase] of 70 000 IU/L. 3+ myoglobinuria, and elevated AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). Normal WBCs [white blood cells ] with no bands. CRP (c-reactive protein test) was less than 5. Their urine was a "Coca-Cola" color. Blood, urine, and feces were sampled; PCR test results (in Brazil) were negative for DEN [dengue fever], CHIK [chikungunya], Zika, parechovirus, and enteroviruses. It was noted this family consumed 44 pounds of fish per month that was predominantly 2 species of marine fish: yellowtail amberjack (_Seriola lalandi_) and any of the fish in either the Serranidae and/or Gadidae families of fish. All of the family members indicated their symptoms began within 12 hours of the consumption of these fish.

The 2nd cluster was 5 more patients: a father, a mother, their son (who lived in a different house), his wife, and [her father] who all ate the same fish (as mentioned above) together. The presentation was similar to the 1st cluster, and the same samples were collected -- all were negative.

The next cluster was a boyfriend and girlfriend who traveled to the hospital from 40 miles [64.4 km] away after visiting the girlfriend's aunt. The boy and girl were admitted to the hospital and the aunt declined admission. All of them had eaten the same fish as mentioned above.

As of [24 Jan 2017], the case counts stand at 62, 34 of which exhibited myalgia and grossly elevated CK. One patient died, a 65 year old male with significant co-morbidity (cardiac insufficiency). A minority of these patients have reportedly had a fine, very light truncal rash. One patient, a 74 year old woman, ate only 2 fish and was later hospitalized. One patient denied consuming fish but ate a dish that contained byproducts of fish. There was also a physician who had consumed fish and was hospitalized. One patient had a CK of 113 000 IU/L and had acute renal failure but did not require dialysis. There is no report of ICU inundation or high demand for dialysis.

All of the patients who had eaten fish were of 1 of the 2 types of aforementioned marine fish. These patients had bought fish in different markets and consumed them in different locations.

The ongoing hypothesis continues to be Haff disease, with notable exceptions:
- this is the largest documented outbreak of Haff disease in Brazil's history;
- this may be the 1st documented outbreak of Haff disease that involved marine, as opposed to freshwater, fish; and
- the clinical finding of dramatically elevated CK values compared to prior reports of Haff disease (see https://www.cdc.gov/mmWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00056038.htm)

We thank Dr Antonio Bandeira, the physician who reported the 1st couple of case clusters for his generosity in sharing this important information with the international community.

[Dr Wilson's summary of the situation is very much appreciated, as Haff disease is always associated with ingestion of certain types of fish, which he clarified. - Mod.TG]

Health officials have reported in the state of Bahia, northeast Brazil, 64 cases of a strange myalgia that causes intense muscle pain and black urine, officials said today [7 Feb 2017].

The state medical services are investigating the still unknown causes of the outbreak of this type of acute myalgia, whose 1st case was notified on 14 Dec 12016, according to a statement from the Bahia Health Ministry.

Of the total number of patients reported with this strange condition, 60 are from Salvador, capital of Bahia, and 33 fit the definition of sudden acute myalgia, so that practically half of the patients have no clear diagnosis.

The symptoms are intense muscle pains, which affect "mainly the cervical and trapezius region" and the upper and lower limbs, in addition to the black urine, the report added.

The Government of Bahia, with the support of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, announced an international cooperation agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in the United States, to intensify the search for the cause(s) of this outbreak.

"It will be necessary to review the files and analyze the data bank built in these 2 months and, if necessary, interview the patients and health professionals who attended them," said State Health Undersecretary Roberto Badaro, quoted in the note.

Some of the samples are being analyzed by the Brazilian Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the largest center for health studies in Latin America.

[Haff disease, rhabdomyolysis after ingesting certain types of fish, was first reported in 1924 in Europe. There have been a limited number of cases reported in the United States, throughout Brazil, and more farther south. Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis can occur after eating cooked buffalo fish purchased at a suburban grocery market, or fresh from markets or the ocean. This suggests the substance responsible for rhabdomyolysis is not changed, denatured, or altered by the heat of cooking. A toxicological agent has not been identified. - Mod.TG
