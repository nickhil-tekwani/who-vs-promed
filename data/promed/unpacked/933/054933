The Mississippi baby thought to have been cured of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection has the virus again after 2 years without therapy, a finding dashing the hope that researchers had found a way to treat infants born with the disease.

The child, born to an HIV-infected mother, is now nearly 4 years old. The child was found to have detectable HIV levels in blood during a routine clinical care visit earlier this month [July 2014], according to a statement by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The levels of HIV in the blood were "not high, but not trivial, said Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID.

"This case represents important research that still provides a tremendous learning opportunity about how rapid, early treatment affects the body's response to HIV, especially in newborns," said R. J. Simonds, vice president of program innovation and policy at the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, in a statement. Besides the Mississippi baby, a child born in Los Angeles County was found to have no trace of the virus 9 months after starting anti-HIV treatment 4 hours after birth. The Los Angeles baby cannot be said to have been cured, because its treatment was never stopped.

"Obviously, as an individual patient, it's disappointing," said Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID, in a telephone interview. "But we're learning very important things. Our capability of detection isn't good enough. This reservoir is extraordinary, and we need to get better tools to measure it accurately."

The Mississippi child has resumed therapy and is doing well with no side effects, Fauci said.

[There was huge hope that the "Mississippi baby" would live a life free of HIV. Antiretroviral drugs can keep the virus in check in the bloodstream, but HIV has hiding places -- known as reservoirs -- in the gut and brain. If treatment stops, then the virus emerges from its reservoirs and begins its assault afresh. It was hoped that starting drug treatment within hours of birth would prevent the reservoirs from forming. This seems not to have been the case.

This case was never going to lead to an HIV-cure for infected adults, who begin treatment months or years after infection. The Mississippi baby has become a reminder of how difficult HIV is to defeat and how distant a cure really is.

The child, nicknamed the "Mississippi baby," did not receive any pre-natal HIV care. Because of a greater risk of infection, she was started on a powerful HIV treatment just hours after labour. She continued to receive treatment until 18 months old, when doctors could not locate her. When she returned 10 months later, no sign of infection was evident, though her mother had not given her HIV medication in the interim.

Repeated tests showed no detectable HIV virus until last week. Doctors do not yet know why the virus re-emerged. A 2nd child with HIV was given early treatment just hours after birth in Los Angeles in April 2013. Subsequent tests indicated she had completely cleared the virus, but that child also received ongoing treatment. Only one adult is currently believed to have been cured of HIV. In 2007, Timothy Ray Brown received a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation that resists HIV. He has shown no signs of infection for more than 5 years.
