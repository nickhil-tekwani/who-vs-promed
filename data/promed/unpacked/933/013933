An outbreak of _Cyclospora_ illnesses linked to fresh basil appears to be over, according to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The FDA reported 241 illnesses were involved in the outbreak, including 6 cases that required hospitalization. No deaths were reported in connection to the outbreak.

The FDA first reported the outbreak on [25 Jul 2019], the day after Siga Logistics de RL de CV, a Morelos, Mexico, company, recalled fresh basil shipped to the US. The FDA's traceback investigation "confirmed that the fresh basil available at points of sale where some consumers became ill was exported" to the US by the company.

While the outbreak appears to be over, the FDA continues to investigate, according to a [30 Sep 209] update from the FDA. Siga Logistics de RL de CV has cooperated with the investigation, ceasing production and distribution of the basil, according to the FDA.

The last onset date for _Cyclospora_ was [26 Jul 2019]

Cases were reported in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Wisconsin. Exposures were traced to restaurants in Florida, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
