False smut infestation in rice has been reported from many places in the State [of Tamil Nadu] in an alarming proportion. In Cauvery delta zone [Nagapattinam district], the disease has been reported to an extent of 10-20 percent during [the current growing] season.

Under congenial conditions like high moisture or rainfall accompanied by cloudy days during the period between flowering and maturity of grains, the development of false smut is rapid and causes considerable loss.

Yield loss is not only due to the occurrence of the smut balls but also due to increased sterility of kernels adjacent to the smut balls. The disease not only reduces the yield but also affects the quality of grains or seeds. Prominent high yielding rice varieties are found susceptible to this infestation.

[False smut of rice is caused by the fungus _Ustilaginoidea virens_. The disease can reduce yield by up to 75 percent and affects grain quality and seed germination rates. Large orange to brown-green fruiting structures on one or more grains of the mature panicle develop. Surface spores spread the disease to immature panicles, and disease development is favoured by high humidity.

The "smut balls" survive between crops in the soil. Disease management may include phytosanitation, cultural methods, fungicides, and use of resistant cultivars. The mycotoxin ustilotoxin is produced by the pathogen and may be of concern in rice products.

In Tamil Nadu (and also other areas of India), false smut outbreaks have become increasingly severe over the past decade. From the report above, it appears that resistant varieties, which are available in India, are perhaps not favoured by farmers due to lower yields, and this would make disease control more difficult.
