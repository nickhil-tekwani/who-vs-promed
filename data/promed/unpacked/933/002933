According to the Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare for the Kemerovo [oblast], 4 cases were recorded in the regional center, and one elsewhere in the Kemerovo [oblast]. Surveillance has revealed a large number of people who are not vaccinated against the disease, which creates a risk of further spread of infection. The risk of contracting measles for people who have not been immunised is 100 percent. Epidemiologists emphasize that measles is still a very dangerous disease associated with severe complications, and is sometimes fatal.

Adults up to 35 years of age who have not been vaccinated against measles, and without a history of measles, or who do not have documented information on vaccinations, should receive 2 doses of the vaccine [3 months apart]. Vaccinations for children are held in accordance with the national calendar of vaccinations: at 12 months (vaccinations) and 6 years (booster dose).

Doctors are trying to locate 200 residents of the area who were vacationing in Pattaya (Thailand) in early May [2013], in order to administer vaccines. Approximately 200 Sakhalin [oblast] residents were on vacation in Pattaya from [30 Apr 2013] to [13 May 2013]. Those who have been located are being advised to visit a clinic to be vaccinated. The disease was brought to Sakhalin by a young woman who recently returned from vacation in Thailand.

"The woman who returned from Thailand on 14 May [2013] felt unwell on the day after her return, with a cough and general weakness. Improvised treatment at home yielded no improvement, and the woman went to a clinic. Dengue fever was suspected and she was admitted to the infectious diseases ward. Subsequently, her condition was diagnosed as measles."

Measles is a rare disease for Sahkalin. A 3-year-old child in March 2012 was the most recent case of measles, the 1st case in 7 years. Epidemiologists checked the health status of all 192 passengers on the same flight from Thailand, and [tried] to determine whether they had been vaccinated or not. So far, none of the tourists have fallen ill. Today [4 Jun 2013] will be last day of the incubation period, [so if no cases are identified, we can assume that] none have been infected. The index case's family and colleagues will be [monitored] for another week.

Measles, especially in adults, can have severe complications. In accordance with the national immunization schedule, vaccination of adults up to 35 years old is free of charge. Older people, however, are required to pay.

According to Olga Kozhanova, the Head of Regional Epidemiology, special regulations have been drawn up in preparation for summer holiday camps. Kozhanova stated that vaccination against measles would be required for attendance at summer holiday camps. This is a consequence of 40 cases of the disease in both children and adults having been diagnosed in the region during the past 2 months. She stressed that lack of vaccination would prevent participation in summer holiday camps.

Measles cases in England: update to end of April 2013
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 288 cases of measles were confirmed in England with onset in April 2013, making a total of 962 cases since the start of the year. This continues the trend seen since early 2012, with monthly totals around the highest recorded levels seen since enhanced surveillance commenced in 1994. The regions most affected continued to be the north-East and the north-West, although cases have been confirmed in all regions. The age group most affected in April was 10-14 year olds (64/288, or 22 percent), consistent with the shift towards this group from the previous 4 years.

Amongst cases this year, 184 (19 percent) were associated with secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low coverage, such as the travelling community and the Orthodox Jewish community in north London. Overall, 192 (20 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital, including 26 with complications [such as] pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

Most cases in April [2013] in England that have been typed have been shown to be MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12/[D8]. This strain differs from the D8 genotype currently circulating in Wales (MVs/Swansea.GBR/4.13/).

The shift in cases towards secondary school age groups in 2013 is likely to be explained by the fall in coverage of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] that occurred between 1999 and 2005. To reduce the risk of larger outbreaks of measles in the next academic year, Public Health England, the Department of Health and NHS [National Health Service] England announced an MMR catch-up programme in late April [2013]. The campaign is targeted at children aged between 10 and 16 years who have a record of none or incomplete MMR vaccination. Invitations will be sent through letters from general practices, from the Child Health Information Systems or through schools. A flyer suitable for both schools and GPs, "Measles: Don't let your child catch it," is available online or to order as hard copies. It is expected that most vaccines will be conducted in primary care, although in some areas, such as the north-East, schools campaigns have been conducted in response to local outbreaks.

Measles has claimed the lives of 10 more children in Pakistan's Punjab province over the past 2 days, taking the toll in an outbreak of the disease to 148. Since the outbreak in the province a month ago [around 6 May 2013], 3 to 5 children have been dying of measles every day. According to a spokesman of the Health Department, the death toll in Lahore alone is 80. Since Thursday [6 Jun 2013], 3 children succumbed to the disease in Lahore, 2 each in Faisalabad and Hafizabad districts, and one each in Toba Tek Singh, Mandi Bahauddin, and Gujranwala.

At least 195 more cases of measles were reported in Punjab, including 19 in Lahore on Friday [7 Jun 2013], the spokesman said.

The failure to launch an immunisation campaign against measles and the failure to purchase the vaccine were said to be the main reasons for the outbreak. After assuming charge, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif held a meeting on Friday [7 Jun 2013] to review the outbreak and approved an action plan to protect children against the disease and called for a vigorous campaign against the disease. "All steps will be taken on an emergency basis to save children, and I will personally review the situation every week, while the Chief Secretary will hold a meeting every day," Mr Sharif said. He directed officials to speed up the process of buying vaccines without waiting for support from international donors.

A total of 2 rare cases of measles have been diagnosed in south suburban Denver, and the 2nd infected individual may have exposed other people after visiting several public places in Lone Tree, Centennial, Cherry Hills Village, Highlands Ranch and Littleton. A Sky Ridge Medical Center doctor diagnosed the 1st case of measles in a patient there in late May [2013]. The 2nd individual, who was exposed to the 1st man, tested positive for the virus on [4 Jun 2013]. During the infectious phase, the 2nd person visited the following places, potentially exposing unvaccinated individuals:
- Lone Tree Medical Plaza, 9695 S. Yosemite St., Lone Tree, between [3 and 6 Jun 2013]
- Kent Denver School's middle school graduation at the Anschutz Theatre, 4000 E. Quincy Ave., Cherry Hills Village, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. [3 Jun 2013]
- Hodsons Bar & Grill, 6851 S. Gaylord St., Centennial, from 12:30 to 3:30 p.m. [3 Jun 2013]
- Christ Lutheran Church, 8997 S. Broadway, Highlands Ranch, from 6 to 9 p.m. [3 Jun 2013]
- Highlands Ranch Orthodontics, 1420 W. Canal Court, Littleton, from 3 to 5:30 p.m. [5 Jun 2013]

90 percent of US citizens are vaccinated against measles, and Sky Ridge chief medical officer Dr. David Markenson said "there isn't really a risk" for that vast majority of the population. "Unfortunately, vaccination coverage levels in Colorado are not as high as we would like them to be," said state epidemiologist Dr. Lisa Miller. "With a 2nd case of measles and fairly wide exposure, we could be seeing additional cases of measles in our community. Now is the time to check your immunizations and make sure you and your family are protected."

The 1st case was diagnosed in a man who traveled to Denver from India, seeking treatment at Sky Ridge. The man was admitted for several days, and Markenson said Sky Ridge took "symptom-based precautions" during his stay. Sky Ridge informed not only the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, but staff and many patients at the hospital [from 25 to 27 May 2013], he said. Visitors to the hospital during those dates may also have been exposed. Those who suspect they may have measles are urged to call a health-care provider before going to a medical office or emergency room.

Western Pacific Region

[9] MMWR: progress report
Date: Fri 7 Jun 2013

Progress toward measles elimination -- Western Pacific Region, 2009-2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2005, the WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific Region (WPR) resolved that WPR should aim to eliminate measles by 2012. The recommended measles elimination strategies in WPR include 1) achieving and maintaining high (at least 95 percent) coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) through routine immunization services and by implementing supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), when required; 2) conducting high-quality, case-based measles surveillance; 3) ensuring high-quality laboratory surveillance, with timely and accurate testing of specimens to confirm or discard suspected cases and detect measles virus for genotyping and molecular analysis; and 4) establishing and maintaining measles outbreak preparedness for rapid response and ensuring appropriate case management. This report updates the previous report and describes progress toward eliminating measles in WPR during 2009-2012. During this period, measles incidence reached a historic low, decreasing by 83 percent, from 34.0 to 5.9 cases per million population. However, to achieve measles elimination in WPR, additional efforts are needed to strengthen routine immunization services in countries and areas with less than 95 percent coverage with the routine 1st (MCV1) or 2nd dose of MCV (MCV2), to introduce a MCV2 dose in the 4 remaining countries and areas that do not yet have a routine 2-dose MCV schedule, and to use SIAs to close immunity gaps among measles-susceptible populations in countries and areas that have ongoing measles virus transmission.

Immunization activities
-----------------------
Annual data on MCV coverage are reported from 36 of the 37 WPR countries and areas to WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). MCV1 coverage in WPR increased from 96 percent in 2009 to 98 percent in 2012. The number of countries with at least 95 percent MCV1 coverage increased from 12 (33 percent) in 2009 to 15 (42 percent) in 2012. MCV1 was administered at 8 months in one (3 percent), at age 9 months in 6 (17 percent), at age 10 months in one (3 percent), at age 12 months in 24 (67 percent), and at age over 12 months in 4 (11 percent).

The number of countries and areas that provide routine MCV2 increased from 32 (89 percent) in 2009 to 33 (92 percent) in 2012, and the number reporting at least 95 percent MCV2 coverage increased from 10 (28 percent) in 2009 to 11 (31 percent) in 2012. Among the 33 countries and areas reporting MCV2 coverage in 2012, the scheduled age of MCV2 administration ranged from 12 months to 7 years. During 2009-2012, approximately 226 million children were vaccinated during 16 measles SIAs; of these, 7 (44 percent) SIAs included rubella vaccine, and 10 (63 percent) added at least one other child health intervention.

Surveillance activities
-----------------------
During 2009-2012, measles case-based surveillance was conducted in all 37 WPR countries and areas, including 14 countries and 2 areas that report data individually, and 21 countries and areas of the Pacific Islands that report data as one epidemiologic block. Measles surveillance data are reported monthly to WHO and supported by 385 laboratories participating in the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network. Suspected measles cases were confirmed based on laboratory findings, an epidemiologic link, or clinical criteria. Key indicators of surveillance performance include 1) the number of suspected measles cases discarded as non measles (target: at least 2 per 100 000 population); 2) the proportion of 2nd-level administrative units with at least one non measles discarded case per 100 000 population (target: at least 80 percent); 3) the percentage of suspected measles cases with adequate investigation that includes all essential data elements (target: at least 80 percent); 4) the percentage of suspected measles cases with adequate specimens collected within 28 days of rash onset (target: at least 80 percent, excludes epidemiologically linked cases) (5); and 5) the percentage of specimens with laboratory results available within 7 days after receipt in the laboratory (target: at least 80 percent). The number of countries and areas with adequate data that met the target for suspected cases discarded as non measles per 100 000 population increased from 7 (50 percent) of 14 in 2009 to 9 (64 percent) of 14 in 2012. From 2009 to 2012, suspected cases with adequate investigations increased from 38 percent to 89 percent, suspected cases with adequate specimens collected for laboratory testing increased from 79 percent to 93 percent, and the proportion of blood specimens received by the laboratory with results available within 7 days increased from 55 percent to 96 percent.

Measles Disease Incidence and Measles Virus Genotypes
-----------------------------------------------------
From 2009 to 2012, confirmed measles cases decreased 84 percent, from 54 291 to 8524, and confirmed measles incidence per million population decreased 83 percent, from 34.0 to 5.9. In 2012, the highest confirmed measles incidence was reported from Malaysia (63.7 per million), the Philippines (15.9 per million), and New Zealand (12.3 per million). The highest number of confirmed cases was reported from China and decreased 88 percent, from 52 461 in 2009 to 6183 in 2012. During 2009-2012, the predominant measles virus genotypes detected in WPR were H1 in China, D9 in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore; and D8 in Malaysia. Other measles virus genotypes that were identified and determined to have been related to measles virus importations from outside WPR included B3, D4, and G3.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
In 2012, the WPR Regional Committee reaffirmed its commitment to eliminate measles and urged member states to interrupt all residual endemic measles virus transmission as rapidly as possible. To achieve elimination, intensified efforts are needed to identify and close gaps in population immunity, by increasing coverage with MCV2 to at least 95 percent in all countries and areas and by conducting high-quality SIAs in countries with sustained measles virus transmission (e.g., China, Malaysia, and the Philippines). In countries and areas with less than 95 percent MCV1 or MCV2 coverage, urgent action is needed to strengthen routine immunization services and to identify and implement targeted SIAs for measles-susceptible populations. In the 4 remaining countries and areas (Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu) that do not provide MCV2 in the routine childhood vaccination schedule, strategies are needed to increase MCV1 coverage, conduct periodic SIAs to provide a 2nd opportunity for all birth cohorts to receive MCV, and prepare for introduction of routine MCV2.

The WPR Guidelines on Verification of Measles Elimination were finalized in March 2013; progress toward measles elimination in WPR will be monitored by the Regional Verification Commission through annual progress reports from each country or area and from the Pacific Islands countries and areas reporting as one epidemiologic block. High-quality case-based measles surveillance is critical to the verification process. Despite overall improvement in measles surveillance performance, gaps persist, as reflected by the low proportion of 2nd-level administrative units with one or more non measles discarded case per 100 000 population. Additionally, incomplete investigations of suspected measles cases in some countries challenge efforts to rapidly identify and respond to outbreaks and to measure and document progress toward elimination. For example, in Viet Nam, only 6 (0.8 percent) of the 771 suspected measles cases with specimens available for testing reported in 2012 were laboratory confirmed. However, 631 additional cases did not have specimens collected but were reported as clinically confirmed measles. The sensitivity of the measles surveillance system in other countries with discarded non measles reporting rates of less than 2 per 100 000 population might be insufficient to rapidly detect and respond to outbreaks or to meet verification criteria.

The WHO Global Vaccine Action Plan calls for the elimination of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in 5 of the 6 WHO regions by 2020. In April 2012, the Measles and Rubella Initiative launched the 2012-2020 Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan to integrate rubella with measles elimination efforts. Rubella-containing vaccine is not provided in 6 WPR countries and areas; 5 of these countries (Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vietnam) are eligible for financial support offered by the GAVI Alliance to conduct a wide-age-range SIA using combined measles-rubella vaccine followed by the introduction of rubella vaccine in their national routine immunization programs. In addition to contributing to rubella elimination, these SIAs would provide a unique opportunity to boost population immunity to measles and contribute momentum to achieve and sustain measles elimination in WPR.

[The WHO Regional Committee for the Western Pacific Region (WPR) has resolved to eliminate measles by 2012. Substantial progress had been made in reducing the burden from measles by most countries in the region by 2008. The number of reported measles cases in WPR (excluding China) decreased 86 percent, from 106 172 (255.6 per million population) in 2000 to 14 724 (32.6 per million population) in 2008.

This report updates the previous report that summarized progress during 1990-2008 and describes progress toward measles elimination in WPR during 2009-2012. During this period, measles incidence in the region reached a historic low, decreasing by 83 percent, from 34.0 to 5.9 cases per million population. In China, a nationwide measles vaccination campaign was implemented in 2010 and reported confirmed measles cases decreased 88 percent, from 52 461 in 2009 to 6183 in 2012.

Despite the progress to date, achieving measles elimination in WPR will require additional efforts. These include 1) introducing a routine 2nd dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) in the 4 remaining countries and areas that do not yet have a routine 2-dose MCV schedule; 2) strengthening routine immunization services in countries and areas with less than 95 percent coverage with the routine 1st or 2nd dose of MCV; and 3) closing immunity gaps through supplementary immunization activities in measles-susceptible populations in countries and areas that have ongoing measles virus transmission. - Mod.CP]

Queensland Health has confirmed a man in his 20s has been diagnosed with measles in Cairns in the state's far north. It is believed the man visited the Cairns 24-hour Medical Centre on Sunday [2 Jun 2013] and the Woree Family Medical Centre on Tuesday [4 Jun 2013]. He also visited the Cairns Central shopping centre and cinemas last Friday night [31 May 2013].

Cairns public health service registrar Dr Trent Yarwood says anyone who develops symptoms should seek medical treatment. "If anybody develops an illness that starts off with symptoms like a bad cold with a very sore throat, and possibly sore eyes and high fevers, and then comes out in a rash, preferably should let their doctor know by phone rather than just going in," he said.

"If people who do have measles go to the waiting room they could potentially expose more people." Queensland Health is also trying to locate other residents who may have been exposed to measles. Authorities believe the man may have caught the virus on a recent trip to Asia.
