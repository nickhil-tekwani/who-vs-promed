Massive fireblight outbreaks
----------------------------
In some Vorarlberg apple orchards, every tree has been affected by fireblight. On average, about 20 sites of infection per tree have been noted. Several pear orchards in the state have also been seriously affected, with up to 50 per cent of trees infected and around 10 per cent with multiple infection sites.

Treatments with agrochemicals or biocontrol agents did not have any effect and there may be no harvested product at all in some of the locations. Sanitation pruning of affected branches has started but will take a long time.

It is suspected that the pome fruit varieties in the affected orchards all flowered around the same time around end of April 2015 when there was strong bee activity. Other pome varieties in the state appear to have been spared due to inclement weather with little insect flight at the times of their earlier or later flowering.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators, as in the report above), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.
