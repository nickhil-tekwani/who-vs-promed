Over a year and a half [ago] bacterial leaf streak was first discovered in the U.S. in Nebraska cornfields [ProMED-mail post 20160906.4467551]. It's [since] been confirmed in 8 other states.

UNL [University of Nebraska-Lincoln] studies over the 2016 and 2017 seasons identified new hosts for the disease. Oats and rice both showed symptoms [in a] greenhouse environment, also [several grass species]. These species were tested in a field near infected corn, and [two grasses] were found susceptible. Oats planted as a cover crop, if in a rotation with corn, can act as a source of inoculum and a place to survive over winter. Weeds can also act as hosts. Prairie grasses [for] feed could serve as a reservoir [but] it's unclear how susceptible they are.

UNL is also working with [other institutions] to research how the disease overwinters, to determine whether the bacteria can be transmitted via seed [and] to evaluate available corn germplasm lines for susceptibility to the disease.

[_Xanthomonas vasicola_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _vasculorum_ (Xvv) has primarily been reported as a pathogen of sugarcane to cause gumming disease. Gumming is considered one of the most serious diseases of this crop in many countries and was one of the first plant diseases proven to be of bacterial aetiology. Xvv leaf streak on maize was previously only known from South Africa, where it has been associated with inoculum from crop residue, overhead irrigation and warm temperatures, but impacts on yield were often minimal. Molecular analysis, including sequencing, has shown a difference in sugarcane and maize infecting strains of Xvv (see links below). It is not clear if maize infecting strains have emerged naturally, or if intensified agricultural systems may have favoured their evolution.

_Xanthomonas_ pathogens cause a range of important crop diseases, including bacterial blight of banana and rice, citrus canker and black rot of brassica vegetables (see previous ProMED-posts in the archives). They can survive between seasons on volunteer crop plants or plant debris. They can be seed borne, depending on the host, and they can be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water and mechanical means (including human and insect activity). Disease management is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds) and use of resistant crop varieties. Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
