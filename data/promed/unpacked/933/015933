At least 13 Israelis are hospitalized in critical condition with
swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus infection], including 5
children, and at least 4 Israelis have died from swine flu in recent
weeks, according to the Health Ministry.

On 10 Jan 2011, a 6-year-old-girl became what seemed to be the 4th
victim of the flu when she died at the Assaf Harofe Medical Center,
Israel Radio reported. Her death was probably due to complications
related to swine flu, doctors said.

Some 8000 Israelis have reported symptoms of swine flu already this
winter [2010-2011], the Ministry said. About 15 percent of Israel's
general population [circa 7.5 million], and a little more than half
of those in the high-risk categories have been vaccinated, the
Jerusalem Post reported.

To date, 28 patients have been hospitalized in serious condition as a
consequence of the outbreak [of influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus
infection] and 4 have died. Beginning next week [week of 16 Jan 2011]
doctors are expected to petition the High Court because of shortage
of beds. Of the 28 hospitalised patients, 24 are on respirators and 3
are in serious condition. 4 patients are reported to have died [as a
result of influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus infection]. "I do not
remember we had such a situation [previously]," stated Dr Eyal Porat,
director of Cardiac Surgery at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva.

3 days ago the number of patients in intensive care was 23, including
19 on respirators. However on the basis of current data the Ministry
of Health has concluded that the outbreak had peaked. 3 of the
patients on respirators have now been transferred to Beilinson
hospital which has facilities to undertake ECMO [extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation]. Dr Porat explained that influenza infection
affects gas exchange in the lungs and the ECMO procedure facilitates
oxygenation of the blood. It is a complex procedure requiring a
dedicated team at the Beilinson hospital and for transfer of the
patients from other hospitals. During Tuesday and Wednesday [11,12
Jan 2011] several other hospitals sought ECMO treatment for their
patients at Beilinson hospital.

"This case certainly an unusual situation, because 3 of the younger
patients with no perceptible risk factors were among these severely
affected patients, said Dr Porath. "Last year we encountered such
morbidity only among those who had serious underlying health
problems. This year it's different." According to the hospital, their
chances of recovery are over 50 percent, but "without ECMO they had
no chance of recovery."

[ProMED-mail no longer routinely posts individual country data, but
as Israel was omitted from the most recent WHO update, these reports
are posted to remedy this omission.

The information above suggests that the influenza outbreak in Israel
is having more severe consequences than in most countries in the
Northern Hemisphere. However, the vaccination uptake has been low.
