Equine Influenza: Vaccinations Begin
----------------------------------------
According to information from the New South Wales (NSW) and
Queensland, Australia, governments, vaccination has begun in specific
areas to try and contain the outbreak of equine influenza in that country.
As of 28 Sep 2007, New South Wales reported 2 653 infected
properties, 323 dangerous contact properties, and 356 suspect properties.
As of 20 Sep 2007, Queensland reported 440 infected properties.
Equine influenza is reported as still contained to the "Red Zone" in
the state's southeast region, which borders New South Wales.
The government's vaccination program to assist in containment and
eradication starts today (29 Sep 2007) in New South Wales and
Queensland. In New South Wales, about 300 horses in a 10km [6.2-mile]
wide strip just north of Mittagong will be the first vaccinated as
part of the "buffer zone" phase in the campaign to eradicate horse flu.
The Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries
Biosecurity Chief Veterinary Officer Ron Glanville said the original
strategy of establishing a series of smaller buffer zones had been
revised after a number of outbreaks in new locations in South East
Queensland were confirmed earlier this week [24-28 Sep 2007].
"In the first shipment of vaccination vials, Queensland has been
allocated 9240 vaccination shots," he said. "Vaccination will be
targeted in very specific areas. We are not planning a general
vaccination of horses in the Red Zone in the short term. We are
conscious that many horse owners desire immediate vaccination of
their animals, but initial supplies are limited and the priority
distribution of the vaccine is being determined in consultation with
horse industries.
"The 1st priority will be those large groups of horses that make a
significant contribution to the economy and people's livelihoods," he
added. "This means racing precincts, spelling farms and other
locations where high performance horses are kept. All vaccinations
will be delivered by private veterinarians trained by DPI&F."
New South Wales government press releases stated that while there
were additional infected properties from Thursday to Friday (27-28
Sep 2007), the new properties are still occurring within existing Red
and Purple Zones, which is where influenza is known to exist. Further
cases are predicted to occur around existing infected properties and
suspect properties, where there are very high horse densities. The
press releases said adjustments in zone interfaces have been made and
will continue as cases are further monitored and resolved.
"We are considering an expansion of the green zone and for conversion
of some red areas to purple zones," noted the press release. "The
disease containment situation remains encouraging and there is still
reason to be optimistic about the prospects for eradication, although
a sustained response effort will be required over the next 6 or more
months to achieve this goal. Epidemiologists are continuing to trace
the epidemiology of the outbreak to determine source and potential
disease spread of outlying infected properties."
Many Australian horse owners have asked questions to the government
about vaccination, following are those questions and answers:
Now the vaccine is available, why not vaccinate everything?
Vaccination is not 100 percent effective. Horse populations that are
vaccinated still have epidemics because the viral strains change and
vaccines do not stop a horse from being infected or stop virus
excretion. The horses that originally brought the virus into the
country were vaccinated.
If the major cost of EI is to racing, why not just vaccinate the racehorses?
Vaccinating only the racehorses is not going to protect the racing
industry from outbreaks that stop racing. In Australia only 20
percent of horses are in the racing sector. If it was voluntary for
the remaining 80 percent of all horses to be vaccinated, we could not
be sure that they were effectively vaccinated.
The vaccine contains a live virus -- will my horse get influenza
because of the vaccination?
The vaccine contains genetically modified canary pox virus. It does
not survive in the horse, but produces enough components of the
equine influenza virus to produce an immune response against equine
influenza. The vaccine will not produce equine influenza disease.
The disease seems to last for about a week; how long is my horse
infective for other horses?
Tests on infected horses that have been monitored every day indicate
that horses excrete virus for up to 3 weeks after infection. This
means that excellent personal biosecurity has to be maintained even
when the horses seem to have recovered. We cannot afford any
continuation of infection. The disease is now burning out in the
first areas affected -- let's keep up the control effort.

Following a meeting last night with Victoria's Chief Veterinary
Officer, Dr. Hugh Millar, Harness Racing Victoria (HRV) has been
advised that it won't be permitted to vaccinate its racehorse and
breeding population against Equine Influenza (EI) in the foreseeable future.
Dr. Millar advised that the National Management Group (NMG) on the EI
outbreak remained committed to eradicating the disease from
Australia's equine population and whilst this was the case mass
vaccinations amongst all breeds would not occur.
"Dr Millar advised that the national policy was still to contain and
eradicate the disease from the equine population and as such the
primary aim of vaccination was to do this through the creation of
buffer or containment zones," HRV Chief Executive, John Anderson, said.
"Until such time as there is a policy change from the NMG and state
veterinary officers and they decide that the disease cannot be
eradicated and is here to stay forever, then we have been informed
there will be no mass vaccinations of the equine population.
"The first batch of 20 000 vaccines will arrive on Thursday [27 Sep
2007] and the absolute majority of these will be used to create these
buffer zones in New South Wales and Queensland.
"Racing Victoria have been promised 1500 vials to vaccinate selected
horses as an insurance policy for the Spring Carnival, however they
requested 14 000 vaccines and were knocked back because the priority
remains the containment and eradication of EI north of the border."
The initial shipment of 20 000 vaccines from France will be followed
by a further 30 000 next week [1-5 Oct 2007] and an additional 100
000 at a yet to be determined date. All have been ordered with the
primary objective of eradicating EI from New South Wales and Queensland.
Dr. Millar advised that the Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
would not be accepting horses into Victoria from New South Wales or
Queensland for the foreseeable future, irrespective of whether they
have been vaccinated or not during the containment exercise.
Dr. Millar also implored harness racing participants to remain
vigilant despite Victoria having no reported cases of EI and
encouraged horse owners and trainers to contact the DPI immediately
if their horse was showing signs of a respiratory illness. The DPI EI
hotline is 1 800 678 779.

[Clearly the Australian government is interested in containment and
eradication of this disease. However, given the rapid spread of the
disease it would seem prudent on the government's part to be ordering
substantially more vaccine.
In addition to disease eradication economics seems to play on the
mind of most government officials. The racing industry has surely
entered into that equation. At least, one would hope so. - Mod.TG]
