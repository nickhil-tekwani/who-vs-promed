A veterinarian at an animal hospital in Japan's Miyazaki prefecture was tired with fever in August 2018 and went into hospital after she treated a cat with poor health. The cat was diagnosed with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS] by the veterinary school at Miyazaki University. The referral hospital identified SFTS virus in the vet's blood sample. The vet recovered from the disease and left the hospital.

Additionally, a veterinary nurse from the same animal hospital was also tired with fever and visited a medical clinic after treating the same cat. Her blood sample was also positive for the SFTS virus. She recovered from her symptoms after several days.

Japan has suffered from cat and human cases of SFTS for some while. Last year [2017], the country reported the world's 1st case of SFTS caused by a dog. The disease is potentially fatal for humans.

[SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, the 2 affected individuals acquired their infections directly from the SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in this instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned.

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
