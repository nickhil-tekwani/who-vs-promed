A 22-year-old youth from Jodhpur who is suffering from viral
encephalitis has been brought to a city hospital. Doctors said his
condition is critical and samples of his blood have been sent to the
National Institute of Virology [NIV], Pune.

Doctors at the Sterling Hospital said this is the 4th case of viral
encephalitis from Jodhpur, Rajasthan, in the hospital. The youth is
suffering from high fever, vomiting, and head ache, and also fell
unconscious. The test carried out on the cerebral spinal fluid shows
inflammation in the brain due to the virus [infection]. There is a
possibility of a viral outbreak in the district of Rajasthan. "We have
collected his samples and have sent them to NIV to find out which
virus is affecting him," said infectious diseases consultant Dr Atul
Patel. He said that ascertaining the kind of virus is important as a
viral encephalitis outbreak in Bangladesh has claimed 29 lives.
Earlier, there were reports of viral encephalitis fever in Chhota
Udepur [Gujarat state], which claimed 2 lives.

Neurophysician Dr Sudhir Shah said he has seen 4-5 cases from the
same area in the past and had also spoken to local physicians about
the possibility of a viral outbreak. "A young girl with viral allergy
has also been taken to a hospital and earlier too, there were cases of
viral encephalitis," said Dr Shah.

[An outbreak of encephalitis in Gujarat in mid-August (2010) was
later confirmed as due to infection by Chandipura virus. The outbreak
in Bangladesh mentioned above was confirmed subsequently as due to
Nipah virus infections. This is the season for Nipah virus
transmission from giant fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_).

It will be interesting to see what the National Institute of Virology
in Pune comes up with in these Jodhpur cases. ProMED-mail would
appreciate receiving information about the laboratory test results
when they become available.
