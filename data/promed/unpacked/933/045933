The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) has confirmed 640 human cases of West Nile illness in Texas this year [2012], including 23 deaths. The deaths occurred in the following counties: Bell (1), Concho (1), Dallas (10), Denton (1), Ellis (1), Gregg (1), Harris (1), McLennan (1), Tarrant (3), Travis (1), Wharton (1), and Williamson (1).

West Nile is a mosquito borne virus. There are 2 forms of the illness, West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WNND) and West Nile fever (WN fever). The symptoms of severe infection from West Nile neuroinvasive disease include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. West Nile fever is the milder form of the illness. Symptoms include fever, headache, body aches, and occasionally a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph glands.

DSHS reminds Texans to reduce the risk of exposure by eliminating standing water and other mosquito breeding areas; making sure door, porch, and window screens are in good condition; and using a repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus or IR3535 when outdoors.

[Spraying around the Dallas area, a focus of West Nile virus (WNV) infections, began over a week ago to reduce vector mosquito populations. In addition to aerial spraying efforts in Dallas County, state health officials are urging people to protect themselves by using insect repellent and draining standing water, which can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes. There are no commercially available vaccines for WNV human use, although equine vaccines are available.
