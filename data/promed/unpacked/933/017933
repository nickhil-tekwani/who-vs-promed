The Assistant Director of Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation, Dr Liu
Kwei-kin, said at a briefing yesterday, one fecal sample from a dead
chicken at Cheung Sha Wan Poultry Wholesale Market had tested positive for
the H5 avian flu virus on Thursday.
The sample came from 1 of 14 dead chickens picked for testing 3 days
earlier, when they arrived from the mainland with 90 000 other live birds.
Dr Liu pointed out the H5 virus could mutate into a number of similar
viruses and some may affect humans.
"In this case we just isolated the virus and it is still too early to say
how it will behave," he said. Further analysis, including gene sequencing,
was required to determine the specific type in this case and the results
would not be known for one or 2 weeks.
Dr Liu stressed there had been no abnormal chicken deaths at retail or
wholesale markets and no sign of sickness among chickens in general. "It is
a fact that avian flu exists in the natural environment. The set of
comprehensive measures are not designed to achieve a virus-free
environment," he said.
These measures include the creation of a comprehensive set of surveillance
and preventive programs to cover all levels of the trade from farms to
retail markets, as well as the introduction of a monthly "rest day" in
markets for cleaning.
"Our aim is to detect the existence of the avian flu virus at an early
stage to prevent it from re-assorting to a type that could affect humans,"
he said. The present virus testing system for imported animals at border
control reportedly requires 7 days before the results are known. A more
expensive but quicker method of testing is said to be available, returning
results in less than a day.
Assistant Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene Dr Gloria Tam Lai-fun
said SAR [Hong Kong authorities had notified mainland [China counterparts
following the discovery. "We have informed their animal import and export
quarantine authorities, who have since gone to the farm where the dead
chicken came from for further investigations," she said. "In the meantime,
we have requested them not to [export any more live chickens from that
farm into Hong Kong until further notice."
The sale of live chickens resumed last month after being suspended for 3
weeks following an outbreak of the H5N1 flu virus and the slaughter of 1.37
million birds in May [2001. A compensation and loan package to the poultry
industry cost the Government $245 million [US$1 = 7.8 Hong Kong dollars -
Mod.JW.
In the retail markets, there is a quota imposed on the number of live
chickens that can be housed together on 1 shelf. However, this is not the
case at the wholesale market, where crowded boxes of live chickens are
stacked on top of each other and there are no racks available to collect
the feces.
