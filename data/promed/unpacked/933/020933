Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update 22 Jun 2014
------------------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
Between 16 and 18 Jun 2014, a total of 3 new cases and 3 deaths were reported from Gueckedou (3 cases and 0 death), Telimele (0 case and 2 deaths), and Boffa (0 cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Guinea to 390 (258 confirmed, 88 probable, and 44 suspected) and 267 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Conakry, 64 cases and 33 deaths; Gueckedou, 227 cases and 173 deaths; Macenta, 41 cases and 28 deaths; Dabola, 4 cases and 4 deaths; Kissidougou, 8 cases and 5 deaths; Dinguiraye, 1 case and 1 death; Telimele, 26 cases and 10 deaths; Boffa, 18 cases and 12 deaths; and Kouroussa, 1 case and 1 death; 16 patients are currently in EVD Treatment Centres in Conakry (4), Gueckedou (11), and Telimele (1).

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 1253 and are distributed as follows: Conakry, 246; Gueckedou, 527; Macenta, 52; Telimele, 118; Dubreka, 118; Kouroussa, 16; and Boffa, 176. So far 70.1 percent 2950/4203 (70 percent) of the contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period. [Presumably without any sign of infection. It would be important to get blood samples from some of these -- if possible -- to get an idea of the subclinical infection rate. - Mod.JW]

Sierra Leone
------------
Between 15 and 17 Jun 2014, a total of 39 new cases and 8 new deaths were reported from Kailahun (34 cases and 7 deaths), Kenema (4 new cases and 1 death), and Western [Monrovia] (1 case and 0 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Sierra Leone to 136 (103 confirmed, 19 probable, and 14 suspected) and 58 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Kailahun, 128 cases and 55 deaths; Kambia, 1 case and 0 deaths; Port Loko, 2 cases and 1 death; Kenema, 4 cases and 1 death; and Western [Monrovia], 1 case and 1 death; 31 patients are currently in the EVD Treatment Centre in Kenema.

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 37 from Kailahun. Community health workers are being trained to do the follow up and contact listing is continuing in Kenema, Kailahun, Kambia, and Port Loko.

Liberia
-------
Between 16 and 19 Jun 2014, a total of 7 new cases and 1 new death were reported from Lofa (5 cases and 0 deaths) and Montserrado (2 cases and 1 death). This brings the cumulative number of cases and deaths reported from Liberia to 41 (24 confirmed, 9 probable, and 8 suspected) and 25 deaths.

The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths is as follows: Lofa, 28 cases and 14 deaths; Montserrado, 9 cases and 9 deaths; Margibi, 2 cases and 2 deaths; and Nimba, 2 cases and 0 deaths; 8 patients are currently in the EVD Treatment Centres in Lofa.

The number of contacts currently being followed-up countrywide is 108 and are distributed as follows: Lofa, 95 and Montserrado, 13. So far, 108/260 (40 percent) of the contacts registered since the beginning of the outbreak) have completed the mandatory 21-day observation period.

WHO response
------------
WHO and its partners continue to provide the necessary technical expertise to the Ministries of Health to stop community and health facility transmission of the virus. This includes, among others, a high-level advocacy meeting with the governments of the 3 affected countries to enhance coordination, information management, and communication. The WHO Regional Director, in consultation with the Director General, has established a temporary function of WHO sub-regional EVD outbreak response Coordinator to directly support the affected countries. The Coordinator will be based in Conakry, Guinea. In addition, WHO is planning a high-level meeting for the Ministers of Health in the sub-region to be held 2-3 July in Accra, Ghana, with the objective of ensuring increased political commitment and cross-border collaboration for EVD response activities among the countries in the sub-region.

WHO, GOARN, and other partners are also closely supporting the Ministries of Health in deploying additional experts in the various specialities (epidemiology, social mobilization, case management, data management, and logistics, among others) to support the EVD outbreak response efforts. The next cross-border technical meeting among the 3 countries is planned for 23 Jun 2014 in Kailahun, Sierra Leone.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

Dear Partners,
Please find attached the Official Ebola situation analysis report as of end of 22 Jun 2014.

Ebola update 23 Jun 2014
------------------
- The cumulative number cases tested [as of end of 22 Jun 2014] is 299, with 156 laboratory cases of Ebola and 39 confirmed deaths;
- 47 cases are currently admitted at the Kenema Government Hospital;
- 15 cases have been discharged from the Government Hospital in Kenema after full recovery from the disease;
- more personal protective equipment, chlorine, and hand sanitizers have been sent to the Kenema treatment center for Ebola;
- Ministry of Education has postponed all BECE [Basic Education Certificate Examination] exams for the country to August 2014 so that school closure in Kailahun will not be a disadvantage to BECE students in that District.

[The regional total of figures provided to WHO as of 18 Jun 2014 in Guinea, 17 Jun 2014 in Sierra Leone & 19 Jun 2014 in Liberia stood at 530 cases (including suspect, probable, and confirmed) and 350 deaths. These are in-hospital case counts -- it is not clear how many cases and deaths are being missed outside the hospitals. But it is encouraging that 40-70 percent of contacts (original degree of contact unknown) have survived for 21 days without showing any symptoms. Many of those will have been health workers and funeral attendants; the percentage of these contacts having subclinical infection is not known.

Latest official figures as of 22 Jun 2014 reported by collaborators in Sierra Leone are 299, with 156 laboratory [confirmed] cases of Ebola and 39 confirmed deaths, an increase of 163 cases, with 53 more confirmed and a decrease of 19 confirmed deaths. WHO recognizes that all figures are subject to retrospective revision.
