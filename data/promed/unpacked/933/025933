Malaria in Rio de Janeiro: question
------------------------
Malaria vectors, usually An. albitarsis and An. aquasalis, are very
common in Brazil's Southern and Southeastern coast, which is very
humid, very warm in the summer and still boasts a reasonable
extension of Atlantic Rain Forest reserves. Autochthonous malaria,
however, is restricted to remote forested areas, never in urban
areas. The recent occurrence of four autochthonous cases in Paraty, a
very fashionable resort town, was due to the introduction of P. vivax
malaria by an Argentinian that had been hiking all over Brazil and
Venezuela.

This person had been diagnosed and treated in the nearby coastal
town of Caragua-tatuba, in the state of Sao Paulo, south from Paraty.
As he was non-adherent to the treatment and did not return for
follow-up and could not be found, he probably relapsed as he was in
Paraty, and initiated local malaria transmission, that did not go
beyond the four above mentioned cases. The news agencies, aware that
Rio de Janeiro is news, brought up the statistics regarding imported
cases, repeat: imported cases, diagnosed in Rio. The number of
imported cases in Rio, or in any large Southeastern urban area,
fluctuates every year, depending on the occurrence of malaria in the
endemic areas in the North and West-Central regions of Brazil. Evend
in the 1980s, when the number of imported cases was much higher,
there was no autochthonous malaria in Rio, apart from one or other
introduced cases.

[We are very grateful to Dr Luiz da Silva (who is moderator of
ProMED-PORT) for clarifying the four cases. We did not mean to imply
that malaria was resurging in the city of Rio de Janeiro but reported
the cases because they illustrate that the vectorial capacity is
there. We do not know if Paraty was affected by the recent spraying
campaigns against dengue fever, and would appreciate information
about this. - Mod.EP
