A quarantine has been imposed in a village in Chita region following a
suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD]. The symptoms of the
disease have been found in 230 cows and 2 pigs in the village of Srednyaya
Borzya, the Kalgan district.
There are about 700 cows and 300 pigs in the private households of the
village. No animals have died yet and 15 cows are considered to be getting
well.
However, disinfection and other preventive measures are hampered by
temperatures as low as minus 40 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit) at
night. The cold makes it easier for the disease to spread.
All the animals in the village had been vaccinated against FMD in
September-October 2005.

[The affected village is situated at latitude 51.6831, longitude 120.1078
-- on the border between Russia's East Siberian province (oblast)
Chitinskaya and China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (maps at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/14/Serednyaya.html> and
<http://map.rin.ru/cgi-bin/main_e.pl?Region=chitin>).
Laboratory confirmation of the suspected outbreak and identification of the
FMD virus (FMDV) serotype involved are urgently required. A single primary
vaccination may have conferred protection only for a limited period;
booster vaccinations are generally recommended. The possibility that the
current outbreak might have been caused by an FMDV serotype which is
different from the previous ones (Asia 1) in Siberia/Far East, should be
excluded.
No first-hand information on the FMD situation in China's provinces
bordering Russia is available. Joint investigation by Russian and Chinese
veterinaries into the reasons for the continued incidence of FMD in
boundary areas has been announced by Russian officials recently (see
20051220.3646). - Mod.AS]
