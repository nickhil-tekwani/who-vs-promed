[1] SARS-CoV-2 and gangrene, long COVID

From a dry cough to a loss of sense of smell, COVID-19 is associated with a range of unpleasant symptoms. Now, a new study has warned of another side effect being experienced by some COVID-19 patients: gangrene.

Researchers have warned that COVID-19 can cause long-term muscle and joint issues, including arthritis, gangrene, and 'COVID toes.'

An analysis of MRI scans taken of patients experiencing these symptoms suggests that the virus can trigger the body's immune system to attack itself, leading to these long-lasting rheumatological issues.

The study follows recent reports of a COVID-infected woman who had to have 3 fingers amputated in Italy after the disease ravaged her blood vessels. Other sufferers have also had to undergo amputations.

Previous studies have also found a link between coronavirus infection and muscle or joint pain, but this is the 1st time that these symptoms have been illustrated through radiological scans.

In the study, the team from Northwestern University used various imaging techniques including CT scans, MRI, and ultrasounds to visualise the causes of gangrene and other long-term muscle and joint pain in COVID-19 patients.

Dr Swati Deshmukh, who led the study, said: 'We've realised that the COVID virus can trigger the body to attack itself in different ways, which may lead to rheumatological issues that require lifelong management.

'Many patients with COVID-related musculoskeletal disorders recover, but for some individuals, their symptoms become serious, are deeply concerning to the patient, or impact their quality of life, which leads them to seek medical attention and imaging.

'That imaging allows us to see if COVID-related muscle and joint pain, for example, are not just body aches similar to what we see from the flu, but something more insidious.'

Gangrene can occur as a result of an injury, infection, or a long-term condition that affects blood circulation.

The NHS explained: 'Gangrene is a serious condition where a loss of blood supply causes body tissue to die. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers, and hands.'

In terms of how gangrene and other joint and muscle symptoms appear on radiological scans, Dr Deshmukh explained that there are several key signs to look out for. 'We might see edema and inflammatory changes of the tissues (fluid, swelling), hematomas (collections of blood), or devitalized tissue (gangrene),' she said. 'In some patients, the nerves are injured (bright, enlarged), and in others, the problem is impaired blood flow (clots).'

While the findings indicate that COVID-19 infection can trigger joint and muscle issues, the researchers highlight that the virus itself doesn't directly cause these symptoms.

Dr Deshmukh said: 'I think it's important to differentiate between what the virus causes directly and what it triggers the body to do. It's important for doctors to know what's happening in order to treat correctly.'

The study comes shortly after a COVID-infected woman had 3 fingers amputated after the disease ravaged her blood vessels.

Gruesome pictures published in a medical journal showed how the unidentified 86-year-old's digits turned black. Doctors in Italy, who had to cut off her gangrenous fingers, called her case a 'severe manifestation' of coronavirus.

Long COVID: What is it and could it be 4 different syndromes?
------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 is described as a short-term illness caused by infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Public health officials tend to say people will recover within 2 weeks or so.

However, it's become increasingly clear that this is not the case for everyone, and that the 2-week period is only the 'acute illness' phase.

The North Bristol NHS Trust's Discover project, which is studying the longer-term effects of coronavirus, found that out of a total of 110 patients given a 3-month checkup, most (74%) had at least one persistent symptom after 12 weeks. The most common were:
Excessive fatigue: 39%
Breathlessness: 39%
Insomnia: 24%
Muscle pain: 23%
Chest pain: 13%
Cough: 12%
Loss of smell: 12%
Headache, fever, joint pain, and diarrhoea: Each less than 10%

Other long-term symptoms that have been reported by COVID-19 survivors, both suspected and confirmed, anecdotally, include hearing problems, 'brain fog,' memory loss, lack of concentration, mental health problems, and hair loss.

The impact of long COVID on people who had mild illness have not been studied in depth yet.

Data from the King's College London symptom-tracking app shows that up to 500 000 people in the UK are currently suffering from the long-term effects of COVID-19.

In October [2020], scientists claimed long COVID could actually be split into 4 different syndromes.

Academics at the National Institute for Health Research -- headed up by Professor Chris Whitty -- were asked to review the limited evidence on long COVID to help both patients and doctors understand the 'phenomenon.'

Their findings warned that even children can suffer, and it can't be assumed that people who are at lower risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19 are also at low risk of lasting side effects.

Doctors cautioned some mental health problems such as anxiety and depression in 'long-haulers,' as they are known, could be [attributed] to lockdowns, as opposed to the virus itself.

The experts also claimed that the symptoms could be grouped into 4 different groups:
- Post intensive care syndrome (PICS)
- Post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS)
- Permanent organ damage (POD)
- Long-term COVID syndrome (LTCS)

[Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related coagulopathy may be the 1st clinical manifestation even in non-vasculopathic patients: the virus induces a hypercoagulable state with micro- and macroangiopathy that is often associated with worse clinical outcomes. There have been case reports of coagulopathy/vasculopathy-related changes associated with SARS-CoV2 infections (1,2). Furthermore, recent data suggest the presence of a complement-mediated microvascular injury in multiple organ systems (3). Because abnormal coagulation parameters and extremity ischemia have been shown to correlate with poor disease prognosis, understanding how to manage and treat these patients is crucial.

[2] UK: human challenge trials

The United Kingdom is set to become the 1st country in the world to deliberately expose volunteers to the novel coronavirus in a so-called human challenge study hoped to aid the development of vaccines and treatments.

Up to 90 healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 30 will be exposed to the virus in a "safe and controlled environment" during the trial, which will begin within a month, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said in a statement on Wednesday [17 Feb 2021].

The UK's clinical trials ethics body has approved the study, which will use the lowest amount of virus needed to cause an infection, BEIS said. Participants will be exposed to the original, 1st-wave strain that has been circulating in the UK since March 2020, which is of low risk in healthy young adults.

The study is also hoped to lead to a greater understanding of how the coronavirus is passed between people.

Similar studies in the past have played a critical role in the development of treatments for other diseases, including malaria, cholera and the flu.

Study promises 'unique insights'
The government has invested GBP 33.6 million (USD 46.6 million) in the research, which is being managed by the UK government's Vaccine Taskforce, Imperial College London, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, and hVIVO, a company that has pioneered viral human challenge models.

"We expect these studies to offer unique insights into how the virus works and help us understand which promising vaccines offer the best chance of preventing the infection," said Clive Dix, the interim chair of the Vaccine Taskforce.

The UK has recorded more than 4 million cases of COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Nearly 120 000 people have died nationwide, marking one of the world's worst death tolls.

Concerns are mounting as a mutation known as the Kent variant rips through the country, a development that prompted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to enforce a 3rd national lockdown on 4 Jan [2021].

But Johnson's government has won praise by moving quickly to vaccinate more than 15 million people with at least one dose of the 2 jabs currently in use in the country -- produced by Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech, respectively -- since 8 Dec [2020].

The UK's medicines regulator has also approved the use of the inoculation produced by Moderna, although supplies of that vaccine have not yet been delivered.

[Human challenge trials have a history of providing insight into diseases such as malaria and influenza. The UK trial aims to identify a suitable dose of the virus SARS-CoV-2 that could be used in future vaccine trials. But the prospect of deliberately infecting people -- even those at low risk of severe disease -- with SARS-CoV-2, a deadly pathogen that has few proven treatments, is uncharted medical and bioethical territory. Herein lies more than one ethical dilemma. Proponents of COVID-19 challenge trials have argued that they can be run safely and ethically, and that their potential to quickly identify effective vaccines outweighs the low risks to participants. On the other hand, there are questions about the safety and value of these studies, as large-scale efficacy trials involving either have delivered, or are expected to deliver, results on the various COVID-19 vaccines.

Ethically, the payoff for the challenge studies could lie in helping to test later-generation vaccines or laying the groundwork for fresh insights into the disease. In this context, it will become harder to justify them, and the risks need to be seriously evaluated.

The value of these human challenge trials at this juncture might raise more questions than provide answers. - Mod.UBA]

[3] Variants: immunity evasion
Date: Tue 16 Feb 2021

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/another-potentially-immunity-evading-sars-cov-2-variant-detected-68456


Researchers in the UK have identified a new SARS-CoV-2 variant with mutations that could allow it to evade immunity-conferring neutralizing antibodies.

Known as B.1.525, the variant was 1st detected in the UK and Nigeria in December [2020]. It's since been found in 11 other countries, including Denmark, the US, and Australia.

B.1.525 sports a handful of mutations, including one on the spike protein called E484K. This mutation is also found in variants that emerged in South Africa and Brazil and seems to help the virus evade antibodies, The Guardian reports. In addition, B.1.525 has similarities to the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant that also emerged in the UK.

"We don't yet know how well this [new] variant will spread, but if it is successful it can be presumed that immunity from any vaccine or previous infection will be blunted," Simon Clarke, an associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading in the UK, tells The Guardian.

Moderna and Pfizer are already working to develop booster shots to give vaccines an edge against the slew of new virus variants. The good news is that because many of the variants share the same mutations, new vaccine versions are likely to confer immunity to multiple versions, according to The Guardian. "This [E484K] change seems to be the key change at the moment to allow escape, so that's the one you put into the tweaked vaccine," Jonathan Stoye, a group leader at the Francis Crick Institute, tells the news outlet.

There is no evidence that B.1.525 causes more severe illness or is more transmissible, Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, says in a statement, according to Reuters.

[4] COVID-19 and blood cancer
Date: Tue 16 Feb 2021

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/covid-19-more-deadly-with-blood-than-solid-cancer-study-68459


Patients with hematologic cancers such as leukemia who are hospitalized with COVID-19 are more likely to die than are those with solid cancers who contract the infection and go to the hospital, according to an analysis posted as a preprint to In Review on 2 Feb [2021]. The researchers suggest that compromised immune responses could lead to these poor outcomes in blood cancer patients with acute COVID-19, as they found that a depletion of CD8+ T cells was associated with the highest mortality among all the participants.

"If you think about it, it makes sense. Patients with leukemia by definition have a cancer of the immune system," says Mikkael Sekeres, the chief of hematology at the University of Miami's Sylvester Cancer Center, who was not involved in the study. Corrupted bone marrow produces abnormal white blood cells, which is why people with leukemia are more susceptible to infection in the 1st place, adds Sekeres, who belongs to an American Society of Hematology research group gathering ongoing data about clinical outcomes of blood cancer patients with COVID-19.

Since early on in the pandemic, multiple studies have found that cancer patients with COVID-19 have higher mortality rates than patients without cancer, especially if the cancer is in their blood. The reason is unclear. "Maybe inadequate immune responses are part of the problem," says Santosha Vardhana, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and an author of the study.

Vardhana and colleagues wanted to learn which immune profiles correlate with a higher risk of death in cancer patients with COVID-19, and if blood cancer patients were more likely than others to have the riskiest of those profiles. They compared the mortality rates and immune profiles of blood and solid cancer patients with COVID-19 at Sloan Kettering in New York and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

They saw elevated mortality rates among hospitalized patients with blood cancer and COVID-19 compared to those with other cancers, as in the earlier studies. Among 45 blood cancer patients with COVID-19 at Sloan Kettering, for example, almost half died in the hospital compared to 20% of 39 people with solid cancer.

In a group of COVID-19 patients at Penn, more than half with blood cancer (12 of 22) died within 30 days of leaving the hospital. This was true for 1/3 (26 of 78) of those with solid cancer.

The immune profiles of these 2 groups might explain the difference, Vardhana says. Compared to COVID-19 patients with solid cancer, those with blood cancer had elevated levels of inflammatory markers that suggested a heightened immune response to the virus.

"Even when [blood cancer patients] have cleared the virus, they then seem to still have a lingering effect of COVID, so it looks more like a chronic infection," says Sheeba Irshad, an oncologist at King's College London who has also profiled the immune responses of cancer patients to COVID-19 but was not involved in this study. Irshad says that solid cancer patients with COVID-19 generally mount an immune response like that of people without cancer, whereas the immune profiles of blood cancer patients are distinctive.

A detailed analysis of the lymphocytes of 45 COVID-19 patients, conducted at Penn, supports Irshad's claim. Just like those without cancer, most solid cancer patients had a balanced complement of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells, all of which are critical for adaptive immunity to a virus. In contrast, those with blood cancer showed less B cell and CD4+ T immune cell production, indicating compromised immunity.

At Sloan Kettering, blood cancer patients with few B cells frequently died in the hospital. Solid cancer patients, on the other hand, found it easier to maintain their B cell counts and usually lived as long as they had enough CD8+ T cells. Patients who faced significant CD8+ T cell depletion, across all cancer types, died in the hospital 71% of the time, even when their B cell responses were adequate.

Vardhana notes that some chemotherapies suppress T cells, making it an open question whether COVID-19 itself or a cancer patient's chemotherapy contributes more to T cell depletion. He says he hopes to tackle this question in future research.

This study arrives as COVID-19 vaccination programs are ramping up in the United States, prompting the American Association for Cancer Research's COVID-19 and Cancer Task Force to call for cancer patients to receive priority vaccine access because having cancer is a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19. While this aligns with recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is little direct evidence of the interaction between the vaccine and cancer because many people with cancer were excluded from vaccine trials.

Vardhana argues that vaccination could be helpful for many cancer patients, though, given that both currently approved vaccines in the US generate a robust CD8+ T cell response.

"Based on the fact that we have some data to suggest that a T cell response is important and helpful, it's reasonable to get [the vaccine]," Vardhana says. Irshad is more cautious, arguing that more evidence of the specific benefits of vaccines for cancer patients is needed. Her recommendation is that everyone who cares for someone with cancer -- family members and health-care workers -- be vaccinated so that there is some degree of protection around that person.

[Researchers launched the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Research Collaborative COVID-19 Registry for Hematology in April 2020 to gather real-time data on patients with hematologic malignancies who develop COVID-19 (see <www.ashresearchcollaborative.org/s/covid-19-registry>). Now, an analysis of the data reveals that around 1/3 of patients with blood cancers who required hospitalization for COVID-19 died. Risk factors included older age, forgoing intensive treatment, and poor prognosis before infection (https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/11/2/214.2). The study concludes that patients with underlying hematologic malignancies are in fact a medically vulnerable population when it comes to complications from COVID-19 infection, including severity and mortality.

People with blood cancer are generally more vulnerable to picking up a cold, flu, or virus, and then suffering complications as a result of that infection, because they have weakened immune systems. Furthermore, the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP) study results suggest that the risk of dying from COVID-19 "appears to be heightened" in blood cancer patients on chemotherapy or those who had chemotherapy treatments within 4 weeks of infection (https://www.cancercenter.com/community/blog/2020/10/covid-blood-cancers).

As for vaccination, people with cancer (or with a history of cancer) can get some vaccines, but this depends on many factors, such as the type of vaccine, the type of cancer a person has (had), if they are still being treated for cancer, and if their immune system is working properly. Because of this, it's best to discuss with the attending physicians before getting any type of vaccine. - Mod.UBA]

In its weekly snapshot of the pandemic yesterday [Tue 16 Feb 2021], the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases and deaths continue to drop, mainly driven by steep declines in the 2 highest-burden countries, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Also, the B117 virus variant has now been detected in 94 countries spanning all 6 WHO regions, with local transmission occurring in 47.

The WHO said cases fell 16% last week compared with the previous week, with deaths declining by 10% over the same period. The 5 countries with the highest totals are the United States, Brazil, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Of those, Britain had the largest decline, with a 27% decrease, and the United States was next, with a 23% drop.

The only region seeing a case increase is the Middle East, where cases were up by 7%, though it saw a decline in deaths. Much of the increase was from a spike in Iran, where cases last week were up by 8%.

In the Americas region, cases declined by 10%, and at a briefing today [Wed 17 Feb 2021], Carissa Etienne, MBBS, MSc, the head of the WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), said though most countries are reporting drops in cases, hot spots remain, such as Honduras; border areas between Peru, Colombia, and Brazil; and some parts of the Caribbean, including the Dominican Republic.

The WHO also said more countries have reported their 1st variant cases, and many are reporting local variant transmission. Eight more reported B117 cases, raising the total to 94, with local spread under way in at least 47 nations.

Two more countries reported B1351 detections, pushing the number to 46, including at least 12 in which the variant is spreading locally. And for P1, 6 more countries confirmed their 1st cases, raising the number to 21. So far, local transmission involving P1 is reported in just 2 countries in the Americas region.

In other variant developments, German health officials said today that B117 now accounts for 22% of samples, up from 6% earlier this month [February 2021], according to the New York Times.

Also, Sweden said the B117 variant is fueling an increase in cases, and the government is seeking broader powers to impose stricter measures, according to the Washington Post. In earlier spikes, the country was reluctant to order lockdowns.

Elsewhere, Zambian researchers today detailed the country's 1st B1351 detections, which began in the middle of December [2020] and were linked to a rapid rise in cases. The team described its findings in an early online edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

The variant made up 96% of specimens tested the week of [16-23 Dec 2020], before which it hadn't been detected, and the investigators said its predominance in a small cohort of recent cases suggests it may have become the country's dominant lineage.

Other global headlines
-------------------
- British officials today [Wed 17 Feb 2021] put forward a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for global cease-fires to allow the rollout of COVID-19 vaccine, according to Reuters.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (72 306), Brazil (57 295), and France (25 018) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 491 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 16 Feb 2021 to late 17 Feb 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Russia (12 828), the UK (12 717), Czech Republic (12 668), India (12 440), Italy (12 066), and Spain (10 829). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 12.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 25.5% decrease in daily reported cases and 7.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases include over 390 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours with over 110.4 million cumulative reported cases and with over 2.43 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. The Eastern Mediterranean countries have been demonstrating decreasing case counts while the Western Pacific and African countries are increasing in reported cases. - Mod.UBA]
