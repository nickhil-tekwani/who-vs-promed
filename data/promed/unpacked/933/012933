FSIS issues public health alert for Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. raw chicken products due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and Empire Kosher Poultry, Inc. are issuing a public health alert out of an abundance of caution due to concerns about _Salmonella_ illnesses reported in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic USA that may be associated with raw chicken products. The Empire Kosher brand raw chicken items, which may include raw whole chicken, raw chicken parts, were produced and sold to consumers from September 2017 to June 2018.

On 18 Jun 2018, FSIS was notified of multiple _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- illnesses within the northeastern and mid-Atlantic USA. Working in conjunction with public health partners, FSIS determined that there is a potential link between Empire Kosher brand raw chicken products and this illness cluster. Based on available epidemiological information, multiple case-patients have been identified in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic USA, many of whom reported consumption of Empire Kosher brand chicken products. Approximately half of affected case-patients have been hospitalized due to illness with illness onset dates ranging from September 2017 to June 2018. FSIS continues to work with the company and public health partners and will provide updated information should it become available.

Consumption of food contaminated with _Salmonella_ can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to properly handle, prepare, and cook these raw chicken products. FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume chicken products that have been cooked to a temperature of 165 F [74 C]. The only way to confirm that chicken is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature (http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ). Consumers should take proper precautions when handling raw chicken products. Proper hand washing after handling raw poultry, meat and eggs can greatly reduce the risk of bacterial cross-contamination to other foods and kitchen surfaces. It is important to prevent cross-contamination from raw poultry juices by washing counter tops and sinks with hot, soapy water.

[_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_, and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5] 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. An O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens.

Salmonellosis from contaminated chicken can be largely prevented by adequate cooking and appropriate kitchen hygiene. - Mod.LL
