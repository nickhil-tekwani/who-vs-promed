["The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida _ (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and scavenger of honey bee colonies. Adult and larvae small hive beetles feed on honey bee brood, honey and pollen, thus causing brood death, fermentation of honey, and comb destruction. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honey bees to abscond. The extent of beetle-associated damage likely depends on climate conditions, among other factors. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity than in areas with lower temperatures and humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey, and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature, and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honey bee colonies of all strengths and sizes." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.05_SMALL_HIVE_BEETLE.pdf).

Photos of small hive beetles, _Aethina tumida_, can be seen at, http://entnemdept.ufl.edu/creatures/misc/bees/small_hive_beetle.htm.

With the occurrence of _Aethina tumida_ in Belize, it appears that the disease continues to spread throughout Central America. _Aethina tumida_ has also been confirmed in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.
