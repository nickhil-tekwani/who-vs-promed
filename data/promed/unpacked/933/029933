Come to Reche Canyon and you're likely to cross paths with a wild burro, hundreds of which roam parts of Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

But recently, many have started showing troubling signs, including "bubbling mouth, bubbling noses, and some respiratory illness," said Chad Cheatam, vice president of Donkeyland, a nonprofit offering sanctuary to the burros.

Cheatam added the calls have come in from various locations.

"Some were in really bad shape, laying down and wouldn't get up, and some were experiencing signs, the runny noses," Cheatam said.

So far, 17 donkeys have died, Donkeyland said, raising the specter of what happened 2 years ago, when hundreds of animals died of equine influenza.

"Unfortunately, there was a little baby we had picked up and transported to the hospital, and upon them handing him over to vet, he died in the veterinarian's arms," Cheatam said.

Dr. Paul Wan, SoCal Equine Hospital veterinary surgeon, said a virus that spreads due to the "congregation of the herd" is a possible culprit -- at least one of the deceased donkeys has tested positive for equine influenza -- but he believes there could be more to it.

"They suspect it is a virus component with a secondary bacterial [component]," Wan said.

For now, only one thing is certain: the more these animals are pushed close together, the more likely they are to be exposed.

[If these animals are at a sanctuary, then vaccination is clearly appropriate. If these are wild animals, without confinement, the situation becomes much more difficult. Perhaps the wild ones could be safely herded into an area for vaccination? However, this becomes a delicate situation, as stressing already ill animals, and the stress of a round-up, could cause additional deaths of these animals.

There are a number of equine viruses that also affect donkeys and burros.

The report indicates 17 deceased animals. Why hasn't one or more been submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory for testing?

The article mentions equine influenza. However, West Nile virus (WVN) or eastern/western equine encephalitis could also be candidates for causing the deaths since there has not been any lab work on the deceased animal. Furthermore, it seems, if possible, it would be prudent to vaccinate the remaining animals for equine influenza, eastern and western equine encephalitis, and rabies. Generally, these core vaccines come in single vaccination.

Hopefully the sanctuary will be able vaccinate their animals.

We have bait drops for some wild animal diseases. I wonder how long it will be before we have oral vaccinations for equine animals. This would definitely help the wild horse/donkey issues and prevent further herds, regardless of location, from suffering from these diseases. - Mod.TG]
