A wolf believed to be suffering from rabies injured 6 people in a village of Shahera taluka in Panchmahal district [Gujarat state]. The canine had strayed into the village and later died due to the disease. The wolf was spotted at Narsana village early on Saturday morning [29 Mar 2014] at around 7am by villagers. Forest officials said the animal looked visibly irritated and started attacking persons at the village.

A total of 6 people, who were in the farms or walking on pathways, were targeted by the wolf; 3 of the victims were injured seriously in the incident and had to be rushed to Godhra Civil Hospital for treatment, while 3 others were treated at Shahera community health centre.

[Rabies is widespread throughout India, but in the past 4 years there were only reports for Gujarat in 2012 -- the other years were blank in contrast to other Indian states. In that one year, 2012, Gujarat reported 5 outbreaks involving cattle, with a total of 34 cattle affected. Bat rabies is possible in cattle thanks to vampire bats in Latin America, but as they are not found elsewhere, we can assume that the bovine cases followed from canid bites, whether domestic or wild as in this report. In my experience, an absence of reports of an expected public health problem usually indicates a bureaucratic embarrassment. Domestic dog rabies is easily controlled via vaccination, and many countries have demonstrated success in controlling wildlife rabies through oral vaccination.

Gujarat is the westernmost Indian state bordering Pakistan; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2370363,302. Panchmahal district is in the eastern portion of this state. - Mod.MHJ]
