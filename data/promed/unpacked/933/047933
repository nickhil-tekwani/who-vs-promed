Symptoms of leaf curling, yellowing and stunting have been observed on
tomato and green pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) in glasshouses in Algeria. In
addition, large populations of whiteflies were observed. Transmission
experiments, serological tests and electron microscopy confirmed the
presence of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest).
According to the EPPO Secretariat, this is the first report of tomato
yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Algeria.
