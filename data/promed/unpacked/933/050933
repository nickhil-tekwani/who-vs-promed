SALMONELLOSIS, RAW MILK - USA (OHIO) (03)

I noted with interest the statement from the Dayton Daily News in a
ProMED-mail posting regarding salmonella in raw milk: "The same bacterial
strain found in the confirmed salmonella cases also existed in Ross and
Columbiana counties last year [2002] before the local outbreak, leading
health officials to conclude the strain found at Young's probably traveled
from one of those counties and did not originate at the dairy."
On reflection, I think that it is exceedingly unlikely for a serovar or
strain of salmonella to originate on a particular farm. It would
necessarily have had to disseminate to the farm from somewhere else, and we
would have to conclude this whether or not there were cases associated with
the same serovar in nearby counties.
This seems a trivial and pedantic point, but, based on the wording above,
the possibility of local creation seems to have been, however briefly,
under consideration. The failure to perceive that any salmonellae found on
a farm disseminated there from somewhere else arguably underlies the
failure of the United States and some other countries to mount effective
control programs against salmonellae in food-producing animals.
Good evidence exists that 2 of the most important routes of dissemination
of salmonellae are animal movement [and we do not know whether Young's farm
purchased any dairy animals from the infected premises - Mod.TG] and
contaminated feeds-in-commerce.
In Scandinavia, programs aimed at those routes of dissemination (among
other factors) seem to have had considerable success in reducing salmonella
in food animals. Yet in the USA -- and perhaps some other countries --
there are no restrictions on animal movement vis-a-vis salmonellae and no
tangible regulatory concern about salmonella pollution in livestock feeds.
At least in some states (for example, Washington State), farms with ongoing
outbreaks of serovar Newport or Typhimurium (for example) are as free to
sell and otherwise move cattle as any other farms.
Furthermore, there has been little effort by government animal health
agencies in the USA to encourage voluntary, farm-level biosecurity programs
aimed at preventing dissemination of agents such as salmonella (or foot and
mouth disease, for that matter).
How did a ceftriaxone-resistant, epidemic clone of _Salmonella newport_
(for example) manage to spread across the country in a few short years?
Certainly it did not independently spring from the quintessence on hundreds
of farms. Perhaps our rugged individualism and federalism place some
constraints on control programs that are not so much an issue in
Scandinavia, but there is room for progress if we could just agree on the
dissemination phenomenon for any and all salmonellae found on any and all
farms.

[It is difficult to assess the matter when no data are available on the
incriminated salmonella type nor on the epidemiological investigations,
which probably involved humans, animals, animal products, and the
environment. It is the the lack of these data which leaves room for
speculations and criticisms, mainly based upon the media-derived statement
that "the strain found at Young's probably travelled from one of those
counties [Ross and Columbiana] and did not originate at the dairy" . It
seems that this statement has been erroneously interpreted. I assume that
the statement is the result of epidemiological investigations on the
Young's farm, most probably excluding the involvement of infected animals
as source of infection. This assumption awaits confirmation, or otherwise,
by the investigators. Another speculation: the infection was, probably,
transmitted by humans (see also the relatively high number of infected
dairy's personnel members) which, on their part, transmitted the bacteria
to the (unpasteurized) products. Animal products can be contaminated all
along the food chain, by salmonellas or other pathogens. Such an incident
is not excluded even in the (hygiene-wise) most advanced countries; for
that reason, pasteurization has not been discontinued in any country and
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point has become a universal
management requirement.
Concluding, I would advise refraining from accusations against the relevant
public/animal health authorities before more details are available. An
early publication of the detailed, official epidemiological investigation
would be helpful. - Mod.AS]
