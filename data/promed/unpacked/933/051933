I am afraid Hans Andersson has misunderstood what I was saying.
I will put it simply.
1) We know that only beef CNS is infective in mouse assay tests.
2) We know that other tissues are, if I remember correctly, at least
many millions of times less infective than infected beef CNS if not zero
or any infectivity would have been picked up. None has been picked up.
3) Those of us that may have been infected by consumption of infected
beef *CNS* were infected before 1990. Not much we can do about it now.
4) British beef since 1990 contained no beef CNS, and since 1996 no
animals over 30 months entered the human (or any) food chain.
5) So one logically would expect nv-CJD cases to be almost entirely, if
not completely, caused by consuming infected beef CNS pre 1990.
6) So worrying about consuming British beef now, in 1997, is pretty
pointless.
>* Action was not taken in 1987. These specified offals were mainly, but not
totally, removed from the human food chain in November 1989.
>
As always, there were some minor infringements. Bearing in mind they
occurred in very small abattoirs probably accounting for under 1% of the
UK turnover and concerned trace remnants probably under 1% of the total
and reporting of BSE cattle was certainly near complete at that time we
had, even with the carelessness, over 1:10,000 and probably nearer to
1:1,000,000 lower infection pressure than before. Personally I would
regard factors of this size as a 'substantial' reduction.
>* There is no scientific evidence to show that the risk originally was "tiny".
I direct you to the marmosets who consumed very high levels of
definitely BSE contaminated feed for their lifetimes without problem as
one piece of evidence. I direct you to the comparison between scrapie
and BSE and infectivity when innoculated directly into marmoset brains
and the definite consumption of scrapie infected sheep in the UK by
humans. Of course it depends upon what you mean by 'tiny'. My view of
'tiny' is something roughly comparable to the natural level of CJD in
the human population since I have never lost any sleep over my risk of
succumbing to this disease.
>* There's no evidence that the safeguards put in place 1887-90 reduced the
risks "to a quite insignificant figure, if not indistinguishable from zero."
>
There is as yet no evidence to show that the infection rate pre-1990 was
anything but tiny. At present it accounts for about 1/10th of the cases
of CJD in the UK. I hope this will continue and indeed decline over the
coming years.
I will repeat, because it is important. Compared to the other diseases
reported here nv-CJD is a minor disease amongst minor diseases. The key
elements to protect the British public have been in place for seven
years and there is, IMHO, no more that needs to be done other than
maintain policing. I hugely symathise with those who have succumbed to
nv-CJD, and am aware that I, too, could also be a casualty since I ate
British beef pre-1990. I will not, however, lose any sleep over it.
