Professionals from the Public Health Ministry recommend the community
to eliminate mosquito breeding sites that accumulate after every
rainfall, in order to prevent the occurrence of dengue fever cases
transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_.
According to data from the Department of Entomology of the National
Service for Malaria Eradication (SENEPA, according to its Spanish
initials), the _Aedes aegypti_ larval infestation index in some
Asuncion areas is on average 4.1 percent.
The areas considered to be at risk and with the highest larvae
infestation indexes are as follows: Panambi Vera, Los Laureles, San
Pablo, and Hipodromo, with the following values: household index 22.4
percent; Breteau index 2.9 percent, and (water) recipient index 5.3 percent.
The likelihood of dengue fever virus transmission is reduced when the
aforementioned indexes are less than1 percent. This situation may be
reproduced in some other areas of the country. Consequently, it is
important to increase surveillance and to establish corrective
actions with the participation of the community as a whole.
Vector surveillance is of paramount importance in the fight against
dengue fever. Of all strategies, the most effective one is the
elimination of mosquito breeding sites.
It is important to mention that after rainfalls and with high
humidity levels, household surveillance and appropriate cleaning are
mandatory in order to prevent increases in mosquito infestation in
the community.
Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by a mosquito called
_Aedes aegypti_. There are basically 2 types of dengue fever: classic
dengue fever and hemorrhagic dengue fever. Generally, when the
mosquito transmits the infection [to a patient] for the very first
time, it [causes] a case of classic dengue fever. When a 2nd
transmission occurs [in the same patient], there is a higher risk for
acquiring hemorrhagic dengue fever, which is a much more severe form
of the disease and may be fatal.
Symptoms of the disease include: high fever, intense headache, severe
eye, bone, and joint pain, and skin rash. These symptoms occur 3 to 7
days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. With the
aforementioned symptoms, it is recommended that the person not
self-medicate, and he/she must go immediately to a health center
and/or physician.
It is recommended to inform the community about the following:
1. Inspect yards at least 2 times per week, with special emphasis on
the detection and elimination of mosquito breeding sites.
2. Put sand in vases, and keep water reservoirs closed.
3. Dispose of used tires in covered places, or fill them with soil,
in order to prevent water accumulation inside them.
4. Go immediately to a health center if a person has fever and
headache without mucus elimination [?]; this warrants action, if
possible, within 24 hours.
5. Immediately report suspected cases of dengue fever to health
services, so that epidemiological investigation is on time and effective.

[_Aedes aegypti_] is the most important and widespread vector of
dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever. This day-biting mosquito
breeds in a variety of man-made container habitats (e.g. domestic
water pots, discarded tires, empty tin cans) and also in some areas
in natural container-type habitats such as tree holes and rock pools.
It has become a peridomestic mosquito.
Risks of dengue outbreaks are often assessed, at least in part, using
larval indices. Several such indices are employed to estimate the
abundance of _Ae. aegypti_ breeding in an area. The most commonly
used is the house (= premise) index, which is the percentage of
houses, including surrounding compounds, that have _aegypti_ larvae
in some of their containers. Other indices are the container (=
receptacle) index, the percentage of water-holding containers
examined that contain _aegypti_ larvae; and the Breteau index, the
total number of containers with larvae of _aegypti_ per 100 houses.
All 3 are presented in the above report. I think the Breteau index
seems low in comparison with the house index. The statement that
dengue transmission is reduced if the indices quoted in the report
are below 1 percent is a little vague, as this usually refers to the
house index alone, and moreover this threshold is rather dubious for
some of the reasons given below on the use of these indices.
The value of such indices has been criticised because outbreaks of
diseases like dengue depend on many other factors such as the actual
numbers of larvae per container, the percentage that survive to
complete development and give rise to adults, and the population
density of humans.
Eradication campaigns in the 1940s and 1960s eliminated _Ae. aegypti_
from many Central and South American countries, including Paraguay,
but after such programs ceased in the early 1970s, _Ae. aegypti_
reappeared in most of those countries.
Another dengue vector, _Ae. albopictus_, originally from Asia, was
found in the 1980s and 1990s in some Latin American countries. It
has not been found in Paraguay, although it has been recorded in
Brazil ( in 1986) and Argentina (in 1998). - Mod.MS]

A 65-year-old woman who died last Sunday in Machala was diagnosed
with hemorrhagic dengue fever. The patient is the 2nd victim of this
outbreak in the current rainy season.
According to the Minister of Health, Dr. Ivan Zambrano, the patient
presented with the same features as another woman, who died 13 Jan
2006. Both patients were taken care of in Teofila Davila Hospital.
"The [65-year-old woman] was admitted last Friday [27 Jan]. Her
condition improved a little the next day, but on Sunday her condition
deteriorated, and she died. In both cases patients self-medicated
before being admitted".
According to Dr. Richard Molina, head of Teofilo Davila Hospital, the
patient was admitted to the emergency ward and later taken to the
Intensive Care Unit, where she stayed until she died. "She arrived
with an hemorrhagic condition and low platelets".
Additionally, in the aforementioned hospital there are 2 children
recovering from classic dengue fever, and a girl is still in critical
condition. "She is quite ill and she still is in the Hospital ICU."
According to Health Subsecretariat Statistics, until yesterday there
were 11 probable cases of classic dengue fever, 6 of them with
laboratory confirmation, 3 have a clinical diagnosis, and two died.
The provinces at risk are: Guayas, followed by El Oro and Manabi.
Probable cases of classic dengue fever until yesterday were 297; 231
from Guayas, 35 from El Oro, and 20 from Manabi.
Dr. Zambrano emphasized that the Crisis Committee is working
alongside province directors, the malaria program, and local
epidemiologists in order to report cases and to coordinate prevention actions.
Dr. Euclides Briones, Health Director from El Oro province, confirmed
that yesterday there was a meeting with parish groups and community
leaders, in order to coordinate actions and to prevent more deaths.
On the other hand, Guayas province Health Direction was at work last
weekend in the villages of Daule, El Triunfo, Playas, and Tenguel,
where there are plenty of cases.
According to Dr. Zambrano, these measures will continue throughout
the rainy season. He added that 500 persons were hired to work in the
National Malaria Eradication Service.
Last year [2005], 13 persons died from dengue hemorrhagic fever, most
of them from Guayas province.

In San Francisco de Tenguel Hospital, relatives and neighbors meet
and greet each other many times a day. Many children and adults with
symptoms suggesting dengue fever, both classic and hemorrhagic forms,
are brought to this place, the only health center in Tenguel, Ecuador.
Tenguel is a remote parish belonging to Guayaquil province. It has
9600 inhabitants. Tenguel was brought to public attention after 13
Jan 2006, when the first victim of hemorrhagic dengue fever died in
the community of San Rafael.
Since then many persons have gone to the hospital seeking medical
care. Yesterday, a woman came from 12 de Junio street bringing her
5-year old son. "I am frightened, the boy has fever and he has a
nosebleed", she said, while she was placing the child in one of the
beds of the children's ward.
The boy was hospitalized for observation. Additionally, there is an
order from Health Authorities to perform examinations, and if a case
of hemorrhagic dengue fever is confirmed, then the person will be
immediately transported to Guayaquil in an ambulance.
A few steps away, and in the same 6-bed ward, a boy was recovering
from the severe illness. The boy was brought last Friday from San
Rafael, a village 6 kilometers away from the local road, where a girl
died because of hemorrhagic dengue fever. He is a schoolmate of the
deceased girl. His mother said that there are thousands of mosquitoes
in San Rafael.
In the women's ward there was a 5-year-old girl; a 25-year-old woman;
a 10-year-old girl; and a 5-year-old boy presented with symptoms
suggestive of dengue fever.
In the men's ward, a 36-year-old man was waiting for his wife to have
their daughter hospitalized. All members of this man's family became
sick with classic dengue fever. "First my wife, then my son and now
my daughter", the man said.
San Francisco Hospital has a 15-bed capacity. Yesterday, 6 persons
were admitted with the disease, and 7 additional patients were
waiting for the diagnosis to be confirmed. According to the Head of
the Hospital, Dr. Alfredo Arreaga, the outbreak is under control, but
the number of cases increased during the week 15-21 Jan 2006, when 41
cases of classic dengue fever and one case of dengue hemorrhagic
fever were reported. In the week from 21 Jan until now, 12 cases of
classic dengue fever and no cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever have
been reported.
"The order states that we do not maintain severely ill patients in
this place. This afternoon an ambulance from Guayaquil will arrive
for emergency cases. Yesterday (Tuesday, January 24), 3 children were
transported to Francisco de Ycaza Hospital for Sick Children,"
according to Dr. Arreaga.
While the Malaria program is performing fumigation and medicines are
awaited, the population is in on alert. In the community of San
Rafael, where the first focal cases where reported, 500 families
organized themselves. "There are no sewage systems, there is no tap
water, and puddles are everywhere. We are not taken care of. Here we
already have one deceased person and everybody is concerned about
Tenguel", said Marilu Ramirez, of the Local Improvement Committee.
"Streets in this community are not paved. You can smell the humidity,
not only because of heavy rainfalls last Tuesday, but also because of
the proximity of the Gala River. Here almost everybody has had fever.
[A woman] and her son, our neighbor, and my granddaughter are also at
the hospital," explained a resident.
This Saturday, Tenguel parish and its 7 communities will participate
in a cleaning campaign. Activities will be led by 20 community
leaders, health care workers from the Ministry of Health, members
from the Malaria Program, Policemen, and Firefighters. "We will clean
the village with the help of the community" pointed out Dr. Arreaga.
The National Service for Malaria Eradication (SNEM, according to its
Spanish initials) is fumigating and putting abate (a larvicide)
throughout Tenguel parish. Out of 60 households that underwent
abatization yesterday, 95 percent had water containers with mosquito larvae.
Tenguel parish is one of the 5 rural communities of Guayaquil
province. It has the 2nd largest number of inhabitants, after
Posorja, which has 18 447.
Next Saturday, a cleaning campaign will also be carried out in
Salitre, Daule, Santa Luc , and Tenguel, as announced by Public
Health Minister Dr. Ivan Zambrano.

The first cases of dengue fever have started to appear in Manabi.
Yesterday, the number of confirmed cases was more than 20.
Additionally, in the community of Portoviejo, an 8-year-old boy is
under observation because of a possible case of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
Dr. Melva Morales, an epidemiologist from the Health Authority,
confirmed that there are 4 cases in Portoviejo, 6 in Chone, 4 in
Santa Ana, and 5 in Manta, but reports from other areas are still
awaited, so the figures are not yet official.
The Leopoldo Izquieta National Institute for Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine also confirmed a case from Junin, in 11 de Febrero Street.
Cases in Portoviejo are from the following areas: 2 from El Naranjo,
1 from El Floron, and 1 from San Eduardo Street (LEA sector).
Dr. Morales also pointed out that preventive actions are being
carried out in all affected areas, not only in Portoviejo, which is
related to the fact that environmental fumigation is being carried
out only in Manabi, the capital city. "Environmental fumigation is
not the solution, it is helpful only in outbreaks; the important
thing to do is to tightly close water receptacles at home, to put
abate in tanks and water containers, to sleep under cover, and to
spray insecticides in households", she explained.
"Environmental fumigation is only for getting rid of the free-living
mosquitoes, but the next day thousands of mosquitoes are born in
breeding places," she added.
"3 vehicles from the Malaria Eradication and Vector Control Service
(SNEM, according to its Spanish initials) for environmental
fumigation have been working in Portoviejo since last Saturday. When
their work is done in this city, they will go to other places," said
Dr. Morales.
In 2005 there were 4000 cases of classic dengue fever, 75 cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever, and 5 persons died. For environmental
fumigation, 400 dollars a week is needed to cover gas bills.

Malaysian authorities are rushing to control an outbreak of dengue in
a northeastern district following the deaths of 2 schoolgirls from
the mosquito-borne disease, an official said on Friday.
The 2 girls 13 years old who died last month in the Tanah Merah
district of Kelantan state were earlier thought to have succumbed to
Japanese encephalitis, but tests later showed they were dengue
victims, Health Ministry director general Ismail Merican told
reporters. "One of the victims also suffered from bacterial
meningitis in addition to dengue," he said.
"It is an outbreak of dengue. We have beefed up our control measures.
Whether it is dengue or JE, the root cause is mosquitoes, so we have
taken measures to ensure cleanliness," he said.
Mr Ismail said Japanese encephalitis is not the real problem, and our
"focus is on dengue," which he described as more dangerous than
Japanese encephalitis. Last year [2005], 108 people died from dengue
fever compared to 6 from Japanese encephalitis.
In Tanah Merah alone, where the 2 girls died, there were 11 dengue
cases in January, Mr Ismail said, adding that measures including
fogging of mosquito breeding grounds are being taken to ensure the
outbreak doesn't spread to other parts of Kelantan.
"A 3rd victim, a 27-year-old epileptic woman, is currently in
hospital being treated for dengue," Mr Ismail said. She initially
tested positive for Japanese encephalitis and dengue, but the latest
tests showed that she had only dengue."
Dengue causes high fever, severe joint pain and sometimes nausea,
vomiting and a rash. Some strains cause internal bleeding, leading to death.
The Japanese encephalitis virus, also spread by mosquitoes, generally
causes fever and headaches or no apparent symptoms. But about 1 in
200 infections cause severe complications to the central nervous
system, resulting in disorientation, comas, seizures, paralysis and death.
