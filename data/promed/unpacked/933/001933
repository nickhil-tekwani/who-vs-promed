[1] Cholera - Togo (Maritime)

Two cholera cases were recently detected in the south of Togo, in the Lakes II municipality (Maritime Region). This was revealed in a press release issued by the Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene. After reassuring the population that "appropriate measures have been quickly taken to contain the public health emergency," the ministry recommended vigilance and adequate hygiene measures, such as regularly washing hands with soap, protecting food from flies and dust, and washing fruits and vegetables before consumption.

The public authority also said anyone suffering from severe diarrhea, with or without vomiting, should be quickly taken to the nearest health center for appropriate treatment.

Cholera, a deadly disease, is transmitted via contaminated food - especially food handled with dirty hands. It often spreads during heavy rainfall periods.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria
Date: Tue 9 Nov 2021

Cholera is endemic in Nigeria, but the outbreak this year, 2021, has been especially severe, with more than 90 000 people infected so far. While nearly all of Nigeria's 36 states have reported cholera cases in 2021, the vast majority have been concentrated in the 6 northern states of Bauchi, Kano, Jigawa, Zamfara, Sokoto and Katsina. The population of this region is already extremely vulnerable; hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes by conflict and violence, and most live in conditions with poor sanitation and no safe drinking water.

But the MSF emergency teams working alongside the Nigerian Ministry of Health are trying and bring the spiraling outbreak under control, opening 6 cholera treatment centers across the region and treating more than 20 000 patients so far. In many areas, security poses an additional challenge. In Zamfara state, many patients arrive in a serious or critical condition, having delayed seeking treatment for fear of encountering violence or danger on the roads.

"Vulnerable populations in Nigeria were already in a dire situation," says Dr. Simba Tirima, MSF country representative in Nigeria. "Cholera has added to a complex web of medical and humanitarian vulnerabilities, coming on top of heightened insecurity, a chronic state of acute humanitarian and medical needs, and the direct and 2ary impacts of COVID-19."

At the peak of the outbreak in July [2021], the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control reported more than 7500 new cases per week and many medical facilities were at risk of being overwhelmed. "We had to admit 80 or 90 patients during a single work shift," says Anas Al-Hassan, a nurse at MSF's CTC in Kano, where the outbreak spread quickly throughout the community. "There was no time for rest because of the number of patients. The work at that time was overwhelming."

"The patients would come devastated, their caregivers worried they might not make it," says Philip Esenwa, MSF medical activity manager for the Nigeria Emergency Response Unit. "Some were so weak they that they couldn't speak. "We used to have patients who were brought in dead," says MSF nurse supervisor Mustapha Mahmud, who also works at Kano CTC.

The challenges were immense in cities such as Kano and Bauchi, where many people live in overcrowded conditions, with dilapidated or non-existent sewage systems and no access to clean drinking water. Water sources can easily become contaminated with sewage, especially in the rainy season, causing waterborne diseases such as cholera to spread quickly.

"The areas with high numbers of cholera cases are congested, with no adequate ventilation or proper drainage," says Mustapha Mahmud. "The sources of water are usually from shallow wells and boreholes; with rainfall, they become contaminated, and that is the water people here drink."

Many medical facilities in these areas are also poorly equipped and were unable to deal with the surge in patients. Some medical facilities charge for their services, which put treatment out of reach of those who could not afford to pay. In some states, a one-dose oral vaccine is available to help reduce the spread of the disease. However, global supply is limited and the vaccine is not available in all states.

[3] Cholera - Philippines (Cavite)

The local Rural Health Unit (RHU) here confirmed on [Fri 5 Nov 2021] that there is a cholera outbreak in their town after recording cases of diarrhea and vomiting in 3 villages. According to Dr. Ruth Punzalan, head of Tanza RHU, an outbreak has been declared in the villages of Punta Uno, Sahud-Ulan and Calibuyo.

Punzalan said test results of the specimen sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Filinvest City in Alabang, Muntinlupa City confirmed that a fisherman and a housewife were stricken with the water-borne disease. She added that many residents complained of diarrhea and vomiting, including a 1-year old child and an 8-month old baby who died last week.

Authorities are still investigating the possible source of cholera in the 3 villages.

[Cavite, officially the Province of Cavite, is a province in the Philippines located in the Calabarzon region in Luzon. Located on the southern shores of Manila Bay and southwest of Metro Manila, it is one of the most industrialized and fastest-growing provinces in the Philippines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavite).

Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign.

The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136.

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63,64)."
