Jackfruit farmers in Jhenaidah [district of Khulna division] are worried as fungal infection has affected fruits on the trees. Some orchard owners said large spots develop on the fruit and spoil it. Some farmers said they applied fungicides on the fruits when they noticed the infestation, but that could not check the spread of the disease. A farmer said he did not know about the disease, and even the agriculture officers could not tell them about it or what to do to fight it.

Dr Khan Mohammad Muniruzzaman, Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), said the attack could be controlled by applying anti-fungal medicine during the immature stage of the jackfruits [but] most farmers are not aware enough about orchard management. The DAE has been providing training to the orchard owners.

[The fruit of the jackfruit tree (_Artocarpus heterophyllus_) can weigh up to 60 kg [132 lb] with almost 1 m [39 in] in length and are amongst the largest tree fruits known. Depending on the level of sweetness of different varieties, they are eaten as fresh or preserved fruit, or as vegetable. The crop is grown widely in tropical and subtropical areas.

Although the trees are generally considered to be hardy, they can be affected by a number of fungal and a few bacterial pathogens, some of which may cause spots and rots on fruit, as mentioned above. However, the information supplied in this report is not sufficient to identify a specific pathogen. Reliable diagnosis is crucial for designing management strategies for local farmers.
