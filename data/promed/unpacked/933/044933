A popular Texas fisherman has died at the age of 61 after being infected with bacteria described as "flesh-eating". He passed away on 30 Jul 2021 at a medical center in Brownsville, Texas, due to complications from vibriosis -- a disease caused by about a dozen species of bacteria from the genus _Vibrio_ -- according to an obituary posted by the McCaleb Funeral Home in Weslaco.

He eventually succumbed to the infection after experiencing organ failure and sepsis -- a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues -- mysanantonio.com reported. He probably contracted the bacteria through an oyster cut, his family and friends said.

The fisherman spent much of his life on the water around South Padre Island -- located off the southern coast of Texas -- and learned fishing from his grandfather. In 1982, he founded a fishing guide service, and in the years after he went on to become a well-known local fisherman, helping to establish Cameron County as a sought-after fishing destination.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," 1st ed, Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at https://bit.ly/3Cohttr:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish.... Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and increased dissolved organics."

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The 'primary septicemia' form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease [the organism can also enter through damaged skin - Mod.LL]. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions" [shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/].

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
