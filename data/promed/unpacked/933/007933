Agonising back pain, fatigue, jaundice, nausea and loss of appetite are some of the symptoms that a 27 year old had to endure last year [2019] before he was diagnosed with hepatitis E.

The disease, which is commoner in areas with poor hand washing and lack of clean water, has been described as an epidemic, as more cases are reported to the authorities. The man is among 4000 Namibian men, mostly from Windhoek's informal settlements, battling the virus.

"I could not sleep at night, as my body was in intense pain. And you cannot sleep on one side for long, as the body aches. I could also not sit, as my lower back was in pain," he narrated to New Era from his home at Ehambo dhaNehale close to the Havana informal settlement. "I went to Black Chain clinic, and a nurse drew my blood and gave me feedback that I tested positive for hepatitis E virus. They injected me and gave me tablets that I took 3 times a day for a week." [There is no specific treatment for HEV. - Mod.LL]. Like many local people, he has expressed grave concern over the outbreak of the epidemic, which has since spread to other regions, including Omusati.

The outbreak of hepatitis E in the country, according to the latest report issued in December 2019, indicated that a majority of the cases are males, with 4167 men testing positive, compared with 2896 women. The least affected are children under one year, representing 0.11%. The report also shows that most of those affected are between the ages of 20 and 39. "Males are more likely to eat food from street vendors than females. Males are also less likely to wash their hands before eating," read the report.

Cumulatively, up to 29 Dec 2019, a total of 7063 hepatitis E virus cases were reported since the outbreak began. This includes 1731 laboratory confirmed, 4345 epi-linked, and 987 suspected cases. A total of 59 deaths have been reported nationally, and among those are 24 maternal deaths. The virus cases have been reported mainly from informal settlements such as Havana, Goreangab in Windhoek, DRC in Swakopmund and similar settings in other regions where access to potable water, sanitation and hygiene is a serious challenge.

Meanwhile, the latest official report on the outbreak indicated that during the period of 16-29 Dec 2019, a total of 82 hepatitis E virus cases were reported countrywide, compared to 63 cases reported during 2-15 Dec 2019. "The outbreak has become protracted and continues to spread to other regions with ongoing active transmission of the virus. Inadequate washing intervention in some informal settlements still persists." The health ministry declared the virus outbreak on 14 Dec 2017 in Khomas, and it spread to other regions around April 2018.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, whereas genotype 3 is usually seen in developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Acute epidemic hepatitis E is attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. - Mod.LL
