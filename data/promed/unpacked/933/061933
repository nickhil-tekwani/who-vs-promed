The Puerto Rico Department of Health reports nearly 800 total (confirmed, probable, and suspect) cases of leptospirosis in the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona on 18 Sep 2022.

According to their data, 33 confirmed, 89 probable and 649 suspect cases (771 total) have been reported from week 38 (ending 24 Sep 2022) through week 50 (ending 17 Dec 2022).

The 771 cases were reported in 74 municipalities of all the health regions. The Health Region with the most reported total cases was Caguas (164). The municipality with the highest number of total cases reported was Caguas (52). The municipality with the highest number of confirmed and probable cases was Utuado (8).

Currently, 7 deaths are under investigation.

In all of 2022, Puerto Rico has seen 944 total cases of leptospirosis, including 14 fatalities.

Leptospirosis is an acute febrile disease with varied manifestations. The severity of the disease ranges from asymptomatic or subclinical to self-limited systemic disease (approximately 90% of patients) to a life-threatening disease with jaundice (yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes or eyes), kidney failure (oliguria or anuria), myocarditis, hemorrhage (particularly pulmonary), and refractory shock (organ damage).

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can be contracted by coming into contact with water or soil containing urine or other body fluids from infected animals. There are several types of animals that can transmit leptospirosis such as rodents, dogs, cattle, pigs, and wild animals.

This disease most frequently affects people who work outdoors free or with animals or those who participate in recreational activities in which they have contact with water or land such as swimming and gardening. After floods or torrential rains, all people who come in contact with flood water, or with soil or fresh water contaminated (rivers and streams) could be at risk of infection.

In Puerto Rico, it is considered an endemic disease. However, in places with continuous exposure to contaminated water, the risk of infection is much higher. Exposures associated with floods and natural disasters, which can include hurricanes and heavy rainy seasons, increase the risk of leptospirosis in the population.

[Hurricane Fiona made landfall in southwestern Puerto Rico on 18 Sep 2022, followed by extensive flooding that caused catastrophic damage in many communities and an island-wide electric power blackout (https://www.npr.org/2022/09/21/1124370722/an-unfinished-recovery-from-hurricane-maria-left-puerto-rico-vulnerable-to-fiona).

_Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months. Consequently, the outbreak of leptospirosis in Puerto Rico could be expected to persist for some time after Fiona.

In the past, parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain and subsequent flooding with Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was followed by outbreaks of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis also occurred following flooding after Hurricane Hortense, which hit Puerto Rico in 1996.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - New Zealand: rural, occupational, animal, waterways exposures 20220706.8704256.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises "preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings. Limited studies have shown that chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline (200 mg orally, weekly), begun 1-2 days before and continuing through the period of exposure, might be effective in preventing clinical disease in adults and could be considered for people at high risk and with short-term exposures."
