Horse owners are being urged to stay on alert after an outbreak of equine brain disease on a Waikato stud farm. A 7th horse has now died, and another 6 have been infected on the farm, which has been under quarantine since Tuesday [4 Feb 2014].

Equine Health Association executive advisor Dr Trish Pearce says horse owners need to look out for signs: "If they have concerns for their horses in terms of incontinence, very unsteady behind, or they might have trouble defecating, etcetera, or they might get down and not be able to get up, then they should ring their vet immediately." Equine herpes is common in New Zealand, but this is the 1st known case of the neurological strain of the disease. Authorities are hopeful the outbreak won't spread beyond the single stud farm.

Dr Pearce says the farm has been quarantined, which should stop the disease from spreading. "Basically, quarantining the property and stopping movements off that one property are effective in this case. The virus doesn't produce huge plumes of virus that will travel for kilometres on end or anything like that." She says horse owners still need to be vigilant, as other horses in New Zealand may have also contracted the disease.

Horse owners want answers after news of the deadly virus outbreak. Horsetalk.co.nz editor Robin Marshall says information about the outbreak has been hard to get hold of: "Horse owners and those involved with horses do need some answers about how it has gotten into the country, if it has actually developed from an existing case that was already in the country, and where it was likely to have come in."

[Horse owners should be vigilant for any signs that their horse is not normal. Taking the temperature of the horse may give an early indication, as the temperature may rise a bit prior to more full blown clinical signs.
