An Outbreak of Shiga Toxin-Producing _E. coli_ O157:H7 Associated with a Goat Husbandry Summer Camp in Rutherford County, Tennessee - June 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
On [Wed 22 Jun 2022], the Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) was notified of an ill child hospitalized in Florida with Shiga Toxin-producing _E. coli_ (enterohemorrhagic _E coli_EHEC) O157:H7 after attending a goat husbandry summer camp at a local farm in Rutherford County, Tennessee. The TDH received a 2nd call on [Sat 25 Jun 2022] from the same mother stating she knew of a 2-year-old patient hospitalized at Vanderbilt in Nashville, TN with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and reported that this child's older brother had attended the same camp. The Foodborne and Enteric Diseases (FED) Program staff searched Vanderbilt Medical Center's electronic medical records confirming the child had EHEC and was admitted for HUS. On the morning of [Mon 27 Jun 2022], the FED team initiated an outbreak investigation.

The farm hosting the summer camp, "Farm X," included many attractions for families such as a petting zoo, pony rides, splash pad, walking trails, various fields and 3 food service establishments. During the summer months, Farm X held multiple 5-day summer camps teaching animal husbandry for children ages 6-10. Among other activities, children pick out a baby goat and care for it the remainder of the camp. Children attended camp during the day and return home each afternoon. A total of 3 of these camps took place in 2022 prior to the TDH investigation: 6-10 Jun 2022 (Week 1), 13-17 Jun 2022 (Week 2), and 20-24 Jun 2022 (Week 3). Farm X typically hosts 3 weeks of camp followed by 2 weeks of no camp.

Epidemiology:
82 summer camp attendees were present at Farm X from 6/6/22 - 6/24/22. A total of 53 (65%) surveys were completed using an outbreak-specific questionnaire with 12 cases and 58 controls included in the final analysis.

A total of 12 primary cases (2 confirmed, 10 probable) and 2 2ary cases (1 confirmed, 1 probable) were identified. Onset dates ranged from 10 Jun 2022 to 21 Jun 2022. The epidemiologic curve supports the likelihood most ill primary cases were exposed sometime during the week they attended camp; 10 of 12 primary cases attended between 6 Jun 2022 and 10 Jun 2022. The median duration of illness was 4.5 days (Range: 2-20 days). As many as 5 cases (36%) were female. The median age among cases was 6 years. Two cases (1 primary and 1 2ary case) went to the ER and were hospitalized. The 2ary hospitalized case developed HUS and died. All 14 (100%) cases reported diarrhea, 7 (50%) reported stomach cramps, 6 reported fever (43%), and 5 (36%) reported nausea. The number of new cases peaked on 13 Jun 2022 with 3 cases stating they began feeling ill on that day.

Campers were served 6 food options and engaged in 17 activities [see Appendix I for the full food and activity analysis - for appendices, figures and tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]. When comparing cases with controls (non-ill persons) who attended the camp, none of the food items or activities were statistically significantly associated with illness. Given the camp food and activity schedules were consistent between weeks and most campers ate every food and participated in almost every activity, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons along these lines. The only statistically significant difference between cases and controls was that cases were more likely to attend camp during week one (OR: 13.1, 95% CI 2.59, 66.57) which is reflected in the epi curve (Figure 2).

Environmental Health:
On [25 Jun 2022], Farm X voluntarily closed the facility. During an evaluation on [28 Jun 2022] the food service aspect of the farm was not operating and general inquiries about food service and preparation were made. No ill food handlers, ill farm staff, or camper illnesses were reported to the farm owners during the 3 weeks of camp. There were no reports of foodservice system changes during this time and no disruptions in water, sewage, or power were reported. There were no maintenance activities reported for kitchen equipment and the kitchen was in good repair. Farm X owners reported that only pre-cooked food was served to campers and fresh watermelon was offered as an optional selection. Fresh raw, preformed beef burgers were prepared on Thursdays and Fridays and cooked to order but were not offered to campers. FED staff recommended cleaning and sanitizing all food contact surfaces in the kitchen and separating staff duties between farm/animal handlers from food handlers.

There were several handwashing and hand sanitizing stations throughout the facility. The outdoor handwashing stations observed were manually activated by depressing a foot bulb on ground and supplied with cold water (both municipal and chlorinated spring-sourced), soap, and towels. Farm X's policy requires handwashing immediately following goat handling and prior to food service for campers. For smaller children, Farm X reported that step stools are provided, and staff assists them with pumping the water. Several porta-potty restrooms were provided throughout the facility and are maintained by the staff. Waste contents are removed by 3rd-party, porta-potty vendor. No fecal incidents reported amongst campers during any week of camp.

On [28 Jun 2022] investigators collected 20 environmental samples (See Appendix II Samples # 1-20) and on 29 Jun 2022 collected 8 water samples (See Appendix II Samples 1.W-8.W). Farm X was able to provide investigators with the camp registration contact list, goat assignment records, lists of daily camp activities, and food service menu calendar. During the onsite visits the farm appeared to be in good repair and the animals seemed well cared for and healthy.

In response to the outbreak, Farm X expedited the already scheduled demolition of the barn housing the baby goats, euthanized 2 baby goats who had tested positive for EHEC, moved the rest of the herd off the property, and indefinitely ceased the animal husbandry aspect of the summer camp. During the closure of the farm, Farm X reportedly consulted with veterinarians from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA). Lastly, to better understand how similar operations address pathogen transmission risk reduction, Farm X reported consulting with other farming operations including visiting 3 petting zoos.

On [18 Jul 2022] Farm X reopened for summer camp, without the goat husbandry component, and to the public on [21 Jul 2022].

Laboratory:
The SPHL received a total 33 environmental samples, 8 water samples, and 3 clinical samples. One clinical specimen was collected in Florida and analyzed for whole genome sequencing by the Florida Department of Health State Laboratory. Of the 33 environmental samples, 1 was a goat feed sample, 17 were goat stool specimens, and 15 were environmental swabs. A total of 13 of the goat stool specimens were collected independently by the owner of Farm X and were initially analyzed at the Kord Lab. As many as 15 of the environmental samples (1 goat rectal swab and 14 goat fecal samples) that initially were unable to grow EHEC were sent to the USDA Agroecosystem Management Research Unit for repeat testing. In total, 45 specimens were collected in response to this outbreak (see Appendix II: Table 2).

Of the 45 samples collected for this outbreak, 9 were positive for EHEC representing 3 different serotypes: H14 [the somatic "O" antigen appears to be missing. - Mod.LL] (2 environmental), O157:H7 (3 clinical, 2 environmental), O26 (2 environmental) (See Appendix II: Table 2). One of the H14 specimens was collected by Farm X and initially tested at the KORD laboratory; neither of the H14 or O26 serotypes were associated with clinical illnesses in this outbreak. All 5 O157:H7 specimens were closely related by WGS. The 2 environmental samples were from a wooden post inside the barn where the baby goats resided (See Appendix II Sample #12) and from a runny stool (animal origin not confirmed) collected outside on the side of the barn where the baby goats would congregate (See Appendix II: Table 2, Sample #6). Sample 12 was isolated and sequenced by the SPHL and sample 6 was isolated by the USDA's Agroecosystem Management Research Unit followed by sequencing at the SPHL. All 5 samples were closely related with a maximum of nine SNPs and average of 4 SNPs distance between isolates (Figure3). In terms of alleles, which more closely reflect the core genome, 4 of the 5 specimens were zero alleles apart (Figure 4). Allele information for the missing specimen is unavailable since it was collected in Florida and the 2 fecal samples (N22165515-01V and N22165515-01W) were isolates generated from the same specimen (See Appendix II: Table 2, Sample #6).

Discussion & Conclusion
-----------------------
It is well documented that Shiga Toxin-producing _E. coli_ (EHEC) resides in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals such as cattle, goats, sheep, deer, and elk without causing illness (1). EHEC outbreaks have also been well documented specifically in the petting zoo environment both in the USA and globally (Austria 2015 (2), Florida 2007 (3), Virginia 2022 (4), Connecticut 2016 (5), Florida, and Arizona 2004 and 2005 (6).

In June and July of 2022, the TDH investigated an outbreak of EHEC _E. coli_ O157:H7 associated with Farm X in Tennessee. Survey responses did not show any statistically significant results in terms of food or camp activity exposures, however attending during the first week of camp was significantly associated with illness. One explanation for this could be that this first week coincided with a period of increased EHEC shedding in baby goats, which can happen due to increased stress or environmental changes (7). Based on the laboratory and epidemiologic findings, this outbreak likely occurred due to close contact with baby goats during their time at the camp. Illness of others who did not attend camp were attributed to 2ary exposure to their infected household member. This hypothesis is further strengthened by there being no reports of illness from general admission customers before, during, or after the 3 weeks of summer camps in question.

During the site visits at Farm X, we reviewed the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) Animal Contact Compendium and Resources (NASPHV Animal Contact Compendium8) document. Farm X had awareness of the Compendium and complied with the majority of recommendations potentially limiting additional transmission. Farm X voluntarily closed the farm for 3 weeks. Upon reopening they removed the baby goat care aspect from camp activities and increased risk communication language on their website and on signage throughout the farm.

EHEC is naturally found in the intestinal tracts of healthy ruminant animals like cattle, sheep, and goats (1). Proper hand washing is a key control measure to prevent infection with EHEC and other harmful germs. The process of vigorously scrubbing the hands with running water and soap helps to remove germs. The use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can reduce the number of germs on hands but does not replace washing with soap and water (9).

TDH recommended they continue to provide an adequate number of accessible hand washing stations (supplied with soap, water, and paper towels), maintain appropriate educational signage throughout the facility, enhance educational messaging on their website, continue to explain this risk on their camp registration forms and to complete a facility consultation with the University of Tennessee Extension agricultural professionals.

The TDH FED concluded that this outbreak was associated with direct contact with goats infected with EHEC O157:H7 with 2ary transmission from cases. Control measures in place at the farm to minimize transmission may have reduced additional illnesses and enhanced control measures to reduce risk were recommended.

[Initially associated with undercooked ground beef, EHEC can be acquired by ingestion of contaminated produce such as lettuce or bean sprouts, contact with either municipal or recreational water, or contact with ungulates or their environment. Petting zoos (the most similar environment to the situation here) are well-known sources.

Abstract
--------
"Despite their general low incidence, Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia (E.) coli_ (STEC) infections are considered an important public health issue due to the severity of illness that can develop, particularly in young children. We report on 2 Austrian petting zoos, one in Tyrol (2015) and one in Vorarlberg (2016), which were identified as highly likely infection sources of STEC infections. The petting zoo-related cases involved a case of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) due to STEC O157:HNM in 2015 and an outbreak of STEC O157:H7 infections affecting 5 young children and 2 adults in 2016. The HUS case accounted for 2.8% of the 36 STEC O157:HNM/H7 infections notified in Austria in 2015 (5.9% of 17 HUS cases). The 7 cases described for 2016 accounted for 4% of the 177 human STEC infections documented for Austria in 2016, and for 19.4% of the 36 STEC O157:HNM/H7 infections notified that year. The evaluation of the STEC infections described here clearly underlines the potential of sequence-based typing methods to offer suitable resolutions for public health applications. Furthermore, we give a state-of-the-art mini-review on the risks of petting zoos concerning exposure to the zoonotic hazard STEC and on proper measures of risk prevention."
