So far, apple mosaic disease was considered to be caused solely by _Apple mosaic virus_ (genus _Ilarvirus_, family Bromoviridae; ApMV). During studies in 2017 in Japan, sequence analysis of samples collected from a symptomatic apple tree (_Malus domestica_) revealed the presence of a new ilarvirus tentatively called Apple necrotic mosaic virus (ApNMV). Three other viruses of family Betaflexiviridae were also detected (_Apple stem pitting virus_, _Apple stem grooving virus_, _Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus_).

Further studies in China in major apple-producing areas showed that the majority of apple trees showing mosaic symptoms were infected with ApNMV but not by ApMV. It is speculated that many previous Chinese records of ApMV should be re-attributed to ApNMV. In China, ApNMV was also detected on crab apple (_Malus_ spp.) and hawthorn (_Crataegus_ spp.) in association with mosaic symptoms. In addition to China and Japan, ApNMV has also been detected in India and South Korea.

[Ilarviruses mainly infect woody plants. Depending on the host, symptoms may include chlorotic line patterns on leaves which may lead to tissue necrosis; ringspots, line patterns, and distortions on fruit; shoot dieback; and stunting of trees. Infection may also lead to bud necrosis. Some of the viruses may occur in co-infections with other fruit tree viruses. Ilarviruses are mainly transmitted mechanically by thrips feeding on pollen grains that contain the virus or by carrying pollen grains contaminated by the virus. When the presence of wind-blown pollen and high populations of vectors coincide, risk of infection is high.

_Apple mosaic virus_ is related to _Prunus necrotic ring spot virus_ (PNRSV) and is one of the oldest known and most widespread of the apple viruses. Most commercial crop cultivars are susceptible to varying degrees. Depending on disease severity, infected trees may still produce fruit, with yield reductions of up to 50%. In some cultivars, the virus severely affects bud set. Commercial disease management mainly relies on use of certified virus free planting and grafting stock.

The novel Apple necrotic mosaic virus was found to be closely related to both ApMV and PNRSV. High sequence diversity was detected between different isolates in China (see link below). This would suggest a diverse population potentially linked to a high rate of new strains emerging.
