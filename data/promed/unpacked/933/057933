Russia: hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Orenburg
----------------------------------------------
75 cases of hemorrhagic fever have been recorded in the Buzuluk region of
the city of Orenburg. These cases, which include 5 children, were recorded
during the course of the past 9 months.
For several years, there have been no serious attempts in the Buzuluk
region to undertake effective rodent control. No measures were in force to
prevent the migration of mice from fields to houses, and no appropriate
sanitary cleaning has been carried out. Most of the ill people are
residents in the villages of Krasnogvardeyez and Koltubanovsk.
According to Regnum sources, the health administration had allocated only
219 000 rubles [USD 7636] for preventive measures. The heads of local
community committees were asked to carry out sanitary cleaning of places
that are considered to be natural [foci] of hemorrhagic fever, and, to
undertake health education of the local population. The epidemiological
surveillance center has detailed records of each of the cases.
People become infected during hunting, collecting hay, and similar rural
activities. Urban people contract infection only when they visit rural
localities. There is some risk of infection if a person does not wash their
hands before eating. Rodents usually excrete virus in their feces and
urine, and infection occurs by inhalation of dust and detritus contaminated
with dried excrement.

[Although the hemorrhagic fever is not identified, it is almost certainly
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), caused by _Puumala virus_.
The carrier of _Puumala virus_ is the bank vole _Clethrionomys glareolus_.
The HFRS caused by _Puumala virus_ peaks in autumn to early winter due to
the seasonal dynamics of bank voles. Nephropathia epidemica, the mild form
of HFRS, caused by _Puumala virus_, has a low case fatality rate. - Mod.CP]
[Orenburg city (1989 pop. 547 000), on the Ural River, is the capital of
the Orenburg region, Central Asian Russia. It is a major rail junction
where the Trans-Caspian RR, the Central Asian RR, and the Samara-Orenburg
line meet. It became a center for Russian trade with Kazakhstan and Central
Asia. - Mod.NR]
