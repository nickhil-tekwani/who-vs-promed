Measles epidemic in Bosnian Serb towns
--------------------------------------
A measles epidemic has been declared in the municipalities of Prijedor,
Bosanska Dubica, and Kotor Varos [western Bosnia], as 161 people, mainly
young people aged 15 to 19 years, have been registered as having measles.
This was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the [Bosnian] Serb Republic Health
Institute, Milka Mrdja.

The infected were born during the [Balkans] war and were not immunized
against measles.

[Although the uptake of measles vaccine in the Balkans has been generally
high (see reference below), the recent conflicts in the area have left a
segment of the population at risk.
