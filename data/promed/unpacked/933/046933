Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: bluetongue virus
Serotype: 8
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion, clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced),
necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak Location: Hazafon [North] (Kefar Rosh Haniqra. Acco)
Affected population: the cow positive to serotype 8 was 3 years old. It was
euthanized; its spleen was sent for virus isolation.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 250 / 80 / 12 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics
Species: cattle
Apparent morbidity rate 32 per cent
Apparent mortality rate 4.8 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate 15 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 4.8 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive;
airborne spread.

Epidemiological comments: this outbreak was already notified to have a
positive result for serotype 16 of bluetongue virus (published in the
immediate notification report dated 29 January 2009). New samples were sent
to the OIE Reference Laboratory in Pirbright (United Kingdom) and, in the
spleen of another cow, serotype 8 was found.

Control measures
Measures applied

- screening
- no vaccination
- no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Pirbright Laboratory (OIE's Reference Laboratory)

[The definite demonstration of BTV-8 introduction into north western Israel
in the fall of 2008 is a matter of grave concern to the livestock industry
in the Middle East, with special reference to cattle. The serotypes
historically present in the region, namely BTV-2, 4, 6, 10, and 16, though
readily infecting cattle, have caused clinical disease almost exclusively
in sheep, cases in cattle and goats being very exceptional. The
pathogenicity to cattle of recently introduced serotypes, namely BTV-15 and
24, has not yet been analysed. However, the pathogenicity of BTV-8 to
cattle has been clearly demonstrated in northern and central Europe since
2006. The severe clinical findings in the Rosh-Haniqra dairy operation,
including mortalities, led the clinicians to suspect epizootic hemorrhagic
disease (EHD) initially. EHD was excluded by laboratory testing, while
BTV-16 demonstrated. The current demonstration of BTV-8 should, however,
provide a plausible explanation to the extraordinary clinical picture,
which is -- in practical terms -- indistinguishable from EHD. There is one
piece of good news though: while there is, so far, no vaccine available
against EHD, BTV-8 (inactivated) vaccine for the vaccination of cattle and
small ruminants is commercially available.

The samples from the affected dairy cattle, sent to Pirbright, included 10
blood samples and one spleen. Out of 10 blood samples, 5 samples were
RT-PCR positive, 2 of which were found to be BTV-16, one found to be
BTV-16, and 4 (mixed infection) by the Sero-PCR test; the remaining 2
positives were untyped. The other 5 blood samples remained negative ("No
virus detected"). The spleen sample, examined by tissue culture
inoculation, was found eventually to be infected by BTV-8. The Pirbright
laboratory staff deserve to be commended for sorting out this mixed
infection, involving BTV-16, 4, and 8. Probably the latter is the most
significant (and effort consuming) finding.

A rather similar situation was observed in Lesvos, a Greek island adjacent
to the Turkish mainland, in November 2008 (see commentary in 20090529.1997).

According to available information, Hungary and Lithuania are the only
European countries from which cattle have been permitted importation to
Israel in recent years. However, we do not have information about the
sources of cattle imports to other Middle Eastern countries. Rosh Haniqra
is situated 2 km (1.2 miles) from the Lebanese border.

Animal health authorities will be curious to note the BTV-8 status of
countries situated between Greece and Israel. - Mod.AS]
