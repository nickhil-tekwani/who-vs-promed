We report about the 1st laboratory confirmed case of WNV [West Nile virus] encephalitis in a Belgian traveler returning from Greece.

A Belgian female of 73 years old traveled to Kavala in Macedonia (Greece). The woman developed fever and neurological symptoms. She was 1st hospitalized in Kavala and thereafter in a private hospital in Thessaloniki. A serum sample from the 9th day of illness was sent to the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. IgM antibodies against WNV were detected in the serum by ELISA, IgG antibodies were absent. The patient was repatriated to Brussels (Belgium) on [30 Aug 2012]. CSF and serum samples from 3 and 6 Sep [2012] respectively were sent to our laboratory in the scope of our function as national reference center for WNV. Both IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in the serum and CSF by ELISA. Immunofluorescence assays on the serum sample revealed IgM antibodies against WNV only and IgG antibodies against WNV, DENV [dengue virus], YF [yellow fever], and JEV [Japanese encephalitis virus] with the strongest reaction against WNV. Real-time RT-PCR [adapted from Linke et al, 2007] on the serum demonstrated a weak positive signal. Repeated RNA extraction and RT-PCR on the serum were confirmative.

The patient was in a coma when she arrived in Brussels and her situation has not improved up to date.

Flemish, national and European health authorities were notified of the laboratory confirmed imported case of WNV.

[The 6 Aug 2012 ProMED-mail post (archive no 20120810.1239031) reported that in Greece, 3 people died in July and August 2012. It is becoming increasingly clear that WNV has become endemic there, and probably in nearby countries as well. It is not surprising that individuals present in these areas are at risk of becoming infected by WNV and with illness upon return to their home countries. That indicates that diagnostic laboratories and health providers in the travelers' home countries need to be as well prepared to diagnose and treat these patients as the Belgian and Greek health professionals demonstrated in the situation above.
