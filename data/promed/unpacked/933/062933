[The reference to a previous report is in relation to the OIE report of 24 Sep 2018 of 2 outbreaks in Messina, Sicily, with 2 animals affected in a herd of 70 cattle, and also 2 animals in a herd of 49 cattle. Livestock anthrax is very sporadic in Italy and largely in southern Italy. They keep on top of it and encourage affected herds to be vaccinated until the risk is minimal. - Mod.MHJ
