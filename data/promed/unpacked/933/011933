I am currently conducting research in Mongolia and wanted to offer a
cultural response to the posting about the human fatality due to plague.
The Mongolians consider hunting marmots ("tarvaga") to almost be a right
and it occurs every summer and autumn when the animals are at their fattest
after the rains. They are considered a treat by most and considered
medicinal by many. The older generations may even eat, and offer others,
internal organ meat raw as a part of Mongolian traditional medicine.
When intended for food, the animal is generally roasted, often without
skinning. This offers ample opportunity for human contact with fleas and
the animal itself.
Any government restrictions on hunting this animal would have little
effect, especially in the countryside.
I sincerely doubt that the dog played a part in acquiring plague in this
case. Mongols consider dogs to be very dirty and disease-ridden animals.
This would certainly bias any reporting on transmission of the disease in
this case.

This may involve translation errors at some point, as many Asian dialects
reputedly call marmots "dogs", just as we call ground squirrels "prairie dogs".
