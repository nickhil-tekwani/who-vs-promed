A girl from the southern Guangxi region is the country's 4th confirmed case
in the last month. 2 female farmers from eastern Anhui province died from
H5N1 avian influenza in November 2005. A young boy from central Henan also
contracted [the disease] but recovered.
The H5N1 virus has killed nearly 70 people in South-East Asia since the
outbreak began in 2003.
The girl at the centre of China's latest case has been suffering from fever
and pneumonia since 23 Nov 2005 and has been undergoing emergency
treatment, state media report. China's Center for Disease Control and
Prevention has alerted the World Health Organization, the Xinhua news
agency reported.
The "China Daily" newspaper says there have been at least 30 avian
outbreaks of bird flu in 11 provinces and regions [so far in 2005]. The
authorities in China have culled millions of birds, but experts are warning
that the virus is entrenched in parts of the country. Beijing has said it
will vaccinate all of the country's estimated 14 billion poultry, but it is
feared wild birds could spread the virus.
The disease is not transmitted easily from birds to humans, and no
human-to-human cases have been confirmed. But health officials remain
fearful that the virus could mutate into a form which could spread from
person to person, potentially sparking a global pandemic.
