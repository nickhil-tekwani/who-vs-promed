On 6 May 2013, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published up-to-date information on the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Germany [1].

Every year, data on the number of cases of TBE are reported in Germany. The data are broken down by "Kreis" or district, which is a defined geographic area. The total number of TBE cases reported in 2012 was 195, down by 54 percent from 2011, when 424 cases were reported. Annual case numbers in previous years since 2001 fluctuated between a low of 239 and high of 546, with no clear trend. These fluctuations are most likely related to ecological factors influencing natural TBE foci as well as the risk of human-tick contact.

In 2012, a total of 141 districts were defined as areas where a significantly increased incidence had been noted. A district is defined as a TBE risk area if the number of TBE cases in the district or district region (consisting of the district plus all adjoining districts) in any 5-year interval since 2002 was significantly greater (p less than 0.05 according to the poisson distribution) than the number of cases required to reach an incidence of 1/100 000 inhabitants. The primary preventive measure is TBE vaccination.

The Standing Commission on Vaccination Recommendations (STIKO) at RKI recommends vaccination against TBE for (i) people who live or work in areas at risk of TBE and who are at risk of tick bites, and (ii) for people in endemic areas for other reasons if they are at risk of tick exposure.

[European TBE (or Central European encephalitis) is endemic in western and central Europe and is transmitted by _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks. It is common in forest and mountainous regions of Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, western Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Croatia, and Slovenia. It occurs at a lower frequency in Denmark, France, Kazakhstan, Liechtenstein, Italy, Romania, Norway, the Aland archipelago and neighbouring Finnish coastline, and Sweden. It is probable that TBE also occurs in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro, and Moldova, although little data are available on the incidence of disease within these countries.

Tick-borne encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease, and tourists and employee-travellers in forested areas should consider vaccination. - Mod.CP
