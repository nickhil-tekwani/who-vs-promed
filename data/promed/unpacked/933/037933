Hepatitis Returns to North Ossetia
----------------------------------
NORTH OSSETIA: An outbreak of hepatitis has again been registered in Mozdok
district, with 5 persons already hospitalized. More than 60 persons were
hospitalized with this diagnosis in October. As before, the main cause of
the epidemic is thought to be the deteriorated condition of the water mains.

[This is presumed to be an outbreak of either hepatitis A virus or
hepatitis E virus infection on account of the association with a defective
water supply. In either case prevention of infection could be achieved by
provision of safe drinking water and efficient sanitation, or by
vaccination in the case of hepatitis A virus infection. - Mod.CP]
