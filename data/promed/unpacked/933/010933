Botulism outbreak kills pheasants at Downar Bird Farm
-----------------------------------------------------
A botulism outbreak at the Game and Fish Downar Bird Farm near Yoder, Wyoming, has killed more than 2700 pheasants in recent weeks and will affect the number of pheasants available for release during hunting season this fall.

"Botulism is a naturally occurring disease and cannot be treated," said bird farm superintendent Steve Schafer. "Its greatest prevalence is associated with hot, dry weather and similar weather conditions were present when the bird farm had a botulism outbreak nearly 30 years ago. Losses are likely to continue until cooler weather arrives."

The disease is spread through association of healthy birds with dead and dying birds. To help reduce the risk of transmission, workers at the bird farm have been walking the pens multiple times each day removing dead and sick birds. Botulism is not related to the bacterial infection psittacosis that resulted in removal of pheasants from the farm last spring.

At this time, it is not known what effect the disease will have on pheasant stocking this fall. The Game and Fish anticipates stocking the usual number of birds for the special Springer pheasant hunt and Glendo hunt.

The effect of stocking on walk-in areas is not known at this time, but due to drought conditions, cover on some of the areas normally stocked is very sparse and would likely have not received birds for the 2012 hunting season.

According to Scott Edberg, assistant wildlife division chief, "the Game and Fish will be evaluating areas and numbers of birds to be stocked once the disease outbreak ends and total losses can be determined. Once this is completed, it is our intent to maximize pheasant releases in those walk-in areas that have suitable cover and are most often used by hunters. As in the past, we will have available for the public, a list of walk-in areas that are stocked with pheasants."

The Downar Bird Farm typically produces 15 000 - 18 000 pheasants each year.

[Botulism is sometimes called limberneck in ducks and other waterfowl. Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacteria is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g., chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible, avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
