Diabetes in children may be spread by school virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
by Jonathan Leake and Mark Macaskill
[Excerpted by Mod.JW]
DIABETES, the blood sugar disease that kills more than 10,000 Britons a
year and afflicts 2.4m others, is caused by a virus that is spreading
across the country by cross-infection between schoolchildren, researchers
have found.
The likely agent isolated by the London team at King's College Hospital is
an organism known as Coxsackie B4 [virus], and has been classified as an
enterovirus, a group increasingly associated with a wide range of diseases,
including some cancers.
Diabetes is characterised by a deficiency of insulin, the hormone that
regulates the blood sugar level. It can cause acute thirst and can also
lead to coma and death. Those with milder forms can control it by
regulating their sugar intake. Others need insulin injections, yet often
suffer eye damage and decreased life expectancy.
Insulin is secreted from parts of the pancreas known as the islets of
Langerhans. In the worst form of diabetes, Type 1, the immune system
attacks the islets and destroys their ability to produce insulin. Sufferers
become dependent on insulin injections from an early age. It is Type 1 that
is spreading among children.
Coxsackie B4 was first isolated from the pancreas of a young girl with
diabetes and was subsequently shown to induce diabetes in previously
healthy mice. The London researchers have now extracted the 11 proteins
found in the virus and hope to find which one is responsible for tricking
the immune system into attacking the pancreas. A study released last autumn
highlighted the diabetes problem among young children. The research,
conducted for the British Diabetic Association, found that the number of
children under five needing insulin injections had doubled between 1985 and
1995 and diabetes in children under 15 has seen an overall increase of 4% a
year.
It means that diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death in developed
countries and the single biggest cause of blindness in adults.
