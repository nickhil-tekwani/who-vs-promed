Adaptation of the vaccination strategy in areas affected by EVD:

Since 13 Jun 2019, the Ebola vaccination protocol has been adapted to better respond to the particular context of this 10th epidemic, especially the security context and the high rate of confirmed cases that are not listed on the contact lists.

This new protocol contains 3 strategies that can be used depending on the environment in which confirmed cases are found. These 3 strategies are as follows:
- Classic ring: This is the classic strategy of vaccinating contacts of confirmed cases and contact contacts;
- Enlarged ring: It is also possible to vaccinate all inhabitants of houses within 5 m [16.4 ft] around the outbreak of a confirmed case; and
- Geographical ring: In an area where team safety can't be guaranteed, an entire village or neighborhood can be vaccinated.

In addition, following the international meeting on Ebola vaccination last month [June 2019], the Minister of Health adopted a circular on Wed 10 Jul 2019 concerning the use of other experimental Ebola vaccines in the context of this 10th epidemic. Due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of other vaccines as well as the risk of confusion among the population, it was decided that no clinical vaccine trials will be allowed throughout the country during the ongoing Ebola outbreak.

- Fri 12 Jul 2019. No additional vaccine trials

Yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019] the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) said that the Ministry of Health and government officials have agreed that Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV is the only vaccine that will be used during the current, ever-growing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

"Due to the lack of sufficient scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of other vaccines as well as the risk of confusion among the population, it was decided that no clinical vaccine trials will be allowed throughout the country," the ministry said in its daily update yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019].

As of yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019], a total of 158 830 people have been vaccinated with rVSV-ZEBOV, which clinical data suggest has as high as a 97.5% effectiveness rate against the virus.

The vaccine has been given in a ring vaccination strategy, which follows case contacts in concentric circles. The ring strategy was 1st used during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak.

Yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019] the ministry said that since 13 Jun [2019], health workers have followed a new vaccine protocol that can be adapted to different security concerns and environments as the situation calls for.

The protocol includes "classic" ring as well as "enlarged" ring, which looks to vaccinate all inhabitants of houses within 5 m [16.4 ft] around the outbreak of a confirmed case. In places where teams' safety cannot be guaranteed, workers have used a "geographical" ring, which vaccinates an entire village or neighborhood.

The DRC will likely confirm 11 new cases of Ebola today [Fri 12 Jul 2019], which raises outbreak totals to 2462, according to a dashboard maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). Yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019], as it confirmed 14 new cases and 2 new deaths, the ministry reported a total of 1647 deaths and said 364 suspected cases are still under investigation.

The United Nations (UN) Ebola response coordinator, David Gressly, MBA, gave an extensive interview to The New Humanitarian this week [week of Mon 8 Jul 2019], in which he identified the biggest challenges facing the outbreak response.

"There are areas where surveillance is weak, mainly because of insecurity. So sometimes the virus gets into a locality relatively undetected. Right now, we are chasing the virus as it moves from place to place. What's important is to take a more structured approach that looks at the things that are stopping the public health response from happening," Gressly said.

In addition to surveillance, community engagement -- or lack thereof -- remains a constant feature of this outbreak.

"As we step up our engagement with communities, including by listening to their needs beyond Ebola and finding ways to meet them, we are seeing some of the reticence to the response ease," he said. "This will take time in some areas that have historically been distrustful of outsiders. We are making progress but need to do more. The virus will find a way to continue to replicate if we don't have all the holes plugged."

Gressly said the UN is employing a variety of strategies to provide security during the outbreak, from community policing to hotlines to, as a last resort, armed vehicles.

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) yesterday [Thu 11 Jul 2019] announced the launch of a campaign to vaccinate 67 000 children against measles in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Ituri province.

The province is one of 2 in the grips of the world's 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak, which has been ongoing for the past year. In addition to Ebola, the DRC has seen almost 2000 deaths from measles this year [2019], and more than 60% of those fatalities have been in children under the age of 5.

"Latest health data from DRC point to around 115 000 cases of suspected measles in the country, far more than the 65 000 tally last year [2018]," UNICEF said in a press release.

The campaign will initially focus on 27 000 children in Bunia, the largest town in Ituri and home to thousands of displaced persons housed in makeshift camps.

"The combined threat of Ebola and measles for the thousands of families living in overcrowded and unsanitary displacement camps is unprecedented," said UNICEF DRC representative Edouard Beigbeder.

[3] Opinion: op ed Washington Post
- Wed 10 Jul 2019. Public health emergency
[Washington Post, abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/its-time-to-declare-a-public-health-emergency-on-ebola/2019/07/10/c77641fc-a327-11e9-b732-41a79c2551bf_story.html?utm_term=.0bad8a9ceac0
[Byline: Ronald A. Klain and Daniel Lucey]

A year ago this week, the 1st patient was diagnosed with Ebola in the northeastern region of Congo, launching a new outbreak of the disease. Today -- notwithstanding the 1st-ever large-scale deployment of an Ebola vaccine, improved performance by the World Health Organization, and valiant efforts by Congolese health workers and global nongovernmental organizations -- that single case has grown into the 2nd-worst Ebola outbreak in history.

As the case count approaches 2500 with no end in sight, it is time for the WHO to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern -- a "PHEIC" -- to raise the level of global alarm and signal to nations, particularly the United States, that they must ramp up their response.

A few months ago, it looked like the response efforts then underway might succeed in bringing the outbreak under control. Yet the disease has since crossed one border (into Uganda) and continues to spread. In the absence of a trajectory toward extinguishing the outbreak, the opposite path -- severe escalation -- remains possible. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo -- a city of 1 million residents with an international airport -- or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. With a limited number of vaccine doses remaining, either would be a catastrophe.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has convened a WHO emergency committee meeting on this latest outbreak 3 times before, but he has declined to declare a public health emergency. It is time for Tedros, as he is known, to trigger the process one more time and make the emergency declaration that is overdue.

Why? Because the failure to make such a declaration -- fairly or unfairly -- has fed global complacency about the outbreak, which in turn is edging us closer to the brink of true disaster. Moreover, when an official PHEIC is declared, specific recommendations are issued by WHO; these could make a difference in Congo. Such steps could lead to improved security for health workers in the region, stepped up community engagement, and extended health care beyond Ebola treatment.

The last of these is most overlooked: expanding the health-care response to include diagnosis and treatment of malaria, diarrheal diseases, and maternal health can build trust and community engagement critical to stopping Ebola. Improved trust will improve the effectiveness of the Ebola response and make the responders safer.

Moreover, an emergency declaration will step up Ebola preparedness measures in neighboring nations, especially South Sudan, where diseases that mimic Ebola -- such as malaria and hepatitis -- are already present. As a result, Ebola could spread there and be masked for some period.

Such a declaration does not require border closures or trade or travel restrictions as some fear. These restrictions would make the current response less effective, not more. Declaring an emergency and accelerating the response ultimately reduce the risk that such unproductive measures are imposed; it is the current threat of unchecked escalation of the outbreak that makes these measures more likely.

[A PHEIC (public health emergency of international concern) is defined in the International Health Regulations [IHR (2005)] as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response." This definition implies a situation that
- is serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected;
- carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border; and
- may require immediate international action.

To understand more about IHRs and emergency committees, see https://www.who.int/features/qa/emergency-committees/en/.

This outbreak has been going on too long with no clear pathway to resolution, jeopardizing neighboring countries. It would definitely benefit from increased international attention. Women and children, particularly, are suffering. Other medically significant diseases are going untreated because of the ongoing Ebola outbreak and the continuing unrest. This op ed from the Washington Post strongly puts forth the need for a PHEIC. One hopes the WHO emergency committee will reconsider its past 3 decisions not to declare a PHEIC. - Mod.LK
