Definition of Emerging Diseases
Professor Jonathan Mayer <jmayer@u.washington.edu> raises some very
pertinent and valid questions in his lucid consideration of what comprises
an "emerging disease". However, if the strict definition were applied, i.e.
those diseases which are only appearing for the first time in humans, or
becoming truly more prevalent (rather than being diagnosed more frequently
because of improved technology, awareness or whatever), then I suspect we
would have very little to read about on ProMED-mail!
