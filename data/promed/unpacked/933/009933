A new polio case was detected in Afghanistan's southern province of Kandahar, bringing the total cases to 7 in the [southern part of the] country, an official said Friday [17 Aug 2018]. "The virus affecting an 11-month-old girl was found in [the] Zhuwando Hadiro area of Arghandab district a couple of days ago, after a previously detected [case] in the neighboring Helmand province in late June [2018]," Abdul Shakoor Nasrat, who is in charge of the Kandahar Immunity Vaccination Program, told Xinhua.

With the newly reported case, the polio cases reported in the country's southern zone has reached 7; one in Helmand and the remaining 6 in Kandahar province, bringing the total cases to 10 countrywide [Note: this brings the total number of cases in Afghanistan to 11. - Mod.MPP], the official added.

Earlier this month, Afghanistan Public Health Ministry, with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), launched a nationwide 5-day campaign to give immunity vaccination doses to 9.9 million children under the age of 5 years. The ongoing insurgency and conflicts have hindered efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country, as 1.2 million children from areas inaccessible to vaccination teams missed the latest drive.

- Papua New Guinea - One new case of cVDPV1

Afghanistan
- One new case of WPV1 was reported in the past week, reported from Arghandab district, Kandahar province. Onset of paralysis was on [17 Jul 2018].
- The total number of cases reported in Afghanistan in 2018 is now 11.
- One new WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Kandahar province.
- During the August [2018] immunization campaign, almost 10 million children were visited by vaccinators to protect them from the virus.

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported this week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases reported in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case, from Dukki district, Balochistan province, had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018].
- A total of 4 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week [9-16 Aug 2018], from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, FATA, Karachi, and Balochistan, all collected in July [2018].

Nigeria
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- One new cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week, from Baure Local Government Area (LGA), Katsina state, with onset of paralysis on [15 Jul 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been confirmed in stool samples collected from a community contact of a previously reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case from Geidam LGA in Yobe state.
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct AFP surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2-containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] subnational immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continues to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The total number of cases detected in the country in 2018 remains 11.
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication.
- The high-level meeting was convened by the Minister of Health, as well as the WHO Director-General and the Regional Director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed. 
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported 4 cases in 2018: one cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3 and one cVDPV2&3 with date of onset of the most recent case on 23 May 2018.
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- A new case of cVDPV1 has been reported in the past week, from Eastern Highland province, with onset of paralysis on [8 Jul 2018]. This brings the total number of cases in the country to 4 (one from Eastern Highland, one from Enga and 2 from Morobe provinces).
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang and Eastern Highlands provinces. A total of 3 more campaigns are planned for late August, September and October [2018].
- With confirmation of recent cases in Eastern Highland and Enga provinces, the geographic extent of the outbreak response is currently being reviewed and will be expanded as necessary.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of AFP and poliovirus are being implemented across the country, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[Well, both WPV1 and cVDPV2 and cVDPV1 continue to be identified in cases and in environmental samples and samples of contacts of recently confirmed acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. One can choose to be pessimistic about this observation or look at the possible bright side -- improved surveillance in high-risk areas (areas with suboptimal vaccination coverages) is finding more cases. In other words -- "Seek and ye shall find" (as opposed to the corollary "Don't look and it ain't there") is the operative. The worrisome observation is the occurrence of continued circulation of the cVDPVs over wider geographic expanses -- now involving 3 separate states in Nigeria, 3 separate provinces in Papua New Guinea, and multiple provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. And as a reminder, the affected areas include areas of civil unrest, where it has been difficult for the public health infrastructure to enter safely for vaccination and surveillance activities.

An additional noteworthy observation is that for the past 2 years, the number of cases related to cVDPVs has outnumbered the number of WPV-associated cases in the world. The risk-to-benefit pendulum is now switching -- in countries that have interrupted WPV transmission, the risk from the use of OPV in areas with low vaccination coverages is now outweighing the risk of WPV encounter. - Mod.MPP
