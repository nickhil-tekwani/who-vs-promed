A threat of epidemic looms over Valiya taluk [taluk refers to an
administrative subdivision - Mod.LL] here as the district
administration has declared 11 villages as "cholera-infected",
including 1 as the "worst hit".

Vitthalgam village in Valiya taluk has been declared as the 'worst'
hit. While Sadigam, Rajgadh, Choramla, Vandariya, Bhamadiya, Umargam,
Jabugam, Kosyadi, Bharadiya, Holkotar, and Nicoli villages, where a
few patients have been affected by the disease, have been identified
as "cholera-infected," according to a notification issued yesterday
by the District Collector Arti Kanwar.

Sources said 3 teams of health officials headed by the chief district
health officer (CDHO) VD Vegda had visited Vitthalgam and nearby
villages in the last week of September 2008 after numerous cases of
cholera were reported from the area. After thorough assessment of the
areas, the CDHO prepared a detailed report and submitted it to the
collector and based on its recommendation Vitthalgam was declared
worst hit, they added.

Cases of cholera reported in September [2008] have gone up due to
increased contamination of drinking water after floods in the Yamuna,
according to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). Until 22 Sep
2008, 136 cases of cholera have been reported as compared to 106
cases reported in 2007 in September.

Moreover, leader of the opposition J K Sharma has alleged that
chlorine tablets being distributed by the civic agency were beyond
their expiry date. Said chairman medical relief and public health
committee: "Cases of cholera have increased this month [September
2008] due to contamination of drinking water due to floods in the
Yamuna. In 2007, a total of 1213 cases of cholera were reported as
compared to 732 cases until 22 Sep 2008."

Iraq: cholera update
--------------------
On 20 Aug 2008, the Government of Iraq reported the first cholera
cases of 2008. As of 28 Sep 2008, a total of 341 laboratory-confirmed
cholera cases, including 5 deaths, had been verified (case-fatality
rate: 1.5 percent). 9 provinces have already been affected, with
Babil accounting for the majority of cases (58 percent), followed by
Baghdad (18 percent) and Kerbala (9 percent). Other provinces in
which cholera cases have been reported include Anbar, Basra, Diala,
Diwanyia, Maysan, and Najaf.

In addition to the confirmed cholera cases, there are a further 31
suspected cases currently under investigation and 7 fatal cases of
acute watery diarrhoea with symptoms similar to those of cholera.

Although the outbreak this year [2008] appears to be less intense
then that of 2007, further waves are still possible. It is therefore
too early to consider this epidemic to be under control. In addition,
long-term inadequacies in the area of water and sanitation remain of
immediate concern and cholera outbreaks will recur in Iraq until
access to safe water and proper sanitation is ensured for all people.

In response to a request from the Ministry of Health, WHO is
providing technical support. The WHO regional expert for water and
sanitation has arrived in Baghdad and a joint WHO-UNICEF [United
Nations Children's Fund] assessment mission to Babil and Maysan will
take place as soon as the security situation allows.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from
affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera. However,
neighbouring countries are encouraged to reinforce their active
surveillance and preparedness systems. Mass chemoprophylaxis is
strongly discouraged, as it has no effect on the spread of cholera,
can have adverse effects by increasing antimicrobial resistance and
provides a false sense of security.

Use of the current internationally available prequalified oral
cholera vaccine is not recommended once an outbreak has started due
to its 2 dose regimen and the time required to reach protective
efficacy as well as the high costs and the heavy logistics associated
with its use. The use of the parenteral cholera vaccine has never
been recommended by WHO due to its low protective efficacy and the
high occurrence of severe adverse reactions.

[4] Shigellosis - China (Hong Kong SAR)
Date: Wed 24 Sep 2008

<http://www.emaxhealth.com/2/39/24919.html>


The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Hong Kong Department of
Health urged members of the public to observe personal and food
hygiene following the notification of 19 cases of
laboratory-confirmed bacillary dysentery (shigellosis) so far in
September 2008.

Initial investigations by the CHP indicated that 18 of these cases
acquired infection locally while the remaining one was an imported
case. These cases, comprising 10 females and 9 males aged between 2
to 58, developed gastrointestinal symptoms including fever, diarrhea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain from 26 Aug 2008 to 12 Sep 2008. All of
them have recovered and their stool samples were positive for
_Shigella sonnei_. Their family contacts presently do not have any
symptoms. Health advice was given to them.

According to food histories provided, 5 of the local cases, which
involved 2 males and 3 females aged from 2 to 28 who did not know
each other, had taken meals from a fast food restaurant in Tsuen Wan
1 to 4 days before onset of symptoms. Further investigations are
underway.

There were 17, 17, and 6 cases in September of 2005, 2006, and 2007
respectively.

Mulago Hospital has set up a cholera isolation unit after confirming
an outbreak of the disease in some parts of Kampala. 2 cholera
victims from Kinawataka-Katogo zone in Nakawa division were treated
at the unit yesterday [28 Sep 2008].

Dr Joseph Senzoga said 29 cases had been reported from the area.
Since the outbreak 2 weeks ago, 3 people have been reported dead.
Senzoga attributed the outbreak to poor water supply and poor
sanitation in the slum, located in a swampy area.

"Residents draw water from a shallow well. There is only one communal
toilet which serves a big population in the area," Senzoga said. He
said they had contacted the National Water and Sewage Corporation to
reconnect the area, whose water supply was cut off.

Cholera usually hits the city during the rainy season. The most
affected areas are Kawempe, Kisenyi, Kamwokya, and Kalerwa.

Sources close to Benin's Public Health ministry told PANA [Panafrican
News Agency] Sunday [28 Sep 2008], 40 cholera cases have been
reported in Malanville, northeastern Benin, close to Niger. All the
reported cases are already being treated free of charge.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently presented treatment kits
worth CFAF 17 million [USD 36 442] to Benin, which has set aside CFAF
211 million [USD 452 184] to efficiently control the pandemic. Under
the budget, clean drinking water would be provided in the affected
areas, solid waste dumps destroyed and the environment cleaned up.

Ghana Health Service (GHS) on Thursday [25 Sep 2008] cautioned the
general public of a cholera outbreak in the Accra metropolis. In a
statement issued in Accra by Dr Irene Agyepong, regional director of
health service, the GHS advised the public not to panic when struck
by the disease but rather quickly attend the nearest health centre
for free treatment, take in plenty of water or oral rehydration
solution to control it.

Guinea-Bussau: cholera
----------------------
Since the beginning of May 2008, Guinea-Bissau has been facing a
large cholera outbreak. As of 21 Sep 2008, 7166 cases had been
reported throughout the country, among whom 133 people had died. The
overall case-fatality rate stands at 1.9 percent, and decreases below
1 percent for hospitalized cases. However, the case-fatality rate
reaches 9 percent in remote areas, indicating that rural populations
affected by cholera do not have access to treatment rapidly enough to
save lives. The fact that Bissau, the capital, accounts for more than
70 percent of all cases but only 31 percent of deaths also
illustrates this issue.

The areas with the highest attack rates are Bissau, Biombo, Bijagos,
and Oio. Cholera epidemics regularly resurge in Guinea-Bissau. In
2005-2006, cholera affected 25 111 people and killed 399.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions to travel or trade to or from
affected areas as a means to control the spread of cholera.

Health officials said residents relied on contaminated water from a
local pan near Malomani primary school in Malomani sub-location,
which they shared with their livestock.

An official at Ganze Health Centre, who requested anonymity, told
Kilifi district commissioner John Elungata that there had been an
upsurge in the number of cases of diarrhoea.

"At least 30 cases have been reported at the health centre after
residents of Malomani, Mitsenzini, Ganze, Migodomani, and Dungicha
villages came to seek treatment," he said. "People are coming from
different villages for treatment complaining of diarrhea and stomach
pains."

"A majority of affected youths have been passing urine mixed with
blood, indicating they are suffering from bilharzia
[schistosomiasis]," the officer said.

The DC urged the Ministry of Health to dispatch a medical team to
investigate the cases before the situation worsens. He also advised
residents to boil water before drinking it.

"I am asking the ministry of Public Health to supply purification
tablets as well as chlorine powder to treat drinking water in the
affected areas," Mr Elungata said.

The DC [district commissioner] said the Department of Arid and
Semi-Arid Lands would dig separate water pans for the residents and
their livestock in various parts of the constituency.

Ganze constituency is a semi-arid area in Kilifi District, and has
been experiencing perennial water shortages. Residents mostly depend
of water pans and ponds that collect water during the rainy season.

Local government officials say cholera outbreaks across Katsina,
Zamfara, Bauchi, and Kano states in northern Nigeria have killed 97
people in the past 2 weeks, making it the worst outbreak in the north
for several years, according to an official from National Primary
Healthcare Agency (NPHA) in Abuja.

More than 60 people have died in Zamfara state in the past 2 weeks,
according to Tukur Sani Jangebe, Zamfara's state commissioner for
religious affairs.

"It is quite alarming and it is quite unusual for northern Nigeria.
If up to 100 people have died from cholera in just 2 weeks, you can
only imagine how many more are affected by the disease," an official
from the government-run NPHA who requested anonymity, told IRIN.

Jangebe said the death toll may be higher as reports of new
infections are still coming in.

In Katsina state in the villages of Makadawa and Kagadama, 20 people,
mostly women and children, have died while 30 others have been
hospitalized according to local government chairman Masur Usman
Murnai. Another 9 people have died in Nabardo village in Bauchi state
since 13 Sep [2008], with 40 more affected, according to Garba Sale,
a primary health care coordinator. Kano State's health commissioner
Aisha Isyaku Kiru told IRIN 5 people have died of cholera in the
state within the past week.

Due to limited access due to insecurity, no humanitarian mission could
go to Ngungu during last week [of 22 Sep 2008], where 116 cases of
cholera have been reported, with 17 dead, among 25,000 displaced
people in the camp located about 60 km west of Goma.
