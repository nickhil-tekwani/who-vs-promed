A ProMED-mail piece dated 31 Jul 2003 regarding the bacterium that causes
cucurbit yellow vine disease (CYVD) in several cucurbit species requires
clarification.

While it could be construed that _Serattia marcescens_ [Sm] was indicted as a
human pathogen in the posting, that is only one aspect of the ecology of this
cosmopolitan bacterium. Bruton and colleagues in Oklahoma have provided
substantial evidence that CYVD strains are phloem-inhabiting bacteria that
are physiologically very different from human strains. Moreover, there are
many other Sm strains, including those that are being evaluated as biocontrol
agents for plant disease control, others that cause disease in insects, and a
endosymbiont that fixes nitrogen in rice plants. Sm is ubiquitous, but it is
very unlikely that strains from most habitats are human pathogens.

Nevertheless, the fact remains that some strains/isolates of Sm are
opportunistic human pathogens. As a general rule, Sm is a hospital-acquired
pathogen affecting debilitated individuals, especially those with catheters
and/or endotracheal tubes. It is uncommonly acquired outside the hospital.

There are similar instances of phytopathogenic bacteria causing infection in
humans. For example, _Burkholderia cepacia_ causes nosocomial infections that
may be a significant problem in patients with cystic fibrosis -- and causes
sour-skin disease in onion.

I am indebted to Benny D. Bruton (USDA, ARS, Lane, OK) and Larry Lutwick
(ProMED-mail Bacterial Disease Moderator) for their assistance in preparing
this comment on CYVD etiology.
