On 22 Mar 2009 more than 900 wild geese were found dead at the
Krasnopavlovsky reservoir in the Kharkov region of Ukraine. The State
Scientific Research Institute for laboratory diagnosis and
veterinary-sanitary examination has not found any avian influenza
virus in them. No cases of death among poultry in the territories
which border the Krasnopavlovsky reservoir have been reported. Tests
of water samples from the reservoir are within normal limits.

According to the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, the most
probable cause of death of birds was the poisoning of corn that
remained on the fields after harvest.

According to Tatyana Atemasova, senior professor of the Department of
zoology and animal ecology in the Karazin Kharkov national
university, the geese died from eating grain from neighboring fields,
because undigested grain was found in their stomachs. The dead were
Northern geese, which nest in the tundra and fly there from Europe.
But the representative of the Kharkov administration believes that
the mass die-off is the result of poacher activity.

[Final results of testing samples in the toxicological laboratory are
not known yet (25 Mar 2009) according to
<http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14041246.html>. Newcastle disease has
not been found in the dead birds. - Mod.NP.

It is not clear why poachers would kill 900 birds and then leave them
to rot. The species involved is not clear either, from the sad photo
at the source URL they appear to be all-white, with very long necks
and black beaks, perhaps common mute swans? But the Russian text
clearly says geese, not swans. Was the test for avian botulism done?
More details would be welcome. - Mod.JW]
