The _E. coli_ outbreak in Stephens County has grown to 11 confirmed cases, Public Health officials said Mon 20 May 2013.

"The Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH), the North Health District, and the Stephens County Health Department continue to investigate an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections that occurred during early May 2013," said District 2 Public Health spokesman Dave Palmer.

Palmer said 10 of the cases were Georgia residents, while the other was a South Carolina resident. 7 of those victims were hospitalized as a result of the infections, with 5 of those diagnosed with a complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), he said.

Palmer said illness onsets were from 4-8 May 2013. Word of the _E. coli_ outbreak came late last week [week of 13 May 2013].

"Of the 11 cases, 10 patients reported eating at the BBQ Shack in Toccoa during the weekend of 2-4 May 2013," Palmer said. "No other common exposures were reported among case-patients." So far, it appears all cases began prior to 8 May 2013.

"Evidence to date indicates that only during the 1st weekend in May (2-4 May) were people at risk for exposure," Palmer said. "No cases have been identified with illness onsets after 8 May 2013." No cause has yet been pinpointed.

"The BBQ Shack is working closely with Public Health in the investigation," Palmer said. "Epidemiologic, environmental, and laboratory investigations are ongoing. Investigation includes conducting surveillance for any new cases and interviewing case patients and community members. The exact source of infection has not yet been identified."

[With 5 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), it is likely that substantially more than 11 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have occurred as the incidence of HUS is generally no more than 10 percent of the total cases of infection.

As a review, HUS is a thrombotic illness caused primarily by the effects of Shiga toxin on the vascular endothelium of organs where the glycosphingolipid receptors for the toxin are expressed. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent thrombocytopenia, intravascular hemolysis resulting in a prominent anemia with schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) seen in the circulating blood, and diminishing renal function that can result in overt kidney failure.

Shiga toxin induces dysfunction in the vascular endothelial cells of organs such as the kidney and brain with induction of proinflammatory mediators and widespread microvascular thrombosis. The coagulopathy is different from disseminated intravascular coagulation as coagulation factors are not consumed and markers of fibrinolysis are only mildly elevated. The thrombocytopenia is caused by direct activation of platelets causing aggregation and clearance by the reticuloendothelial system. Hemolytic anemia is related to mechanical injury of erythrocytes induced by passing through microthrombus-narrowed capillaries, especially in the renal vasculature. HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in children as the Gb3 toxin receptor is expressed at high density on glomerular endothelial cells.

Fibrin-rich microvascular thrombi occur in the renal glomeruli with endothelial swelling and detachment from the glomerular basement membrane, accompanied by subendothelial deposits and vessel lumen narrowing.

Neurological involvement in diarrhea-associated HUS occurs primarily in those who develop renal failure, portending substantially higher mortality and sequelae. Manifestations include seizures which may be protracted, coma, cranial nerve abnormalities, and stroke. Cardiac manifestations are uncommon, tending to occur during the acute phase of HUS related to fluid overload, hypertension, myocarditis, or myocardial microangiopathic thrombosis, presenting as congestive heart failure. Cardiac ischemia or infarction are rare.

As the microangiopathy resolves, renal function and thrombocytopenia improve. The hemolytic component of the process seems to be the last to resolve.
