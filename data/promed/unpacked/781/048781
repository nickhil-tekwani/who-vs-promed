West Nile outbreak in horses in southern France: Sep 2004
---------------------------------------------------------
On 28 Aug 2004 (week 35), 2 suspected clinical cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection in horses were identified by veterinarians in
Saintes-Maries de la Mer, in the Camargue region of south eastern France.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests were performed on blood
specimens from these horses by the Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire
des Aliments (the French food safety agency), and WNV IgM and IgG
antibodies were detected on 10 Sep 2004. An alert was sent to the national
authorities on 13 Sep 2004.
By 30 Sep 2004 (week 40), 37 suspected cases in horses, including 4
fatalities or euthanasia, were reported. 14 of the 18 horses tested were
positive for WNV (WNV IgM detection or positive RT-PCR (reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction)). The most common clinical
symptoms were fever, prostration, anorexia, ataxia, paresis, and
irritability. The Centre National de Reference des Arbovirus (National
Reference Centre for arboviruses) in Lyon confirmed the presence of
specific neutralising antibodies in 3 cases (PRNT80 titre >160).
The suspected cases were distributed over an area extending about 35km west
and north from the initial focus, Saintes-Maries de la Mer. Saintes-Maries
de la Mer is situated in the Rhone delta, where migrating and resident
birds are numerous. The infected area covered approximately the same region
where a previous WNV outbreak in horses occurred in 2000 (131 suspected
cases/76 confirmed cases from late August until early November) [1]. No
human cases were reported in 2000 and none in 2004 by week 39.
After the 2000 outbreak, an integrated programme of WNV surveillance
involving partners from the Ministries of Agriculture, Public Health and
the Environment, as well as local agencies, was initiated. It covered 3
Departements: Herault, Gard and Bouches du Rhone [2]. Sentinel birds
(chicken and ducks) were tested for WNV antibody detection on a regular
basis. Suspected cases in horses and humans were tested for WNV infection.
Dead wild birds were collected for WNV testing. Because of the limited WNV
outbreak in Frejus (in the Var department, 200 km east of the Camargue) in
2003 which involved 7 human cases (3 encephalitis and 4 cases of febrile
illness) and 4 equine cases, the 2004 sentinel bird surveillance programme
was extended along the Mediterranean coast to cover 6 Departements from the
eastern Pyrenees to the Var, as well as the report of suspected cases in
humans and horses [3].
A low level of WNV activity was reported in the Camargue region in sentinel
birds: one seroconversion in 2001, one in 2002 and none in 2003. In late
July 2004, a WNV seroconversion was reported in a sentinel chicken from
Saintes-Maries de la Mer, and a second seroconversion was reported in
mid-August at the same location. On 6 Sep 2004, 2/3 of the sentinel birds
from this flock were positive for WNV antibodies. A sentinel duck was
reported to be positive for WNV on 16 Aug (infection confirmed on 7 Sep
2004) in Saint-Just, Herault.
Following the alert on 13 Sep several measures were taken: (a)Increased
surveillance for detection of suspected cases in human and equine
populations; (b) entomological studies at areas where infected horses have
been found; (c) a restriction on blood donations from individuals living in
or with history of travel to the infected area until the end of October
2004. An absence of WNV viral genome was reported in a retrospective study
on 789 blood donations collected from donors in the infected region from
the beginning of August 2004 to mid-September.
