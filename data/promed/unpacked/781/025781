CAHS Experiences High Number of Absentees
---------------------------------------
Rumors circulating that Connellsville Area Senior High School (CAHS)
students were the victims of food poisoning can't be dismissed or confirmed
but one thing's for sure - a virus is circulating through area residents.
Patty McKissock, nurse manager of Highlands Hospital Emergency Room said
that at least 25 people have been treated for gastroenteritis in the last
few days. Gastroenteritis was defined by Dr. Paul Dascani of Connellsville
as "an inflamed stomach and bowels."
McKissock said she heard the rumors that students at CAHS were the victims
of food poisoning but couldn't confirm if any of her patients were CAHS
students. She said that the patients treated in the emergency room for
gastroenteritis varied in age. Gastroenteritis is common in people who
have food poisoning and common in people who are suffering with a viral or
bacterial infection, according to Dascani.
Rumors were that students ate the Christmas dinner served at CAHS on
Thursday and became ill on Friday.
Gerald Browell, Connellsville Area School District superintendent, said
that "when it comes to food poisoning, my understanding is that you get it
an hour to six hours after you eat and that wasn't the case with our
students." [The 6-hour incubation period is usually associated with
staphylococcal toxin-related "food poisoning." The range in incubation
periods for
the various etiologies of "food poisoning" is from less than one hour (in
the case of some toxins and heavy metals) up to several weeks (in the case
of hepatitis A) depending upon the etiology. - Mod.MPP
He added that he didn't think the students were poisoned and that there
"wasn't a consistency" because others who ate the same meal served on
Thursday weren't ill.
However, Dascani explained that there are several types of food poisoning
and the 2 most common, staphylococcal and salmonellosis, can occur in
individuals more than 20 hours after consuming a meal. "Staphylococcal
[food poisoning usually occurs 8 to 10 hours after the meal and
salmonellosis can occur 8 to 20 hours after the meal and is usually over
within 24 hours in most people," he said.
"Hopefully it was one of those weird outbreaks of an illness," Browell said
of the high number of absences at the school on Friday. According to
Browell, 339 students were absent on Friday. "Some didn't come to school
at all and others came, got sick and left early," he said. Browell said
that he heard the same rumor on the streets and added that during the week
of 11 Dec 2000 there were a high number of absences all week long.
On Mon 11 Dec, 247 students were absent, Tuesday listed 338 absences,
Wednesday had 184 and Thursday a total of 239, according to Browell. "We
typically have 200-220 absences a day. So although that's a lot of kids
absent on Friday, it's just that it's that time of year. There's a lot of
flu going around," said Browell.
Dascani agreed with Browell's assumption and said that he has seen a high
number of patients in his office this week with flu-like symptoms. "I've
seen a lot of people with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea in
the past few days," said Dascani. "We (practicing physicians) suspect it's
a virus. And it appears to be more frequent at this time."
Whatever the illness, Dascani recommends that individuals drink plenty of
clear liquids.

[There have been prior reports of food-borne viral gastroenteritis
outbreaks due to Norwalk-like viruses. An epidemiologic investigation of
this suspected food-borne outbreak should clarify if there is a real
outbreak and the possible or probable etiology as well as route of
transmission (common source and/or person-to-person). From the information
given in this article, there does appear to be an increase in school
absences on Monday and Tuesday by absolute numbers presented which may have
begun on Friday, the day following the suspected exposure. ProMED-mail
would like to receive more information on this before venturing further
speculation. - Mod.MPP
