A horse in the town of Lee has tested positive for the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, according to an announcement Friday [4 Oct 2019] by the Oneida County Health Department. The horse died on 30 Sep 2019.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but serious viral disease spread by mosquitoes, which can affect people and horses, the health department said in its announcement. EEE is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes become infected by feeding on infected birds. The infected mosquitoes will then occasionally feed on horses, humans and other mammals. EEE is not spread person-to-person, from people to animals or from animals to people (other than via mosquitoes).

"It is vital for people to take steps to protect themselves against mosquitoes in all areas of the county," said Phyllis Ellis, the Oneida County health director. "It is still very important for people to continue their efforts to prevent exposure to mosquitoes."

People should limit their outdoor activities around dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active; use insect repellents and wear long pants, long-sleeved shirts, shoes and socks when outdoors, as well as eliminate standing water around their homes.

Repellents containing DEET are the most effective but need to be used with caution and according to label instructions, the health department said. Products containing picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus are also effective.

To reduce mosquito habitat around the home, residents are advised to:

- Repair or replace window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside and reduce or eliminate all standing water around homes;
- Dispose of old tires;
- Empty or dispose of pails, cans, flower pots and similar water-holding containers;
- Drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers that are kept outdoors;
- Clear roof gutters and be sure they drain properly;
- Turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use;
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs and drain pool covers;
- Change the water in birdbaths and horse troughs twice a week;
- Remove leaf debris from yards and gardens and clean vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds;
- Use landscaping to eliminate standing water that collects on your property.

An EEE vaccine is available for horses and other large animals. People should check with their veterinarians to help protect livestock from the virus.

[Vaccination for horses is extremely effective. Depending on your location, it may still be advisable to vaccine your horse. Please also to remember to use horse-approved sprays for flies and mosquito control.

The EEE vaccine is usually combined with ones for West Nile virus, western equine encephalitis, and tetanus. It is a series of 2 shots approximately 2-3 weeks apart followed by an annual booster. However, in high risk areas (near water or a coastline) where warm weather and mosquito season is longer, revaccination every 3-4 months is recommended, as immunity to EEE wanes somewhat rapidly in an extended season. - Mod.TG
