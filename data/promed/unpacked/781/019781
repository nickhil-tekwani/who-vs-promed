I sell pedigree breeding pigs in Malaysia and was concerned to read of the
possible link posted between JE and pig farms, and so e-mailed a customer
near Penang who replied as follows:
*******
The recent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis was a great concern to the pig
farmers particularly in the affected places. Sad to tell you that 2 of my
colleague's sons died from JE several months ago. Both were working on the
farm.
The state health department is monitoring the areas of outbreak and advises
farm workers and the people living nearby to get vaccinated against JE
virus. I hope that this outbreak does not necessitate the closing of the
pig farms.
Thank you for your kind consideration towards our well being relating to
the recent events in KL. [Kuala Lumpur We are safe and pretty well in
Ipoh. Everything is going on smoothly as usual. We hope that Malaysia will
overcome all obstacles and also the economy has improved over the last 2
months as reported today by Bank Negara.
