-------------------------------------------
The statement [in the above posting], which disputes that pigs have
been shown to be infected by H5N1 HPAI is incorrect. Published
research by the USA's Agricultural Research Service's Exotic and
Emerging Avian Viral Diseases Research Unit shows that, while it
doesn't cause serious disease, H5N1 HPAI definitely can infect pigs.

"Groups of 4 animals were intranasally inoculated with 10 6 EID50 of
A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/04) or A/Muscovy duck/ Vietnam/209/06
(Dk/VN/06) viruses."

"Histological examination revealed lobular lymphocytic
bronchopneumonia and focal alveolitis in the lungs of pigs infected
with both H5N1 viruses. Conclusions. Pigs had limited susceptibility
to infection with avian influenza H5N1 viruses."

There are several other interesting research projects involving H5N1
and pigs documented on the site.

I have no reason to doubt the validity of the observation even though
I have only seen the abstract of the paper. I note from this that
virus was detected in the upper respiratory tract of swine up to 5
days after they had been intranasally inoculated with an avian
influenza virus of unstated origin; another isolate from a duck seems
not to have replicated at all. I see no evidence of systemic
infection and the pigs showed no signs of clinical disease; nor am I
sure of the aetiological link between the lung lesions described in
one pig and the avian influenza virus infection. Could it be that the
observations relate to limited virus replication primarily on the
mucosal surface of the upper respiratory tract? I would wish to see
the full paper.

What I should have stated explicitly was that I was referring to
evidence of infection occurring in field situations not as a result
of experimental infections conducted in laboratory conditions. I
would expect that any number of species could be experimentally
infected to variable degrees but that is a different issue. It is to
me an enigma as to why natural transmission to, between and from
swine does not seem to have occurred. If anyone has any data showing
that it does occur, it would be very useful if this could be reported.

"Lipatov, A.S., Kwon, Y., Lager, K.M., Suarez, D.L., Swayne, D.E.
2007. Pathogenesis of avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses in pigs
[abstract]. In: Proceedings of the Research Conference on
Orthomyxoviruses, September 21-24, 2007, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. p. 26.

Background.
Genetic reassortment of avian influenza H5N1 viruses with currently
circulating human influenza A strains is one possibility that could
lead to efficient human-to-human transmissibility. Domestic pigs
which are susceptible to infection with both human and avian
influenza A viruses are one of the natural hosts where such
reassortment events could occur. To begin to study this possibility
we characterized the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza in a pig model.

Methods.
3-week-old male domestic pigs (PIC 1050's, a cross between a Land
Race x Large White Cross) were used in the experiments. Groups of 4
animals were intranasally inoculated with 10 6 EID50 of
A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/04) or A/Muscovy duck/ Vietnam/209/06
(Dk/VN/06) viruses. Pigs were observed daily and 2 pigs from each
group were euthanized on day 5 and day 14 after virus inoculation to
collect organ samples. Body weight of infected pigs was measured
daily; nasal and rectal swabs for virus detection were collected on
days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.

Results.
Inoculation of pigs with both H5N1 viruses did not result in disease
with visible clinical signs or significant weight loss. VN/04 virus
was detected in nasal swabs of inoculated pigs on days 1 (2 animals,
titers 10 1.5 EID50 and 10 2.25 EID50/1.0 ml of collection fluid), 3
(1 pig, titer 10 2.25 EID50) and 5 (1 pig, titer 10 3.75 EID50).
Dk/VN/06 virus was not detected in nasal or rectal swabs. VN/04 virus
was not detected in any of organs samples collected on day 5.
Dk/VN/06 virus was isolated from lungs of 1 pig (titer 10 5.75
EID50/g) and nasal turbinate of another animal (titer 10 2.5
EID50/g). Histological examination revealed lobular lymphocytic
bronchopneumonia and focal alveolitis in the lungs of pigs infected
with both H5N1 viruses.

Conclusions.
Pigs had limited susceptibility to infection with avian influenza
H5N1 viruses. Inoculation of pigs with VN/04 and Dk/VN/06 viruses
resulted in asymptomatic infection restricted only to the respiratory
tract in contrast to mouse and ferrets animal models, where these
viruses are highly pathogenic and replicate systemically."
