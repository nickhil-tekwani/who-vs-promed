Safety of Yellow Fever Vaccine Questioned
-----------------------------------------
LONDON: Scientists are for the first time questioning the safety of the
60-year-old yellow fever vaccine after 6 suspicious deaths. The deaths of 3
Americans, 2 Brazilians and 1 Australian after vaccination against the
mosquito-borne disease are described this week in The Lancet medical
journal. "These are the first deaths supposedly linked to the vaccine
virus," said Dr. Ray Arthur, Head of the yellow fever division at the World
Health Organization. Experts are calling for an urgent investigation, but
strongly recommend that people in parts of South America and Africa, as well
as travelers to those areas, continue to get the shots.
The WHO estimates that yellow fever strikes 200 000 people a year, killing
30 000 of them. It occurs both in jungles and in urban areas. The vaccine,
which has been given to about 400 million people, has not changed since its
introduction and has been considered one of the safest available. It is
likely that other deaths have occurred over the years but have gone
unnoticed, Arthur said. New technologies now allow scientists to more
accurately connect a fatality with the vaccine, he said. Arthur, who was not
connected with the Lancet reports, said the WHO does not plan to change its
recommendation that people get vaccinated. "I don't think we should be
terribly concerned," he said, adding that "Although it is unclear what
proportion of people vaccinated might get a bad reaction, complications are
still very rare."
Dr. Thomas Monath, a virologist at Cambridge [U.K. based Acambis Inc., who
described the Brazilian cases in the journal, emphasized that yellow fever
is an untreatable disease that causes 1000 times more illness and death
than the feared Ebola virus. The vaccine is created using a live version of
the virus. The virulence is dampened so that a shot gives people a harmless
bout of the disease. When they are later exposed to the real virus, their
immune systems immediately recognize it and attack. It now appears that some
people can get very sick from the vaccine. Scientists suggested that some
people may be genetically more susceptible to a bad reaction. Arthur said
that the vaccine may need changing, but that it is impossible to tell yet.
Pedro Vasconcelos from the Center for Arbovirus Reference and Research in
Brazil, reported 2 deaths, one a 5-year-old white girl, the other a
22-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman. The symptoms in both victims were typical
of yellow fever -- fever, vomiting, muscle pain, jaundice and kidney
failure. Vasconcelos concluded that although such complications are rare,
the safety of the vaccine should be reviewed. The Australian report involved
the death of a man showing symptoms similar to those seen in Brazil. In a
third report, scientists from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention described the illness of 4 elderly patients, and the death of 3
of them, shortly after vaccination. Unlike the cases in Brazil and
Australia, the symptoms were not typical of yellow fever and seemed to be a
new condition.
Yellow fever, so named because some patients get jaundice, is found in
tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and South America. In response to a
re-emergence of epidemics over the last 20 years, vaccination campaigns have
increased. "Despite the severity of these reactions, overall the findings
indicate that no change in practice regarding yellow fever vaccination is
needed," scientists from the Pasteur Institute in Lyon, France, advised in a
commentary published in The Lancet. "Nevertheless, the intriguing adverse
effects reported today should rekindle research into how the yellow fever
virus attacks the body, how the vaccine activates the immune system and what
factors might make some people react badly to the vaccine."

[The statement from Dr. Tom Monath, formerly of the CDC Arbovirus Laboratory
in Fort Collins, Colorado, is relevant to any discussions that may evolve
around discontinuing the use of the yellow fever vaccine. Dr. Monath
emphasized that: "Yellow fever is an untreatable disease that causes 1000
times more illness and death than the feared Ebola virus". Readers should be
reminded that no vaccine is 100 percent safe. The decision to recommend the
use of vaccine is based on weighing a risk/benefit equation -- risk of
disease versus benefit of receipt of vaccine. As clearly stated by Dr.
Monath, the risk of death from yellow fever (in endemic zones) is very high,
and clearly outweighs the current risk of death from the vaccine. In the
cases presented in the articles referred to, one could question the
application of the vaccine for one of the cases where travel was to be to
Nepal and Thailand, neither location associated with any risk of yellow
fever. In that case, the risk of any adverse event from the vaccine clearly
outweighed any benefit gained by receipt of the vaccine as the risk of
exposure to yellow fever was nil for the recipient. (Fortunately the outcome
in that case was recovery and not death). Of the other reported cases, 2
lived in states in Brazil where there was ongoing sylvan yellow fever
activity and a real potential for urban yellow fever activity as _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes are abundant in 27 states of Brazil. The remaining 4
reported cases were all planning travel to known yellow fever endemic
countries. Readers are reminded of the continued occurrence of yellow fever
cases in returning tourists who neglected to take the yellow fever vaccine
prior to travel to endemic zones.
Internationally there is an increased focus on identifying unusual events
following receipt of vaccine and countries are enhancing surveillance of
such adverse events following vaccines. (The USA/CDC began such a monitoring
system back in the late '70s looking for serious health events in the 30
days following receipt of any vaccine
<http://www.cdc.gov/nip/vacsafe/concerns/default.htm>. This system has now
evolved to be a collaborative effort with the FDA <http://www.vaers.org/>).
This increased awareness and surveillance for unusual health events following
receipt of vaccine combined with more available sophisticated virologic
laboratory testing will clearly lead to identification of previously
unrecognized vaccine associated health events. These articles in Lancet are
clearly signalling a need to intensify surveillance for adverse events
following receipt of yellow fever vaccine to further quantify the risk of
serious adverse event following the vaccine, as well as to identify possible
vaccine recipient host factors that may be associated with increased
susceptibility to such events.

[The commentary published in Lancet by Philippe Marianneau, Marie-Claude
Georges-Courbot and Vincent Deubel (Unite de Biologie des Infections Virales
Emergentes, Institut Pasteur, 69007 Lyon, France) is worth reproducing here
in part to put the matter in perspective.
"Yellow fever is an acute disease caused by a flavivirus transmitted by
mosquitoes and characterised by high fever, jaundice, oliguria and
proteinuria, and hypotension and hypovolaemic shock. Haemorrhages, including
that of the gastrointestinal tract, are common. The disease was first
recognised in the 17th century, and epidemics were reported in Africa, the
Americas, and Europe. At present, this viral anthropozoonosis, which
involves monkeys, human beings, and mosquitoes, is restricted to tropical
and subtropical areas of Africa and South America. With the striking
resurgence of epidemics of yellow fever in the past 20 years in Africa, and
more recently in South America, vaccination campaigns for the prevention of
outbreaks, or as a response to outbreaks, have increased.
In 1937 Theiler and Smith at the Rockefeller Foundation Laboratories in New
York developed an attenuated yellow fever virus (17D) by 176 serial passages
of the Asibi strain (which had been isolated in Ghana in 1927) in
mouse-embryo and chicken-tissue cultures. The current vaccine sub-strains,
which have all been prepared from this 17D strain, are free of avian
leucoses and are designated 17DD and 17D-204. The derivation and passage
histories of the yellow-fever vaccines are thoroughly documented and 8
countries now manufacture the vaccine. About 100 million doses of 17D
vaccine are produced annually under the control of WHO. This quantity will
be far from sufficient should a large epidemic re-emerge in Africa or South
America.
The 17D vaccine virus is heterogeneous, consisting of quasispecies
distinguishable biologically by plaque size and neurovirulence in mice, and
by their growth capacity in human monocytic cells. Comparative studies of
wild strains and vaccine variants indicated only 13 amino acid
substitutions, with 5 of them located in the envelope protein that may be
associated with attenuation.
Vaccine seed viruses are tested in Macacus rhesus monkeys for absence of
neurotropism and clinical effects and to ensure that any resulting viraemia
is low (<1·6 x 104 pfu/mL), so people generally tolerate 17D vaccines very
well. A few cases of post-vaccinal encephalitis, but no adverse
viscerotropic effects of 17D, have been recorded in vaccinees. However, in
the current issue of the Lancet 7 severe cases of multisystemic illnesses,
including 6 deaths, after yellow-fever vaccination are described in 2
articles and one research letter. The clinical manifestations differed among
the cases. There are no obvious correlations between the cases in these 3
Lancet reports. There are no relations between relevant host factors (age,
country of origin, sex, known medical or epidemiological risk factors, or
viral factors (17D vaccine sub-strains or lots, or vaccine schedules)."
The authors of the commentary add that: "To assess whether mutations of the
vaccine strain could arise in vaccine lots or during replication in people,
the genomes of viruses isolated from any viraemic vaccinees should be
completely sequenced. In addition, changes in envelope protein that may lead
to infection of different target cells should be analysed. One challenging
task would be to correlate substitutions in the virus genomes with
modifications in virus tropism and attenuation. This task could be addressed
by using 17D-204 infectious cDNA10 to characterise the effect of each
identified mutation on infectivity of different cells or tissues."
RNA viruses are inherently variable at the genotypic level, but most remain
phenotypically stable and subject to control by monotypic vaccines (e.g.
measles virus, the polioviruses, yellow fever virus). It is self-evident
that the 17D yellow fever vaccine has performed outstandingly well during
the past 60 years. But the situation may not stay in equilibrium since both
vaccine and wild viruses have the potential to evolve for different reasons.
The 3 reports in Lancet suggest that surveillance should be enhanced to
match the increased production and use of live virus vaccine. - Mod.CP
