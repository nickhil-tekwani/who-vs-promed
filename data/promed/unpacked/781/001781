[5] Cholera - Lake Chad Basin countries
Date: Tue 30 Aug 2011

Cholera has killed at least 1200 people in 2011 in the countries
surrounding Lake Chad: Cameroon, Chad, Niger, and Nigeria. The
illness, linked primarily to poor sanitation and lack of potable
water, has struck some 38 800 people in the region in 2011 and
continues to spread.

A good part of the rainy season lies ahead. While some epicentres
reported cholera cases during the dry period, the rains generally
cause spikes as water sources become contaminated.

The unique Lake Chad Basin is the centre of economic activity --
commerce, fishing, farming -- for some 11 million people, according to
an August [2011] report by the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF). Population
movements for social and commercial activity are constant between
areas where sanitation is poor. All this contributes to the explosion
of cholera once infection starts, according to aid agencies doing
prevention work in the region.

That is why a regional strategy is critical, UNICEF says. "A
cross-border, decentralized approach is necessary to protect each
country's population and nip outbreaks in the bud," says Francois
Bellet, UNICEF regional water and sanitation specialist for west and
central Africa.

In 2010, the Lake Chad Basin region reported 58 000 cases of cholera,
with 2300 deaths, according to UNICEF -- the most serious outbreak
since 1991. Here is a tally of how many people have been affected in
2011:

Cameroon: As of 22 Aug 2011, 14 730 cases; 554 deaths. Lethality rate
3.76 per cent
Chad: As of 22 Aug 2011, 10 314 cases; 314 deaths. Lethality rate 3.1
per cent
Niger: As of 8 Aug 2011, 976 cases; 25 deaths. Lethality rate 2.5 per
cent
Nigeria: As of 1 Aug 2011, 12 840 cases; 318 deaths. Lethality rate
2.5 per cent
