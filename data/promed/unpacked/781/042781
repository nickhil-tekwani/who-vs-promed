Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development advises a new case of a variant H1N2 (influenza A) flu virus has been identified. The case has been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada in accordance with international health regulations.

This flu virus is related to influenza viruses that circulate in pigs. Influenza viruses from pigs do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses."

This human influenza A(H1N2)v appears to be an isolated case. The current assessment is that there is no increased risk to Manitobans, Canadians or the food supply chain at this time.

The virus was detected in October [2021] after the individual independently sought testing after developing an influenza-like illness. The individual experienced mild symptoms, was tested, and then recovered. The test came back negative for COVID-19 but was later identified as a case of human influenza A(H1N2)v through regular influenza surveillance processes.

The individual had direct exposure to pigs. Based on available evidence, the current assessment is that there is no increased risk to people, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission at this time.

The virus is not a food-related illness. It is not transmissible to people through pork meat or other products that come from pigs and there is no risk associated with eating pork.

Health officials, in conjunction with Manitoba Agriculture and Resource Development, have performed a public health investigation to determine the source of the virus and have not identified any further spread. The province will also continue working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other partners across Canada to share information about this case. Anyone who works with pigs or poultry, has influenza-like symptoms and is seeking testing or treatment is reminded to identify themselves as an agricultural worker to medical officials, including at COVID-19 testing sites. This will help to identify any potential additional influenza cases.

Sporadic human cases of variant influenza have been reported over the past decade in North America. Human influenza A(H1N2)v is rarely seen in humans. One case was reported in Alberta in October 2020 and one in Manitoba in April 2021.

In most cases, variant flu viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person.

Health officials advise the detection of these cases could be occurring for a number of reasons, including that increased respiratory surveillance for COVID-19 and influenza has been occurring during the pandemic. It is also possible that there is a true increase in the number of these cases, possibly occurring from exposure to infected pigs or through subsequent limited human-to-human transmission.

The increased respiratory surveillance currently done for COVID-19 and influenza allows Manitoba to continue to monitor for any new cases.

While rare, influenza can spread from pigs to people and from people to pigs. It is important for people who have contact with pigs to take measures to reduce the spread of influenza viruses between pigs and people. Additional tips to help reduce the risk of spreading influenza viruses include:

- Do not take food, drink or other items into pig areas and do not put anything in your mouth in pig areas;
- Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill or are known or suspected to be sick. This includes minimizing contact with pigs and wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover your mouth and nose when contact is required. Call a veterinarian if you suspect illness in pigs;
- Wash your hands often with soap and running water before and after exposure to pigs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub;
- Avoid contact with pigs if you have flu symptoms; and
- Anyone who is at high risk of complications from influenza should avoid pigs and pig barns. If you develop flu symptoms, call a healthcare provider and tell them about your exposure to pigs.

The same influenza antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can be used to treat variant virus infection.

In April [2021], Manitoba reported 2 separate cases of variant influenza viruses found in 2 unrelated individuals in different communities in southern Manitoba. One was a case of human influenza A(H1N2)v and one was a case of human influenza A(H1N1)v. In June [2021], Manitoba reported an unrelated case of H3N2 variant influenza.

[This is the 3rd case of influenza A H1N2v reported in Canada. The 1st case was reported in November 2020 (https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/canada-reports-rare-strain-of-swine-flu-found-in-a-human-2320812).

H1N2 viruses commonly circulate in North American swine herds. H1N2v is rare and the spread of infection between humans is very rare. Human infections with H1N2v usually result in mild respiratory illness, with symptoms like those seen with seasonal influenza. Most people will have uncomplicated influenza and recover from the flu within a week or 10 days, but some are at greater risk of developing more severe complications, such as pneumonia.

Swine influenza viruses are not transmissible to people through eating pork meat or other products that come from pigs. Cases usually occur following direct or indirect exposure to pigs. This is not a foodborne illness associated with eating pork.

Farm owners, farm family members, farm workers, and those in contact with pigs should protect themselves from animal-related influenzas by frequent handwashing. They should also:

- Avoid close contact with pigs that look or act ill
- Take protective measures if they must come in contact with pigs that are known or suspected to be sick. This includes wearing personal protective equipment like protective clothing, gloves and masks that cover the mouth and nose when contact is required.

Individuals with flulike symptoms should:

- Avoid contact with livestock, particularly sick animals
- Contact their physician for more information. - Mod.UBA
