The Ugandan government said on Friday [24 Nov 2017] that an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the central districts of Mityana and Kiboga has killed 2 people. Charles Olaro, acting director general of health services at the ministry of health, said in a statement that blood samples taken from 2 dead patients in Mityana and Kiboga tested positive for RVF.

The 2 were a 26 year old male forest ranger, who died on 16 Nov [2017], and a 69 year old male farmer and fisherman, who died on 21 Nov [2017]. Olaro said the National Rapid Response Team has been sent to support the district response structures to contain the outbreak.

RVF is a viral zoonosis that can also infect humans. Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals. The disease can result in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.

[As mentioned in previous posts, Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically. The above report makes no mention of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus.

RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune.

RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in aedes vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.

As Mod.AB noted: "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_." - Mod.TY
