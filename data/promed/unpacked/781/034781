The death toll from cholera in Malawi has risen to 30 from the 26 recorded in March 2018, the Ministry of Health said Wednesday, 11 Apr 2018. The number of infections has risen to 893 from 844 in March 2018, the ministry said. Cases in the capital, Lilongwe, rose to 352 from 305 and deaths from 14 to 18 during the period of 26 Mar to 11 Apr 2018, said Joshua Malango, a spokesman for the ministry.

The cholera outbreak has been blamed on drinking water from shallow, contaminated sources.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare Province)

http://nehandaradio.com/2018/04/14/cholera-outbreak-hits-chitungwiza/


There is an outbreak of cholera in Chitungwiza, with 7 cases having been recorded as of yesterday [13 Apr 2018] in St Mary's. This brings the total number of cases recorded in a fortnight (2 weeks) in the town to 8. Health and Child Care Secretary Dr Gerald Gwinji confirmed the outbreak. He said Government had confirmed 4 of the cases to be positive of cholera, and 2 people died of the disease. Although he could not confirm further cases by last night, indications were that deaths and illnesses could actually be more than those recorded by health institutions.

Chitungwiza Ward 5 councillor Mr Richard Chimutsa said as of last night, 13 Apr 2018, 2 people had died, while 14 others were rushed to hospital. "I am still visiting homes of the affected, but the majority of those affected are from areas dissected by Chiratidzo Road," said Clr Chimutsa.

Dr Gwinji said health authorities were still trying to establish an epidemiological link between the St Mary's and the Stoneridge cases, which killed a father and daughter last week. He said provision of adequate and safe water in Chitungwiza was generally still below the expected standards. This provides a conducive environment for diarrhoeal diseases like cholera. "Water and sanitation remain the same," he said.

The country has recorded a number of cholera cases this year [2018] in Chegutu, Norton, Harare and now Chitungwiza.

[4] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Thu 29 Mar 2018
Source: WHO Outbreak News [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/29-march-2018-cholera-somalia/en/


The ongoing cholera outbreak in Somalia started in December 2017. As of 18 Mar 2018, a total of 1613 cholera cases, including 9 deaths (case fatality rate = 0.6%), have been reported from 4 regions: Hiraan, Banadir, Lower Juba and Middle Shabelle.

The outbreak started in Beletweyne, Hiraan Region; it spread to Banadir Region in early January 2018, to Lower Juba in early February 2018, and to Middle Shabelle in early February 2018. Of the 66 stool samples tested in 2018, 19 were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup 01 serotype Ogawa. Banadir Region is one of the regions with the highest concentration of internally displaced persons (IDPs). Lower Juba has experienced cholera outbreaks in the past on the border with Kenya, and the region has many people who have been displaced by conflict in Middle Juba. Middle Shabelle has also previously had cholera outbreaks. Access to safe water and sanitation is limited in all of the affected regions.

Public health response:
The Ministry of Health (MoH), with support from WHO and partners, has implemented the following ongoing response measures:
- Established weekly meetings between the MoH and Health Cluster partners.
- Strengthened surveillance and case investigations, where security permits.
- Trained and deployed community health volunteers to provide basic patient care in affected communities.
- Conducted training for national, state and regional level integrated rapid response teams.
- Dispatched cholera and diarrhoeal disease kits to local response partners and hospitals.
- Trained evaluators for systematic monitoring of cholera treatment centres to assess capacity and quality of care and recommend reinforcement where necessary.
- Developed and implemented cholera case management sessions with the support of the Global Cholera Task Force partners.
- Distributed hygiene kits to inaccessible areas through community health volunteers and different non-governmental organizations.
- Carried out social mobilization and community education activities by State and Regional Government authorities.
- Prepared and disseminated Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials on acute watery diarrhoea (AWD)/cholera prevention.
- Implemented oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaigns. From 11-18 Feb 2018, an OCV campaign was conducted in Hudur district and Afmadow district. The 2nd OCV has taken place from 11-18 Mar 2018.

WHO risk assessment:
Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of _Vibrio cholerae_ bacteria. It is primarily linked to insufficient access to safe water and adequate sanitation. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.

Cholera is endemic in Somalia, and continuous transmission was reported in the last few years. The last outbreak, which occurred in 2017, was one of the largest cholera epidemics the country has experienced: 78 000 cases, including 1159 deaths (case fatality ratio = 1.5%) were reported from 16 regions. The outbreak reached its peak in April 2017 and gradually declined from June until August 2017, and only a few sporadic suspected cases were recorded between October and November 2017.

Despite the control and prevention measures implemented during the last large cholera outbreak in 2017, the risk of the current outbreak is considered high at the national level because of the following:

- Only 16% of the at-risk population was vaccinated during last year's OCV campaign, which is too low to provide population-level immunity;
- There are large population movements in the affected areas due to drought, conflict and floods;
- The regions affected have the highest concentration of IDPs where access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) is limited;
- Funding for cholera control and treatment measures will continue through to 2018, which include activities related to WASH and OCV campaigns. The lack of longer-term funding, however, remains a concern as the seasonal recurrence patterns require more predictable financing for more effective prevention and mitigation.

At the regional and global levels, the level of risk was assessed by WHO to be low.

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conduct risk assessments based on the latest available information.

WHO advice:
WHO recommends improving access to safe water and sanitation to prevent cholera transmission. Reinforcing surveillance, particularly at the community level, is advised. Access to appropriate case management should be improved in the affected areas to decrease mortality. The use of oral cholera vaccine to limit the spread should also be considered.

WHO does not recommend any restrictions on travel or trade to Somalia based on the information available.

For 2 months now, cholera has hit residents of Hoima, Kagadi and Kyegegwa including the refugee settlements. The number of people affected with the disease in Hoima has reached 2000 and an estimated 40 killed, while in Kyegegwa, about 300 cases and 22 deaths have been reported.

In Kagadi, James Olowo, the district health officer told media that over 20 cases had been reported by early April 2018 at Kitebere landing site on the shores of Lake Albert, but the number is expected to go up. Some of the samples have been taken to the Government Analytical Laboratory in Wandegeya, Kampala.

Olowo revealed that the district had constituted a team comprising 2 senior clinical officers with vast experience in infection control and management, a district disease surveillance focal person, lab technicians, and a Uganda Red Cross Society emergence response team.

[6] Cholera - Uganda (Congolese refugee camps)
Date: Fri 6 Apr 2018

A cholera outbreak in overcrowded refugee camps in Uganda has killed about 40 people and infected more than 2000 as health workers rush to stem the spread, aid agencies said on Thursday, 5 Apr 2018. Nearly 70 000 people from the Democratic Republic of Congo have fled to Uganda this year [2018] due to a surge in ethnic violence, and many have been infected with cholera, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

The waterborne disease has spread rapidly since mid-February 2018 due to poor sanitation and lack of clean water in the camps, said IFRC emergency operations coordinator Andreas Sandin.

"The risk is definitely not over yet," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone, adding that aid agencies have set up treatment centres and are trucking in water in response.

Most people recover from cholera if treated promptly with oral rehydration salts but can die within hours if not.

The people fleeing Congo's Ituri province cross Lake Albert in boats to reach Uganda. More than 80 percent of the arrivals are women and children, many in poor health, said the IFRC.

"Most arrive exhausted, traumatised, and with limited personal belongings," said Robert Kwesiga, secretary general of the Uganda Red Cross Society.

"Their children lack even the most basic clothing."

The influx has placed "unprecedented strain" on health facilities not used to accommodating refugees, the IFRC said.

People are sleeping back-to-back in makeshift hangars as reception centres along the shore of the lake are overwhelmed, according to the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, which said the risk of a measles outbreak in the camps is also high.

The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) expects at least 200 000 refugees to reach Uganda from Congo's Ituri region this year [2018], after clashes between the Lendu and Hema people ended 15 years of relative peace in the area.

Congo is also dealing with its worst cholera outbreak in decades, which killed more than 1000 people last year [2017].

As of last month [March 2018], cases in the capital Kinshasa were declining, but the situation remained "alarming," according to the World Health Organization.

https://www.dailytrust.com.ng/yobe-cholera-outbreak-death-toll-hits-13.html


13 persons have been confirmed dead in 160 reported cases as cholera continues to ravage Gashua town in Bade local government area of Yobe state. Daily Trust reported on Saturday, 31 Mar 2018, that the victims were admitted at the hospital's isolation center, where 6 people died out of the 62 cases recorded. However, a laboratory test on 10 patient samples found 8 positive, ending doubts about whether the outbreak could be gastroenteritis.

Mr Hassan Gadaka, the head of Records and Statistics of the hospital told our correspondent that more deaths had been recorded, increasing the number to 13. "From our records now, we have 13 deaths out of the 160 cholera patients hospitalized. Among the dead was a child from the 18 children under the age of 5 admitted in the hospital.

He said the patients were brought from 7 affected wards in Gashua town and one in Yusufari local government area: Sabo Gari, Lawan Musa, Katuzu, Lawan fannami, Zango, Sarkin hausawa, and kachallari in Yusufari.

[8] Cholera - Nigeria (Borno State)

https://www.channelstv.com/2018/03/15/cholera-outbreak-kills-three-persons-in-borno/


The Borno State government has confirmed the deaths of 3 persons as a result of the cholera disease outbreak in the state. Commissioner of Health in the state, Dr Haruna Mshelia, disclosed this during an interview with Channels Television on Thursday, 12 Apr 2018, in Maiduguri. According to him, 693 persons have been diagnosed with the disease in villages around the Lake Chad area of the state.

Dr Mshelia noted that the outbreak 1st occurred 6 weeks ago in Baga, Doro Baga, Bundiram and Kukawa villages, while 77 samples were collected, out of which 69 confirmed the suspicion of cholera. He, however, said the state government has set up 2 treatment centers in Baga and Kukawa, respectively, to attend to all reported cases. The commissioner explained that the victims who lost their lives were brought to the treatment centre either in critical condition or dead on arrival. He maintained that the cases are common in areas recovered from Boko Haram terrorists, including Baga and Kukawa, which consist of people living in their homes and those at the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps.

On some of the causes of the outbreak, Mshelia said: "In those areas around the shores, the challenge they have is with open defecation because it is very difficult to build toilets there. Unless you have the means to use blocks, the soil is very loose, and if you dig a hole and just cover it, it collapses. So out of frustration, they practice open defecation, which is a recipe for cholera outbreaks, he added. The commissioner, however, said all water sources in the area have since been chlorinated, while locals are constantly being educated on cleanliness and other practices that would prevent them from contracting the disease. He was also hopeful that with only 3 new cases reported in Baga on Wed 11 Apr 2018, with none in Doro and Kukawa, the outbreak would be totally defeated with the measures put in place.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/apollo-hospital-reports-more-cholera-cases/articleshow/63564367.cms


The number of patients tested positive for cholera at the Apollo Specialty Cancer Hospital in Nandanam increased to 6, and the hospital's main branch on Greams Road notified a fresh case to the Greater Chennai Corporation on Sat 31 Mar 2018. However, the condition of all patients is stable, doctors said. Hospital authorities and doctors said they will not be able to reveal the names of the patients or their identities but said they have informed the civic authorities after stool samples were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ in the culture test.

A senior doctor at the Greams Road hospital said a patient from one of the N-E states was treated for diarrhoea a couple of days ago. "On Saturday [31 Mar 2018], the culture tests we had sent for also came as positive," said a senior doctor. The patient was discharged with advice of adequate hydration and antibiotics (doxycycline). The city health officer, Dr N A Senthilnathan, however, said that the civic body has received information only from the Nandanam hospital. "It is an outbreak within the hospital. The city or state hasn't seen cases for the last 2 years. We have no cases reported from anywhere else," he said.

The corporation and Metro Water have taken water samples from the hospital and surrounding areas in Nandanam. "We did not see contaminants in the samples. We are awaiting results of food samples. As of now, we have not seen any common link or reason for the outbreak," he said. Designated food safety officer in the city R Kathiravan, took food samples from hospitals and hotels. Doctors at the Nandanam hospital said all patients were moved to the isolation ward to prevent spread of the infection. Patients and attenders have been banned from eating food brought from outside the hospital. Doctors, nurses and paramedics have been put on alert, and there is stringent monitoring of hygiene and handwashing.

[Nosocomial outbreaks of _V. cholerae_ infections are not common but do occur and certainly reflect defects in infection prevention in the facility. The following are more recent publications in this regard:

Bwire G, Malimbo M, Kagirita A, et al: Nosocomial cholera outbreak in a mental hospital: Challenges and lessons learnt from Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital, Uganda. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2015;93: 534-538

Abstract
----------
During the last 4 decades, Uganda has experienced repeated cholera outbreaks in communities; no cholera outbreaks have been reported in Ugandan health facilities. In October 2008, a unique cholera outbreak was confirmed in Butabika National Mental Referral Hospital (BNMRH), Uganda. This article describes actions taken to control the outbreak, challenges, and lessons learnt. We reviewed patient and hospital reports for clinical symptoms and signs, treatment and outcome, patient mental diagnosis, and challenges noted during management of patients and contacts. Out of 114 BNMRH patients on two affected wards, 18 cholera cases and five deaths were documented for an attack rate of 15.8% and a case fatality rate of 28%. Wards and surroundings were intensively disinfected and 96 contacts (psychiatric patients) in the affected wards received chemoprophylaxis with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily until 5 Nov 2008. We documented a nosocomial cholera outbreak in BNMRH with a high case fatality of 28% compared with the national average of 2.4% for cholera outbreaks in communities. To avoid cholera outbreaks and potentially high mortality among patients in mental institutions, procedures for prompt diagnosis, treatment, disinfection, and prophylaxis are needed and preemptive use of oral cholera vaccines should be considered.

Abstract
-----------
On 20 Jul 2010, 3 cases of cholera were reported from a district hospital in Ca Mau province, Viet Nam. We investigated the likely source and mode of transmission of the outbreak. All hospitals in the province were requested to notify cases of acute watery diarrhea. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data were collected. Between 12 and 22 Jul 2010, 7 cases with positive culture for _Vibrio cholerae_ were identified. 6 cases were epidemiologically linked to the index case. Basic infection control practices were not in place at the hospital. Clinicians and public health staff should consider the possibility of nosocomial cholera transmission even in non-endemic areas. - Mod.LL]
