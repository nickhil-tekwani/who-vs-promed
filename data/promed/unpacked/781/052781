A domestic cat in Evergreen tested positive for bubonic plague last week, according to Jefferson County Public Health.

The health department said the cat stays near Bergen Mountain Road and Stagecoach Boulevard, close to Elk Meadow Park. It tested positive for plague Friday [5 Nov 2021], according to the health department.

The health department said this is the 1st case of plague confirmed in the county this year [2021]. The cat is suspected to have been infected by an encounter with a sick rodent, possibly a rat. [Rodents frequently carry fleas, and fleas transmit plague. - Mod.TG]

"While plague is a serious disease, and cases of animal-borne disease in household pets is never something we like to see, it is normal and expected for some animals to contract plague in Jefferson County each year," Jim Rada, director of Environmental Health Services at Jefferson County Public Health, said in a release. "The good news is modern antibiotics are effective against plague, and as long as it is treated promptly, severe complications, illness, or death can be avoided."

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria _Yersinia pestis_. It can be contracted by humans and pets if proper precautions are not taken.

Humans and pets may be infected with plague through bites from infected fleas, by the cough from an infected animal, or by direct contact with blood or tissues of infected animals, such as through a bite.

The health department said symptoms of plague in people may include sudden onset of high fever, chills, headache, nausea, and extreme pain and swelling of lymph nodes, occurring 2-7 days after exposure.

Plague can be effectively treated with antibiotics when diagnosed early, according to the health department. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should consult a doctor.

The health department recommends the following precautions to protect yourself and your pets from plague:

- Eliminate all sources of food, shelter, and access for wild animals around the home.
- Do not feed wild animals.
- Maintain a litter-free yard to reduce wild animal habitats.
- Avoid contact with sick or dead wild animals and rodents.
- Use precaution when handling sick pets. Have sick pets examined by a veterinarian.
- Consult with a veterinarian about flea and tick control for pets.
- Keep pets from roaming freely outside the home where they may prey on wild animals and bring the disease home with them.
- Do not let dogs off leash in the wild or in parks and open spaces.
- Whenever possible, keep cats indoors and do not let them free-roam the neighborhood.

In July [2021], the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said plague had been confirmed this year [2021] in La Plata, San Miguel, El Paso, Boulder, Huerfano, and Adams counties. A 10-year-old child died of plague in La Plata County in July [2021].

[A quick scan of ProMED archives indicates Colorado is reporting one or more cases of plague, in animals or people, about monthly. Please be sure you are treating your pet with veterinarian-recommended products for your area.

Plague, caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is an infectious disease found in small mammals, such as squirrels, other small rodents, and sometimes our domestic animals, and because it is a zoonotic disease, it may also affect people. It is usually transmitted in a cycle between fleas and the host. A host may be a dog, cat, squirrel, other rodents, or other animals or human beings. The flea transmits the disease between the various mammalian hosts.

"- People infected with _Y. pestis_ often develop symptoms after an incubation period of 1-7 days.
- There are 2 main clinical forms of plague infection: bubonic and pneumonic [actually there are 3 forms: bubonic, pneumonic, and some include septicemic. - Mod.TG]. Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes.'
- Plague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.
- Plague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30%-60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.
- Antibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives."

Cats
----
"Signs and diagnosis
The most common presentation of plague in cats is bubonic plague. Cats with bubonic plague usually have fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, and an enlarged lymph node that may be abscessed and draining. Ulcers in the mouth, skin abscesses (pockets of pus and infection), discharge from the eyes, diarrhea, vomiting, and diffuse spreading inflammation of tissues beneath the skin have also been documented. High fever may be present. Cats with primary septicemic plague have no obvious disease of the lymph nodes but have fever, lethargy, and poor appetite. Septic signs may also include diarrhea, vomiting, excessively rapid heart rate, weak pulse, and breathing distress. Primary pneumonic plague has not been documented in cats. Cats with secondary pneumonic plague may have all the signs of septicemic plague along with a cough and other abnormal lung sounds.

"To diagnose plague, your veterinarian will take samples (such as blood, fluid from the lymph nodes, or a swab from the mouth or throat) for testing and confirmation of the presence of plague-causing bacteria. Blood tests may also help.

"Treatment and prevention
Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"The duration of infectivity in treated cats is not known with certainty, but cats are thought to be noninfectious after 72 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment if there are indications of improvement. During the infectious period, cats should remain hospitalized, especially if there are signs of pneumonia. Human cases have occurred in cat owners trying to give medications by mouth at home, exposing them to contact with the mouth and associated infectious secretions.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs that suggest plague should be placed in isolation at a veterinary hospital, and infection control measures, should be implemented for the protection of you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected animal. Examples of infection control measures include disinfection, protective clothing (such as gloves and face masks), and possibly preventive antibiotics for in-contact animals or people. Your veterinarian will contact local public health officials so they can help minimize spread of the disease.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to the plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control. Your veterinarian can suggest the most appropriate flea control product for your cat."

Dogs
----
"Septicemic plague results when the plague spreads through the blood and affects multiple internal organs (such as the spleen, liver, heart, and lungs)."

"Dogs are inherently resistant to the plague-causing bacteria. Dogs becoming infected with plague are less likely to show signs of illness than infected cats. Signs may include fever, lethargy, inflammation of the lymph nodes below the lower jaw, a pus-like lesion along the jaw, lesions in the mouth, and cough.

"Due to the rapid progression of this disease, treatment for suspected plague (and infection control practices) should be started before a definitive diagnosis is obtained with bacterial cultures. Your veterinarian will recommend an antibiotic as standard treatment.

"Along with treatment and diagnostic considerations, protection of people and other animals and initiation of public health interventions are critical when an animal is suspected to have plague. Even before a diagnosis is complete, animals with signs suggestive of plague should be placed in isolation and infection control measures implemented to protect you and your family, other household pets, and any other animals or individuals that have had contact with the infected pet.

"To decrease the risk of pets and humans being exposed to plague, pet owners in areas where the disease may be found should keep their pets from roaming and hunting, limit their contact with rodent or rabbit carcasses, and use appropriate flea control.

Veterinarians are susceptible to plague, as bubos can rupture unexpectedly onto their hand(s) during the examination an animal. Any tiny cuts/scrapes could easily result in infection, as could possible inhalation of any bacteria.

Protecting your pets from fleas is critical for their well-being, and for yours. Fleas carry plague and potentially other diseases. But what do you use to treat your pet? There are a number of products on the market. However, some over-the-counter medications can be toxic to your pets, especially cats. A brand name does not mean safety and effectiveness. Please consult your veterinarian about safe and effective flea prevention. In some areas, fleas are resistant to some prevention products. The veterinarian is most familiar with what products are safe and effective in your area. - Mod.TG]
