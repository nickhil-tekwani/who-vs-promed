The Wayne County Public Health Department has received notice of a positive report for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in the town of Galen in Wayne County, according to the New York State Department of Health Arbovirus Laboratory.

Four horses died of EEE in September 2014, and now Wayne County Public Health is actively trapping mosquitoes in the town of Rose and Galen and sending them for testing on a weekly basis. Currently, no pools of mosquitoes have tested positive for EEE or West Nile virus. Unvaccinated horses are very vulnerable to the EEE virus and die from the disease if infected, the health department said.

EEE is a rare illness in humans and is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. It can affect humans, birds, horses and other mammals. Disease transmission does not occur directly from person to person or mammal to person contact, the health department said.

Mosquitoes are most active from dusk to dawn. WCPH is urging residents to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and protect themselves from potential exposure to the mosquito-borne illness until the 1st hard frost by:

**Limiting outdoor activities in areas where mosquitoes are most active and between dusk and dawn, which is the peak mosquito biting time.

**If you have to be outside, wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, shoes and socks.

**Repairing or replacing all window and door screens to keep mosquitoes outside.

**Reducing or eliminating all standing water.

**Emptying or disposing of pails, cans, flower pots, or similar water-holding containers.

**Clearing roof gutters, removing leaf debris from yards and gardens, and cleaning vegetation and debris from the edge of ponds.

**Turning over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use.

**Cleaning and chlorinating swimming pools, outdoor saunas and hot tubs and drain pool covers.

**Changing the water in birdbaths and horse troughs twice a week.

**Wearing insecticides such as DEET.

Health officials in Franklin County, New York, say a horse in St. Regis Falls suffered the 1st confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) this year [2015] in the North Country.

Amber Jones has grown up around horses her entire life and has boarded her horse in Franklin County for the past several years. She says she was stunned to hear that a horse in St. Regis Falls was euthanized for carrying a rare disease.

"When we heard about it, I, of course, got right online, looked up all the signs, and it was very scary knowing that it was lethal to horses, because you never know if your horse is going to come down with it," said Amber Jones, St. Regis Falls.

This month [September 2015], the Franklin County Department of Public Health announced that the horse had tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, a disease caused by being bitten by an infected mosquito. The disease can affect either humans or animals, but an animal cannot transmit the disease to a human, but rather an infected mosquito transmits the disease.

"There's neurological illness and coma, a swelling of the brain, and so it can make the horse and/or make the person very ill and potentially even die from the illness," said Kathleen Strack, director of public health, Franklin County, New York.

Strack says this was the 1st ever case of EEE in Franklin County and the 1st case in the North Country this year [2015]. The disease is almost always fatal in animals and humans, and anyone who survives is most likely left with brain damage. Jones says her barn is giving all its horses booster shots containing a preventive vaccine.

"Vaccines aren't 100 percent, and according to our vet, it can take up to 3 years having the vaccine for the horse to become completely immune to it," said Jones.

Strack says there is no vaccine for humans, but they are urging the public to take precautions such as wearing long sleeves, pants and using bug spray to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

"The time frame for most likely catching EEE is generally in the fall. The organism and disease peaks in the fall, and it takes a hard frost to kill off the mosquitoes," said Strack.

Symptoms in people can include a fever, headache and seizures, and Strack warns horse owners to keep an eye on any strange behaviors that could be neurological.

"Become familiar with the symptoms in humans and the signs in horses, and take extra steps to try and prevent it, because horses are our family, and we love our horses, and we don't want to lose them," said Jones. Jones says she hopes no other horse owner will have to face a loss from EEE.

Health officials say the disease is not contagious from person to person or from person to horse and can only be spread through an infected mosquito.

[The most effective prevention is vaccination. The EEE vaccine is usually combined with vaccines for West Nile virus and western equine encephalitis.

Most owners usually vaccinate in the spring, but immunity to EEE is the shortest and wanes within about 3-4 months. Owners are encouraged to vaccinate every 3 to 4 months to protect against EEE.

"In the United States, equine vaccines are available for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile Virus encephalomyelitis.

"The distribution of EEE has historically been restricted to the eastern, southeastern, and some southern states (but disease incidence is also reported in the upper Midwestern states of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin). Outbreaks of WEE have been recorded in the western and mid-western states. Variants of WEE have caused sporadic cases in the northeast and southeast, most notably Florida. VEE occurs in South and Central America but has not been diagnosed in the United States for more than 35 years. The availability of licensed vaccine products combined with an inability to completely eliminate risk of exposure justifies immunization against EEE and WEE as core prophylaxis for all horses residing in or traveling to North America and any other geographic areas where EEE and/or WEE is endemic.

"Transmission of EEE/WEE/VEE is by mosquitoes, and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects, to horses from wild birds or rodents, which serve as natural reservoirs for these viruses. Human beings are also susceptible to these diseases when the virus is transmitted to them by infected mosquitoes; however, horse-to-horse, or horse-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is highly unlikely, because the amount of virus in the blood of horses affected by EEE or WEE is small. The viremia that occurs with VEE is higher, and direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission is possible. Of these 3 encephalidites, WEE has the lowest mortality (about 50 percent). Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the most virulent for horses, with mortality approaching 90 percent. Epidemiological evidence indicates that young horses are particularly susceptible to disease caused by EEE. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis can also be lethal; however, some horses develop subclinical infections which result in lasting immunity.

"The risk of exposure and geographic distribution of EEE and WEE vary from year to year with changes in distribution of insect vectors and reservoirs important in the natural ecology of the virus. EEE activity in mosquito and birds, and resultant disease in humans and equids, continues to cause concern along the East Coast and demonstrates northward encroachment. WEE has caused minimal disease in horses in the last 2 decades; however, the virus continues to be detected in mosquitoes and birds throughout the Western states. In addition, variants that cause clinical disease in equids have been detected in the eastern US.

"VEE is a reportable foreign animal disease. Epidemics of VEE occur when the virus undergoes genetic change and develops greater virulence in avian and mammalian hosts. These viral variants are able to multiply to high levels in the horse, and then the horse becomes a reservoir in these outbreaks. Areas of Southern Texas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the West Coast of Florida are likely at the most risk for natural VEE encroachment from central and south America.

"Vaccination against VEE is controversial because:
1. Vaccination against a foreign animal disease may confound testing in the event of an outbreak. However, vaccination against EEE/WEE will also cause cross-reaction in VEE antibody testing.
2. Experimental and field data have demonstrated that previous infection with either EEE or WEE may provide cross-protection against VEE. It is therefore possible that EEE/WEE bivalent vaccination may provide partial cross-protection, although it is likely to be less than that following infection.
3. A conditionally available modified live (MLV) vaccine has been released during previous outbreaks. Should an outbreak occur, it is likely that this highly attenuated MLV would be released, and this MLV provides superior protection against transmissible viremia.

"In summary, horses that receive annual EEE/WEE vaccines may be partially protected against VEE infection. In the event of an outbreak, the availability of and vaccination with the highly effective MLV product would induce rapid, complete immunity while allowing for accurate surveillance before VEE specific vaccination. Killed VEE vaccine should be used only in high-risk areas of the US, at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, or when necessary, with input from state agriculture officials. The inactivated VEE vaccine is less effective that the MLV VEE vaccine, and will blunt responses to the MLV VEE vaccine.

"Vaccines
------
EEE/WEE vaccines currently available are formalin-inactivated adjuvanted whole-virus products. Early testing of bivalent (EEE/WEE) vaccines was performed by intracranial challenge with either EEE and WEE; the formalin-inactivated preparations were shown to be highly efficacious protecting against clinical disease. Currently, the only available VEE vaccines are killed products; an MLV would be conditionally released in the face of an outbreak.

"Vaccination schedules EEE/WEE
-----------------
Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6-month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4- to 6-week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs 1st.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4- to 6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the southeastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day [8-week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
