Japan: 40 People With Antibody Against Avian H5N2 Influenza Virus
-----------------------------------------------
About 40 people in Ibaraki Prefecture linked to chicken farms are
suspected of having been infected with the H5N2 strain of bird flu in
the past, informed sources said on Saturday [7 Jan 2006]. They showed
no symptoms and there is no possibility of secondary infection, the
sources said.
The health ministry and National Institute of Infectious Diseases
have reportedly been testing farm workers. Chickens at some 40 farms
in Ibaraki Prefecture have been infected with the H5N2 strain of bird
flu since June 2005, but the ministry and the institute suspect farm
workers might have been infected before then, the sources said.
A former employee of a farm in Kyoto Prefecture was found in February
2004 to be infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus,
which is more harmful than H5N2 and could be fatal to humans.
If the latest cases of avian flu are confirmed, they would be the 1st
involving humans since that incident. Because the antibody [against]
the H5N2 strain is weak, there are no defining marks of infection,
such as birds dying en masse.

[It would be very helpful if similar serosurveys were conducted (with
information on results disseminated) in countries with widespread
H5N1 activity to see the background level of infection with H5N1. - Mod.MPP]
