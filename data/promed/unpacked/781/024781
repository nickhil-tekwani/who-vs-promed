Uganda's health ministry on Tuesday [23 Jan 2018] said at least 3 more people have succumbed to the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in the country's 3 central districts.

Ruth Aceng, the Minister for Health, told reporters here that at least 5 suspected cases have tested positive of RVF, including 3 deaths in the central districts of Kiboga, Buikwe and Mityana.

The latest RVF cases were reported on 19 Jan [2018] in the 3 districts in the East African country.

This new number brings the total number of people who have succumbed to the fever, which broke out in August 2017, to 5. At least 2 cases died of the fever in November 2017 [see ProMED-mail post Rift Valley fever - Uganda 20171126.5465725>].

"Since August 2017, when suspected cases were reported, 5 cases of the RVF have been confirmed. Unfortunately, we have lost 3 cases of the RVF from Kiboga, Buikwe and Mityana districts," said Aceng.

The minister said that a joint National Rapid Response team has been dispatched to the affected districts to handle the situation.

RVF is a viral zoonosis that can also infect humans. Most human infections result from contact with the blood or organs of infected animals.

The disease can result in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.

[Rift Valley fever virus is endemic in Uganda, and human cases occur there sporadically. The above report and the previous one in November 2017 make no mention of cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in domestic animals in the area where the human cases occurred. Farm animals are the main reservoirs and amplifiers of RVF virus.

RVF outbreaks very often involve significant numbers of ill and dead small ruminant animals and abortions. It is odd that no small ruminant animal cases are mentioned, unless the animals had been vaccinated previously and are immune.

RVF virus can persist for a long time in some areas, maintained in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes that deposit eggs in seasonally-flooded areas, where those eggs are transovarially infected with the virus. Adult female mosquitoes coming from infected eggs can transmit the virus during their 1st blood meals. Eradicating the virus from these areas is not possible with current technology.

As Mod. AB noted: "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic disease caused by a virus of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus affects different animal species (buffaloes, camels, cattle, goats, and sheep) and can pass to humans either by direct contact through blood or body fluids during slaughter or ingestion of contaminated meat or indirectly through arthropod biting, especially by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_."
