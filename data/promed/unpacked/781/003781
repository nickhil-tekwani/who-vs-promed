TOXIC JELLYFISH - AUSTRALIA: INCREASED RISK

An expert on jellyfish says changing human behaviour, rather than
Irukandji numbers, are to blame for an increase in stings this season.
At least 10 people have been treated at Broome Hospital's emergency
department with Irukandji syndrome since Christmas [2009] -- more than
double the number of serious stings last wet season.
The past decade has seen only 2 Irukandji-related fatalities, but
James Cook University's Marine and Tropical Biology associate
professor, Jamie Seymour, says the increase in stings will continue.
"This problem is not going to go away, it's only going to get worse,
for 2 reasons," he said. "First, you're going to put more and more
people in the water, so more people are going to get stung. But
second, what we're seeing on the east coast, and I suspect it's
happening in the west as well, is that with increased water
temperatures now occurring, with temps staying higher for longer,
we're now seeing a consistent increase in the length of the stinger
season."

[The Irukandji jellyfish (_Carukia barnesi_) inhabits waters of
Australia. This is a deadly jellyfish that is very difficult to spot
as it is only 2.5 centimeters [1 in] (with bell and tentacles) in
diameter. The Irukandji is believed to be the most venomous creature
in the world.
The Irukandji jellyfish has been seen in Fraser Island, an island in
northern Queensland, 250 kilometres [155 mi] north of Brisbane.
The syndrome has also been described throughout the Pacific and
recently from waters of Florida.
Dr Seymour (James Cook University) said the tourist industry should be
warning people about the jellyfish because global warming may be
changing water temperatures allowing the dangerous Irukandji jellies
to live in new areas including some tourist destinations.
Irukandji syndrome symptoms are a catastrophic complex of clinical
signs and symptoms. The initial sting is typically mild and is
followed, minutes to hours later, by vomiting, profuse sweating,
headache, agitation, rapid heart rate, and very high blood pressure.
The increase in blood pressure may be life threatening and can be
associated with abnormal heartbeat and heart failure. The symptoms may
last from hours to several days, and victims usually require
hospitalization. Though the syndrome was first described almost 50
years ago, its pharmacological basis and a specific treatment have
eluded investigators.
In rare cases, the victim suffers pulmonary edema, which could be
fatal if not treated.
Dr Michael Corkeron, director of intensive care at the state's
Townsville Hospital, has discovered a remarkably simple yet effective
treatment for the potentially fatal stings of the venomous Irukandji
jellyfish. He has successfully treated patients with magnesium
infusions delivered by intravenous drip. Doctors in Queensland say
magnesium infusion can fight the jellyfish's lethal venom.
The treatment has been tested on pigs. Doctors have now reported
success in humans. Dr Corkeron said: "The remarkable thing is that
magnesium infusion is a long-established, very safe, and inexpensive
treatment."
