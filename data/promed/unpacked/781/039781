An outbreak of acute respiratory illness has been taking place in the last
2 weeks in a military base in southern Israel. Clinical surveillance data
have indicated an increase in ILI (influenza-like illness) cases compared
with adjacent military bases, and 16 radiologically confirmed pneumonia
cases have been identified so far, mainly in new recruits. The majority of
the pneumonia cases quickly resolved with appropriate antibiotic treatment,
but in 2 cases serious complications have occurred which required treatment
in intensive care units.
An epidemiological investigation was initiated by the Epidemiology Section
of the IDF Army Health Branch. Active case finding was initiated, along
with environmental testing and clinical questioning of hundreds of
soldiers. Laboratory testing, including pharyngeal and nasopharyngeal
swabs for extensive bacteriological and virological testing, serological
blood testing and urinary sampling for various antigens was performed, in a
sample of over 100 contacts and base personnel, as well as in all confirmed
pneumonia cases. All new recruits in the affected base were sent home, to
prevent further disease dissemination in the dense housing settings in the
recruits' quarters.
Laboratory testing is still underway, but preliminary lab results have
implicated _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (fully antibiotic sensitive) as the
causative agent in 5 of the pneumonia cases, with a single serotype
identified in 3 of these cases. The results also suggest a considerable
(greater than 40 percent) _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ carriage rate in the
sampled contact group. In view of these findings, prophylactic treatment
with azithromycin (500 mg once a week for 2 weeks) was initiated for all
base personnel, and, in addition, a 23-valent unconjugated pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine was administered to new recruits (and their
instructors) on this military base. Continuous monitoring for additional
cases is currently employed, and no new confirmed pneumonia cases have been
identified in the last 2 days.

It may be worthwhile in this outbreak to consider the possibility that the
cause is a fungal disease -- emmonsiosis caused by _Emmonsia crescens_ or
_E. parva_ (teleomorph genus Ajellomyces, Ascomycetes). This dimorphic
fungus normally lives in the soil and produces very small conidia that can
be inhaled by rodents and other mammals including man, which then produce
large spherules called adiaspores in the lungs of affected hosts.
A recent paper reports the presence of both _E. crescens_ and _E. parva_ in
Israeli soil, as detected indirectly by emmonsiosis diagnosed in blind
moles (_Spalax_).

[Although pneumococcal disease seems to be the culprit of the lower
respiratory infection in this Israeli outbreak , Dr. Hubalek has brought up
a human dimorphic fungal infection that is relatively uncommon.
Emmonsiosis (also called adiaspiromycosis) is much more commonly a
pulmonary infection of small mammals (reported by Dr. Hubalek and others)
but has been described in humans as well (e.g., refs. 1-4).
The term adiaspiromycosis is derived from the human form of the infection,
the adiaconidium, which (at body temperature) progressively enlarges from a
spore of 2 to 4 microns to one 200-400 microns or more in size without
internal replication. This is unlike the spherule of coccidioidomycosis,
in which internal endospores are found; the cocci spherule does not become
as large as well. The lack of endospores suggests that no intrahost
replication actually occurs.
Human infection (perhaps 60 cases have been described) was first recognized
in France but has been described in many countries in Europe as well as in
Latin America and the USA. I am not aware of any clusters of cases.
The typical case is a symptomatic (cough, low-grade fever, sometimes
hemoptysis) male who is being evaluated for one or more pulmonary
nodule. Histopathologically, a granulomatous (usually but not always
noncaseating) reaction is found with an adiaconidium in it. The
adiaconidium is usually empty and round or oval, but due to collapse
(probably in processing), crescent, sickle, or barbell forms can be seen
and can look like a helminth. Severe cases with inhalation of many spores
can result in acute respiratory failure as can occur in histoplasmosis and
coccidioidomycosis, diseases caused by 2 much more well-known dimorphic
fungi that can affect humans.
