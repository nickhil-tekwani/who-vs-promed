The ban on movements of foot and mouth disease (FMD) susceptible animals
remains in place throughout Great Britain. However, in accordance with the
contingency plan, a veterinary assessment of the risk from licensing these
moves has been carried out. The decision has been taken to permit the
movement of live animals direct to slaughter and the collection of dead
animals from farms from 00.01 hours on Thu 9 Aug 2007. These general
licenses will only apply outside of the Protection and Surveillance Zones.
In the view of the chief veterinary officer (CVO), the emerging conclusions
of epidemiological investigations, and the on-going surveillance and
testing indicate that there is a low, but not negligible, risk of the
spread of FMD from the Protection and Surveillance Zones to the rest of the
country.
CVO Debby Reynolds said: "My assessment is that these licensed moves
outside of the Protection and Surveillance Zones present a low risk
provided the conditions are strictly followed. I continue to urge all
farmers to take the highest level of biosecurity measures and to follow the
conditions of these licenses in every respect.
"I have today ordered culling on suspicion of foot and mouth disease on one
farm adjacent to the 2nd infected premises in the Protection Zone confirmed
yesterday. Test results this morning have revealed that the strain of the
virus found on the 2nd infected premises is a 01 BFS67-like strain. This is
the same as the strain identified on the 1st farm on 4 Aug 2007. This is a
developing situation, and our surveillance activity is on-going."
Movements and collections will only be permitted to take place in
accordance with strict licensing conditions, including biosecurity measures
on-farm, in transport, and at abattoirs. Only those abattoirs that meet the
specific conditions requiring stringent biosecurity, and which have
appropriate Meat Hygiene Service inspection and supervision, will be
permitted to accept livestock for slaughter.

A 3rd outbreak of FMD was feared last night [8 Aug 2007], but Debby
Reynolds, the chief veterinary officer, announced a partial lifting of the
national ban on the movement of cattle to ease fears of a meat shortage in
shops at the weekend.
Ms Reynolds has ordered a cull at a farm inside the existing 3 km
protection zone around 2 affected farms in Surrey because of suspicions
that more cattle have become infected with the highly contagious disease. A
3rd farm in the village of Normandy has fields adjoining the 2nd farm to be
infected.
All cattle at the 2nd farm were culled on Tuesday [7 Aug 2007]. Ms Reynolds
said: "I have ordered a culling on suspicion of foot-and-mouth on a farm
adjacent to the 2nd infected premises."
The partial lifting of the travel ban from midnight raised hopes for other
farmers outside the 3 km protection zone and 10-km surveillance zone near
Guildford that they can get back to "business as usual."
They will be allowed to resume sending their animals for slaughter to
abattoirs with strict biosecurity measures, and they can arrange for the
collection of dead animals from farms, but farmers' markets and the
movement of animals across roads are still banned.
The partial lifting of the ban came after warnings that retailers could
start running out of meat at the weekend. Ministers and farmers are keeping
their fingers crossed that, in spite of a suspected 3rd outbreak, the
partial lifting of the ban will herald the beginning of the end of the crisis.
The chief veterinary officer admitted there was a "low" risk that the
disease could still spread to the rest of the country. "It is my view that
the emerging conclusions of the epidemiological work and the ongoing
testing indicate there is a low but not negligible risk of the spread of
foot-and-mouth disease from the protection and the surveillance zone to the
rest of the country," she said.
She denied that the decision partially to lift the ban was driven by
financial pressures on the government, which is facing claims for millions
in pounds in compensation from farmers. "Absolutely not," she said "This is
based on my veterinary assessment."
Farmers are still prevented from exporting their meat for the next 3 months
under Monday's [6 Aug 2007] EU ruling, but there may be moves to have it
lifted early.
Asked whether she now believed that the situation was under control, Ms
Reynolds said that it was still very early. She added: "We have got 2
infected premises and a new premises that has been culled on suspicion."
Peter Ainsworth, shadow environment secretary, said: "The news that further
culling is to take place in Surrey will come as a bitter blow to the farmer
concerned, and he has my deepest sympathy. The fact that the need for this
arises from a dangerous contact, however, suggests that the disease is not
spreading widely, but we can only wait and hope at this stage."
The president of the National Farmers' Union, Peter Kendall, described the
easing of the ban as a "measured and very necessary 1st step on the road
towards getting the industry back to normal and maintaining supplies of
home-produced meat to consumers." He added: "It is as vital as ever that
livestock farmers remain vigilant, check their stock regularly and report
anything suspicious immediately. The highest possible standards of
biosecurity must be maintained."
He indicated that discussions were taking place between the NFU and Hilary
Benn's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs aimed at a further
easing of the ban to allow some farm animals to be moved on welfare
grounds. "We recognize there are growing concerns over animal welfare,
ranging from cattle due to calve away from the farm through shortages of
forage to pigs needing to move to suitable housing after weaning," Mr
Kendall said yesterday [8 Aug 2007].

[We are informed by ProMED-mail rapporteur Joe Dudley that according to
local media reports, the new culling operation involves cows, sheep, pigs
and goats at a farm in the village of Normandy, Surrey. The farm is
advertised on the web as a producer and vendor of "free range" pork/bacon,
beef/veal, lamb, and mutton products.
Culling of other susceptible species on suspected or confirmed-infected
premises does not necessarily mean that these animals have been found
infected; possibly, the suspicion involves bovines. Details are expected to
be included in UK's follow-up report to the OIE.
All 3 outbreaks so far -- including the new one, which at this stage is
regarded as suspected -- are located in the village of Normandy. An
additional cattle herd was culled in Elstead, about 7 km south of Normandy,
in a 2nd farm property of the owner of the index farm. There are, thus, 2
protection zones: one around Normandy and the Pirbright laboratory complex
site; the other one around Elstead. Both protection zones of 3-km radius
around the foci are located within one surveillance zone of 10-km radius
from the foci. A written description of the protection and surveillance
zones and a map are available at
