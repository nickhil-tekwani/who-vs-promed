It may be assumed that the given number of 2 cases out of 100
susceptible animals stands for clearly clinically affected animals,
others probably subclinically affected, a known phenomenon in adult
small ruminants.
A summary of the Israeli epizootic since its start on 28 Dec 2006,
including a map showing all 22 outbreaks recorded so far and links to
the initial immediate notification and the 10 previous follow-up
reports, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=ISR&public_disease=1&reportid=4351>.
The recent spread of the disease into southern Israel seems to be
related to its distribution in the southern part (Hebron area) of the
West Bank (see item 2, below). This will be clearly demonstrable when
one looks at the 2 summarising WAHID maps, referred to in the 2
reports. - Mod.AS]

Epidemiology
Source of infection:
-introduction of new live animals
-illegal movement of animals
-contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering
Epidemiological comments
The post-mortem examination of young animals revealed typical lesions
of "tiger heart". A very high mortality among lambs and kids aged
less than 2 years was observed.
A mass vaccination was applied in all districts of the West Bank. The
total amount of vaccinated animals is 350 000. Vaccination is ongoing.
Control measures
Measures already applied
-movement control inside the country
-vaccination in response to the outbreak (s)
-disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
-quarantine
-vaccination permitted
-treatment of affected animals (symptomatic treatment and
oxy-tetracycline injection)
Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Beit-Dagan laboratory (Local laboratory)
Test: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date: 22 Mar 2007
Result: positive

[For the original notification, including a map showing the 7 new
outbreaks, subscribers are referred to the source URL above. Two of
the outbreaks are situated in the southern part of the West Bank
(Outbreak 3 in Tarameh, Durah, and outbreak 4 in Zahret Nada,
Bethlehem); see commentary to the item on FMD in Israel.
The given outbreak statistics demonstrate a significantly higher
mortality rate in the susceptible goat population, compared to sheep.
This is mainly due to the fact that the timing of parturition of
goats in the affected region (Israel and Palestinian Authority (PAT),
as well as Jordan) is, generally, one to 2 months later than in
sheep. Hence, in goat flocks affected in March [2007], the proportion
of young, susceptible offspring is higher than in sheep flocks,
leading to the observed higher mortality rate.
A summary of the PAT epizootic since its reported start on 2 Feb
2007, including a map showing all 17 outbreaks recorded so far and
links to the initial immediate notification and the 2 previous
follow-up reports, is available at
