A 42-year-old McKinley County woman died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), officials with the New Mexico Department of Health reported this week.

The fatality is the 2nd case of HPS confirmed in New Mexico in 2019, and the 1st death.

The woman's name was not released, but the state Department of Health said it completed an environmental investigation at the woman's home to help reduce risk to others.

New Mexico reported a total of 114 HPS cases with 49 deaths between 1975 and 2018, according to statistics from the state health department.

During that time period, 2 cases were reported in Lincoln County, 4 in Otero County, one in Dona Ana County. No cases were reported in Eddy, Lea and Chaves counties.

State health officials reported a case of HPS last month [May 2019] in another McKinley County woman, who survived. In 2017, there were 5 cases of HPS in New Mexico and no cases in 2018.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a severe, respiratory disease in humans that is fatal in about 40 percent of cases.

In New Mexico, the deer mouse is the main carrier for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain, that can be transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva that contain the microscopic virus, the release stated.

People can contract the disease [virus] when they breathe in virus that is suspended in the air [on small, aerosolized bits of material], but it is not contagious from one person to another.

"We urge New Mexicans to be mindful when they are opening up sheds, cabins, and other buildings that have been closed up, as mice and other rodents may have moved in," said Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel.

"Stirring up dust in areas where rodents hang out -- that includes everything from nests to droppings -- can cause the virus to get into the air where the particles can be breathed in. It's best to air out cabins and sheds before entering them and wet down droppings with a disinfectant."

Hantavirus disease surveillance in the United States began in 1993 during an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in the 4 Corners region, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HPS became a nationally notifiable disease in 1995 and is now reported through the Nationally Notifiable Disease Surveillance System when fever is present in a patient with laboratory-confirmed evidence of [a] hantavirus infection.

In 2014, the Council of State & Territorial Epidemiologists expanded the national reporting of laboratory confirmed hantavirus infections to include HPS and non-pulmonary hantavirus infection. Reporting of non-pulmonary hantavirus cases began in 2015.

State health officials encouraged healthcare providers and the public to become familiar with the signs of [a] hantavirus infection.

Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and cough, which rapidly progress to respiratory distress.

The signs typically develop within 1-6 weeks after rodent exposure, state health officials said. Although there is no specific treatment for HPS, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.

Patients are encouraged to tell their provider if they have had an exposure to rodents, their nests or droppings within the 2 months prior to their illness.

Prevention
- Air out closed-up buildings, storage rooms, trailers, cabins and overwintered vehicles before entering.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Soak down rodent nests and droppings using a disinfectant [such as a 10% bleach solution] before cleaning up.
- Don't sweep rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles to reduce attracting rodents.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

[Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in New Mexico. That hantavirus and its deer mouse host are identified as the source of the virus that caused this fatal case of HPS. The disease can progress rapidly to serious pulmonary compromise, so early medical attention is essential. Although an environmental investigation of the woman's home was carried out, no details of the finding are reported. Presumably, there was evidence of deer mouse presence there. The advice offered in the above report for prevention of exposure to Sin Nombre virus should be heeded not only in New Mexico, but throughout the deer mouse's extensive geographic range.
