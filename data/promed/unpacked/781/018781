Four people have been taken to hospital after apparently being poisoned by
wild growing mushrooms. These cases resulted from 2 incidents; one in
Pavlograd, involving one 29 year old man, and the other in Pershotravensk,
involving a 69 year old woman, her son, 46, and daughter, 47 years old.

The previous outbreak was reported on 30 Sep 2009, which involved 5 people.

[There are many types of poisonous mushrooms. Some mushrooms are not
poisonous at one stage of growth but become poisonous as they grow. Very
often even trained mycologists may have some difficulty.

Mushrooms can produce a variety of clinical signs, including death. This
article doesn't tell us about the clinical signs or the outcome of the
individuals affected, so it is impossible to speculate on the mushrooms
involved. However, we wish all the individuals a speedy recovery. - Mod.TG
