State public health officials are warning people on Martha's Vineyard about
the dangers of a potentially fatal disease known as "rabbit fever," after 6
new cases were identified.
Cases of the disease tularemia, or rabbit fever, have occurred on Martha's
Vineyard every year since an initial outbreak in 2000 sickened 15 people
and resulted in a fatality, according to the Department of Public Health
(DPH). More than 2 dozen confirmed cases have been reported on the island
in the last 5 years.
Tularemia is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rabbits. It
can be contracted through the bite of an infected dog tick, when an open
sore or cut comes into contact with the bacteria or by inhaling the spores.
Symptoms include a lesion on the skin, swollen lymph nodes and flu-like
problems. Tularemia is not spread from person to person. A few people have
gotten sick after bites from their infected pet cats.
Those affected on Martha's Vineyard range in age from 33 to 67 and became
ill between 13 May and 5 Jul 2006, the DPH said. All 6, 4 of whom are
employed as landscapers, have been treated and are recovering, officials
said. All of the cases reported in 2006 had the respiratory form of the
disease -- pneumonic tularemia -- according to the DPH's announcement late
this week. "While landscapers should definitely take precautions, anyone
working outside near lawn mowing or brush cutting activities should also be
careful," Dr Bela Matyas, DPH medical director for epidemiology, said in a
statement.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mark Liao for contributing this report. Human infection
with _Francisella tularensis_, a Category A bioterrorism agent, continues
to be a problem on Martha's Vineyard, a 100 square mile island off the
southern coast of Cape Cod, MA. A substantial number of the cases are
pneumonic, occurring in landscapers and gardeners, related to the
aerosolization of infective bacteria.
Telford and colleagues (1) have investigated the genetic diversity of _F.
tularensis_ obtained from Martha's Vineyard ticks. Between 2001 and 2003,
0.7 per cent of 4246 dog ticks (_Dermacentor variabilis_) harbored the
tularemia bacillus, and there was a degree of genotypic diversity
suggestive of long-standing enzootic transmission of the infection on the
island. The authors review information regarding the island's tularemia,
which appears to have been a relatively recent introduction into
Massachusetts. They state that prior to 1937, only one case of the
infection was recognized, related to contaminated rabbit meat from the
mid-western USA. In 1937, however, more than 20 000 cottontail rabbits from
the mid-western states of Missouri and Kansas were introduced into the
mainland state and Martha's Vineyard for sporting purposes (2). Cases began
to occur starting several years later.
