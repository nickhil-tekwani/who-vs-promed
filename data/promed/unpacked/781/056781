[Dates of collection are not given, but are probably within the last 2
weeks. So there is active transmission on eastern Long Island (where a
number of horses died of WNV infection last year), Staten Island (site of
this year's non-fatal human case) & in Rockland County, north of the Bronx
(with the most WNV-positive birds this year). - Mod.JW
