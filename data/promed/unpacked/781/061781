A new strain of a very contagious and common dog virus, canine parvovirus (CPV), has been discovered in Australia. University of Adelaide researchers say they have confirmed cases of the variation of the virus in South Australia and Victoria over the past 2 years. The viral infection attacks the cells lining a dog's small intestine, leading to bloody diarrhea, and it can be fatal.

The new strain is spreading around the world but until now there have no confirmed Australian cases. Along with the cases in South Australia and Victoria, there have been suspected cases of the strain, CPV-2c, in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

Veterinary virologist Farhid Hemmatzadeh says the variation may not show up in existing diagnostic tests for CPV and dogs already vaccinated against CPV may not be protected. He says despite this, Australian dog deaths have not recently spiked. "So I think it's a case of being alert, not alarmed," Professor Hemmatzadeh said in a statement on [Fri 28 May 2017].

There is no specific treatment for the virus, which mostly affects puppies aged between 6 weeks and 6 months. But dogs can be hospitalized and given intravenous fluid therapy, medication to stop their vomiting and antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections until they recover.

[If this strain of the virus is spreading worldwide, then let us hope vaccine researchers are working on finding a vaccine for this strain. Hopefully that vaccine will come soon, and can be incorporated into existing vaccines.

Although deaths have not increased, it is devastating to an owner to lose their pet to such as this, when they think they have vaccinated against it. Furthermore there is always the possibility this strain could become more virulent. - Mod.TG
