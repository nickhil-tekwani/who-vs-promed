Health and Child Welfare Minister denies bird flu death
-------------------------------------------------------
Mystery surrounds the cause of death of MDC-T [Movement for a
Democratic Change - Tsvangirai] legislator. News reports said that the
senator had died of avian influenza or bird flu, but health expects
deny there any cases of the disease in the country. Health and Child
Welfare Minister Henry Madzorera said the government had not raised
any alerts of an outbreak of the disease as they had not received
reports of a possible epidemic. “The Epidemics and Disease Control
centre has not informed me about any outbreak, but they are closed and
we can only know that after the holidays,” he said. Madzorera said
he could not comment further as he had not received any news of an
outbreak.

Officials from the Health Ministry also revealed that there were no
known cases of the virus in Zimbabwe or in the region. They said it
was highly unlikely that there could have been an outbreak in the
country. The only recently recorded cases, the officials said, were
reported in Hong Kong and a spread to Zimbabwe at this stage was
highly improbable.

But the family of the late senator insist that post-mortem results had
indicated that the deceased senator had been afflicted with the deadly
avian virus. The Standard could not have access to the post-mortem
report. To add to the mystery, a Kadoma doctor reportedly declined to
carry out a postmortem and instead referred the family to a hospital
in Harare. “We were told that she had a swelling in her stomach
because there was water in her lungs, but this did not make sense to
us,” an informed source said. The source said before her death, the
senator was down with influenza, she however developed an unnamed
infection in her chest.

In the past Zimbabwe’s health systems have been reported to be
incapable of handling epidemics such as bird and swine flu. In 2010 it
was reported that some children in Tsholotsho were affected by swine
flu. However, results on whether it was actually swine flu were
inconclusive.

[As inferred in the previous post, there is no evidence, other than an
inconclusive autopsy report, to establish the cause of death of the
Zimbabwean senator. While avian A/(H5N1) virus infection cannot be
excluded, in the absence of any laboratory investigation there is
nothng to support this diagnosis, particularly as the disease has not
been reported in Zimbabwean poultry. - Mod.CP.
