From: Nick Honhold <nick@plewland.demon.co.uk>

I have talked today with Dr Pathak who is the head of the rabies Control
Section here in Kathmandu (50 yards or so from my office in the vet
complex) and he is preparing a summary of the rabies vaccine production
there and dog rabies control measures. That lab is the only one producing
rabies vaccine in Nepal (using sheep brains) though some vaccine is
imported from India and "modern" vaccines such as human diploid cell
vaccine and RIG are available in private (and so expensive) clinics in the
capital. I will also try and include the figures, such as they are, on
animal rabies from our animal disease database which we maintain in the
Central Epidemiology Unit of the Animal Health Division. Bear with us a
couple of days please and we can hopefully shed some light on the figures
Dr Joshi passed on to you.
