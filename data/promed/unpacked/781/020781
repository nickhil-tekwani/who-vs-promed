MRSA, EQUINES: RFI
==================

I am a microbiologist in a small state lab, associated with our Vet.
School and Hospital (large animals only). In fall of 1993 we got our
first MRSA [Methicillin resistant Staph.aureus] isolate. We were
quite alarmed and warned the hospital but they were not too concerned!
We have gradually gotten more and more isolates and the concern is that
vet. med students are becoming carriers and taking the MRSA away with
them. The hospital has finally instituted control measures (isolation,
pre and post cultures etc.) after a couple of 'negative outcomes' but
we have no epidemiologist on staff and little information about MRSA
in animals.

Our isolates are mostly equine post-surgical, but it has been
difficult to determine where the animals get it from. Sometime it may
take a week or more to show up in wound drainage, or is associated
with jugular thrombosis. Does anyone else have experience with MRSA
in a veterinary hospital or horses? Are environmental cultures
useful? Pre- and post-surgical cultures? How does one clean what is
really a barn! What is recommended for possible human carriers of
MRSA around animals?

[- Conversation with our clinicians indicates that these might be
Staph.intermedius infections as these are more usually seen in horses
and dogs than classic Staph.aureus. MHJ]
