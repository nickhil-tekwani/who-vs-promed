Import Foods Wholesale Inc in St Paul, Minnesota is recalling: Smoked Croaker, Smoked Barracuda, Smoked Big Eye, and Smoked Red Snapper after it was discovered by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory personnel who confirmed that the product was not properly eviscerated prior to processing.

This product may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal foodborne illness.

The sale of improperly eviscerated fish, 5 inches [13 cm] in length or greater, is prohibited because _C. botulinum_ spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to outbreaks of botulism poisoning which may pose a potentially life-threatening health hazard.

The following recalled products were sold to retail stores in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa:
- Smoked Croaker in a 10 lb cardboard box with a code: 298/11 and is a product of Guyana.
- Smoked Barracuda in a 10 lb cardboard box with a code: 0282/011 and is a product of Guyana.
- Smoked Big Eye in a 10 lb cardboard box with a code: 287L10 and is a product of Guyana.
- Smoked Red Snapper in a 10 lb cardboard box with a code: 298-11 and is a product of Guyana.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem. Consumers who have Smoked Croaker, Smoked Barracuda, Smoked Big Eye, or Smoked Red Snapper are advised not to eat it, but should return it to the place of purchase.
