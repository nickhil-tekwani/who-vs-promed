Emergency report:
Translation of a fax received on 24 June 1998 from Dr M. Eloit, Deputy
Head, Department of Food Quality and Animal and Plant Health Actions,
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Paris:
Location of the outbreak: Gard department, Languedoc-Roussillon region (in
the south of the country).
Description of affected animal: an abandoned dog (a cross between a German
shepherd dog and a Siberian husky) found in NÃ®mes was taken to a veterinary
surgery on 26 May 1998, and died on 28 May 1998 at the dog pound of the
Animal Protection Society in Vallerargues.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible cases deaths destroyed
7 1 1 6*
* domestic carnivores in contact with the affected dog at the veterinary
surgery or dog pound.
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Pasteur Institute, Paris.
B. Diagnostic tests used: immunofluorescence, ELISA and virus isolation on
cell culture.
C. Causal agent: genotype 1 lyssavirus. This is not the same as fox virus
responsible for the epizootic of sylvatic rabies in France during the past
three decades.
Source of agent/origin of infection: this canine strain is not of European
origin. It is close to a strain found in the north of Egypt. It seems
likely that the strain originates, directly or indirectly, from that region
of Africa and/or the Middle East. The dog was probably introduced illegally
into the territory of the European Union.
Control measures during reporting period: the Gard department has been
officially declared infected with rabies, by Order of 8 June 1998,
published in the Journal Officiel de la Republique Francaise on 10 June 1998.
