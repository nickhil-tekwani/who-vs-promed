[According to the latest report on the situation of HPAI in Germany, which was presented on 23 Apr 2021 in the ScoPAFF meeting of the European Commission: "Some of the outbreaks in Baden-Wurttemberg are situated closer than 10 or even 3 km [6.2 or 1.9 mi, respectively] from the French and the Swiss border. The competent authorities have been informed without undue delay." See https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20210423_pres_hpai_deu.pdf.

Regarding the outbreak in Bulgaria, given the presence of HPAI H5N8 in the region, there is a high likelihood that this recent outbreak reported by Bulgaria is also associated with this same subtype.
