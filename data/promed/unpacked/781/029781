[1] China: Optimization of non-pharmaceutical interventions and latest epidemiology
[A] New coronavirus variant could emerge as China COVID cases explode

https://www.livemint.com/news/world/experts-warn-new-covid-variant-could-emerge-as-china-covid-cases-explode-11671093861795.html


A recent study report by researchers in Hong Kong titled "Modelling the adjustment of COVID-19 response and exit from dynamic zero-COVID in China" [see below] stated that explosive growth of infection rates in China could also lead to mutations of the virus.

The study is co-authored by Kathy Leung, Gabriel M Leung, and Joseph Wu. Gabriel Leung is the former dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong. (The report was published Wednesday [14 Dec 2022] and is a preprint, meaning it hasn't yet been certified by peer review.)

A reopening that sees a high R rate -- the basic reproduction number for the virus -- would "result in a large number of infections that could potentially accelerate mutation, selection and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viruses," the researchers wrote. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID.

It's no longer possible to determine China's R rate after the government stopped releasing numbers of new asymptomatic cases [from 14 Dec 2022].

[China announced on 14 Dec 2022 that it will no longer report asymptomatic COVID cases; https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-stops-publishing-asymptomatic-covid-19-cases-reports-no-deaths. - Mod.LWW]

As part of efforts to return to normalcy and out of concern for a potential wider outbreak once controls are loosened, China started enforcing a more lenient version of its strict "zero COVID" policy.

The study also suggests that the unregulated lifting of restrictions might cause the death of nearly one million people in China (https://www.livemint.com/news/world/new-warning-for-china-covid-deaths-in-the-country-could-hit-10-lakh-says-study-11671091988274.html).

Just the day after restrictions were lifted, the nation reported 21 165 new coronavirus cases, but it was not clear if the lower figure reflected fewer infections or a decrease in testing.

The National Health Commission loosened anti-pandemic regulations, including the requirement that a recent COVID-19 test result be shown in order to enter most public places and the use of lockdowns.

Beijing has been urged by Dr Anthony Fauci and other foreign health officials to import Western COVID-19 vaccines based on mRNA technology because they are thought to be more efficient than the inactivated vaccines produced by China. Such calls have thus far been ignored by Chinese authorities.

The difficulties China faces are made worse by the fact that very few individuals have been exposed to the virus under "zero COVID"; most people lack natural antibodies.

Although officially China is still pursuing "zero COVID," which aims to monitor and eradicate all infections, recent actions seem to suggest that the name is only left the same but all the restrictions it entailed have been dropped.

China's official death toll is 5235 since the start of the pandemic, versus a US count of 1.1 million.

Abstract
--------
"Background: Since the initial Wuhan outbreak, China has been containing COVID-19 outbreaks through its 'dynamic zero-COVID' policy. Striking a balance between sustainability and cost-benefit, China has recently begun to adjust its COVID-19 response strategies, e.g. by announcing the '20 measures' on 11 Nov 2022 and further the '10 measures' on 7 Dec 2022. Strategies for safely exiting from dynamic zero-COVID (that is, without catastrophically overburdening health systems and/or incurring unacceptably excessive morbidity and mortality) are urgently needed.

"Methods: We use simulations to assess the respective and combined effectiveness of 4th-dose heterologous boosting, large-scale antiviral treatment and public health and social measures (PHSMs) that might allow China to further adjust COVID-19 response and exit from zero-COVID safely after 7 Dec 2022. We also assess whether local health systems can cope with the surge of COVID-19 cases posed by reopening, given that chunyun, a 40-day period with extremely high mobility across China associated with Spring Festival, will begin on 7 Jan 2023.

"Findings: Reopening against omicron transmission should be supported by the following interventions: 1) 4th-dose heterologous boosting 30-60 days before reopening by vaccinating 4-8% of the population per week with 85% or more uptake across all ages; 2) timely antiviral treatment with 60% or greater coverage; 3) moderate PHSMs to reduce transmissibility by 47-69%. With 4th-dose vaccination coverage of 85% and antiviral coverage of 60%, the cumulative mortality burden would be reduced by 26-35% to 448-503 per million, compared with reopening without any of these interventions. Simultaneously reopening all provinces under current PHSMs would still lead to hospitalization demand[s] that are 1.5-2.5 times of surge hospital capacity (2.2 per 10 000 population per day).

"Interpretation: Although the surge of disease burden posed by reopening in December 2022-January 2023 would likely overload many local health systems across the country, the combined effect of vaccination, antiviral treatment and PHSMs could substantially reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality as China transits from dynamic-zero to normality. Planning for such a nationwide, coordinated reopening should be an urgent priority as part of the global exit from the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Early this week (beginning 12 Dec 2022), China announced plans to optimize its strict anti-epidemic measures with a series of guidelines, including the adoption of rapid antigen testing and optimized nucleic acid testing (in contrast to mass testing), relaxation of negative nucleic acid test result requirements for entry to public and private facilities, and shift from isolation and quarantine of asymptomatic cases and close contacts in specified facilities to allow options for home quarantine (https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202212/1281307.shtml).

The plan, also called the "new 10-point plan," was released by China's National Health Commission on 7 Dec 2022. - Mod.LWW]

1. Scientifically and accurately divide risk areas. Delineate high-risk areas according to buildings, units, floors, and households, and [this] shall not be arbitrarily expand[ed] to areas such as residential areas, communities, and streets (townships). All forms of temporary [lockdowns and restrictions of movement] shall not be adopted.

2. Further optimize nucleic acid detection. Nucleic acid testing for all [inhabitants will] not [be] carried out according to administrative regions, and the scope and frequency of nucleic acid testing are [to be] further reduced. Antigen detection can be carried out [according to the needs of epidemic prevention work]. Nucleic acid testing will be carried out for employees in high-risk positions and personnel in high-risk areas in accordance with relevant regulations, and other personnel are [tested as extensively as they are willing to be tested]. Except for special places such as nursing homes, welfare homes, medical institutions, childcare institutions, and primary and secondary schools, no negative nucleic acid test certificates are required, and health codes are not checked. Important agencies, large enterprises, and some specific places can determine the prevention and control measures by themselves. Negative nucleic acid test certificates and health codes will no longer be checked for cross-regional migrants, and landing inspections will no longer be carried out.

3. Optimize and adjust isolation method[s]. Infected persons should be admitted and treated in a scientific manner. Asymptomatic infected persons and mild cases who are eligible for home isolation are generally isolated at home, or they can voluntarily choose centralized isolation for treatment. During the period of home isolation, health monitoring should be strengthened. On the 6th and 7th days of isolation, [individuals with] 2 consecutive nucleic acid tests with a Ct value of 35 or greater will be released from isolation. If the condition worsens, [they] will be transferred to a designated hospital for treatment. Close contacts who have the conditions for home isolation are subject to home isolation for 5 days, or they can voluntarily choose centralized isolation, and the isolation will be released after the nucleic acid test is negative on the 5th day.

4. Implement "quick [lockdowns] and quick [reopening]" in high-risk areas. High-risk areas with no new infections for 5 consecutive days must be ["unblocked"] in time.

5. Ensure the basic needs of the masses for purchasing medicines. Pharmacies around the country must operate normally and must not close down at will. The online and offline purchase of over-the-counter drugs such as antipyretic, cough, antiviral, and cold treatment[s] shall not be restricted.

6. Accelerate the vaccination of the elderly against [SARS-CoV-2]. All localities should adhere to the principle of receiving as much as possible, focus on increasing the vaccination rate of people aged 60-79, accelerate the increase in vaccination rate of people aged 80 and over, and make special arrangements. Optimize vaccination services by setting up green channels for the elderly, temporary vaccination sites, mobile vaccination vehicles and other measures. It is necessary to carry out training on the identification of vaccination contraindications level by level, and guide medical staff to scientifically determine vaccination contraindications. Detailed popular science publicity, mobilize the whole society to participate in mobilizing the elderly to vaccinate, localities can adopt incentive measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of the elderly to get vaccinated.

7. Strengthen the investigation and classification management of the health status of key populations. [Emphasize] the role of grassroots medical and health institutions and [the role of family physicians as "gatekeepers"], and [understand] the [situation of] cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, tumors, immune dysfunction and other diseases [among the elderly] in the jurisdiction and their [COVID-19] vaccination status, and promote the implementation of hierarchical and [categorical disease] management.

8. Ensure the normal operation of society and basic medical services. Non-high-risk areas shall not restrict the flow of people, and shall not suspend work, production, or business. Medical personnel, public security, transportation and logistics, commercial supermarkets, supply guarantees, water, electricity, heating and other personnel who guarantee basic medical services and normal social operations are included in the "white list" management, and relevant personnel do a good job in personal protection, vaccination and health monitoring to ensure normal operation. Provide medical services, basic living supplies, water, electricity, heating, etc., try our best to maintain the normal production and work order, solve urgent problems raised by the masses in a timely manner, and effectively meet the basic living needs of the masses during the epidemic situation.

9. Strengthen the security guarantees related to the epidemic. It is strictly forbidden to block fire exits, unit doors, and community doors in various ways to ensure that the public's access to medical treatment, emergency escape, etc. is unobstructed. Promote the establishment of a "docking mechanism" between communities and specialized medical institutions to [facilitate access to healthcare services] for the elderly [who are] living alone, minors, pregnant women, disabled people, and patients with chronic diseases. Strengthen the care and psychological counseling for [personnel involved in movement restriction programs], patients and front-line staff.

10. Further optimize the school epidemic prevention and control work. Schools in all regions must resolutely implement scientific and precise prevention and control requirements. Schools without epidemics must carry out normal offline teaching activities, and supermarkets, canteens, stadiums, and libraries on campus must be open as normal. Schools with epidemics must accurately delineate risk areas, and normal teaching and living order must still be guaranteed outside the risk areas.

[C] Medical staff in China's hospitals say COVID-19 ripping through their ranks
Date: Wed 14 Dec 2022 01:24 EST
Source: Reuters [abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/china/medical-staff-chinas-hospitals-say-covid-19-ripping-through-their-ranks-2022-12-14


A growing number of China's doctors and nurses are catching COVID-19 and some have been asked to keep working, as people showing mostly moderate symptoms throng hospitals and clinics, according to medical staff and dozens of posts on social media.

China's health authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment on infections among medical staff.

Health experts say China's sudden loosening of strict COVID rules is likely to trigger a surge in severe cases in coming months, and hospitals in big cities are already showing signs of strain.

Reuters was unable to immediately get verification from hospitals on waiting times and bed utilisation rates, but photographs circulated on social media showed patients in Beijing and neighbouring Baoding waiting for hours to get treated.

Health officials have been recommending that people with mild COVID symptoms quarantine at home and have also said most of the cases reported in the country are mild or asymptomatic.

State media Xinhua reported on Tuesday [13 Dec 2022] in the capital Beijing that 50 patients are currently in a serious or critical condition in hospital with COVID.

The sudden loosening of restrictions has sparked long queues outside fever clinics since last week [beginning 5 Dec 2022] in a worrying sign that a wave of infections is building, even though official tallies of new cases have trended lower recently as authorities eased back on testing.

Some hospitals in Beijing have up to 80% of their staff infected, but many of them are still required to work due to staff shortages, a doctor in a large public hospital in Beijing told Reuters, adding he has spoken to his peers at other big hospitals in the capital.

All operations and surgeries have been cancelled at his hospital unless the patient is "dying tomorrow," he said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.

Beijing Hospital did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Several doctors from Wuhan province's top public hospital Tongji have also tested positive for COVID-19, but since Sunday [11 Dec 2022] have not been allowed to take leave, a pharmaceutical sales representative with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, declining to be named, as the information is not public.

Tongji hospital did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

[2] Australia: Thousands more Australians died in 2022 than expected; COVID was behind the majority of them
Date: Wed 14 Dec 2022 23:01 EST
Source: The Conversation [abridged, edited]
https://theconversation.com/thousands-more-australians-died-in-2022-than-expected-covid-was-behind-the-majority-of-them-196281


Last month [November 2022], the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released a report of mortality statistics. It showed that from January to July 2022, there were 17% more deaths (16 375) than the average expected for these months [https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/causes-death/provisional-mortality-statistics/jan-jul-2022. - Mod.LWW]

This historical average is based on an average of the deaths for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021. They did not include 2020 in the baseline for 2022 data because it included periods where numbers of deaths were significantly lower than expected. The difference between the expected number of deaths based on historical data, and the actual number, is called "excess deaths."

However, as the ABS points out in its report, using previous years as the predictor for the expected number of deaths does not take into account changes in population age structure over time, or potential improvements in mortality rates.

As we will see, the excess deaths this year [2022] were likely lower than the ABS estimate -- but still overwhelmingly related to COVID and its effects on health.

Both the Actuaries Institute report and the ABS separate COVID deaths into 2 categories:
- Deaths from COVID, where COVID is listed as the primary or underlying cause of death;
- Deaths with COVID, where the underlying cause of death has been determined as something other than COVID, but the virus was a contributing factor.

The Actuaries Institute report shows 13% excess mortality for the first 8 months of 2022 (approximately 15 400 deaths), substantially lower than the ABS estimate for the first 7 months.

Just over half of the excess mortality -- 8200 deaths -- are deaths from COVID. Another 2100 deaths are deaths with COVID. The remaining excess of 5100 deaths makes no mention of COVID on the death certificate.

The actuaries' report gives the following possible explanations for excess deaths not listed as from or with COVID:

- Long COVID and interactions with other serious health conditions: A previous COVID infection can cause later illness or death. We know COVID is associated with higher risk of death from heart disease, cancer, and other causes. But a doctor tasked with completing a death certificate may not identify a link between the death and a COVID infection months earlier. Therefore, it seems likely some deaths were due to late COVID effects.

- Delayed deaths from other causes: Deaths from respiratory disease in 2020 and 2021 were lower than expected. This is presumably due to public health measures like mask wearing. While those measures were in place, people caught fewer respiratory diseases. Some people may have died earlier had their systems been stressed by respiratory disease during this time. So, some of the reported non-COVID excess deaths may be due to the catch-up effect of those people succumbing to underlying illnesses.

- Delays in emergency care: Around Australia, our health systems are under pressure, with staff absences due to COVID, ambulance ramping, and bed blocks in our acute hospitals. Unfortunately, there have been cases of people dying while waiting for an ambulance. It could be that people with conditions such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes may not be getting lifesaving emergency care due to these factors.

- Delays in routine care: Over the pandemic period we have seen delays in people seeking routine health care or attending screening tests for breast and cervical cancer. There have also been delays in elective surgery. And people may have been avoiding healthcare settings due to fear of catching COVID. These delays in routine care may have led to deaths that would have been prevented in previous years.

- Pandemic lifestyle changes: There is evidence in Australia and the United Kingdom a higher proportion of people made less healthy lifestyle choices during lockdowns, such as drinking more alcohol and exercising less. Higher risks for childhood obesity were also noted. We could be starting to see the impact of these changes.

- Undiagnosed COVID: It is almost certain some of the excess deaths are from unidentified COVID. Unfortunately in Australia, we have no firm data on the percentage of undiagnosed COVID cases, and even less on how that percentage might have changed over time.

So, the good news is the ABS excess death estimate of 17% more deaths in the first 8 months of this year [2022] is likely an overestimate, with the true rate closer to 13%. Of this 13%, some 7% are deaths from COVID, 2% are deaths with COVID, and much of the remaining 4% is likely to still be COVID-related in some way.

Last week [beginning 5 Dec 2022], there were 219 COVID-related deaths reported. If the actuaries' analysis is accurate, then the true number of COVID-related deaths last week was closer to 250 -- a sobering thought as we approach the festive season.

Editor's note: After publication, the ABS contacted The Conversation to clarify its Provisional Mortality Statistics should not be used or reported as official excess mortality estimates.

[A] Key partner in Covax will stop giving free vaccines to middle-income nations
Date: Thu 8 Dec 2022
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/health/covid-vaccines-covax-gavi.html


A key partner in Covax, the organization that has led the effort to bring COVID vaccines to poor and middle-income countries, will stop supplying the shots to a huge part of the global population in the year ahead [2023], and provide them only to the lowest-income nations.

The board of governors of Gavi, the nonprofit that supplies immunizations to developing countries, voted at a meeting in Geneva on Thursday [8 Dec 2022] to end Covax support for 37 countries, including Egypt and Indonesia, where hundreds of thousands of people have died from the coronavirus.

A total of 54 other nations, including some of the world's poorest countries, will continue to receive free COVID shots and funds to help deliver them -- if they want them -- going into 2025.

The decision reflects the fact that demand for COVID vaccines has plummeted worldwide, and that Gavi has found itself overcommitted to vaccine purchases when countries don't want them. The continuing vaccination efforts are expected to focus on high-risk groups, including older and immunocompromised people.

Covax has delivered 1.7 billion COVID shots to people in developing nations, in challenging circumstances, but has fallen far short of its goal of ensuring equitable access to the vaccines worldwide. The effort was hobbled at the outset by high-income countries that locked up the initial supply of shots, and later by erratic supply flows and weak delivery systems.

Today, vaccination rates in the countries served by Covax sit at an average of 52% of the population receiving initial COVID inoculation. But the figure for sub-Saharan Africa is just 26%. Delivery of booster doses has stalled across developing nations, and Covid cases are rising around the world.

"It's alarming that this decision has been made while the pandemic is still ongoing and without thorough consultation with these countries," said Kate Elder, the senior vaccines policy adviser for Doctors Without Borders' access campaign.

But Dr Anthony Mounts, director of the COVID vaccine introduction program at the Task Force for Global Health, a nonprofit organization that has supported COVID vaccination delivery in 37 developing countries, said the decision seemed inevitable in the face of the across-the-board lack of interest in COVID vaccines he had seen. The World Health Organization estimates that 90% of the world population now has some immunity to COVID-19, from vaccination or previous infection.

"In spite of whatever challenges Covax faced, I think just the fact that there was a coordinating mechanism was extremely useful," Dr Mounts said. "But it's time to change our direction and really focus on high-risk groups and what we can do to protect them."

The 37 countries for which support is ending will receive a one-time payment, which the board described as "catalytic," to set up their own COVID vaccination programs. They will continue to have the ability to buy vaccines at a Gavi-negotiated reduced price.

The other 54 are nations that received support from Gavi for routine immunization before the pandemic. If those countries choose to continue with COVID campaigns, Gavi will move to integrate COVID shots into the regular support it offers, ending the emergency program.

The World Health Organization, another partner in Covax, continues to maintain a goal of vaccinating 70% of the population in each country. The WHO did not respond to a request for comment on the Gavi board decision.

Gavi, using funds from rich nations, negotiates purchases with vaccine makers on behalf of Covax, and also channels money to countries to help administer shots. The agency has also received millions of doses of vaccines as donations, the tide of which has ballooned as high-income nations -- which have seen their own vaccine programs falter -- seek to offload their oversupply.

Budget documents presented to the Gavi board show that the organization has had to renegotiate its vaccine contracts to get out of having to buy hundreds of millions of doses, and that countries have been slow to use the funds they were given to administer the shots.

The Gavi board directed the organization's staff to update donors early in 2023 on how it suggests using the money currently sitting in the pool to buy vaccines. It also gave broad approval to a plan for Gavi to create a USD 1.5 billion pandemic preparedness pool.

At the meeting, Gavi's governors recommitted the organization to trying to catch up on a critical drop in routine childhood vaccinations that has occurred over the course of the COVID pandemic and led to resurgences of diseases including polio and measles.

In addition, the Gavi board voted to restart a vaccination campaign against the human papillomavirus, or HPV, with an investment of USD 600 million, in an effort to try to reach 86 million girls by 2025 with the vaccine, which aims to prevent cervical cancer.

And, going forward, Gavi will invest in efforts to expand the manufacturing of vaccines in Africa, as part of an effort to prevent the kind of disparity seen early in the COVID pandemic when vaccine nationalism left the continent with no access to shots.

[B] USA: FDA approves bivalent vaccines for children
Date: Fri 9 Dec 2022 12:00 EST
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/12/08/covid-booster-shot-kids/


Federal regulators Thursday [8 Dec 2022] authorized an updated booster shot of Moderna's coronavirus vaccine for young children, saying the inoculation would offer increased protection amid a wave of respiratory illnesses that is increasing peril for youngsters. This means the youngest Americans will have access to variant-targeting boosters already available to older children and adults.

The Food and Drug Administration, in a statement, said children 6 months through 5 years old would be eligible for the booster -- known as a "bivalent" shot targeting the omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 and the original version of the virus -- 2 months after they had completed Moderna's 2-dose primary series.

The agency also cleared an updated shot of the coronavirus vaccine by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech for children 6 months through 4 years old. That bivalent shot, which also targets omicron, will be substituted for the last shot in the companies' initial 3-dose series. It is not considered a booster shot.

The FDA in June [2022] authorized a 2-shot series of the Moderna vaccine of 25 micrograms each for young children, and a 3-dose regimen of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine of 3 micrograms each. Pfizer and BioNTech have said they chose a lower dose to minimize potential side effects.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday [9 Dec 2022] endorsed the FDA's latest action, saying in a statement [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html] that it has "expanded the use of updated (bivalent) COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 6 months through 5 years." Children ages 6 months through 5 years who previously completed a Moderna primary series are now eligible to receive a Moderna bivalent booster 2 months after their final primary series dose. Children ages 6 months through 4 years who are completing a Pfizer primary series will receive a Pfizer bivalent vaccine as their 3rd primary dose.

The updated vaccines are formulated to protect against some of the more recently circulating subvariants and are "critical to providing ongoing protection as immunity wanes and the virus continues to mutate," the CDC said. "The vast majority of children in this age group have not received any doses of a COVID-19 vaccine."

CDC said it is working to increase parent and provider confidence in the coronavirus vaccines to improve uptake among the 95% of children who are not vaccinated or who have not completed the vaccine primary series.

The government's latest effort to bolster protections is bumping up against an unwelcome fact: Only a small percentage of young children have been vaccinated against the coronavirus. Fewer than 5% of children 4 and younger have completed an initial series of a coronavirus vaccine, and fewer than 10% have received even a 1st shot, according to the CDC.

The FDA's steps "won't have a lot of real-world impact," said Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. "It's like arguing over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin."

But federal health officials, eyeing a rise in COVID-19 cases and pediatric hospitalizations because of an array of respiratory germs, said it was important to make updated shots available to the youngest age groups.

Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccine regulator, said the agency wanted "parents who are trying to optimally protect their children" to have access to the most-up-to-date versions of the vaccine. He also said the authorizations give the agency another opportunity to stress that all children should be vaccinated against the coronavirus because it is the best way to prevent the worst outcomes, including hospitalization and death.

With temperatures dropping and activities moving indoors, the nation is "entering into another wave of COVID," Marks said. "We don't know how high it is going to go."

The BA.4 and BA.5 coronavirus subvariants, which were circulating widely this summer [2022], have faded and are responsible for below 15% of cases, according to the CDC. They have been replaced by BQ.1 or BQ.1.1, which are causing more than 60% of cases in the United States.

Officials say the bivalent formulation will offer improved protection against the latest crop of omicron subvariants. Still, that shield is not foolproof: The latest mutants have proved adept at dodging some of the protective antibodies generated by even that shot.

Some vaccine experts are worried that the emergency authorizations could cause confusion among parents, especially those whose children have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The bottom line is this: Children who have not started getting that vaccine's 3-dose series or have received only 2 shots, will get the bivalent vaccine, not the original shot, as their 3rd inoculation.

But children who have received the 3-shot primary series of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will not be eligible immediately for a booster. The FDA is expected to review data for a bivalent booster for the Pfizer-BioNTech shots early next year [2023]. These children "would still be expected to have protection against the most serious outcomes from the currently circulating omicron variant," the FDA said.

Children's hospitals in the United States are under strain as they care for unusually high numbers of children infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses. Doctors worry that the numbers will rise as families and friends gather for the holidays.

But the boosters have hardly been embraced, even by adults. The uptake of a bivalent booster has been lackluster, and the White House recently said it would launch a 6-week push to increase booster rates among older people, in communities of color and in rural areas -- all of which have suffered disproportionately high rates of severe disease and death during the coronavirus pandemic.

[C] Monovalent COVID booster found to cut poor outcomes in nursing homes
Date: Wed 9 Dec 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/monovalent-covid-booster-found-cut-poor-outcomes-nursing-homes


The original monovalent (single-strain) COVID-19 mRNA booster lowered combined COVID-19 hospitalization or death by 80% and 64% in 2 multistate nursing home systems during a period dominated by the delta and omicron variants, suggests a study published yesterday [8 Dec 2022] in JAMA Network Open [see citation below].

Researchers from the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Province, Rhode Island; Brown University; and Genesis HealthCare in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, analyzed electronic health records to estimate the booster-related reduction in COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among 10 949 residents of 202 Genesis HealthCare nursing homes (system 1) and 4321 residents of 128 Veterans Health Administration nursing homes (system 2).

The residents had completed a primary COVID-19 vaccine series and were eligible for a Pfizer/BioNTech booster dose from 22 Sep to 30 Nov 2021, with a 12-week follow-up until 8 Mar 2022.

System 1 had 8332 booster recipients who were 63.9% women and 80.2% White and 10 886 unboosted residents who were 63.1% women and 79.5% White. Median age was 78 years. System 2 had 3289 booster recipients who were 96.0% men and 59.3% White and 4317 unboosted residents who were 96.2% men and 56.4% White. Median age was 74 years.

Booster vaccination was tied to declines in COVID-19 infections of 37.7% in system 1 and 57.7% in system 2. Hospitalizations fell by 74.4% in system 1 and 64.1% in system 2. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) for COVID-related death was 87.9% in system 1. While system 2 saw a reduction in death of 46.6%, it wasn't statistically significant.

Compared with booster recipients in system 2, those in system 1 had higher rates of COVID-19 infection (100.1 infections per 1000 residents vs 72.5/1000) and death (1.4 deaths/1000 residents vs 1.3/1000) but lower rates of hospitalization (3.9/1000 vs 31.2/1000).

A total of 45 residents died of COVID-19 in system 1, and 18 died in system 2. Booster recipients in system 1 saw an 80.3% reduction in combined hospitalization or death, and those in system 2 had a 63.8% decline.

VE differed in the 2 systems mostly in terms of hospitalization rates, with the need for booster vaccination of an estimated 47 residents in system 1 and 18 in system 2 to prevent 1 COVID-19 hospitalization or death.

The study authors said that nursing homes are an ideal setting in which to estimate VE because of residential stability, systematic documentation of vaccination, and frequent COVID-19 testing.

"The present work evaluated VE by using an emulated trial design, which allowed us to include unboosted participants with characteristics comparable with those of boosted participants who differed primarily by the date on which they received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine rather than by indication, baseline covariates, or exposure risk to circulating strains," they wrote.

The results, the researchers said, suggest that administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an important role in preventing severe COVID-19 outcomes. "Additional clinical evidence of booster effectiveness may support efforts to increase booster distribution for this vulnerable population," they wrote.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
----------
"Importance: A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine booster dose has been recommended for all nursing home residents. However, data on the effectiveness of an mRNA vaccine booster in preventing infection, hospitalization, and death in this vulnerable population are lacking.

"Objective: To evaluate the association between receipt of a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine booster and prevention of infection, hospitalization, or death among nursing home residents.

"Design, setting, and participants: This cohort study emulated sequentially nested target trials for vaccination using data from 2 large multistate US nursing home systems: Genesis HealthCare, a community nursing home operator (system 1) and Veterans Health Administration community living centers (VHA CLCs; system 2). The cohort included long-term (100 days or more) nursing home residents (10 949 residents from 202 community nursing homes and 4321 residents from 128 VHA CLCs) who completed a 2-dose series of an mRNA vaccine (either BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) and were eligible for a booster dose between 22 Sep and 30 Nov 2021. Residents were followed up until 8 Mar 2022.

"Exposures: Receipt of a 3rd mRNA vaccine dose, defined as a booster dose (boosted group), or nonreceipt of a booster dose (unboosted group) on an eligible target trial date. If participants in the unboosted group received a booster dose on a later target trial date, they were included in the booster group for that target trial; thus, participants could be included in both the boosted and unboosted groups.

"Main outcomes and measures: Test-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, or death was followed up to 12 weeks after booster vaccination. The primary measure of estimated vaccine effectiveness was the ratio of cumulative incidences in the boosted group vs the unboosted group at week 12, adjusted with inverse probability weights for treatment and censoring.

"Results: System 1 included 202 community nursing homes; among 8332 boosted residents (5325 [63.9%] female; 6685 [80.2%] White) vs 10 886 unboosted residents (6865 [63.1%] female; 8651 [79.5%] White), the median age was 78 (IQR, 68-87) years vs 78 (IQR, 68-86) years. System 2 included 128 VHA CLCs; among 3289 boosted residents (3157 [96.0%] male; 1950 [59.3%] White) vs 4317 unboosted residents (4151 [96.2%] male; 2434 [56.4%] White), the median age was 74 (IQR, 70-80) vs 74 (IQR, 69-80) years. Booster vaccination was associated with reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections of 37.7% (95% CI, 25.4%-44.2%) in system 1 and 57.7% (95% CI, 43.5%-67.8%) in system 2. For hospitalization, reductions of 74.4% (95% CI, 44.6%-86.2%) in system 1 and 64.1% (95% CI, 41.3%-76.0%) in system 2 were observed. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for death associated with SARS-CoV-2 was 87.9% (95% CI, 75.9%-93.9%) in system 1; however, although a reduction in death was observed in system 2 (46.6%; 95% CI, -34.6% to 94.8%), this reduction was not statistically significant. A total of 45 SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths occurred in system 1 and 18 deaths occurred in system 2. For the combined end point of SARS-CoV-2-associated hospitalization or death, boosted residents in system 1 had an 80.3% (95% CI, 65.7%-88.5%) reduction, and boosted residents in system 2 had a 63.8% (95% CI, 41.4%-76.1%) reduction.

"Conclusions and relevance: In this study, during a period in which both the delta and omicron variants were circulating, SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination was associated with significant reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalizations, and the combined end point of hospitalization or death among residents of 2 US nursing home systems. These findings suggest that administration of vaccine boosters to nursing home residents may have an important role in preventing COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality."]

[4] Drug for liver disease could protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2 and help COVID-19 patients
Date: Tue 6 Dec 2022
Source: Berlin Institute of Health, press release [edited]
https://www.bihealth.org/en/notices/drug-for-liver-disease-could-protect-against-infection-with-sars-cov-2-and-help-covid-19-patients


Scientists from the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité (BIH), together with colleagues from Germany and the UK, have found that a commonly used liver drug also affects infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. It causes the number of ACE-2 receptors on the cells to decrease, which makes it harder for the virus to enter the cells. The researchers were able to demonstrate this in various cultured organoids in the laboratory, as well as in living animals and in humans who had taken the drug. The scientists have now published their results in the journal Nature [see citation below].

Ludovic Vallier is actually interested in the liver. The holder of an Einstein strategic Professorship for Stem Cells in Regenerative Therapies at BIH and Max-Planck-Fellow at Max-Planck-Institute for molecular genetics grows mini livers, so-called organoids, in order to research how diseases of the liver develop and how they can be treated or prevented. As a long-term goal, he would also like to use liver organoids for cell based therapies for patients with liver failure.

When the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in 2020, Vallier's team, especially Fotios Sampaziotis and Teresa Brevini, who were working with Dr Ludovic Vallier during his time at the Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute at the University of Cambridge, also turned their attention to researching this new threat. "We were surprised when we discovered that liver cells carry a lot of ACE-2 molecules on their surface, which is the receptor for this strain of coronavirus. This is because the liver was not previously known to be particularly affected by infection or by COVID19 disease."

The scientists then investigated how the amount of ACE-2 molecules on the liver cells is controlled. They discovered an interesting mechanism: particularly high concentrations of the ACE-2 receptor -- the highest in the human body -- were found on the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts and gallbladder. These cells can be easily grown in vitro as organoids. However, they lose the expression of ACE-2 if they are not regularly flushed with a bile acid.

"When we omitted the bile acid from the culture medium, the cells lost the ACE-2 receptor. We were thus able to identify bile acid as a regulator of the ACE-2 receptor," reports Vallier. The mechanism behind this is even more complicated: bile acid activates the receptor FXR, which in turn stimulates the production of ACE-2. Without bile acid, no FXR; without FXR, no ACE-2.

"Now, of course, we wanted to know whether this correlation also existed in the tissues that are the actual target of the coronavirus, i.e., in the lung and intestine. And indeed, we also found FXR in organoids generated from lung or intestinal cells, and there, too, treatment with bile acids caused an increase in FXR and then in ACE-2," Vallier explains.

The exciting question now was whether the process could also be reversed: could the amount of ACE-2 receptors also be lowered via this route? Vallier says: "We were lucky that there are already drugs on the market that lower the concentration of bile acids in the context of liver diseases. We added these substances to the different organoids from liver, lung and intestine, and indeed, as a result, the concentration of ACE-2 receptors decreased."

In a next step, the scientists infected organoids of liver, lung, or intestine with SARS-CoV-2 viruses, which they had obtained from nasal swabs of infected patients. Some of the organoids had been pre-treated with the drug, while others had not. And indeed, the drug caused the infection rate to drop sharply.

Mice and hamsters given the drug also showed significantly fewer ACE-2 receptors in their nasal, lung, liver, and intestinal epithelial cells. And indeed, the drug protected hamsters from infection with the virus: of 6 untreated hamsters, all contracted the virus from another infected animal, became ill and lost weight. Of 9 animals pretreated with the drug, only 3 became infected and also fell ill less severely. "We were thus able to show that the drug was indeed effective in preventing infection," says Ludovic Vallier. "However, of course, we wanted to show this in humans, not hamsters."

The scientists next studied donated human lungs that were perfused and ventilated outside the body. The 2 lungs were perfused separately in order to be able to check the effect of the drug on one and the same organ. Consequently, they perfused one lung with a treatment-standard concentration of the drug and the other with placebo. The ACE-2 level in the 2 lungs, which was still the same at the beginning of the experiment, then changed: it dropped sharply in the treated part. When the researchers subsequently infected the 2 lungs with SARS-CoV-2, it was shown that pretreatment with the drug actually significantly impeded the infection.

In a subsequent test, 8 volunteers received the drug at the usual dosage for 6 days. "After that, we found in their nasal swabs that the concentration of the ACE-2 receptor on their nasal epithelial cells had significantly reduced. Serum from patients with congenital liver disease who had been taking the drug for a long time also showed lower ACE-2 concentrations than patients not taking the drug. Finally, data on patients with liver disease who also had COVID-19 also found that patients treated with the drug had significantly milder disease courses, required less intensive care and died less frequently.

A drug directed against the body's own molecule would have several advantages over a drug directed against the virus. Unlike the virus, the body's own ACE receptor does not change, so there is less risk of resistance. Because it has been used for many years, it is known to be well tolerated in the long term. It is off-patent and therefore available at low cost.

"We are of course excited by these results," Ludovic Vallier reports, "because we believe we have found a way to both prevent COVID-19 and treat it in the early stages of infection. Of course, we know full well that we need to conduct proper clinical trials to verify this hope. But if successful, we would have in our hands a low-cost, low-side-effect drug that is quickly and globally available, and with which we could well help many people. And that is our goal!"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the modulation of viral host receptors, such as ACE2, could represent a new chemoprophylactic approach for COVID-19 complementing vaccination. However, the mechanisms controlling ACE2 expression remain elusive. Here, we identify the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) as a direct regulator of ACE2 transcription in multiple COVID19-affected tissues, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. We then use the over-the-counter compound z-guggulsterone (ZGG) and the off-patent drug ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to reduce FXR signalling and downregulate ACE2 in human lung, cholangiocyte, and intestinal organoids and in the corresponding tissues in mice and hamsters. We demonstrate that UDCA-mediated ACE2 downregulation reduces susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, in vivo, and in human lungs and livers perfused ex situ. Furthermore, we illustrate that UDCA reduces ACE2 expression in the nasal epithelium in humans. Finally, we identify a correlation between UDCA treatment and positive clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection using retrospective registry data, and confirm these findings in an independent validation cohort of liver transplant recipients. In conclusion, we identify a novel function of FXR in controlling ACE2 expression and provide evidence that modulation of this pathway could be beneficial for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, paving the road for future clinical trials."

[A] Lung scarring occurs in up to 11% of patients recovered from COVID, regardless of infection severity
Date: Mon 5 Dec 2022
Source: HealthImaging [edited]
https://healthimaging.com/topics/clinical/COVID-19/lung-scarring-patients-following-covid


Researchers recently estimated that up to 11% of patients who recover from COVID could have lung scarring that may worsen over time.

This data was published recently in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine [see citation below], where experts used the follow-up CT imaging (completed within 240 days of discharge) from 209 patients hospitalized with COVID to stratify the risk of residual lung damage for a post-hospitalization cohort of almost 3500 individuals without follow-up imaging.

Corresponding author Iain Stewart, PhD, of the Margaret Turner Warwick Center for Fibrosing Lung Disease and co-authors suggested that the team's work could have major implications for patients who are released from the hospital following a COVID infection, as a "substantial" number of these individuals could have fibrotic abnormalities of the lungs that need to be addressed and potentially managed.

"For some people these fibrotic patterns may be stable or resolve, while for others they may lead to longer term lung fibrosis progression, worse quality of life and decreased life expectancy," the authors wrote. "Earlier detection of progression is essential to improving outcomes."

The findings revealed that although patients with the most severe cases of COVID (those requiring ventilation, etc.) were more likely to display residual lung abnormalities indicative of interstitial lung disease following their release, nearly 8% of patients with less severe cases were also found to be at high risk.

The researchers acknowledged that they cannot yet determine whether these changes will progress or resolve in the long-term, but they have planned a 2nd phase of research that will reevaluate study participants at the 12-month mark.

"At that time, we will also use linked electronic health records of hospital admissions and mortality data to support our analyses. We expect to have the final results in early 2023," the authors stated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Rationale: Shared symptoms and genetic architecture between COVID-19 and lung fibrosis suggests SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to progressive lung damage.

"Objectives: The UKILD Post-COVID study interim analysis was planned to estimate the prevalence of residual lung abnormalities in people hospitalized with COVID-19 based on risk strata.

"Methods: The Post-HOSPitalisation COVID Study (PHOSP-COVID) was used for capture of routine and research follow-up within 240 days from discharge. Thoracic CTs linked by PHOSP-COVID identifiers were scored for percentage of residual lung abnormalities (ground glass opacities and reticulations). Risk factors in linked CT were estimated with Bayesian binomial regression and risk strata were generated. Numbers within strata were used to estimate post-hospitalization prevalence using Bayesian binomial distributions. Sensitivity analysis was restricted to participants with protocol driven research follow-up.

"Measurements and main results: The interim cohort comprised 3700 people. Of 209 subjects with linked CTs (median 119 days, interquartile range 83-155), 166 people (79.4%) had >10% involvement of residual lung abnormalities. Risk factors included abnormal chest X-ray (RR 1.21 95%CrI 1.05; 1.40), percent predicted DLco<80% (RR 1.25 95%CrI 1.00; 1.56) and severe admission requiring ventilation support (RR 1.27 95%CrI 1.07; 1.55). In the remaining 3491 people, moderate to very-high risk of residual lung abnormalities was classified in 7.8%, post-hospitalization prevalence was estimated at 8.5% (95%CrI 7.6%; 9.5%) rising to 11.7% (95%CrI 10.3%; 13.1%) in sensitivity analysis.

"Conclusions: Residual lung abnormalities were estimated in up to 11% of people discharged following COVID-19 related hospitalization. Health services should monitor at-risk individuals to elucidate long-term functional implications."]

[B] Devastating effect of long COVID on children
Date: Wed 8 Dec 2022 12:18 GMT
Source: iNews [abridged, edited]
https://inews.co.uk/news/health/long-covid-impact-children-walk-like-drunk-2001032


In January [2022] the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 120 000 children suffer from long COVID. Professor Sir Terence Stephenson, from UCL [University College London] Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, estimates somewhere between 2% and 14% of teenagers have persistent symptoms. That's potentially 700 000 without counting younger children.

He is leading the children and young people with long COVID (CLoCk) study, the largest of its kind, which recently published research in The Lancet Regional Health - Europe [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/child-health/news/2022/dec/symptoms-long-covid-children-may-change-over-time] reporting that ongoing symptoms experienced by children and young people change over time and that clinicians should be aware of this. It also found that new symptoms may appear in children up to a year after initial infection.

He explains that just as in adults, even youngsters who are asymptomatic or mildly infected can develop lingering problems. But intriguingly, some of the children who tested negative had symptoms 3 months later, which Professor Stephenson said could be due to a phenomenon known as "long-pandemic syndrome."

Exactly why children develop long COVID symptoms is still a mystery.

In adults, the theories put forward include the reactivation of a dormant virus, lingering viral fragments within the body attacking the circulatory system and an autoimmune reaction to infection with so-called autoantibodies, proteins that attack one's own healthy cells and tissue.

One study [https://www.jci.org/articles/view/149633] found that young children who show signs of post-COVID inflammation tend to have in their blood biological traces associated with leaky gut syndrome -- where the intestines become permeable and microbes seep into the bloodstream, triggering an inflammatory response.

But Professor Stephenson isn't convinced there's strong enough evidence to understand exactly what's happening yet. However, he is persuaded by the idea that youngsters do not have as many ACE2 receptors -- the gateway for the virus to enter our body through cells in the nose and respiratory tract.

"I don't know of any other virus that gets into the body by binding like this and this is the only virus I know where you lose a sense of smell and taste.

"You don't have many ACE2 receptors as a young infant and you develop more of it during childhood, and after puberty you've got more of it and as an adult you get even more of it. I think that's why long COVID is worse in adults than children and why long COVID is worse in older teenagers than younger children. But I'm speculating at this point."

Many parents in Facebook support groups swear that there must be a genetic link, because they've had persistent symptoms like their children. Professor Stephenson said this could be the case. "We've found that if a teenager lives with an adult who has had long COVID they are 1.7 times more likely to have long COVID. It could play a role that they share similar genes and it could simply be that as a household they've been exposed to a stronger strain and have had a bigger viral load."
