New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 East Grinstead, West Sussex, England
Date of start of the outbreak 15 Sep 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Equidae
Susceptible
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population: A single stallion that is reported to have been
moved into Great Britain from the Netherlands in November 2009. The
epidemiological inquiry is on-going to determine the population at risk.

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection. Legal
movement of animals

Epidemiological comments - Suspicion of disease arose as a result of a
pre-breeding test for equine viral arteritis, routinely carried out in
Great Britain as part of the industry agreed Horse Race Betting Levy
Board Codes of Practice. The serum sample was subjected to a serum
neutralisation serology test with positive results on 2 Sep 2010.

There was no recorded evidence of past history of equine viral
arteritis vaccination to explain this result and the stallion was
placed under immediate official restrictions.

Confirmatory tests (virus isolation) were performed on a semen sample
obtained on 22 Nov 2010. The delay between the initial serum test and
confirmatory one is due to problems obtaining a semen sample from this
stallion. The virus isolation test was confirmed positive on 7 Dec
2010, but results reached us on 8 Dec 2010. The epidemiological
inquiry is on-going.

Control measures - Measures applied: Quarantine; Disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of
affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge
(National laboratory)
Species Equidae
Testvirus isolation
Test date 08 Dec 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting

[This case sound very similar to the case in the UK in August, both of
which are a bit of a mystery. For further details on the disease
itself see the moderator comments for Equine viral arteritis - UK, OIE

I apologize for letting the 1st notification of this case of EVA slip
through the cracks but I have included the original notification I
missed along with the 1st Follow up report in this posting. I plead
mea culpa but hope you find the combined reports useful. - Mod.PC]
