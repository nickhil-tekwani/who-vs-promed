Health authorities are testing more samples from 2 Adelaide bakeries
associated with a salmonella outbreak linked to custard-filled
pastries. At least 60 people have fallen ill, nearly half of them
needing to be admitted to hospital.

SA [South Australia] Health's investigation has linked the infections
to Vili's custard-filled berliner buns and St George Cakes and
Gelati's custard-filled cannolis and eclairs.

Kevin Buckett from SA Health says they expect more test results later
in the week. "We have taken more samples from the manufacturing
plants," he said. "We're continuing to interview the 60 or so people
that were notified to us last week [week of 1 Feb 2011] and obviously
the more we interview the better chance we have to get a good track on
what common foods people have eaten."

[It is certainly likely that eggs used in the making of the custard
were the source of the salmonellae. Most of the serotypes linked to
egg-linked salmonellosis have been Typhimurium. - Mod.LL
