Subject: M. Sarraet (1883)
Regarding the M. Sarraet (1883) report, has anyone considered pseudorabies
as a part of the differential? Cattle exhibit extreme pruritus, frenzied
efforts to relieve the itch and CNS signs. (Actually, I noted that a list of
differential diagnoses was not given).

Eight years of age is not old for a draft animal, or a cow. [There had been
some discussion on BSE-L as to the age of this affected ox. Considering the
animal, the time (1880s), and the place this animal was probably only 2/3rds
of the way through its working life. MHJ]
The clinical signs of this 1883 ox are what the diagnosis is being based on.
A stonger case could be made for another differential diagnosis for pruritis
and nervous signs in a cow infected with suid herpesvirus 1. This is refered
to as Aujeszky's Disease for Pseudo Rabies. The presenting clincial sign is
intense focal pruritits.
Aujeszky's disease is known to cross from swine to cows, Scrapie is not.

There are other plausible explanations for the case described historically
from France. Compare the following to the translation of the paper by M.
Sarraet of France in 1883: "The incubation period ranges from 90 to 156
hours, and the duration of illness ranges from 8 to 72 hours. Because of the
short incubation period, animals may die suddenly, without premonitory
signs. In more slowly developing cases the first clinical signs are often
paraesthesia. Dermal abrasions, swelling, pruritis, and alopecia occur at
the site of virus inoculation. Affected animals also have fever and may
bellow, bloat, stamp their feet, salivate and chew the tongue.
Other signs include ataxia, conscious proprioceptive deficits, circling,
nystagmus and strabismus. Aggression may be seen in some instances, but most
affected animals become depressed. Progression of the disease is associated
with additional signs of diffuse cerebral dysfunction, which include
twitching, hyperesthesia, tenesmus, wild spasmodic kicking, licking the
nostrils, continuous mastication, sweating, vocalization, semicoma, coma,
convulsions, opisthotonos, hyperpnea, tachypnea, or slow, irregular
respirations. The duration of clinical disease is longest in animals with
pruritus of the head. Most affected animals die by 2 days after the first
onset of clinical signs." Taken from Large Animal Internal Medicine, 2nd
ed., 1996, Bradford P. Smith ed., pg. 1017.
This is a verbatim description of the clinical signs of Pseudorabies
(Aujesky's Disease) when it spills over from pigs into ruminants. The
disease is also colloquially known as "Mad Itch". Additional diagnostic
rule-outs for these symptoms include rabies, polioencephalomalacia, salt
poisoning, meningitis, lead poisoning, hypomagnesemia, or enterotoxemia.
One of the lessons we are taught early and often as diagnosticians is "when
you hear hoofbeats, look for horses, not zebras". This is really just a
paraphrase of Occam's Razor which suggests that the simplest explanation for
a given set of facts is also the most probable. Given today's heightened
awareness of BSE, the diagnositc workup on such a case as described in this
historical account would certainly include BSE on the list of possible
rule-outs but it would be lower on the list than Pseudorabies, rabies and
several other of the more probable possibilities.
One other important point, Mr. Pringle refers to "Stetsonville BSE", no
doubt a reference to the outbreak of Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy on a
mink ranch in Stetsonville, Wisconsin some years back. There certainly was
never any BSE found in Stetsonville or nor has there been any BSE found to
date anywhere in the United States.

As to Bruce Akey comments on the "Stetsonville BSE", while this was clearly
not BSE from Dick Marsh's observations what became TME seems to have started
as a bovine TSE, possibly spontaneous. Neither the latter nor BSE have since
been found in North America. -Mod.MHJ]
