Resources for _Trichinella_ control
-------------------------------
Related to the report on trichinellosis in pigs and humans in New Zealand,
I would like draw the readers' attention to the existence of the
International Commission on Trichinellosis (ICT), an international
scientific forum dealing with all aspects of _Trichinella_ and trichinellosis.
The home page of ICT is <http://www.med.unipi.it/ict/welcome.htm>
Here it is possible among others to find information on:
1) What to do in case of an outbreak
2) How to treat patients
3) Links to the International _Trichinella_ Reference Centre in Rome
4) Description of recent outbreaks around the world
