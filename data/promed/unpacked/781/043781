Bluetongue, Spain: an update, 13 Dec 2004
-----------------------------------------
1. Epidemiological situation
The following data have been derived from Spain's Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAPA) (accessed 13 Dec 2004)
<http://rasve.mapya.es/Publica/Noticias/LenguaAzul/Focos_LenguaAzul.asp>:
Until 13 Dec 2004, the accumulated total number of premises affected by
bluetongue virus [BTV] in cattle, sheep and goats has reached 298. This
represents an increase of 59 infected premises since the last published
figures of 1 Dec 2004. All those outbreaks have been detected in Andalucia,
where their total number is now 253. No BTV activity has been detected in
Extremadura or Ceuta.
In Andalucia, the breakdown of new outbreaks by provinces (listed from
south to north) is the following:
Cadiz: 10
Malaga: 36
Sevilla: 5 (not affected earlier)
Huelva: 9
Sevilla province, where BTV has now been detected for the 1st time, is
situated to the east of the other 3 affected Andalucian provinces. The
northernmost detection of BTV for the 1st half of December 2004 has been in
the municipality of Aroche, Huelva, situated at Lat: 37:56:40N (37.9444)
Lon: 6:57:15W (-6.9542).
2. Weather situation
Data from the Spanish Institute of Meteorology (Instituto Nacional de
Meteorologia, INM) indicates that, for Extremadura, average low
temperatures for the past week [2nd week of December 2004] were slightly
over 0 C. Further south in Andalucia, the lowest temperatures registered
for the same period were around 10 C. The institute forecasts a substantial
drop in temperature over the next 5 days [Which might indicate a decrease
in _culicoides_ activity and the disappearance of clinical cases within
several weeks. - Mod.AS]
3. Vaccination
Excerpts from the press regarding the use of vaccination to control the BTV
epizootic in Spain:
a. Sur Digital, 12 Dec 2004 [edited]
<http://servicios.diariosur.es/pg041212/prensa/noticias/Ceuta/200412/12/SUR-CEU-059.html>:
The local press in Ceuta reports the expected arrival of vaccines from an
(unnamed) South African laboratory [see comment further] by the end of
January 2005.
(The same press report says that 3 animals -- no species given -- have died
during the last few days, and that another 8 sheep and one goat were
destroyed 3 weeks ago [final week of November 2004] following serological
confirmation of the virus).
b. Yahoo noticias, 3 Dec 2004 [edited]
<http://es.news.yahoo.com/041203/4/3sayr.html>:
Juan Fernandez Batanero, speaker from the regional Department of
Agriculture and Fisheries said that the vaccination in Huelva was almost
completed.
c. Canal Sur, 18 Nov 2004 [edited]
<http://www.canalsur.es/>:
Juan Manuel Lopez, head of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in
Huelva, said that all animals around a 10 km radius from an infected
premises are being vaccinated. Currently, this has affected around 5000
animals. The plans are to vaccinate the entire provincial herd of around
200 000 animals before the spring. [The vaccination is most probably
related to sheep only; complementary information will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
d. ABC, Sevilla edition, 26 Nov 2004 [edited]
The Director of the Agrarian Production Department for the Andalucian
regional government said that more than 100 000 vaccine doses were to be
used before the end of December 2004 as a 1st emergency measure.
A 2nd phase will be undertaken during the winter [2005], when the
vaccination campaign will extend to all animals situated in a radius of 100
km (around the infected premises?) in the provinces of Huelva, Cadiz and
Malaga.
4. Trade restrictions and regulations
Trade affected areas (some partially affected) are Jaen, Cadiz, Malaga,
Sevilla, Huelva and Cordoba in Andalucia; Caceres and Badajoz in
Extremadura, and Toledo y Ciudad Real in Castilla-La Mancha.
The restrictions for vaccinated areas usually last 2 years. More detailed
information regarding international trade regulations for infected
countries or zones can be consulted at the OIE web site.

[The use in Greece of a live-attenuated Bluetongue vaccine, produced by the
Onderstepoort laboratory in South Africa, was discussed at the time by EU's
Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare. The subsequently
published relevant document "Possible Use of Vaccination against Bluetongue
in Europe", Adopted 27 Jun 2000, can be seen at
<http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scah/out47_en.pdf>.
Official information on the vaccines used in Spain would be appreciated;
the use of vaccination within the applied control measures has not, so far,
been included in Spain's reports to the OIE. - Mod.AS].
