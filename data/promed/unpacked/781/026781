After receiving a report of an outbreak of rinderpest in Torit, Southern
Sudan, and cattle movement from Sudan to the Agoro market in northern
Uganda, the national veterinary services have announced control of cross
border movement and vaccination in the northern part of Uganda.
The epidemic in the Sudan, being blamed on civil war disruption of
livestock vaccination, was confirmed by Mohammed Hassan, Sudanese Pan
African Rinderpest Campaign Coordinator last month. Since then, merchants
have been advised to intercept all meat coming into Uganda without
appropriate health and veterinary markings and send it back to the Sudan.
