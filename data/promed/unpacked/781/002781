["Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. There are 10 serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses designated APMV-I to APMV-10.

ND virus (NDV) has been shown to be able to infect over 200 species of birds, but the severity of disease produced varies with both host and strain of virus. Even APMV-1 strains of low virulence may induce severe respiratory disease when exacerbated by the presence of other organisms or by adverse environmental conditions. The preferred method of diagnosis is virus isolation and subsequent characterisation." Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf. - Mod.CRD
