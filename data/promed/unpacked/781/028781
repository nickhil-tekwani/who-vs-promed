[1] UK (England, Norfolk), poultry, H7N3 confirmed

The results of further tests from the poultry farm in Dereham,
Norfolk have confirmed the H7 avian flu virus, Defra announced today.
The tests also indicate that the strain of virus is [of] low pathogenicity.

The virus is confirmed as H7N3 and last occurred in the UK in 1979.
It bears no relationship to H5N1.

The results will need further investigations by the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA) before the Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby
Reynolds can rule out completely high pathogenicity. Results from
these further tests will be available in the coming week.

Debby Reynolds the Chief Veterinary Officer said:

"The current working hypothesis is that the infection on the farm
occurred due to a breach of biosecurity, the most likely source of
the virus being from another premises or from wild birds. We are not
yet able to say that the farm near Dereham is the index case, there
may be other premises involved.

"Restrictions will remain in place on the farm in question and
movements on and off the poultry company's other premises may only
take place under licence from the State Veterinary Service.

"In addition, a 1-km low pathogenic avian influenza restricted zone
has been put in place around the infected premises. The State
Veterinary Service is continuing to trace movements and contacts, the
necessary surveillance and all appropriate worker protection measures
have been put in place."

Notes to editors

1. In this case confirmation of low pathogenic H7N3 under EU rules
has a negligible effect of intra-community trade. In relation to 3rd
countries under OIE rules the UK remains a highly pathogenic
notifiable avian influenza free zone as that strain of the virus has
not been detected. It will be confirmed with each country the
conditions they require.

2. The 1-km zone restricts the movement of poultry, poultry products
and eggs, additional biosecurity measures must be taken and
gatherings can only take place under licence from the State Veterinary Service.

3. Poultry keepers within the zone will not be asked to house their
birds, however good biosecurity measures are encouraged.

4. All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low pathogenic but only H5
and H7 have been shown to have the potential to become highly pathogenic.

5. Low pathogenic H7N3 has been reported recently in the U.S.A.,
Canada and Italy. The virus that hit the Dutch poultry industry in
2003 was highly pathogenic H7N7. It last occurred in the UK in 1979.

6. More recently our regular surveillance of the domestic poultry
population to date has resulted in no positive findings for H7 avian
influenza. There have been no findings of H7N3 in the UK as part of
the wild bird surveillance programme, 157 samples have been taken as
part of the programme in Norfolk.[See comment].

7. H7 does not transmit easily from human to human. In almost all
cases of human H7 infection to date, the virus, in both low and high
pathogenic forms, has only caused a mild disease. Therefore at this
stage this is a virus which only has extremely limited implications
for human health.

8. The Food Standards Agency advises that avian flu does not pose a
food safety risk for UK consumers. The risk of people getting avian
influenza from eating poultry meat and eggs is low. Further
information is available on the Food Standards Agency website
[<http://www.food.gov.uk/>].

9. Guidance on handling and disposing of dead garden and wild birds:
The advice given here applies in all circumstances where members of
the public may come across a dead bird.

If you find a dead swan, goose or duck or 3 or more dead wild, or
garden birds together in the same place, please report this to Defra,
via the Defra Helpline on 08459 33 55 77. They may wish to have the
birds examined for signs of specific diseases. They will advise you
on what action you should take.

If the dead bird is a single, small garden, or wild bird then you do
not need to call Defra.

You should:
-leave it alone, or
-follow the guidelines below for disposal

People should follow some simple hygiene precautions to minimise the
risk of infection. It is hard for people to catch avian influenza
from birds and the following simple steps are also effective against
avian influenza.

If you have to move a dead bird

1. Avoid touching the bird with your bare hands.

2. If possible, wear disposable protective gloves when picking up and
handling (if disposable gloves are not available see point 7).

3. Place the dead bird in a suitable plastic bag, preferably
leak-proof. Care should be taken not to contaminate the outside of the bag.

4. Tie the bag and place it in a second plastic bag.

5. Remove gloves by turning them inside out and then place them in
the 2nd plastic bag. Tie the bag and dispose of in the normal
household refuse bin.

6. Hands should then be washed thoroughly with soap and water.

7. If disposable gloves are not available, a plastic bag can be used
as a make-shift glove. When the dead bird has been picked up, the bag
can be turned back on itself and tied. It should then be placed in a
2nd plastic bag, tied and disposed of in the normal household waste.

8. Alternatively, the dead bird can be buried, but not in a plastic bag.

9. Any clothing that has been in contact with the dead bird should be
washed using ordinary washing detergent at the temperature normally
used for washing the clothing.

10. Any contaminated indoor surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned
with normal household cleaner.

[According to the international terrestrial animal health code of the
OIE, an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the
H5 or H7 subtypes is notifiable (NAI). If the pathogenicity of the
current H7N3 will indeed be found eventually to be low, it will
become a low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza (LNPAI).

The summarised results of the UK surveys of wild bird populations to
screen for the presence of Avian Influenza are available at:
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/wildbirds/survey-results.htm>.

The following figures are derived from table 3, "Survey of mortality
in wild birds found dead (all species): tests completed by month from
November 2005 - April 2006:

Nov /Dec /Jan /Feb /Mar /Apr* /Total
Incidents investigated: 71 /86 /95 /479 /903 /2207* /3841
Incidents tested for AI: 32 /48 /80 /421 /722 /2338* /3641
Samples tested for AI: 147 /187 /83 /909 /1689 /4968* /7983

(*update of 26 Apr 2006)

The incidents / samples tested in particular month relate in some
cases, to incidents investigated / samples collected in previous months.

The tables do not present data on the species tested, but it is
indicated that out of 7983 samples tested, 1027 were swans. - Mod.AS]

The scene is a tranquil one, a lone farmworker in blue coveralls
ambles around 5 deserted chicken sheds in the morning sunshine.

Inside the eerily quiet farm a scattering of plastic bowls and
disinfectant spray pumps are the only clues that this is the scene of
the UK's first outbreak of the H7-strain of the bird flu virus in 15 years.

Just metres away on the other side of a tall steel gate 2 police
officers guard Whitford Lodge Poultry Farm, keeping the scrum of
journalists, cameramen and photographers at bay.

The narrow country lane that leads to the farm is lined by cars,
satellite trucks and radio vans feeding back what little information
trickles through.

The few officials on scene, a handful of police and a communications
officer from Norfolk County Council know little more than the media
pack, who wait for Defra officials to arrive.

The 1st sign of a government response comes at 10:20 am when 2
officials and 2 vets from Defra are ushered in and kitted out in blue
coveralls, face masks and protective rubber wellies.

Closely behind is a water tanker loaded with 8 10-kg tubs of VikronS
disinfectant, which claims to be effective against all 18 types of
virus affecting man and animals.

The fate of the 35 000 birds becomes apparent soon afterwards with
the arrival of a lorry laden with cylinders of the deadly gas argon
followed by another vehicle bearing sealed steel gas chambers.

As the day wore on, the ground ran white with disinfectant foam as 12
state veterinary service doctors and vets in blue and white coveralls
passed through the gate, their hazardous task reflected by the
shielded gas-masks worn by a select few.

Working their way from shed to shed, the shrouded figures prepared
the chickens for the cull and took more blood samples from the flock.

The killing began at about 4pm yesterday and will continue today,
with chickens either being gassed or shot with a stun gun.

Evidence of the grisly work was apparent from the bulging yellow
sacks of carcasses which were driven away to be rendered or
incinerated off-site.

The 1st birds are believed to have died on Saturday [22 Apr 2006],
with the number totalling about 400 birds, about 0.02 percent of the
total population.

Owners Banham Poultry submitted blood from the birds for testing
after workers noticed some were showing reduced appetite and poor
egg-production, with test results confirming the virus late on
Tuesday [25 Apr 2006].

Kimblewick Equestrian Centre is the farm's closest neighbour and
[the] owner, fears her family may have already been unwittingly
exposed to the virus.

On Monday [24 Apr 2006], their Rottweiler-cross Ziggy dumped a dead
chicken from the farm in their garden; the stinking carcass lay in a
pile of manure at the stables until Defra vets took it away late yesterday.

[The family that owns the chickens], are angry that an official and
vet from the farm who warned them to bury the bird on Tuesday made no
mention that chickens had tested positive for bird flu.

Defra experts recommended that both Mrs Moore and Nikkita take
Tamiflu and are given a flu vaccination.

Mrs Moore is concerned that fear of the virus and government movement
restrictions will force her 16-horse riding school under, destroying
the business which she has built up over 8 years and attracts 120
riders a week.

"People have been constantly phoning me since this, worrying about
whether they will be able to bring their kids for riding today," she said.

"If people stop coming here then we can keep the yard running for a
week at most before we will have to close, that is the real worry.
This is bad timing because the bank holiday weekend is a busy time for us."

For the year 2006 in Bavaria, 71 cases of avian influenza in wild
birds have been confirmed by the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI).
During the week of 24 Apr 2006 (12 noon) until 28 Apr 2006 (1 PM),
the following new cases were confirmed:

No. / Municipality / Administrative or City District / Regional
District / Species / Date H5N1 confirmed
71/ Parkstetten/ Straubing-Bogen / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 28 Apr 2006
70/ Epfach / Landsberg on the Lech / Upper Bavaria / Merganser / 28 Apr 2006
69/ Steinach / Straubing-Bogen / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 27 Apr 2006
68/ Kirchroth / Straubing-Bogen / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 27 Apr 2006
67/ Olching / Fuerstenfeldbruck / Upper Bavaria/ Duck / 24 Apr 2006

65/ Lindau / Town of Lindau / Schwabia / Crested Grebe / 24 Apr 2006
64/ Stephansposching / Deggendorf / Lower Bavaria / Swan / 24 Apr 2006

So far in 2006, 6843 wild birds have been handed over to the Bavarian
Agency for Health and Food Safety; 6084 of them have already [by 28
Apr 2006] been tested for influenza A, and the 90 samples that were
influenza A positive have been sent to the Friedrich Loeffler
Institute (FLI) for further testing. The FLI has confirmed 71 samples
as H5N1 positive, 15 as H5N1 negative, and 4 have yet to be determined.

In addition to avians, 295 carnivores (martens, foxes, cats) have
been sent to the LGL; 287 have been tested for influenza A virus. One
influenza A positive sample has been forwarded to the FLI, where it
was [found] H5N1 negative.
