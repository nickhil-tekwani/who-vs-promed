From: "Dr. Patricia \"Trish\" Somsel" <SOMSELP@mercyhealth.com>

Given the response of the quarantine officer at a major US
airport to our concern that a highly infectious young visitor would
defy our quarantine order and try to return to his homeland with
the tickets already in his possession, it would appear the
concern is mainly for those coming into [the USA with
infectious diseases, not those leaving it. This officer seemed to
feel that only foreign nationals would be at risk.
If all fellow travelers are exposed, why does it matter in which
direction the aircraft is flying? The world is indeed a small place
where TB knows no boundaries and recognizes no nationalities.

health to at least one of its quarantine officers! - Mod.JW
