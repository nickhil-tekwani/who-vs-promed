[1] Case update
Uganda NOT Ebola
- Wed 15 Aug 2018. Three alert cases in western Uganda tested negative for Ebola
[Xinhua News Agency, edited]

[Editor: Yan]

The 3 alert cases recorded in the western part of Uganda have tested negative for Ebola, the World Health Organization (WHO) said [Wed 15 Aug 2018.

The global health body said samples taken from 2 alert cases from Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that were registered in the border district of Kasese tested negative.

Samples from the 3rd alert case -- a pregnant woman who died at Kaganda hospital in Kasese district due to ante-partum hemorrhage -- also turned out negative.

The samples were tested at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, 40 km [about 25 mi] south of the capital Kampala.

Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, WHO Representative in Uganda, told Xinhua that there was no confirmed case of Ebola in Uganda though the threat is real.

"Uganda and DRC have a porous border so people will come and go for trade and business. I think having a good screening at the border is important and there are a lot of efforts to do that. Getting the health workers trained and get ready to respond is high and is ongoing," he said.

The Ebola virus is highly contagious and can cause a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, generalized pain and in many cases internal and external bleeding.

Mortality rates of Ebola fever, according to WHO, are high, with the human case fatality rate ranging from 50 percent to 89 percent, depending on viral sub-type.

[There are numerous reports on the 3 'alert' cases (note: originally referred to as 'suspect' cases) not being confirmed as Ebola. 2 individuals crossing the border had fever, and 1 pregnant female died in Uganda. This is good news on several fronts. First, it is good news that the Ebola outbreak has not spread to the neighboring country of Uganda. And it is also good news it does not represent a new outbreak in Uganda. Further, this incident demonstrates that the border checks worked to detect individuals with fever. There are many and diverse agents that will cause fever, so this serves to remind us that all fever in the region is not Ebola. But it would be helpful to know exactly what confirmatory assays were conducted in the laboratory. Are the assays specific for Ebola Zaire, and then would they miss Ebola Bundibugyo, which has also been active in this area in the past? Are they testing for other agents than Ebola to determine etiology of these patients' illness?

ProMED thanks Greg Folkers, NIAID, <gfolkers@nih.gov> for alerting us to the lack of confirmation of the 3 cases as Ebola. Also Yonas Woldermariam, WHO, should be thanked for his submitted note. - Mod.LK]

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/ebola-cases-mounting-drc-region-prepares-more
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Ebola outbreak on the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) grew by 9 more confirmed cases today, and 1 death. 6 of the new cases (including the death) are from Mandima health zone in Ituri province. Ituri borders North Kivu province, the outbreak's epicenter. The cases expand the number of cases in neighboring Ituri province.

Yesterday [14 Aug 2018], the DRC said a man from Ituri had contracted Ebola and had been treated for heart problems at Mangina Reference Hospital. He died upon his return home.

The outbreak total now stands at 66, which includes 39 confirmed and 27 probable cases. Lab testing results have brought the suspected number of cases down to 36 from 58. [Note these numbers are slightly different from the MoH report above. But the situation still reflects an increase in cases over the previous report. - Mod.LK]

North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in DRC, with 8 million inhabitants. Ituri, South Kivu, Maniema, and Tshopo are neighboring regions, and home to an additional 1 million displaced persons. The area is a hothouse of rebel activity. ...[more]

Surveillance at entry points increases
--------------------------------------
According to the latest situation report published by the WHO, a total of 990 contacts are under surveillance in Mabalako (790), Beni (141), and Mandima (59) health zones as of [11 Aug 2018]. Of these, 129 are healthcare workers. So far, 8 healthcare workers have contracted the virus, and 1 has died.

Today [15 Aug 2018] the WHO detailed the surveillance and preparedness plans underway in the DRC and Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi -- the countries most likely to experience spillover infections.

"WHO is deploying Preparedness Support Teams to these and other neighbouring countries, as was done during the previous EVD outbreak in Equateur province," the WHO said. "These missions aim to assess countries' readiness using a WHO checklist and to provide technical support to countries to develop and implement national contingency plans in collaboration with partners." [see WHO report below on preparedness - Mod.LK]

The WHO also said it will be strengthening surveillance capacities in 18 international points of entry in North Kivu. Burundi, Central African Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Uganda, and Zambia have already implemented heightened POE activities.

The WHO is not suggesting restricted travel to and from DRC.

False alarm in Uganda [see also report above]
---------------------------------------------
Yesterday [14 Aug 2018], international news media, including Xinhua, reported 3 suspected cases of Ebola detected in Uganda. [...] Today, officials from the WHO and Uganda took to Twitter to announce that lab testing showed there was no Ebola in Uganda.

"There is no confirmed case of #Ebola in #Uganda as reported in sections of the international media. The MOH have heightened surveillance and operational readiness to respond to #Ebola," said Yonas Woldemariam, MD, WHO country representative for Uganda on Twitter.

[As has been noted in the Twitter responses to the false alarm, the heightened surveillance underway will likely lead to other suspect or alert cases [see tweets by Peter Salama and Yonas Woldemariam, among others]. These need to be distinguished as different from suspect cases who have actually had contact with an infected individual. Many infectious agents present clinically similar to Ebola. A point of care assay would greatly facilitate diagnostics, increase speed of testing and safety through rapid clarification of risk for population in contact with potential cases.

A new Ebola death was recorded on Tue 14 Aug 2018 in the Mandima Health Zone, Mambasa territory (Ituri). 6 other positive cases were recorded 48 hours after the positive case was reported in the area.

3 new cases of the virus were confirmed in the Mabalako health zone in Beni territory [North Kivu].

The Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) is operational in Mangina and in the city of Beni. On Tue [14 Aug], the international NGO Doctors Without Borders [MSF] transferred the patients from the hospital to the CTE for effective care. ...[more]

[Al Jazeera, edited]

Highlights
----------
Internal conflict is hampering efforts to rein in an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned, urging a ceasefire to stop the virus from spreading.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, told reporters on [Tue 14 Aug 2018] he feared conditions on the ground in the eastern province had created "a conducive environment for the transmission of Ebola."

The new outbreak poses the same problems as past cases in the DRC, including logistical hurdles in a country with weak health infrastructure. But in North Kivu, health workers are being forced to navigate their response among more than 100 armed groups.

Targeted vaccination, aimed primarily at front-line health workers, began last week [week of 6 Aug 2018], and so far 216 people have received a jab [that is, been vaccinated].

[It would be in the best interest of the population, including the warring factions, to allow the DRC to get Ebola under control. A ceasefire would certainly help health care workers and international and governmental agencies accomplish this difficult task by making cases and suspects more accessible. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 14 Aug 2018. EVD in the DRC - WHO; operational readiness and preparedness in neighbouring countries
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/14-august-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Currently for the EVD outbreak in North Kivu, the WHO Regional Office for Africa has prioritized 4 of the 9 countries (Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda) neighbouring the Democratic Republic of the Congo to enhance operational readiness and preparedness (Figure 1. Countries identified for enhanced operational readiness and preparedness activities [available at the source URL above]).

These 4 countries were prioritised based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks, and their proximity to the areas currently reporting EVD cases. In addition, Kinshasa, Mai-Ndombe, Tshuapa, Tshopo, South Kivu, Ituri, Bas-Uele, Sankuru, and Maniema provinces were prioritized for readiness activities. This update will primarily focus on the four of the nine priority countries.

WHO is deploying Preparedness Support Teams to these and other neighbouring countries, as was done during the previous EVD outbreak in Equateur province. These missions aim to assess countries' readiness using a WHO checklist and to provide technical support to countries to develop and implement national contingency plans in collaboration with partners. The operational and preparedness activities will focus on the following thematic areas:

- Coordination
- Surveillance
- Rapid response teams (RRTs)
- Points of entry (POEs):
- Laboratory
- Case management and IPC (infection prevention and control)
- Risk communication
- Logistics

Also included:
- WHO regional strategic plan for EVD operational readiness and preparedness
- WHO advice
