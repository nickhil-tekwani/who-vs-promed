The equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) quarantine at Barn 44 at Belmont Park, in Elmont, New York, has been lifted after a subsequent test has come back negative on one horse that had tested positive 2 weeks ago [week of Sun 7 Jan 2018], the New York Racing Association (NYRA) reported [Fri 26 Jan 2018].

Officials at NYRA and New York State Gaming Commission have removed the quarantine, effective immediately. Horses in Barn 44 are now able to run and enter races, as well as train among the general horse population during regular training hours.

All horses in Barn 44 were monitored daily for fever and other signs of illness. No other horses showed any signs of disease.

The affected horse, an unnamed, unraced 3-year-old male, tested positive for EHV-1 on [Tue 9 Jan 2018] after being sent to the nearby Cornell Ruffian Equine Hospital after developing a fever and a mild respiratory issue. Last week [week of Sun 14 Jan 2018], follow-up testing returned a 2nd EHV-1 positive on the same horse.

The horse, trained by Linda Rice, was tested for a 3rd time on [Wed 24 Jan 2018]. Officials received the negative results [Thu 25 Jan 2018] evening.

Since leaving the Ruffian Equine Hospital, the affected horse was quarantined in isolation in a separate barn on the Belmont grounds, where he has remained afebrile and asymptomatic. As an additional precaution, the horse will remain in isolation through the coming days.

[This is directly related to a notice a short while back that NYRA was taking the precaution of quarantining Barn 44 at the Belmont track. So this is very good news the horses have tested negative and remain healthy.
