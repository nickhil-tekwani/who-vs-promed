[The location of the outbreak, in the very eastern-most part of the country,
can be seen at
<http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&id=3dee2cf37>.

A broad swath of Europe has ongoing, periodic, but uncommon small outbreaks of
Classical Swine Fever, almost always resulting from contact with wild boar.
Not to be overlooked however, are significant outbreaks like those in the
Netherlands and United Kingdom. How the disease is maintained in wild boar
is an interesting question, but given the potential significant difficulties
if this disease becomes widespread in a nation's swine herd, it is good that
these periodic small outbreaks are efficiently identified by the current
surveillance systems.
Nevertheless, any feasible, economically justifiable measures to reduce or
eliminate the disease in wild boar populations might be value-added preventive
medicine.
For example, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Former Yugoslavian Republic of
Macedonia, France, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovakia
and Germany
all reported outbreaks in 2004.
If we go back as far as 2003, Italy, Luxembourg and Albania had new
outbreaks.
In 2002, when the previous outbreak of CSF in Croatia occurred,
Spain, Slovenia & Belgium
were added to the list of countries reporting a new outbreak, even if
not for the 1st time.
In summary, it appears that in Europe there are not many new
countries each year reporting these periodic outbreaks; the outbreaks are
neither very involved nor widespread, but there is a persistence of this
potentially consequential disease. - Mod.PC]
