With icy ponds forcing ducks and geese to crowd closer and closer together,
wildlife refuge managers are continuing the grim task of collecting the
dead in an effort to slow an outbreak of avian cholera.
The bacterial disease has killed more than 1500 birds so far at the Butte
Sink section of the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge complex, said Mike
Carpenter, one of the wildlife biologists who has been scooping the dead
birds from ponds and shorelines. A further 214 were collected Sunday [14
Jan 2007] on a refuge boat that sometimes broke through a half-inch-thick
layer of ice on its rounds, he said.
A few birds were saved for testing, but most went into an incinerator:
little gray and black coots, ruddy ducks streaked with vivid green, and
wigeons, a compact duck with male breeding plumage that turns russet and is
set off by a blue beak. "I don't like picking up dead birds," said
Carpenter, "but you're saving lots of birds by staying on top of the disease."
Fueled by cold, crowding and low water levels, cholera can fell tens of
thousands of birds in a bad winter. This year's [2007] episode, while not
unusual in cold weather, is one of the harsh realities facing migratory
waterfowl.
"I have actually seen birds drop out of the sky from avian cholera," said
Bob McLandress, president of California Waterfowl Association, whose
graduate work included studying the disease. "All of a sudden, a bird will
fall down, and within 20 minutes it's stone dead." The disease poses no
risks to hunters, he said, as long as any ducks they take are thoroughly
cooked. So far, avian cholera doesn't appear to have spread significantly
through the network of wildlife refuges, flooded rice fields and duck clubs
that dot the Central Valley, McLandress said, but that could change. Once
the disease has taken hold in one place, "the chances of it flaring up
during the rest of the winter will be higher," he said. "I do not think it
is the end of it." Often, avian cholera seems to target a species or 2 and
spare many others, he said, but the victims can vary from year to year,
with some outbreaks tougher on snow geese or Ross's geese.
Overcrowding is a key factor in spreading avian cholera from bird to bird,
and right now, conditions are ripe for overcrowding. With 3 million to 4
million waterfowl in the Central Valley now, the relative lack of rain
means there are fewer places for migratory birds to gather, McLandress said.
Cold weather compounds the problem, both because the birds stay closer for
warmth and because some wetlands freeze, making even less open water
available to the birds. For bird watchers, the crowding can also mean a
chance to see bigger flocks than usual gathered in one place.
Refuge officials plan to take a boat out again today [16 Jan 2007] to
continue monitoring for cholera, searching for more dead birds at Butte
Sink Wildlife Management Area, an 18 000 acre complex west of the Sutter
Buttes and east of the town of Colusa.
The birds saved for testing are also being checked for avian flu, a far
more worrisome disease, because it has the potential to mutate into a
deadly flu that could spread easily among humans. Migratory flocks are
tested regularly in California for bird flu, but it has not yet been
detected here.
