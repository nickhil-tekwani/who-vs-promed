[I would just like to reiterate the importance of watching the
developing pattern of spread in wild birds and poultry, given these
recent outbreaks in Central Asia. Previously, in April and May of
2005, there was a substantial wild bird outbreaks at Qinghai Lake.
This was followed in July and August with spread North and West to
Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang Province in China.

The location of this outbreak can be seen in the OIE/WAHID posting or
