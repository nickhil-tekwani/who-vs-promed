Beaufort incident: Two more hospitalized
------------------------------------
Two more people have been admitted to the Beaufort District Hospital Friday
after coming into contact with contaminated water.
A source said 28 of the 44 who were admitted earlier are still being
monitored, especially 3 who still displayed some symptoms.
State Health Director Dr Saimy Ismail had said Thursday that the 44
teenagers and children who were admitted with complaints of fever,
coughing, headache and vomiting contracted them after bathing in the stream
by Kampung Kabatu and Kebidang. (It was earlier reported to be a monsoon
drain).
The first case was on 13 Oct 1999 followed by the rest seeking treatment.
A 15-year-old-boy who suffered severe haemorrhagic symptoms was referred to
the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 17 Oct 1999 but died several hours after
admission. He was said to have suffered internal bleeding in his lungs.
Investigations are still continuing into the cause.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Datuk Seri Amar Osu Sukam said "The Health
Department is monitoring the situation there and we have asked the relevant
authorities to get water samples for analysis and find out the exact
cause," he said.
Osu advised parents and villagers near the affected area to restrain their
children from taking a dip in the suspected stream. "I was also given to
understand that it was a drain and not supposed to be used as a place to
take bath, but due to heavy rain the children took the opportunity to do
so," he said.
Meanwhile, the Department of Environment (DOE) was reported to have queried
operators of an oil palm mill and the Sabah Rubber Fund Board to
investigate the contamination allegations.
