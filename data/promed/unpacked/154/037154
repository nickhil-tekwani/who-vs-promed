This Monday [30 Jun 2008], the state Health Secretariat confirmed the
3rd case of hantavirus [infection] in Minas Gerais this year [2008].
A 29-year-old man died because of the disease in Uberaba, in the
Triangulo Mineiro, on 26 Mar [2008]. This is the 2nd confirmed
[hantavirus-caused] death in the state.

According to the Ministry of Health, from January to June [2008], 34
cases were confirmed across the country, with 17 deaths. Hantaviruses
are transmitted by field rats. The human being can be [infected by]
breathing [virus] contaminated dust from faeces, urine, and saliva
from infected animals. The main symptoms are fever, severe headache,
muscle pain, anoxia, dry cough, nausea, and vomiting.

[The specific hantavirus that infected these patients is not given in
this report. The ProMED-mail report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb
2008 (archive no. 20080223.07412) indicated that [hanta]viruses
circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the
_Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had
previously been found in Para state, but without a known host. Field
research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_
was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus.

hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), and Argentinean hantaviruses,

host is _Necromys [Bolomys] lasiurus_ in Brazil, is cited in

Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent of HPS in Brazil. Its
rodent host is _Oligoryzomys fornesi_ in Brazil and is cited in:
