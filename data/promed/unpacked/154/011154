The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is reporting a case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) confirmed to be present in a Cheboygan County beef herd, located in Michigan's Accredited Free Zone (AFZ). The case was found through routine surveillance testing, as required by the state's current Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). This is Michigan's 81st cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB since 1998.

"As with all new findings of this disease in a cattle herd, additional testing will be done in the herd, and an epidemiologic investigation has been started to rule out the possibility of additional cases stemming from the affected herd," said State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "A key part of this investigation will be whole genome sequencing, a comprehensive analysis of DNA from the TB bacteria found within this sample. This analysis will help to determine the source of the infection. Results of this testing may take up to 3 months to be completed."

Bovine TB is a bacterial disease affecting all mammals, including humans. It is known to be present in the free-ranging white-tailed deer population in specific areas of northeastern lower Michigan, and the disease can be transmitted between deer and cattle. As a result, there are currently 2 TB zones within the state: a 4-county area in northern lower Michigan called the Modified Accredited Zone (MAZ); the remainder of the state is referred to as the Accredited Free Zone (AFZ).

Although Cheboygan County is a part of the AFZ, it is also categorized as a buffer county, which is a county adjacent to the 4 counties of the MAZ (Alpena, Alcona, Oscoda, and Montmorency counties). As required by the MOU, MDARD has been testing herds in buffer counties over the past year. This herd was identified as part of that surveillance program.

This is the 1st recorded case of a bovine TB-positive cattle herd in Cheboygan County; however, the disease was detected in 2 free-ranging white-tailed deer from the county in 2010. While state and federal agencies are taking significant steps to manage the disease, the continued hunting of deer in this area is an important tool in maintaining healthy deer and cattle populations.

Bovine tuberculosis (TB) has been confirmed in a South Dakota beef herd for the 1st time since 2017.

State Veterinarian Dr. Dustin Oedekoven says an infected cow was initially identified in January [2021] by meat inspectors during routine inspection at a Minnesota packing plant. Records linked the cow to a Corson County beef herd, which had additional animals confirmed as infected by recent laboratory testing.

The State Veterinarian's office is working closely with the affected herd owner as well as other producers in the area, USDA officials, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal officials, area veterinarians and wildlife officials to evaluate the extent of the disease and mitigate further spread. Necessary precautions are being taken to protect the health of South Dakota's cattle industry. Dr. Oedekoven stated bovine TB is not currently a threat to food safety in the United States, thanks to milk pasteurization and comprehensive meat inspection programs.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic, slowly progressive respiratory disease of cattle. Infected animals may transmit infection to other animals when in close proximity for prolonged periods. Cattle rarely exhibit visible signs of illness, and testing of cattle herds is necessary to determine if animals are infected. The USA has nearly eliminated bovine TB due to a cooperative eradication campaign. South Dakota has officially been recognized as free of the disease since 1982.

[The following is from the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS; https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/programs/nwrc/SA_NWDP/CT_Tb):

"Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic bacterial disease (primarily of cattle) caused by the microorganism _Mycobacterium bovis_. The disease can affect other species, including humans and wildlife. Bovine TB is most often transmitted to humans by inhalation of aerosolized respiratory tract bacteria, ingestion of unpasteurized milk, and inoculation by contaminated instruments (such as knives). The disease can be spread from livestock to wildlife or wildlife to livestock via the fecal-oral route, ingestion of contaminated food, or though the respiratory tract. The APHIS Bovine TB Eradication Program has reduced TB in US cattle; however, spillover into wildlife may maintain the microorganism in the environment and function as a source of re-infection for livestock."

"Bovine tuberculosis in wildlife was first documented in the United States in white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in 1933. They continue to be the wildlife species of most concern because they are known to become infected and transmit bovine TB via the oral or respiratory route and are considered reservoirs in some areas. Other wildlife and feral species in North America where _M. bovis_ has been detected include:

- Elk (_Cervus canadensis_)
- Mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_)
- Bison (_Bison bison_)
- Raccoons (_Procyon lotor_)
- Moose (_Alces alces_)
- Coyotes (_Canis latrans_)
- Opossums (_Didelphis virginiana_)
- Feral cats (_Felis silvestris catus_)
- Gray fox (_Urocyon cinereoargenteus_)
- Black bears (_Ursus americanus_)
- Feral swine (_Sus scrofa_)
- Gray wolves (_Canis lupus_)
- Red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_)
- Bobcat (_Lynx rufus_)

"Wildlife surveillance for TB in the United States: Active surveillance for TB in wildlife is currently being conducted only in Michigan and Minnesota, where the disease has been documented in white-tailed deer. However, surveillance in wildlife is often conducted in other areas of the United States following the detection of bovine TB in domestic livestock or captive cervids. These short-term surveillance programs are usually established to evaluate whether bovine TB is present in wildlife on or near infected premises."

These state folks will be tracing any animal moving into the herd (trace-ins) as well as any animal moving out of the herd (trace-outs). This can help determine what other herds may need to be tested. So this will be a very busy time for state and federal veterinarians. - Mod.TG
