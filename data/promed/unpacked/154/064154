[During the 13th meeting of the Standing Group of Experts on ASF in Europe held 29 May 2019, Ukraine reported that: "ASF is endemic in the country. However, the situation appears to have significantly improved in 2019 compared to 2018. 100 percent of dead wild boars are tested. Awareness campaigns are being deployed aiming at farms and backyards particularly."
