[Although the OIE report submitted by China did not describe the affected population, a report by Reuters (http://news.msn.com/world/china-poultry-farm-hit-in-new-outbreak-of-h5n6-bird-flu) indicates that geese were involved.

Reuters noted that 20 550 geese in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, were showing signs of the disease and that 17 790 birds died. This same report said that the ministry had "sealed off and sterilized the infected area, besides culling and safely disposing of almost 69 000 geese." The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed that the geese had the H5N6 virus.

"In May 2014, a 49 year old man in China's Sichuan province died influenza due to the H5N6 bird flu virus, which domestic media described as the world's 1st known human infection with the strain." See ProMED-mail archive number 20140505.2451125.
