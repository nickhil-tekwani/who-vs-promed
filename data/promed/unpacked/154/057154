The Health Surveillance Agency in Rondonia [Brazil] this Fri 7 Sep 2012 is going to donate 30 000 doses of yellow fever [YF] vaccine to the Guajara-Mirim municipality, Bolivia, the country located along the border with Rondonia [state], Brazil. According to the Advanced Planning and Management Unit of [Brazilian] Guajara-Mirim, the Bolivian Consulate requested help after identifying 2 cases of the disease on Bolivian soil.

According to Suzana Cury El Chebib Filha, Secretary of the Advance Unit, the vaccine is available to donate. "We have many people who cross the border between Brazil and Bolivia, and so beginning this Wed 5 Sep 2012, we are offering the populace along the border immunization at vaccination posts set up in the army base here in Guajara-Mirim," Suzana stated. "The objective is to avoid the spread of the disease and infection of other people, both on the Bolivian and the Brazilian side of the border," Suzana explained. Vaccination cards are required by the federal police for tourists in both countries.

[This is a very good example of timely international cooperation to avoid spread of YF, a very serious disease, to people living along the Bolivian-Brazilian border. No information is provided about the 2 YF cases in Bolivia, but presumably the infections were acquired in forested areas where the sylvan YF virus transmission cycle occurs. Sylvatic YF occurs sporadically in inhabitants of the forests in the Amazon basin. Good vaccination coverage is essential to prevent YF virus from becoming established in the urban cycle, with transmission from person to person via _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes. - Mod.TY]
