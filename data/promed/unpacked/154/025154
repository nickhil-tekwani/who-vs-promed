Decline in agriculture results in increased incidence of hemorrhagic fever
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The head of Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Service for Consumer Affairs
and Human Welfare], Gennady Onishenko, has issued a document stating
that the increase in incidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has
been facilitated by the increase of vegetation as a consequence of a
decline in sheep rearing and grazing in the Southern Federal Okrug [district].

He also stated that virus circulation has risen because of high
temperatures, which have remained above 15 deg C [59 deg F] during
the spring months in recent years. During the past 10 years, 1217
people contracted Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the Southern
Federal District, 60 of whom died (4.9 percent). 212 cases were
registered in South Russia in 2008, including 12 fatalities (5.6
percent). The number of cases in 2008 increased by 52 percent in
Rostov Oblast [region] and by 26 percent in Stavropol region compared to 2007.

More than 90 percent of cases were rural residents, who worked in
animal husbandry, in gardens, or in the fields. The urban population
contracted infection during visits to country homes and the
countryside. In most cases infection was the result of tick bites or
by removal of ticks with bare hands. High rates of tick infestation
have occurred in early autumn creating potential for epidemic
development this year [2009]. Activation of ticks and their 1st
contacts with people are expected at the end of March and beginning
of April. Gennady Onishenko recommends immediate initiation of tick
control measures such as treatment of all farm animals and all
recreational areas.

[Rostov and Stavropol regions had the highest rates of this infection
in the Southern Federal District in 2008. Dynamics of the years since
2004 indicate a steadily worsening situation in these regions. The
statistics for Rostov region are as follows: 2004 - 9 cases; 2005 -
16; 2006 - 53; 2007 - 53; 2008 - 81. For Stavropol region: 2004 - 28
cases; 2005 - 38; 2006 - 41; 2007 - 63; 2008 - 80 (data may be not
very accurate).

Tick control activities started late in 2008, only at the end of May,
despite Gennady Onishenko's recommendation and haven't been done
fully, which led to a worsening of the situation. Meantime, the
number of cases dropped from 64 in 2007 to 19 in 2008 in Kalmykia,
another leader of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever morbidity in the
region. Morbidity decreased also in Astrakhan and Volgograd regions
at least 2-fold. The epidemic situation may stabilize this year
(2009) provided preventive measures start on time in the Southern
Federal District. - Mod.NP]
