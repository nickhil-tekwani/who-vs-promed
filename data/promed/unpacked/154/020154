A total of 4 people have been sickened in an outbreak Legionnaires' disease that has been linked to a hotel in northwestern Minnesota. The individuals became ill between [22 Jan and 27 Jan 2019], with all having spent some time at the Crookston Inn and Convention Center prior to falling ill, though none of them stayed the night.

The Minnesota Department of Health [MDH] is investigating what the source of the _Legionella_ bacteria might be, but says early evidence and "past experience" suggest the source is the hotel's spa. The pool and spa area has been closed to guests by hotel management, with MDH and hotel staff working to decontaminate the areas.

Meanwhile the hotel is notifying anyone who was at the hotel between [14 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019], informing them that they may have been exposed to the bacteria. "If you spent time at the hotel between [14 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019] and are ill with undiagnosed pneumonia or you develop symptoms in the 2 weeks following your visit, please see a health care provider to be evaluated for possible Legionnaire's disease," said Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at MDH.

Most people exposed to _Legionella_ won't develop Legionnaires' - a form of bacterial pneumonia - but smokers, those aged over 50, and those with weakened immune systems, diabetes or lung disease are particularly vulnerable. Symptoms to watch out for are fever fatigue, headache, muscle aches, chills, shortness of breath, loss of appetite and coughing.

[According to the US CDC, about 20-25% of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 4 cases of legionnaires' disease being investigated in people who visited the Crookston Inn and Convention Center in Crookston, Minnesota will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes matched. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Crookston is a city with a population of 7891 in 2010, in the U.S. state of Minnesota; it is in part a commuter town to the larger city of Grand Forks, North Dakota, which is 25 mi [approx. 40 km] to the northwest. A map showing the location of Crookston can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Grand+Forks,+ND/Crookston,+MN+56716. Crookston Inn and Convention Center has 74 guestrooms, an indoor pool and "health club" (https://www.hotels.com/ho434810/crookston-inn-and-convention-center-crookston-united-states-of-america). - Mod.ML
