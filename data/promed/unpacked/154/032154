Larger than usual increase in cases of hantavirus infections in Belgium,
France & Germany, June 2005
-------------------------------------------------
An exceptionally large increase in hantavirus infections has been detected
simultaneously in Belgium, Germany, and France since spring 2005. From 1
Jan to 15 Jun 2005, 120 cases were reported in Belgium and 115 cases in
France. In Germany, 258 laboratory-confirmed hantavirus cases were reported
between 1 Jan and 30 Jun 2005 and, in contrast to previous annual trends,
the increase in cases has occurred earlier in the year (see figure in the
original text).
The total numbers of cases for 2003 and 2004 were, respectively, 122 and 47
in Belgium, 128 and 55 in France. In Germany the numbers of reported cases
for 2003 and 2004 from 1 Jan to 30 Jun were 72 and 64, respectively.
In 2005, most cases have been in men; the male:female sex ratio was 3.0 in
Belgium, 3.4 in France, and 2.5 in Germany. Their mean age was around 41
years in all 3 countries: 43 (range: 11 to 82 years) in Belgium, 43 (range:
16 to 83 years) in France and 41 (range: 5 to 75 years) in Germany. In
Germany, most infections were caused by the hantavirus species _Puumala
virus_ (n=212, 82 per cent), 5 infections (2 per cent) were caused by
_Dobrava virus_ and for 41 cases the causative virus was not specified (16
per cent).
Belgium
-------
In Belgium, the area most affected in this outbreak is Luxembourg province,
where there have been 34 cases, an incidence of 2.0 per 100 000
inhabitants, followed by Liege province (27 cases, 2.6/100 000) and the
Namur province (25 cases, 5.5/100 000). A large number of cases in Liege
province was observed in 2003. In Belgium, hantavirus epidemics are
characterised by a minor spring peak and a major summer peak, and so a
further increase in the registered number of cases is anticipated for 2005.
According to local health professionals, part of this increase is due to a
greater awareness among health professionals and a higher recourse to
hantavirus testing. Risk factors for Belgian cases are not yet available.
Since 1980. over 1200 cases have been diagnosed in Belgium, and outbreaks
of hantavirus infections in humans have been described in 1985, 1990, 1991,
1993, 1996, 1999, 2001 and 2003, with most cases having onset in summer.
Known endemic areas are the provinces of Hainaut, Namur and Luxembourg.
In Belgium, the national reference laboratory for hantavirus infections and
the IPH sentinel laboratory network report data to the Scientific Institute
of Public Health (IPH).
France
------
Most of the 2005 cases in France are in the Ardennes (40 cases, 13.8/100
000) and the Aisne Administrative Departements (18 cases, 6.9/100 000) in
northern France, bordering on Belgium. The Departement of Jura bordering on
Switzerland is also an epidemic area, with 13 cases to 15 Jun 2005 (5.2/100
000).
Since 1980, over 1000 cases of hantavirus infection have been diagnosed in
France. Hantavirus outbreaks have been described in 1985, 1990, 1991, 1993,
1996, 1999, and 2003, with most cases having onset in summer. The known
endemic areas in previous years have been northeastern France, along the
Belgian and German borders (in the Administrative Departements of Ardennes,
Aisne, Nord and the administrative regions of Lorraine, Picardie and
Franche-Comte). Clusters of hantavirus infections have rarely been reported
in the Jura before 2005.
In France, the national reference laboratory for hantavirus infections is
in charge of surveillance of human infections.
Germany
-------
The increase of hantavirus infections in Germany between 1 Jan and 30 Jun
2005 has also been seen in federal states such as Nordrhein-Westfalen,
Niedersachsen and Hessen, that have not had high hantavirus prevalence in
previous years. The federal states most affected are Nordrhein-Westfalen
(92 cases, 0.5/100 000), Niedersachsen (51 cases, 0.6/100 000),
Baden-Wuerttemberg (46 cases, 0.4/100 000), Hessen (23 cases, 0.4/100 000)
and Bayern (23 cases, 0.2/100 000).
In Germany, the average incidence for hantavirus infections over the time
period 2001-2004 was 0.25/100 000. An increase in hantavirus infections was
observed in 2002 and 2004. In both years the increase was due to outbreaks
in a known endemic area of Baden-Wuerttemberg, and an outbreak of 38 cases
also occurred in Niederbayern in 2004. In Germany, the known regions with
higher prevalence of human hantavirus infections are Schwaebische Alb in
Baden-Wuerttemberg and parts of Unterfranken in Bayern (Bavaria).
Hantavirus infection became a notifiable disease in Germany with the
introduction of the Infektionsschutzgesetz (the Protection against
Infection Act) in 2001. Reports of laboratory confirmed Hantavirus
infections are transmitted to the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI) based on a
case definition (1).
In many forest and agricultural regions of Belgium, France and Germany, a
significant increase in the population density of rodents, especially
voles, has been observed since the autumn of 2004, with no sign of this
increase abating.
Control Measures and Recommendations
------------------------------------
An alert was sent out from France through the European Early Warning and
Response System (EWRS) on 21 Jun 2005, and subsequent messages were sent
through this system from Germany (22 June) and Belgium (5 July).
General recommendations for avoiding hantavirus infection include
preventing rodent access to houses or buildings. Any factor that could
attract rodents inside, such as keeping uncovered food, should be avoided.
When cleaning a previously unoccupied building where rodents may have
settled, soil and surfaces should be sprayed with a disinfectant before
dust is removed. People living in endemic areas should be informed about
the risk factors and clinical symptoms of the disease, and advised to seek
medical attention and report their risk exposure if they develop symptoms
consistent with haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
A case control study including Belgian and French cases identified the main
risk factors as living less than 50 m from a forest and seeing rodents in
or around the home, digging, spending long periods in the forest and being
in contact with wood or disturbed earth or dust (2).
Information has been released to the general public in Liege province in
Belgium, and general information is available on the website of the
Scientific Institute of Public Health (IPH), Brussels
(<http://www.iph.fgov.be/epidemio>) and the national reference laboratory's
website (<http://www.smd.be/rlvbd>).
An update of the situation on 24 Jun 2005 is also available on the IPH
website (3). Printed versions of the leaflet have been widely distributed
and more copies can be obtained from the IPH.
In France, information about the disease and recommendations for avoiding
infection have been issued in the national media to alert the resident
population in affected areas and tourists. A leaflet is being printed by
the Ministry of Health describing the clinical features of hantavirus
infection and general recommendations protecting homes from rodents and
avoiding infection when working or spending leisure time outdoors, and this
will be soon available in camping sites, leisure centres and tourist
information offices. The InVS [Institut de veille sanitaire] has published
a press release (4) and more information is available at the websites of
the Ministry of Health (<http://www.sante.gouv.fr>) and the Institut
Pasteur (<http://www.pasteur.fr>).
In Germany, a further increase in human cases is expected during the
following months. Health care professionals around Germany are increasingly
aware of the disease, and guidelines for preventing hantavirus infection
are available on the RKI website (5). In collaboration with the federal and
local health departments, the RKI is conducting a nationwide case control
study to identify more specific risk factors for human hantavirus
infections in Germany (6). There are plans to trap rodents in affected
areas to test for hantavirus infection.
