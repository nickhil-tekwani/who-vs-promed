Possible Exacerbation of Hantavirus Infection in Mice by Off-road Vehicles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little off-road recreation may result in more [rodents carrying [the
hantavirus [Sin Nombre virus, according to University of Utah researchers.
The scientists found 30 percent of the deer mice near the Bureau of Land
Management's Little Sahara Recreation Area are infected with [the
hantavirus [Sin Nombre virus. Little Sahara is located 40 miles southwest
of Provo. The researchers hypothesize that the high infection rate, which
is 3 times that of similar habitats in the Great Basin area, is a result of
heavy ORV use in the area. Dr. Denise Dearing, who led the research team,
suggests that the abundance of dirt roads in the recreation area create
"habitat islands" that force deer mice and wood rats into smaller pockets
of vegetation. In tight quarters, the mice fight more readily, passing the
disease through saliva and blood. Researchers have not determined if the
increased prevalence of [Sin Nombre virus will result in more humans
contracting the disease, but Dearing believes it is probable. "You've got
more deer mice with hantavirus infection, so humans have an increased risk
of contact with infected deer mice," she said. The infection level found in
the recreation area mirrors that of the Four Corners area in 1993, the
location of the first widely reported [Sin Nombre virus outbreak.
From the first recorded case 8 years ago to 7 Dec 2000, the United States
has reported 277 cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome, more than 100
resulting in death. Utah has reported 14 cases during the period. Dearing
[believes that it will be necessary to extablish a balance between ORV use
and protected land. "When habitats get seriously degraded, they should be
given a rest and a chance to recover," she said.
Dr. Denise Dearing, biology student Rachel Mackelprang and Stephen St.
Jeor, a virologist at the University of Nevada-Reno, were trying to
quantify the prevalence of hantavirus infection in wood rats when the issue
of ORV use in the area surfaced as a corollary issue. Dearing discovered 3
years ago during a separate study in the recreation area that wood rats
also carry the disease. She set 3 traps at 40 separate wood middens, baited
with the wood rats' favorite nesting materials Â— cotton, oats and peanut
butter. She caught not only wood rats but deer mice, pinyon mice, kangaroo
rats, pocket mice and sagebrush voles. While some wood rats had the virus,
the prevalence in deer mice far surpassed that of the other rodents. During
trips to the recreation area, students had questioned how ORV use in the
area might be affecting the mice. Dearing didn't take the inquiries too
seriously until one student brought in an aerial photo of the study site
that showed the land spattered with dirt roads.
Dearing compared the tentative hypothesis against previous research. She
found studies indicating that mowed fields or roads force mice into
concentrated areas where they are more susceptible to infections. She also
found a previous study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention that found only 11 percent of deer mice had hantavirus infection
in 4 other Great Basin sites with similar habitat but without the
concentrated ORV use.
A full account of this new study will appear in the May-June issue of the
journal "Emerging Infectious Diseases", published by the CDC.
