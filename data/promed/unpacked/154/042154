Background information on leishmaniasis in Afghanistan
-----------------------------------------
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a very old endemic disease. The Afghanistan form
is most probably an example of "Leishmaniasis of the Old World" that is
common in the Mediterranean area and along the "Silk Route" between the
Middle East and the Far East. It is hosted mainly by animals. Unlike
_L.donovani_ (the agent for kala azar), the cutaneous form (primarily
caused by _L.tropica_) is harboured in smaller animals.
The cycle is very interesting because the transmitting vector, _Phlebotomus
papatasii_, protects itself from the heat in arid areas in the burrows of
_Psammomys_ mice, which [are found] along dry river beds that still have
some
humidity in their soil. In the evening and at night the flies leave the
burrows and may fly as far as a kilometer, and that's when they bite
exposed areas of the body. Because of the heat people may sleep half naked,
and we have seen people who were bitten so many times that they had a few
dozen ulcers.
It is intriguing to observe such a widespread epidemic as the
current one, and I wonder whether the people involved migrated only
recently to these areas. In Jericho we found at the time that most children
over the age of 6 were already protected, having probably been infected
before.

[Thank you very much for the interesting background information. We have no
information as to whether the increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis is due to
an increase of the vector or migration of non-immune humans into endemic
areas. - Mod.EP]
