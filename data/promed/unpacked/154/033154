With regard to the report on the origin of the classical swine fever
0utbreak in the UK in ProMED Digest V2000 #236, I still have a few
rhetorical questions for the specialists in the UK.
Did the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) laboratory in the UK have
samples of a comparable strain in their freezer and does their biosecurity
regime preclude escape of CSFV?
How can a terroristic attack be excluded as cause of the infection?
How can illegal import of e.g., meishan pigs be excluded as cause of the
infection?
I know these are perhaps stupid questions, but I can not believe the story
of the sandwich as the only probable cause of the infection. A quantitative
study of all probable causes and risks should be performed.
In the Netherlands it was very difficult for farmers to remember things
which happened less than a week ago. I can believe the farmer remembers
very well where some specific animals have been housed, but there should be
more proof, e.g., serological with isotype specific ELISA's that this was
the pig infected first. I'm sure the farmer has also forgotten a lot of
other information essential for a quantitative risk analysis.
The other question which arises is whether we should we put a police agent
next to every field to prevent feeding of animals (if you forbid something
you should control it), or should we make sure illegal import of meat and
meat products is not possible. I think the latter should be better.

With regard to Dr Dekker's question I would like to respond as follows:
1. The Classical Swine Fever Virus Laboratory in the UK did not have
samples of a comparable strain to the outbreak strain in their freezer.
2. We believe that their bio-security regime precludes escape of CSFV.
3. By their nature, we are not necessarily aware of all illegal imports,
however we have traced all of the sources of pigs to the index case and
have found no evidence to suggest that infection resulted from the
introduction of infected pigs of any sort.
4. The sandwich story is a press invention based on the farmer's perception
and was not proposed by the epidemiological team investigating the
outbreak. This team is in the process of collecting evidence for a
quantitative study as suggested.
5. The epidemiological investigation team believe it very unlikely that the
pig specified by the farmer was the first case.
6. Great Britain has legislation to reduce the possibility of illegal
imports of meat and meat products and this is under regular review. As
regards access of outdoor pigs to infected material, we will be reviewing
policy in the light of the current outbreak, however individual producers
can also take measures to reduce the risk. For example siting pig paddocks
away from public footpaths, or erecting double fencing between such
paddocks and public rights of way.

Taking the questions in turn:
(1) How could a rambler come to have Chinese ham to give to an outdoor pig?
There are controls on importation of pig products, but illegal imports
occur and it is difficult to ascertain the real origin of some compound
products.
The UK cases must be considered in the wider European context. There have
been a small series of incursions of this genotype of virus into Europe in
the last 10 years, whilst apparently the virus is not endemic in any of the
wild boar population. In 1993, an illegal import of wild boar meat into
Austria was seized and found to contain a classical swine fever virus
(CSFV) of the 2.1 genotype. This virus had an identical partial genetic
sequence to isolates obtained from contemporaneous outbreaks of disease in
domestic pigs in Austria and Switzerland. The massive 1997/8 outbreaks of
CSFV caused by another 2.1 virus is believed to have begun in Paderborn,
Germany. The index case [for the Austrian or German outbreak was
attributed to feeding uncooked meat brought into the country by service-men
returning from Bosnia. In this case, the meat was apparently bought on the
world market, and its origins are unknown.
The fact that viruses of the 2.1 genotype are known to occur in parts of
Asia does not of course rule out that they occur elsewhere, without us
knowing about it. Therefore other countries could also be a source. As well
as ramblers, the possibility should be considered that wild animals and
especially birds, might carry contaminated food from waste disposal sites.
(2) What about the possible role of feral pigs in England?
Captive wild boar have been introduced into a number of farms in Britain,
from European sources. Some have escaped and there is a small feral wild
boar population in parts of the south east and south west of England.
However, feral wild boar are not known to occur in East Anglia. A survey
for the occurrence of feral pigs in areas surrounding the CSF outbreaks is
being conducted, but if they do occur, numbers are certainly very small.
(3) Could it be a lab escape?
CSF virus is only handled in one place in England, and that is at the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge (where I work), south west of
London. There are no obvious links between this and the cases in East
Anglia. The genetic typing suggests that the virus isolated is distinct
from all those held in our virus collection.
(4) Should more detailed studies be done of the index case?
A lot of information has been collected from our presumed index case, and
blood samples were taken from most of the pigs at slaughter. The detective
work to marry up the recorded animal movements around the farm with our
virological and serological findings is ongoing. We hope that we can
establish when the infection arrived and in what part of the farm, and also
how it spread among the outdoor units.
(5) How can we prevent outdoor pigs getting access to potentially infected
food?
This is certainly a difficult question. Improved awareness of the dangers
of feeding outdoor pigs is one obvious step. More research is probably
needed to try and understand just how pig products move around the world.
Spot checks on imported pig products can bring results (c.f. the Austrian
story) but has been likened to looking for the proverbial needle in a
haystack. Testing of seizures of illegally imported products could be
practical.
Much of what I have said is already contained in two recent letters to the
Veterinary Record: Vet Rec (2000) 147, pp 251 and 310. An overview of the
genetic typing of CSF can be found in Veterinary Microbiology (2000) 73,
137-157.
