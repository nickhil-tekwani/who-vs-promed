[1] Case update
- Tue 14 Aug 2018. 3 suspected Ebola cases reported in Uganda (Kasese district), one dies: WHO
[Xinhua News Agency, edited]
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-08/15/c_137390360.htm


The World Health Organization (WHO) on [Tue 14 Aug 2018] said 3 suspected cases of Ebola have been registered in the western Uganda's Kasese district.

WHO in a statement issued here said 2 of the suspected cases are from neighboring eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the viral hemorrhagic fever has already broken out, leaving 41 people dead.

The 3rd was a pregnant woman who died at a hospital.

The global heath body said samples from the suspected cases have been taken to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) for laboratory tests.

"Two of the alert cases from DRC are alive. They were identified at the Mpondwe screening point with temperatures above 37.9 C [100.2 F] and 38.8 [101.8] respectively, the latter also had a headache," said the statement.

WHO said the 3rd alert case involved a pregnant woman who died at Kaganda hospital due to ante-partum haemorrhage.

"Use of theater where the patient was operated on stopped until it is properly disinfected and the body has been retained in Kaganda hospital pending arrangements for safe burial," said the statement.

The Ebola virus is highly contagious and can cause a range of symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, generalized pain, and in many cases internal and external bleeding.

Mortality rates of Ebola fever, according to WHO, are high, with the human case-fatality rate ranging from 50 percent to 89 percent, depending on viral sub-type.

[Amidst this terrible but not unexpected news of Ebola virus spread to neighboring Uganda, it is reassuring news that 2 of the cases were stopped at the border during border checks, when their fevers were detected. This indicates the border checks are working. It is very disappointing that the virus has spread into Uganda where a woman has died following infection. One hopes the doctors and nurses who attended to her were wearing protective gear and appropriate protocol was followed to avoid infection. The 2 neighbors, Uganda and Rwanda, should have been on alert and following strict biosafety practices. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 14 Aug 2018. DRC Ebola cases surpass earlier outbreak total, virus infects 4 more health workers
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy) edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/08/drc-ebola-cases-surpass-earlier-outbreak-total-virus-infects-4-more-health
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Underscoring concerns that health worker Ebola infections could amplify the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the country's health ministry today reported 5 more confirmed cases, including 4 involving health workers at a health center in Mangina. The other is a patient recently treated at that facility.

The batch of new cases puts the outbreak total at 57, which now exceeds the 54 illnesses reported in recent Equateur province outbreak, which was declared over just a week before officials announced the latest outbreak.

In other developments, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, today [14 Aug 2018] filled reporters in on a visit he and his colleagues made to the new outbreak zone and warned that inaccessible "red zones" due to armed conflict might be hiding places for the Ebola virus and make it difficult for responders to enter and for infected residents to seek outside help.

"I was worried before I got there," he said of the area, which he said is home to more than 100 armed groups and has experienced about 120 violent attacks since January [2018]. "After the visit, I am even more worried."

Tedros said the night his delegation stayed in Beni, an incident took place about 9 miles [14.5 km] away, which resulted in the killing of 4 civilians with a number of people kidnapped.

Infection patterns also show more illnesses in women and children.

According to the DRC health ministry's daily update, the 57 Ebola cases includes 30 confirmed and 27 probable cases. Also, health officials are investigating 58 suspected cases, up from 45 reported on [12 Aug 2018]. 2 more deaths were reported, pushing the total number to 41.

Besides the 4 new confirmed cases among health workers from Mangina Reference Health Center, there is one new confirmed case in a man from neighboring Ituri province who had been treated for heart problems at Mangina Reference Health Center. He died after returning to his village in Ituri, which is a short distance from Mangina.

Yesterday [13 Aug 2018], the WHO signaled that it was worried about early exposure in healthcare workers and warned that, given the amplifying effect sick healthcare workers have on spread of the disease, the outbreak could get worse before it gets better.

At today's [14 Aug 2018] briefing, Tedros said 7 health workers are among the confirmed Ebola cases and that as a precaution, all 74 of the facility's workers are considered contacts and are under home monitoring. He noted that replacement workers have already been provided to staff the treatment center.

He said there are several features of the North Kivu outbreak that are different than the recent event in Equateur province, including high population density and population movement, high numbers of displaced people, armed conflict in the area, and a different Ebola genotype. Another, Tedros said, is high numbers of infected women and children. He said the pattern could be due to women's responsibilities as caregivers and the dependence of children on women. However, he said other factors may be in play, such as cultural factors, which require further investigation.

Vaccination strategy could change
---------------------------------
In a vaccination update, Tedros said 216 health workers have received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and that 20 people from the community have also been immunized.

Health officials are hoping to speed up deployment of the vaccine, he said, adding that experienced immunization teams from Guinea arrived in Kinshasa yesterday and are expected to be on the ground in Beni and Mangina today [14 Aug 2018].

So far, responders are sticking with the ring vaccination strategy, which targets contacts of confirmed cases and the contacts of the contacts, he said. However, depending on how events unfold, officials may need to consider other strategies.

Given the high numbers of healthcare workers infected in Mangina, Tedros said health officials have proposed vaccinating the entire community of about 1200 people to more quickly contain the virus.

There are about 3000 doses of vaccine in the DRC, and up to 300 000 doses are available on short notice, he said. "We are OK, we are comfortable," he said of the vaccine supply situation.

1st patients get experimental treatment
---------------------------------------
In another new development, the DRC's health ministry said health teams have started using the experimental monoclonal antibody treatment mAb114 in treatment centers in Beni and Mangina, making it the 1st experimental therapy to be used in an active Ebola outbreak in the DRC. [See ProMED-mail Ebola update (67): Congo DR (NK) cases, response, issues, research 20180814.5964660, for discussion of mAb114]. In the earlier outbreak this year, the ministry's scientific and ethics committees approved the use of 5 experimental therapies, which included mAb114. At the start of the North Kivu outbreak, the country's National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) asked the makers of all 5 therapies to reauthorize their use and amend treatment protocols for the ethics committee to review again.

Supplies of all treatments have arrived in Beni, except for ZMapp, which must be stored at -20 C (-4 F).

The ethics committee has already cleared mAb114 for use, and the other 4 have just been submitted to the group for reconsideration, according to the health ministry.

At today's [14 Aug 2018] briefing, Tedros said 5 patients have already received mAb114. He added that the INRB and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) had launched a study of the treatment in May [2018].

The monoclonal antibody is based on antibodies of a patient who survived Ebola in the DRC city of Kikwit in 1995. A WHO expert committee in May [2018] evaluated 5 experimental Ebola therapies, including mAb114. It said early data on the treatment looked promising, but more were needed before recommending it for compassionate use.

[2] Concerns and challenges
- Tue 14 Aug 2018. Ebola death toll in DR Congo at 41 -- new drug in use [MedicalXpress, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-08-ebola-death-toll-dr-congo.html

Raging conflict is hampering efforts to rein in an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the WHO chief warned [Tue 14 Aug 2018], urging a ceasefire to stop the virus from transmitting freely.

As the death toll in the outbreak declared on 1 Aug 2018 in DRC's violence-wracked North Kivu province hit 41, the World Health Organization chief also called for the rapid roll-out of an unlicenced drug being used for the 1st time to treat Ebola patients.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva he feared conditions on the ground in the eastern province had created "a conducive environment for the transmission of Ebola."

Tedros, who travelled to the epicentres of the outbreak in Beni and Mangina in recent days, said he had been very worried before his trip, but that after the visit "I am actually more worried."

The outbreak in North Kivu's Beni region, which shares borders with Uganda and Rwanda, was declared a week after WHO and the Kinshasa government hailed the end of an Ebola flareup in northwestern Equateur province, which killed 33 people.

The latest outbreak, which now counts 57 probable and confirmed cases of the deadly virus, is the country's 10th since 1976, when the disease was first identified in the DRC near the Ebola River.

'Red zones'
-----------
DRC health authorities said [Tue 14 Aug 2018] that for the 1st time since the outbreak was announced, one fatality was recorded outside of North Kivu -- in the neighbouring province of Ituri.

The new outbreak poses the same problems as past cases in the DRC, including major logistical hurdles in a volatile country with weak health infrastructure.

But in North Kivu, health workers are being forced to navigate their response among more than 100 armed groups, and Tedros said that there have been 120 violent incidents since January [2018] alone.

He said the region was sprinkled with so-called "red zones", or inaccessible areas. "That environment is really conducive for Ebola ... to transmit freely. We call on the warring parties for cessation of hostilities, because the virus is dangerous to all. It doesn't choose between this group or that group," he said.

In a bid to halt the virus's lethal advance, DRC health authorities said [Tue 14 Aug 2018] that doctors in Beni had begun using a prototype drug called mAb114 to treat patients.

The treatment is "the 1st therapeutic drug against the virus to be used in an active Ebola epidemic in the DRC," the health ministry's directorate for disease control said.

Developed in the United States, the prototype drug is a single monoclonal antibody -- a protein that binds on to a specific target of the virus and triggers the body's immune system to destroy the invader.

In May [2018], the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said it was carrying out the 1st human trials of mAb114 to test it for safety and tolerance.

Tedros said 5 patients had received the unlicenced drug so far, and that WHO would like the roll-out "to speed up as much as possible."

Use of the experimental treatment in the field comes on the heels of deployment of an unlicensed vaccine in the earlier Ebola outbreak in the DRC this year [2018].

The decision to use the vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, came after trials during the 2013-2015 pandemic in West Africa showed it to be safe and effective, the WHO says.

The vaccine played a significant role in halting Ebola's spread in Equateur province, and should also be useful in fighting the new outbreak. \

Targeted vaccination, aimed primarily at front-line health workers, began last week [week of 6 Aug 2018], and so far 216 people have received a jab.

But Tedros warned that lack of access could impact the efficiency of the current vaccine campaign, which is based on ring vaccination aimed at immunising every person who has been in contact with the sick, and all of their contacts.

He said WHO and its partners were considering other approaches, including possibly vaccinating all 1200 people living in Mangina, where at least 7 health workers have been infected.

[Because of the volatile situation making it very difficult to assure health care workers' safety, vaccinating the local population in active transmission zones such as Mangina would be a good idea as long as sufficient vaccine doses are available. Ring vaccination as previously practiced may not be possible under the conditions that exist. It is noted below that there have been 120 violent incidents in the region since January 2018, a terrible challenge for anyone wanting to enter the area to protect the population from this virus. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 14 Aug 2018. 41 deaths from Ebola in Congo; health officials 'worried' [CNN, edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/14/health/congo-ebola-outbreak-update/index.html
[Byline: Jacqueline Howard, Debra Goldschmidt, CNN's Radina Gigova contributed to this report.]

An ongoing Ebola outbreak is spreading across the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province, and it has health officials gravely concerned due to conflict in the area along with other factors.

The country's Ministry of Health announced [Mon 13 Aug 2018] that 57 cases of hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region: 30 confirmed and 27 probable.

The outbreak has left 41 people dead, according to the World Health Organization.

WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the city of Beni and the Mangina area in North Kivu. Mangina, which is about 30 kilometers or 19 miles from Beni, sits at the epicenter of the outbreak.

"After the visit, I am actually more worried," Tedros said at a news conference [Tue 14 Aug 2018].

"What makes the outbreak in eastern DRC or northern Kivu more dangerous is, there is a security challenge. There is active conflict in that area. Since January [2018], there were 120 violent incidences," he said.

Thousands in the region have been displaced by fighting between rebel groups and government forces.

"That environment is really conducive for Ebola actually to transmit freely, because in that area, there are places called red zones, inaccessible areas, because there are many armed groups that operate in that region or in that province," he said. In other words, those areas remain difficult to access, and people may have difficulty getting health care and support. Also, he added, many cases are among women and children.

"There are other factors that complicate the issue. One is high population density," Tedros said.

North Kivu is among Congo's most populated provinces, with 8 million inhabitants, according to WHO and the United Nations. Its capital is the city of Goma. The region has been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with over 1 million internally displaced people and a continuous outflow of refugees to neighboring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.

"The other worrisome problem, especially in Mangina, is the number of health workers that are already effected with Ebola, and we have, so far, 7 cases," Tedros said.

This new outbreak is the 2nd of the summer for Congo.

Cases in the new outbreak emerged last month [July 2018], just about a week after the government declared that a previous Ebola outbreak had ended. The previous outbreak was the country's 9th on record since the virus was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The new outbreak is now bigger than the previous outbreak, Tedros said. During the initial outbreak, 54 cases were recorded, including 33 deaths. The 2 outbreaks were not related.

The new outbreak remains a high risk regionally and nationally, but "the risk of international spread is now at low level," Tedros said.
Officials are working to control the new outbreak.

Vaccination efforts have begun in high-risk areas of North Kivu. The provincial health minister and the provincial coordinator of the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization were the first to be vaccinated, according to WHO.

They were followed by 1st-line health workers from the Mangina health center, who had been in contact with confirmed Ebola cases. "We have started with health workers, and we have already vaccinated more than 216. And, according to the data that I have since last evening, we have already vaccinated 20 people from the community, and we will speed up that," Tedros said.

A total of 3220 doses of an investigational Ebola vaccine from the pharmaceutical company Merck, called rVSV-ZEBOV, are available in the country, and some supplementary doses have been requested, according to WHO.

The vaccine is being administered using a ring vaccination strategy, in which groups of people who were in close contact with each Ebola case, as well as the contacts of those contacts, get vaccinated.

Yet Tedros said [Tue 14 Aug 2018] that a proposal to conduct more widespread vaccinations among people in Mangina, whether they are contacts or not, has been under consideration.

"In the typical ways to contain these types of outbreaks, you want to identify the patients very quickly. You want to make sure that people who are feverish and have the disease do not leave an area," Don Sodora, a virologist at the Center for Infectious Disease Research, told CNN when the previous outbreak was declared over in July [2018].

"The hemorrhagic fever viruses have a number of issues that make them particularly problematic with regard to transmission. They have this initial period when people are infected but don't show symptoms, and that's a problem," he said, adding that once people are infected, they are extremely contagious.

"So the best strategy is to identify infected people, get there rapidly with trained health care workers and get quarantine established quickly," he said. "That is the major lesson we have learned."

- Tue 14 Aug 2018. WHO chief: visit to DRC left me 'more worried' about Ebola [The Washington Times, edited]
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/aug/14/who-chief-visit-drc-left-me-more-worried-about-ebo/
[Byline: Tom Howell Jr.]

Director-general Ghebreyesus tells violent groups they're at risk, too.

The World Health Organization's chief traveled to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo to get a 1st-hand look at the latest Ebola outbreak in the African nation.

He didn't like what he found. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said [Tue 14 Aug 2018] he feels "more worried" than before he toured the North Kivu province -- a departure from the upbeat briefings that highlighted progress in fighting a separate outbreak in northwestern DRC, which grabbed headlines before petering out in July [2018].

The new outbreak has been linked to 41 deaths, meaning it "has actually now surpassed" the last one, Dr Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, said in Switzerland.

Area residents are quite migratory, with 1 million displaced persons moving from town to town and crisscrossing the border with Uganda and Rwanda. And, worst of all, there is clear and active fighting in the region that will cut off access to care.

There have been 120 violent incidents in the region this year [2018]. While Dr Ghrebreyesus stayed overnight in Beni, an affected town, violent clashes unfolded less than 10 miles [16 km] away, leaving 4 civilians dead.

"That environment is really conducive for Ebola to transmit freely, because in that area there are places called red zones, inaccessible areas," Dr Ghebreyesus said. "We will have difficultly accessing those areas, and people from those areas will have difficulty moving from the areas they're in to a place where they can get the support they need."

Making matters worse, Dr Ghebreyesus said 7 health care workers in Mangina -- a town up the road from Beni -- have been infected by Ebola, meaning responders had to scramble for replacements.

Despite its concern, WHO still sees the outbreak as a regional issue, so it has not yet considered whether the crisis is a public health emergency of international concern -- a designation that would signal the risk of global spread.

"We're following the changes around the clock, 24-7," Dr Ghebreyesus said.

The WHO says it's ramping up personnel on the ground, giving trial vaccines to health workers and working with community and religious leaders to track down contacts of infected persons.

An existing UN mission in the region, known as MONUSCO, has supplied air support and 10 vehicles, with 30 more vehicles in the pipeline. "We're doing everything we can in order to be more aggressive than the virus," Dr Ghebreyesus said.

Ebola is a serious, often-fatal illness that is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads from human to human through the bodily fluids of people who exhibit symptoms. Infected persons remain highly contagious right after death.

For that reason, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it trained nearly 50 volunteers in Beni and Mangina on how to perform on safe burials.

It is also teaching locals how to maintain better water and sanitation systems, particularly in prisons, and supporting hospitals to reduce the spread of infection.

Dr Ghebreyesus said agents are checking for Ebola cases at the Ugandan border, and he expects more doses of the trial vaccine, supplied by Merck, to arrive in Beni and Mangina on [Tue 14 Aug 2018].

He also pleaded with hostile militias in the mineral-rich territory to cooperate with the response, suggesting it is in their own interest. "The virus is dangerous to all," he said. "It doesn't choose between this group or that group."
