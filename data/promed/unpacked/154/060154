It's been the scourge of Myall Lakes fishermen for the past 5 years, but red spot disease has now reached plague proportions. Recreational fishermen reported almost every fish caught last weekend had to be destroyed because they were infected with the fungal disease. "Every one of the 18 fish I caught had it," said Brad Wright, who has travelled from Newcastle to fish in the Myall Lakes for the past 13 years.

"It's gone from red spot to full-blown ulcers. They are basically dead fish swimming." Most locals and marine experts believe the increase in the illness is directly related to the Myall River's inability to effectively flush. "Five years ago, there were 2 10-meter deep entrances to the river. I've watched the sand swallow them up to the point where it's just full of dirty water," Mr. Wright said.

Great Lakes Council and Port Stephens Member of Parliament Craig Baumann have lent their support to a long-running community campaign calling for funds to dredge the river's natural entrance.

A government-appointed task force is expected to deliver a report on options for improving the river's health in the near future. Myall River Action Group's Gordon Grainger said he was disappointed with the task force's lack of transparency. "We don't know who is on the task force, what its terms of reference are, and we have never been invited to a meeting," he said.

A Department of Primary Industries spokesman said the latest diagnosed case of red spot in the Myall Lakes occurred in January this year [2012]. "Epizootic ulcerative syndrome, or red spot disease, is known to be endemic in a number of NSW estuaries," the spokesman said.

The public are advised not to consume severely ulcerated fish and to dispose of them in landfills away from the waterway. Healthy fish with no ulceration can still be consumed.

[Red spot disease is quite a serious ulcerative disease of many (more than 100) species of freshwater and estuarine fish. In Australia, the disease is more common in the Northern Territory, but it also occurs in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia. The causative agent of red spot disease is a fungus, _Aphanomyces invadans_. The overall impact of red spot disease on wild stocks of fish is uncertain, although high losses in juvenile stocks are known to occur. The fungus is not known to cause disease in humans. However, advanced lesions in fish sometimes contain bacteria which potentially cause disease in humans. Therefore, people should not eat diseased fish.
