Bovine anthrax in the Province of Santa Fe, Argentina
-----------------------------------------------------
On [28 Mar 2016] a laboratory in Santa Fe received through a veterinarian responsible for a dairy operation in Totoras, Iriondo Department, Santa Fe Province, a tube containing non-coagulated blood from which _Bacillus anthracis_ was identified on [4 Apr 2016]. The farm is located in a low area with frequent flooding. The animal was a pregnant female that showed bleeding from her natural openings and therefore the veterinarian diagnosed anthrax. The animals had been vaccinated in October and December of 2015. In Santa Fe Province, vaccination is mandatory due to the No. 1007/14 Resolution. This is in accordance with the recommendation of the Comisi√≥n Provincial de Sanidad Animal [Provincial Commission for Animal Health] (COPROSA) to implement a plan in the fight against anthrax that will include mandatory vaccination together with foot and mouth disease.

[Santa Fe Province is in northern Argentina, on the west side of the Parana river. It is cattle country; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/argentina_pol96.jpg. For Totoras, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AR/21/Totoras.html.

Anthrax is truly sporadic in Santa Fe Province with 1 outbreak in 2008, 1 in 2010, and 4 in 2014.

Most anthrax activity in Argentina is in the pampas, Buenos Aires Province, and so in the outer provinces there can be a lack of awareness of the local incidence and risks accruing. And in conjunction, various scavenging birds take advantage of the situation; see: Miguel D Saggese, et al. First detection of _Bacillus anthracis_ in feces of free ranging raptors from central Argentina. Journal of Wildlife Diseases 2007; 43: 136-141. - Mod.MHJ
