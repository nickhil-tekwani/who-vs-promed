The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Excelsior Foods Inc.
are warning the public not to consume Marcella's Garden brand Olives
described below because these products may be contaminated with
_Clostridium botulinum_. Toxins produced by this bacteria may cause
botulism, a life-threatening illness.
Only the following Marcella's Garden brand Olives sold in 600 ml.
plastic tubs bearing a "best before" date of 31 Jul 2007, are
affected by this alert:
1. Baresana Olives, lot 009/6, UPC 0 62136 90067 8.
2. Calabrese Olives, lot 012/6, UPC 0 62136 90070 8.
3. Cerignola Olives, lot 011/6, UPC 0 62136 90069 2.
4. Jumbo Stuffed Olives, lot 011/9, UPC 0 62136 90071 5.
5. Kalamata Olives, lot 005/6, UPC 0 62136 90066 1.
6. Nocellara Olives, lot 010/6, UPC 0 62136 90068 5.
These olives, imported from Italy, were distributed in British
Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.
There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption
of these olives. Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin
may not look or smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with
the toxin may cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache,
double vision, dry throat, respiratory failure and paralysis. In
severe cases of illness, people may die.
The importer, Excelsior Foods Inc., Toronto, Ontario, is voluntarily
recalling the affected products from the marketplace. The CFIA is
monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[This is the 3rd recall of olives this month (March 2007) regarding
botulism risk. Many food-product recalls that are botulism-related,
as this one is, involve inadequate preparation conditions that would
predispose to the production of the bacterial neurotoxin, not
necessarily the finding of the toxin in the food.
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. - Mod.LL]
