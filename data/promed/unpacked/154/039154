200 high school girls hit with food poisoning
---------------------------------------------
More than 200 high school girls suffered food poisoning after having meals
at a sports facility in Tochigi Prefecture in late Mar 2004, prefectural
government officials said on Fri 2 Apr 2004. The prefectural government
ordered Ashino Onsen Co, the owner of the facility, to close its restaurant
for a week, and is trying to specify the source of the mass food poisoning.
A total of 245 out of 562 people who had meals since the afternoon of 29
Mar 2004 have complained of nausea and diarrhea. They are steadily
recovering from the poisoning, the officials said. Most of those afflicted
are high school girls who took part in a tennis tournament held at the
facility in Nasu from 26 to 30 Mar 2004.

[The etiology of this episode is not clear. If the incubation period of the
illness was relatively short (10 to 18 hours), fever was absent, and
vomiting not a prominent feature, then _Clostridium perfringens_
enterotoxin may be the culprit. Unlike in staphylococcal enterotoxin
disease (shorter incubation period and mostly vomiting), whose toxin is
generally ingested preformed in food, in this disease the toxin is usually
produced in the gut. If fever was an integral part of the illness, however
-- especially with a longer incubation period -- then salmonella and
campylobacter infections should be considered.- Mod.LL]
