[1] Cholera - Iraq: WHO Report
Date: Thu 8 Nov 20007

(OCHA), ReliefWeb, WHO report [edited]

New laboratory-confirmed cholera cases reported during 5-8 Nov 2007:
- Kirkuk: 8 (of 108 samples tested) 7 percent
- Sulaymaniyah: not reported
- Erbil: 2 (of 168 samples tested) one percent
- Baghdad: 8 (number of samples tested not reported)
Total new cases: 18

Overview
--------
The most important development during weeks 44-45 is the steep
increase in the number of cholera cases reported from Baghdad. The
number of laboratory confirmed cases jumped from 11 to 32 cholera
cases representing an increase of 290 percent in the cumulative
cases. 44 percent of new confirmed cholera cases this week were
reported from Baghdad Resafa; mainly from the highest risk areas in
the 3 most disadvantaged districts in Baghdad (Sadder City, Me'dain
and Resafa districts). Data provided from Baghdad is neither complete
nor timely; therefore what is reported may be an underestimation of
the real situation.

As of 8 Nov 2007 (week 44), 44 districts, 28 in northern Iraq and 16
in the center and south have reported laboratory-confirmed cases of
cholera. In northern Iraq, 13 out of the 14 districts of Sulaymaniyah
governorate, all 5 districts of Kirkuk governorate, 6 of 7 districts
of Erbil governorate, and 4 districts in Dahuk. As for the center and
south, the affected districts are: 3 districts each in Baghdad,
Tikrit, Mosul, and Diyala; 2 districts in Basra as well as one
district in each of Wasit and Anbar.

99 percent of Iraq's cholera cases were reported from Kirkuk,
Sulaymaniyah, and Erbil, northern Iraq. Sporadic cases with definite
history of travel and food consumption in Kirkuk were reported from
Tikrit province; however, isolated cases with no epidemiological link
to northern Iraq were also confirmed in Mosul, Wasit, Baghdad, Anbar,
and Basra.

One of the important features in this outbreak is that most of the
cases seen have mild to moderate signs and symptoms. The traditional
signs and symptoms of severe dehydrating diarrhea were seen only very
occasionally, out of the 4531 laboratory-confirmed cholera cases; 22
deaths were reported, most of the deceased had other, serious
underlying morbidity.

A Belgian female tourist and a Japanese person have contracted
cholera in Viet Nam, which has hit 202 people in the country, local
newspaper Pioneer reported Mon 12 Nov 2007. Specimens from the
36-year-old tourist, who developed vomiting and had diarrhea after
traveling from southern Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi capital, initially
tested positive for cholera. She is now being treated at the
Hanoi-based Tropical Disease Hospital.

Some foreign tourists in the same group with her have shown similar
but less serious symptoms. They, after flying from Ho Chi Minh City
to Hanoi, have traveled to northern Quang Ninh province.

The Japanese person, who earlier ate tofu and raw shrimp paste and
drank beer in a street-side restaurant in Viet Nam, was reported to
have contracted cholera. The person is now recovering.

Now, specimens from the 2 foreigners are being thoroughly tested for
cholera at the country's National Epidemiology and Hygiene Institute.

Acute diarrhea has infected over 1600 people in 13 cities and
provinces in Viet Nam, of whom 202 have contracted cholera since 23
Oct 2007, said Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the Preventive Medicine
Department under the Vietnamese Health Ministry.

Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung ordered concerted efforts to contain
acute diarrhea in a dispatch released to agencies and local
government authorities across the country on Sat 10 Nov 2007. He
asked the Ministry of Health to lead a multi-sector taskforce in
taking firm and immediate measures to improve food hygiene in order
to check the spread of the epidemic.

The Ministry of Health was told to set up inspection delegations led
by Cabinet members, focusing on flood-stricken areas in the central
and southern regions. Dung also called on the Ministries of Police,
Industry and Trade, Agriculture and Rural Development, Transport,
Finance, and Information and Communication, to join the battle.

Almost 1380 cases of acute diarrhea have been reported, 15 percent of
which tested positive to cholera.

Cases of acute diarrhea occurred in some areas of Phu Yen Province
after it was hit by floods recently. A total of 60 out of 78 communes
and wards in the province have been sprayed with chemicals to help
eradicate further disease outbreaks, according to the provincial
People's Committee. The director of Phu Yen Department of Health,
Nguyen Van Ty, said 4 people developed acute diarrhea in Xuan Duc
hamlet in the city of Tuy Hoa's An Phu Commune. Ty said all patients
with acute diarrhea tested negative for the cholera bacterium.

reported a further 42 patients suffering from cholera, taking the
total number of cholera sufferers to 201. After 3 weeks fighting
against the outbreak, the Ministry of Health is now considering
further measures and may distribute vaccine to people living in
high-risk and flood-stricken areas.

At the same time, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung assigned the
Ministry of Health the task of following up and forecasting the
development of the outbreak, so that appropriate warnings to relevant
agencies and the public can be arranged. Establishment of a number of
teams directed by members of the cabinet is reported to be under
careful consideration. Their mission is to go to high-risk areas in
the North and the flood hit areas in the Central and South to
supervise and accelerate the prevention a containment of the outbreak
there.

In related news, the Ho Chi Minh Department of Health announced that
no cholera cases have been detected so far in the city. However, it
had a scare when a woman in Hoc Mon District was initially suspected
to [have contracted] the disease.

[5] Cholera, refugee camps - Congo DR: (North Kivu)
Date: Mon 12 Nov 2007
Source: Reuters Foundation AlertNet, Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) report [edited]
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/UNHCR/2e26b2c1a84c7bcc52b73754f25a106f.htm>


The UN refugee agency and its partners have stepped up joint efforts
to curb the spread of cholera in camps hosting some 45 000 internally
displaced Congolese in the troubled province of North Kivu. The
potentially fatal diarrheal disease broke out in early October 2007
in 5 camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) located in the
Mugunga area of North Kivu, which is located in the east of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Latest reports from the camps indicate that the cholera situation
appears to be stabilizing, with the number of new suspected cases
dropping slowly but steadily. Health workers said that at the end of
October 2007 there were 439 suspected cases of cholera, 189 of them
reported from 24-28 Oct 2007.

In the last 4 days of October, 103 new cases were recorded, or about
25 per day, while in the 1st 8 days of November 2007 medical
personnel registered 135 new cases, an average of 16 a day.

"Last week we stepped up our aid efforts in the IDP camps close to
Goma [the main town of the area, located not far east of Mugunga], in
partnership with UN sister agencies and NGOs (non-governmental
organizations)," UNHCR Representative Eusebe Hounsokou said. "The
upsurge of cholera is only one of the many symptoms of the worsening
humanitarian tragedy in North Kivu," he added.

At Delmas, in Mpumalanga, 60 more people are being treated for severe
diarrhea. More than 640 people have contracted the disease since its
outbreak late in October 2007.

Test results have given the drinking water in the town a clean bill
of health and authorities suspect that borehole water may be infected.

Health Department spokesperson Mpho Gabashane says additional
resources have been made available to deal with the outbreak.
