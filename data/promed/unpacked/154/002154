[2010], are the source of the human infections. In the northern areas
of the Zhytomyr province the density of foxes is 8-fold greater than

[Rabies is endemic and widespread in wildlife throughout Ukraine,
transmitted predominantly by foxes and wolves. A recently implemented
oral wildlife vaccination programme has yet to take effect.
