Rabies in Namibia
-----------------
A massive outbreak of rabies, affecting kudu antelopes, started early
last year [2008] in Namibia. During a helicopter count in the Khomas
highlands during the winter months of 2008 some 500 dead kudu bulls
were counted. Similar outbreaks were observed in the past, with the
largest one during the years 1977-1985 , when an estimated loss of
30-50 000 antelope (20 per cent of the population) was reported,
apparently involving oral spread of rabies infection between
individuals.

It is estimated that over 20 000 antelopes have died during the
current epizootic.

[Dr Schneider's authoritative clinical/epidemiological observation is
gratefully acknowledged. Laboratory confirmation and information on
possible control measures will be anticipated with interest. A
picture of a kudu is available at
<http://costumenetwork.com/albums/album77/KuduBull.jpg>.

The major, unique epizootic of 1977-1985, which decimated about 20
percent of the kudu antelope (_Tragelaphus strepsiceros_) population
of Namibia, as well as the later, smaller outbreaks of 2002 and 2006,
provided an example of horizontal spread between individuals by means
of non-bite transmission. The social behavior of kudu was believed to
be the contributing factor, through the exposure of mouth lesions
from the browsing of thorn bushes to the infected saliva.
