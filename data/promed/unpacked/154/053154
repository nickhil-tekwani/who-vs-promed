Europe's flu earlier, more virulent
-------------------------------------
Europe's flu season began 2 weeks earlier this year [2007] compared
to last, and a more virulent strain of virus is causing most cases,
health experts said on Fri 26 Jan 2007. The European Influenza
Surveillance Scheme (EISS), which collects data and monitors
influenza throughout the region, received information about the 1st
cases just before Christmas in Scotland and Northern Ireland, earlier
than normal. Spain, Greece, Denmark and the Czech Republic have also
reported an increasing number of cases.
"The dominant virus that we are seeing in the European influenza
system is the A H3 virus, which we know from experience is a more
virulent virus than last year's [2006] B virus," said Professor Koos
van der Velden, chairman of the EISS. "Usually people with the A
virus are more infectious, sicker for a long period and complications
are more likely," he added. But Van der Velden said the differences
reported this year do not increase the risk of an influenza pandemic.
Scientists fear the H5N1 bird flu virus that has killed more than 160
[163] people since 2003 could mingle with a seasonal virus to become
highly infectious in humans and capable of killing millions. "We have
no evidence that there is any mixing [reassortment] of seasonal virus
and bird flu virus," he added.
Each year an estimated 100 000 people in Europe die from seasonal
influenza. The global total, according to the World Health
Organization, can be as high as 500 000. The virus is spread by
coughs and sneezes from an infected person.
The normal flu season in Europe runs from December to March. It lasts
between 5-8 weeks in most countries. Van der Velden said it is too
early to predict how many people will be infected with seasonal flu
or how many deaths it may cause. But he added that the virus
circulating in Europe is well matched to the vaccine given to people
to prevent infection.
It is not known whether the unseasonably warm weather in December and
January had an impact on the flu season.
EISS, which is based in Utrecht in the Netherlands and which was
established in 1996, has 30 member countries. Doctors in each nation
report all clinical cases of flu and send samples to EISS. It
collects the information and passes it on to the European
authorities, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for
Diseases Control and Prevention in the United States (CDC).

Flu gets early but mild start in US and Europe
-----------------------------------------------
Europe's flu season got off to an early start, according to surveys
released on Fri 26 Jan 2007, but the vaccine matches the circulating
virus well. The U.S. flu season, which typically starts several weeks
earlier, has been mild so far and has not risen to epidemic levels,
which suggests an average season for Europe as well. Eight U.S.
children infected with influenza have died since it began in October [2006].
The influenza virus evolves and mutates every year, but so far the 3
main strains that are circulating are those that have been expected
and were used in this year's vaccines, according to the European
Influenza Surveillance Scheme and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. "The dominant virus that we are seeing in the
European influenza system is the A H3 virus, which we know from
experience is a more virulent virus than last year's [2006] B virus,"
said Koos van der Velden, chairman of the surveillance program.
"Usually people with the A virus are more infectious, sicker for a
long period and complications are more likely," he added.
The current vaccine protects against the H3 virus [actually [H3N2],
as well as another influenza A virus called H1 [actually H1N2 virus],
and the influenza B virus. Similar activity has been seen in the United States.
Experts have been keeping a closer than usual eye on flu everywhere
since 2003 because of the appearance of the H5N1 avian flu virus,
which has infected 269 people and killed 163 of them. Scientists
agree it could mutate, or mix [reassort genome subunits] and kill
millions. "We have no evidence that there has been any mixing of
seasonal virus and bird flu virus," Van der Velden said.
Each year, an estimated 100 000 people in Europe die from seasonal
influenza, and 36 000 die in the United States. The global total,
according to the World Health Organization, can be as high as 500
000. These include mostly older people but also a number of young,
previously healthy children. The virus is spread by coughs and
sneezes from an infected person as well as by touching surfaces where
virus-laden droplets have fallen.
The normal flu season in Europe runs from December to March. In North
America it, stretches from October through March. In the United
States, widespread flu activity was reported by 3 states: Indiana,
Iowa, and South Carolina. Most states report local and sporadic cases
of flu, with 5.6 percent of all flu-like illness being confirmed as
influenza on testing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said 7.5 percent of all deaths reported last week were due to
pneumonia or influenza, just below the 7.7 percent threshold for an epidemic.

[The Weekly Electronic Bulletin of the EISS (European Influenza
Surveillance Scheme) presents and comments on influenza activity in
29 European countries that are members of EISS. In week 03/2007, 26
countries reported clinical data and 29 countries reported
virological data. The spread of influenza virus strains and their
epidemiological impact in Europe are being monitored by EISS in
collaboration with the WHO Collaborating Centre in London (United
Kingdom) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
in Stockholm (Sweden).
As of Sat 27 Jan 2007, [seasonal human] influenza virus detections
continue to increase in Europe. The total number of positive
specimens has steadily increased from less than 100 in week 50/2006
to 626 positive specimens in week 03/2007. Countries with increased
levels of influenza activity are Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Northern Ireland, Scotland, Spain and Switzerland. In Scotland
consultation rates for influenza-like illness peaked in week 02/2007
and now appear to be on the decline.
For the intensity indicator, the national network level of
influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI)
was medium in Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland,
Scotland, Spain and Switzerland*, whilst it remained low in 18 other countries.
For the geographical spread indicator, regional activity was reported
in 4 countries (the Czech Republic, Norway, Scotland and Spain),
local activity in 7 countries, sporadic activity in 12 countries and
no activity in 3 countries (Hungary, Lithuania and Poland).
Cumulative epidemiological situation - 2006-2007 season (since week
40/2006): So far this season, the consultation rates for ILI and/or
ARI have been at increased levels in Northern Ireland (since week
49/2006), and above the national baseline threshold in Greece (since
week 01/2007), Scotland (since week 01/2007), Luxembourg (since week
02/2007), Spain (since week 02/2007), Switzerland (since week
03/2007) and the Netherlands. In the other countries influenza
activity has remained at baseline levels.
Virological situation - week 03/2007: The total number of respiratory
specimens collected by sentinel physicians was 1290, of which 320
(24.8 percent) were positive for influenza virus. Of these, 315 (98
percent) specimens tested positive for influenza A virus and 5 (2
percent) were influenza B. In addition, 306 specimens from
non-sentinel sources (e.g. specimens collected for diagnostic
purposes in hospitals) tested positive for influenza virus, of which
300 (98 percent) were influenza A and 6 (2 percent) influenza B.
Cumulative virological situation - 2006-2007 season (since week
40/2006): Based on (sub)typing data of all influenza virus detections
(N=1881; sentinel and non-sentinel data), 1191 (63 percent) were type
A not subtyped, 59 (3 percent) were type A subtype H1 [of which 28
were subtype H1N1], 583 (31 percent) were type A subtype H3 [of which
310 were subtype H3N2] and 48 (3 percent) were type B.
Based on the characterisation data of all influenza virus detections,
325 have been antigenically and/or genetically characterized: 250
were A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2)-like, 52 were A/California/7/2004
(H3N2)-like [a strain of the A(H3N2) virus that emerged during the
2004-2005 season, circulated during the 2005-2006 season, and is
closely related to the A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2) reference virus],
21 were A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like, one was
B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like (the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage) and one was
B/Jiangsu/10/2003-like (the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage (click here).
Comment: Influenza virus detections are currently increasing in
Europe. Whilst influenza activity appears to have peaked in Scotland,
in most other European countries the epidemiological and/or
virological indicators indicate it is increasing. Based on historical
data, the consultation rates in Scotland were the highest observed in
the last 7 seasons but were not exceptionally high (for example,
compared to the 1999-2000 season). It is expected that influenza
activity will continue to increase in Europe in the coming weeks.
Estimates of disease severity are not available at this stage. - Mod.CP]
