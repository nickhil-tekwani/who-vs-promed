Botulism is believed the cause of bird dieoff at Chautauqua National
Wildlife Refuge
Avian botulism is again believed to be the cause of a bird die-off at the
Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge near Havana, Illinois, where refuge
staff have collected about 1000 dead birds, mostly waterfowl. Last year
approximately 8000 birds died from the disease. However, refuge staff have
been monitoring the health of early migrants and are making every effort to
minimize the impact of this avian disease during September and October. Dead
birds were initially discovered by refuge personnel on 9 Sep 1998.
Refuge personnel began collecting birds and samples have been sent to the
national Wildlife Health Center, of the U.S. Geological Survey, in Madison,
Wisconsin. Results are pending.

Low water levels, high temperatures, and maggot-infested carcasses are all
key factors in the outbreak of botulism. Refuge personnel have been
patrolling the lake, picking up and disposing of dead birds. Carcasses are
then buried to prevent spread of the disease. Refuge personnel will continue
daily patrols to minimize and prevent additional loss of birds. The refuge
is allowing water to flow into the lake from Quiver Creek to dilute the
toxin and cover exposed mudflats. The weather is also helping with cooler
day and night temperatures. The primary species affected by the
disease have been green-winged and blue-winged teal with smaller
numbers of northern shoveler [ducks.

Refuge Manager Ross Adams said, "Once the Habitat Restoration and
Enhancement Project is completed on the lake, we will have control of the
water we need to provide optimum habitat for the birds to avoid problems
such as botulism." This project should be completed by early next summer.
The bacterium (_Clostridium botulinum_) responsible for this outbreak
produces a toxin that when ingested causes avian botulism, type C.
The bacterium is commonly found in soils and mud along lakes and
rivers. When water levels drop, temperatures rise, and oxygen is no
longer present, the bacteria reproduce, generating a toxin. Waterfowl
and shorebirds are affected when they ingest toxin while feeding in
these areas. The disease can spread quickly when healthy birds feed
on maggots on infected carcasses, prompting the extensive efforts to
remove dead birds.

Avian botulism can effect any bird species, although it is most often seen
in waterfowl and shorebirds. The disease is not always fatal, but smaller
species such as teal are generally at greater risk. Birds die when they lose
control of muscles enabling them to fly, breathe, and they can drown when
they can no longer hold up their heads. Type C or avian botulism is rarely
a threat to humans, who are more often affected by type A, B or E, sometimes
found in improperly canned food.
