Insects bred in castor oil plants kill people in northern Burma
---------------------------------------------------------------
In an alarming situation, insects breeding in bio-fuel plants called
Castor oil plants also called Jet Suu in Burmese have killed at least
a dozen people in northern Burma, said local sources. Recently a
widow and her daughter died after being bitten by unidentified
insects in Castor oil plants or Physic nut trees (_Jatropha curcas_)
on [13 Sep 2008] in Myitkyina Township, the capital of Kachin State,
residents in Myitkyina told KNG today.

According to locals, they were bitten by the green-coloured and
earthworm-like insects and died of the poison in the insects within 3
minutes while they were selling snacks under the Castor oil trees in
front of No. 5 State High School in Thidar quarter in Myitkyina.
About 10 people including children in Shatapru and Jan Mai Kawng
quarters, and a bicycle trishaw driver also reportedly died early
this month after they were bitten by the same insects from Castor oil
trees in the township, loal sources added.

Meanwhile, alarmed school teachers in Myitkyina have cautioned
students to stay away from Castor oil trees in the school compound
and other places, a resident said. Unusually, the military
authorities in Myitkyina cleaned the Castor oil trees around
Myitkyina Public General Hospital, Du Mare, Thidar and Tatkone
quarters by cutting the stems early this month [September 2008], said
local eyewitnesses.

On the other hand, the new Northern Military Command commander of the
military junta, Maj-Gen Soe Win has issued a warning that strong
action would be taken on residents who report about the deadly insect
in Castor oil trees, according to residents.

In June [2008], several children and adults were hospitalized and the
patients felt nausea and were dazed after they ate the poisonous
fruits of Castor oil trees.

Because of the junta's state-project for future bio-fuel production,
it is mandatory to grow Castor oil plants in vacant place near
government buildings, schools, offices, roadsides as well as open
spaces outside the townships, quarters and villages in Myitkyina, added locals.

However, there are no warning signboards and posters in Castor oil
plantations. Residents of Myitkyina are alarmed and extremely scared
of the insects because they are surrounded with Castor oil trees,
said residents.

[The castor oil plant (_Ricinus communis_) has been studied for many
years for its medicinal, insecticidal and pest reduction abilities.
The presumed toxin is ricin, which is found predominantly in the
seeds of the plant. Low doses of ricin may lead to an acute
anaphylaxis-like reaction, collapse and death. Other symptoms
associated with its ingestion include burning of the mouth, vomiting,
diarrhea, cramps, muscular twitching, convulsions, and possibly renal
failure. A burning sensation of the mouth and throat occurs after
chewing the seeds. After a latent period of 3 to 6 hours, nausea,
vomiting, severe stomach pains, diarrhea, and excessive thirst
develop leading to acute dehydration, hypotension and circulatory
failure. Prostration, blurring of vision, loss of consciousness,
convulsions, haemolysis, uraemia and liver necrosis have also
occurred associated with ricin ingestion. (For more details on the
clinical picture, see:
<http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/plant/ricinus.htm#PartTitle:2.%20SUMMARY>.)

A review of the literature and other documents available on the
Internet suggested that while the castor oil plant extracts have been
used as an insecticide due to its toxicity to many of insects, one
reference mentioned that "The castor plant is not toxic to most
insects, even though small amounts of the toxic protein, ricin, and
the alkaloid tricinine, occur in vegetative parts of the plant
(Weiss, E.A. 1971. Castor, sesame, and safflower. Leonard Hill,
London.1971). Thrips, corn earworms, armyworms, spider mites, leaf
miners, lygus bugs, and green stink bugs have been observed in castor
fields with minimal damage."
<http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1993/v2-380.html>.

The Physic nut trees (Jatropha curcas) have a black, thin shelled
seed that is considered toxic. It is known to contain toxalbumin
curcin. Clinical symtoms associated with their ingestion include
those associated with gastro-intestinal irritation: acute abdominal
pain and a burning sensation in the throat beginning approximately
half an hour after ingestion of the seeds, followed by nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. The vomitus and faeces may contain blood. In
severe intoxications dehydration and haemorrhagic gastroenteritis can
occur. There may be CNS and cardiovascular depression and collapse.
(For more details on the clinical picture, see:
<http://www.inchem.org/documents/pims/plant/jcurc.htm#SectionTitle:2.2%20%20%20%20%20%20Summary%20of%20clinical%20effects>.)

The above newswire does not provide information on the type of insect
that is felt to be responsible for the above reported fatal
reactions. There is mention of an earlier episode (June 2008) in the
same area where persons (adults and children) were sickened after
ingesting the "fruit" (seeds) of the castor oil plants. The reported
instantaneous fatalities are curious, and one wonders if there isn't
some missing information to the history of what transpired... Perhaps
an anaphylactic reaction occurring where the individual(s) did not
have access to immediate medical care.

More information on this situation from knowledgeable sources would
be appreciated -- including identification of the insect allegedly
associated with the fatal reactions, and numbers of cases involved.

[It may be of interest to note that Jatropa curcas is a primary
resource for bio-diesel.

Also the alkaloids in jatropa may be accumulating in the "worms."
Certain butterflies consume some toxins and are not affected but
those consuming the butterflies often die from the toxins in the
butterflies. I am wondering if this same accumulation may be
occurring in the "worms" mentioned in the article. Or if these are
insect larvae, not really worms. Additionally, it makes no sense that
these "worms" or "larvae" or any type of insect would be attacking
people. It seems much more likely that these people are encountering
this "bug" (of whatever form) and finding it toxic by ingestion or by
mashing its contents on the skin. - Mod.TG]
