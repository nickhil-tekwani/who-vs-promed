Grape growers warned to monitor crops in wake of virus
--------------------------------------------------------------
The South West Table Grape Association says the onus is on growers to
monitor their vines for signs of disease, particularly since confirmation
of a virus in Western Australia for the first time.
The grapevine "B" virus has been found on table grape varieties in the
Swan Valley, but appears at this stage not to be causing any problems.
Agriculture WA says preliminary studies suggest the virus is different
from a virulent strain capable of causing disease.
But Table Grape Association president Roger Fahl,says it is important for
growers to thoroughly monitor their vineyards.
"Through Hort-guard, the new program being established in Western
Australia, we are trying to encourage all growers to continue to check and
anything out of the ordinary be reported and be monitoring and using
hygienic practices at all times," he said.

[Based on PCR assays of over 500 grapevine samples from
various locations in Australia, grapevine B virus (GBV) appears to
be widely distributed in the country, so the outbreak at Bunbury is
not surprising. None of the vines that tested positive for GBV in
Australia exhibited symptoms of corky bark disease which is
consistently associated with the presence of GBV in
other countries, and no corky bark disease has ever been
observed in Australia. GBV has not been shown to induce corky
bark disease. According to the National Office of Animal and Plant
Health in Australia, the Australian strain is likely different from the
Italian strain. It is likely that a symptomless GBV strain is common
in Australia. The voluntary moratorium on movement of the cultivar
'Jade Seedless' adopted in June 1999 has been lifted because it is
no longer justified. - Mod.DH]
