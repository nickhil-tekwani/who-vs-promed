The results of human testing to date are as follows: In total, blood and/or
spinal fluid samples from 34 residents have been or are in the process of
being tested for the presence of West Nile virus (WNV). To date, 2 tests
were positive, 12 were negative and 20 are pending. These individuals either
had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV testing criteria or
exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties where dead crows and/or
mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered. New Jersey's positive human
cases include a 43-year old Jersey City man whose test was verified by the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on 1 Sep 2000. 1.
In addition, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and
Cliffside Park, Bergen County, has tested positive for WNV. The 54-year old
man became ill 31 Aug 2000, 31, was admitted to a New York City hospital on
4 Sep 2000, and remains hospitalized in stable, but improving, condition.
His WNV test was conducted by the New York City Health Department and
verified by the CDC on 12 Sep. 2000.
The numbers of positive Crow, Hawk, Falcon and House sparrow tests are
unchanged from the previous post.
Twelve mosquito pools collected in Bergen (5), Essex (1), Middlesex (2),
Monmouth (3) and Passaic (1) Counties have tested positive for the presence
of WNV. More than 1670 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been
collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by
the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all 21
counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture have all
tested negative for the presence of WNV to date.
No new positive horse tests are reported.

New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) has been confirmed by the New York State
Department of Health in 7 birds and 19 mosquito pools in New York City.
Spraying is scheduled for tonight in Pelham Bay Park and Van Cortlandt Park,
Bronx, after the parks are closed to the public. Spraying is also scheduled
for all of Staten Island on Sunday night and Monday morning, and Upper
Manhattan on Tuesday morning, weather permitting. Temperatures of 60F or
lower may necessitate postponement or suspension of spraying activities.
Spraying activities will be ground-based, with the exception of areas on
Staten Island that are inaccessible by ground and will be sprayed aerially,
as has been done previously.
The positive WNV findings announced today include: On Staten Island, one
bird (a crow collected from West Brighton on September 6), and 14 mosquito
pools (5 from Tottenville, on 13 Aug 2000 (2 pools), 24 Aug 2000 (2 pools),
and 26 Aug 2000; 3 from Richmond Valley on 2 Sep 2000; 2 from Grasmere on 2
Sep 2000; one from the Fort Wadsworth area 29 Aug; one from Clay Pit Ponds
Park on 1 Sep; one from Westerleigh on 1 Sep, and one from Rossville on 2
Sep). In Manhattan, 3 birds (crows collected from the Upper West Side on
September 6, from Greenwich Village on September 1, and from Harlem on 30
Aug); and 3 mosquito pools (2 from Central Park on 31 Aug; and one from
Upper Manhattan on 31 Aug. In Brooklyn, 2 birds (a crow collected from
Marine Park on 4 Sep, and a crow collected from Canarsie on 31 Aug). In
Queens, one bird, a bluejay collected from Forest Park on 29 Aug. In the
Bronx, 2 mosquito pools (from Van Cortlandt Park on 31 Aug, and from Pelham
Bay Park on 31 Aug).
"Included in the test results announced today was evidence of West Nile
virus documented in another species of mosquito in which WNV has not been
identified previously: _Psorophora ferox_. A pool of these mosquitoes was
collected from mosquitoes trapped in the Richmond Valley area of Staten
Island. While the _Culex pipiens_ species of mosquito continues to be the
primary carrier of WNV, the number of species (6) now known to be carrying
the virus is evidence of considerable viral activity on Staten Island. The
Health Department continues to urge all New Yorkers to take precautions to
reduce exposure to mosquitoes," Dr. Cohen added.

Possible explanation [for the resurgence of West Nile virus infection in
Israel and the reduced number of fatalities in New York City this year
------------------------------------------------------
The most recent report on the outbreak of West Nile virus infection in
Israel contained the following comment: "The reason for this year's outbreak
is still a mystery. One theory is that the bird migratory period began
earlier than usual. Israel does not have more mosquitoes than normal, said
Yossi Inbar, deputy director general of the Environment Ministry. Mosquitoes
multiply in standing water, and this has been a dry year even by Israeli
standards".
[May I draw your attention to a Columbia University researcher's theory
that dry seasons mean lower bird populations around the mosquito breeding
grounds, and then the mosquitos feed on humans as a secondary source. It
seems to explain the lower incidence this year in New York City and the
higher incidence last year and this may be an explanation for the higher
incidence in Israel now.
