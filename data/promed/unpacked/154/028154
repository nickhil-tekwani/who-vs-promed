Sin Nombre virus and HCPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The posting about the year 2000 HCPS [see below for explanation cases in
California and New Mexico [Hantavirus pulm. synd. - USA (California & New
Mexico) made a couple of references to the fact that the virus was not
"confirmed" to be Sin Nombre virus and not another hantavirus strain.
Our laboratory conducted serologic testing of all of the 10 New Mexico cases
and a good fraction of the California cases. In addition to the 9 reported
cases in New Mexico that met the case definition we tested one other case
that did not meet the case definition (not known to have pulmonary
infiltrates; treated as outpatient). The other New Mexico case was one that
needs to have medical records examined to verify the pulmonary involvement
(pending). Thus, overall pulmonary cases: 9; pending: 1; non-pulmonary: 1.
Of the New Mexico cases we examined all but one had clear IgG and/or IgM
reactivity to the Sin Nombre (SN) virus G1 antigen, which is specific for SN
virus infection and is not seen in human infections with related viruses,
using the SIA or western blot technique (J Clin Microbiol 1997; 35: 600-8
and refs therein). Thus these cases are established to be SN virus cases.
The one exception may be a non-SN virus case but more likely is simply a
false-negative on the G1 test, which occurs in roughly 5% of SN virus
infections. Most of the California cases we have tested also have G1
reactivity. but I haven't tallied them yet though.
We and others are using the term "HCPS" (hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome) rather than "HPS" because some clinicians did not understand that
most deaths were caused by cardiac insufficiency rather than pulmonary
failure per se (ventilatory support is almost sufficient to correct the
latter problem, at least in isolation, but extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation, ECMO, is needed when there is severe cardiac compromise- with
or without pulmonary failure). Early cardiac involvement is detected by
tachycardia out of proportion of the decline of the mean arterial blood
pressure. At UNM we are still working hard to educate clinicians who see few
cases on this point, so that they will give prompt attention to the cardiac
deficiencies and triage/treat accordingly.
For examples of publications that use the term "HCPS" see: Clin Infect Dis
1999; 29: 664-6; Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29: 1577-9; Pediatr Infect Dis J
2000; 19: 248-50; J Infect Dis 2000; 181:1569-73; J Infect Dis 2000; 182:
43-8; and Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2000; 97: 10578-83.

[As moderator of this and the preceding post I very much appreciate Dr.
Hjelle's comprehensive and instructive response to my query about the
identity of the causative agent. The additional comment on renaming of the
syndrome is useful information for anyone interested in this field of
virology and clinical management of disease. - Mod.CP
