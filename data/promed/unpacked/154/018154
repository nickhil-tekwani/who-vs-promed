The authorities of the Mexican state of Veracruz today [14 Dec 2010]
confirmed an outbreak of 30 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, with 2
deaths.

The state secretary of Health, Pablo Anaya Rivera, said that patients
are being studied by specialists from the World Health Organization
(WHO) and laboratory analysis is being performed by the CDC, Atlanta,
GA USA.

He said the dead had other illnesses that made them more susceptible
to disease, while the rest, some of whom have recovered in their
homes, are being treated in hospitals of the Instituto Mexicano del
Seguro Social de Orizaba Veracruz and Rio Blanco. "There are no data
to determine the cause of the syndrome," the official said, adding
that those affected are children from 4 months old to adults over 70
years.

Guillain Barre syndrome presents itself as a flaccid paralysis that
begins in the extremities and affects the spinal cord, causing loss of
the myelin sheaths of nerves in the spinal cord. Experts do not know
what the exact cause of the disease is, but it is believed to be
caused by the immune system's reaction to infections, say Spanish
researchers.

In half the cases, the 1st symptoms appear as a respiratory or
gastrointestinal viral infection, but there are also reported cases
with infections and surgeries as propagators, says the group Guillain
Barre Syndrome Support, based in Spain.

The institution "Iberian" states that another risk for developing the
disease is receiving an immunization, and it draws attention to rare
cases occurring after vaccination against rabies and swine flu.

[ProMED has reported a few clusters of Guillain Barre Syndome (GBS)
before (see below). GBS is thought to be an aberrant immune reaction
elicited by an infection or, in rare cases, immunizations. Previous
studies have linked GBS to infections with campylobacter, but a
cluster of 30 cases closely related in time and geographical area
would mean that many cases should be diagnosed with the infection, but
without GBS, and only upper respiratory tract symptoms are reported
here.

The risk of GBS after influenza vaccination is estimated to be 0.8 per
million doses administered after the pandemic H1N1 vaccine (see below)
and cannot explain this cluster of cases. ProMED will be happy to post
further information. - Mod.EP]
