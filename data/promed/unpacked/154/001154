Vietnam has reported its first cases of bird flu this year [2007].
According to local health officials, 4 members of the same family were
admitted to a hospital in southern Viet Nam suffering with symptoms
consistent with avian flu. It was reported that the family had 4 chickens
and 5 ducks on their farm. The family soon became ill after eating one of
the chickens, reported the Associated Press.

The affected family members were a 36-year-old mother and her 3 children
between 3 and 13 years old. It is estimated that 42 people have died of the
H5N1 bird flu virus in Viet Nam since 2003 [but none during 2006 - Mod.CP].
However after extensive work, the country has dramatically reduced the
number of new cases.

[The WHO list of confirmed human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) in Viet
Nam remains unchanged at 93 with 42 deaths
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_20

06_12_27/en/index.html>). No human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
infection have been confirmed in the past year, despite the reappearance
of bird flu in poultry in 3 southern provinces of Viet Nam (see ProMED-mail
references below). Four suspected human cases have not been confirmed and a
verdict on another 2 is pending.

It is possible that the mother and family of 3 described in this report are
the same as those recorded as unconfirmed in "Avian influenza, human (194)
- Viet Nam: NOT 20061231.3663". - Mod.CP]
