The advance of yellow fever [YF] in Rio Grande do Sul leaves the
health authorities on alert and raises questions about what is going
on that would cause the disease to spread so fast. Although
investigations are being carried out in all areas of risk, so far
there is no definitive explanation, only suspicions and concern about
new infections.

Since October last year [2008], the State Secretariat of Health
recorded 6 deaths due to sylvan [jungle] yellow fever. Of these, one
occurred in Vale do Rio Pardo, where 4 other cases were confirmed,
and 5 suspected [cases] are being investigated.

Among the most likely causes for the spread of disease is that it
could have come in through Missiones, where there is environmental
damage, such as deforestation and increased temperatures. The State
Center for Health Surveillance (CEVES) is monitoring all regions to
identify factors that may indicate the presence of the virus.

In Vale do Rio Pardo, including the area of risk for the past week,
the explanation is the same as in other areas. For the director of
CEVES, Francisco Paz, climatic variations and the cutting of trees
may have contributed to the [outbreak] events, 1st in monkeys and
then in humans.

There is no specific cause. The virus normally circulates in the
forests of the state, but now is expressed [as human cases]. One
possibility is that the monkeys were less resistant, but we cannot
prove it, he explained. Up to the last report of the agency, 1287
animals had died in areas considered at risk, which now reach 182
municipalities. Eventually, a monkey develops the disease [YF virus
infection], is bitten by a mosquito, which then bites a person, and
yellow fever spreads, he said.

This explanation has been thoroughly repeated by the State
Secretariat of Health. Secretary Osmar Terra emphasizes that
prevention has not failed, rather that there is no way to know where
these [YF disease] events will occur. Faced with this situation, the
only action possible for the health services at this time is
application of the vaccine to those who live in or will have access
to locations considered at risk. "If you are not vaccinated, you
should avoid these places," clarified Francisco Paz.

The trend for continuation of cases is not discarded by CEVES.
According to the coordinator, the disease is spreading very fast. "We
have never seen a situation like this; it is impressive. Between 2001
and 2002, there was an outbreak of yellow fever in the region of
Santo Antonio de Missoes, but that was controlled by vaccination." In
other areas, that will be the strategy. According Paz, there are no
measures to ensure the elimination of the mosquito [vector]. Spraying
forests is impossible; therefore, the only way [to prevent YF
infection] is to be vaccinated.

[This news, although correct with the facts, is just a part of the
interpretation. There is no evidence that yellow fever is advancing;
this was a concept that existed for some decades. Current evidence
suggests that [YF virus] is latent in the forest and enters into a
zoonotic cycle from time to time, triggered by factors that are not
yet well known. Thus, one cannot say that yellow fever has reached
Rio Grande do Sul through Argentina. This is a superficial and
simplistic interpretation. - Mod.LJS]
