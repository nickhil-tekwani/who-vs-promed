Health officials in Samara Oblast in the Volga Federal District of Russia are reporting a measles outbreak this month [December 2022]. Six cases of the dangerous disease have been officially registered in Samara, according to a local media report.

Caused by a highly contagious virus, measles spreads from person to person by breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Signs and symptoms of measles include rash, high fever and cough, runny nose, or red, watery eyes. People can spread measles up to 4 days before and 4 days after they have a rash. Measles can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs), and even death.

Health officials say the only reliable method of preventing the disease is immunization.

Indian health officials have reported elevated measles activity nationwide, with 10 416 confirmed measles cases reported 1 Jan - 12 Dec [2022]. Maharashtra State (3075 cases) is the most at risk, followed by Jharkhand (2683 cases). Health officials have increased immunization activities to minimize disease incidence; this includes increasing immunization campaigns and community awareness of vaccination hesitancy. This report represents the most complete data available as of 28 Dec [2022].

Vaccination coverage for measles-containing vaccine 1 (MCV-1) in India was estimated at 89% in 2021 and 2020, lower than the 92-95% required to prevent wider community transmission. The last notable measles outbreak in India was reported in 2019 when 10 430 cases were reported. In 2020, approximately 5600 cases were reported, and in 2021, 5700 cases.

A measles outbreak in central Ohio has now infected at least 82 children. Most of those impacted by the outbreak have been under the age of 5, state officials reported. Since details of the first measles cases were announced last month [November 2022] by Columbus Public Health, 32 children have been hospitalized.

The first 4 cases were in unvaccinated children with no travel history who were linked to a child-care facility in Franklin County, Ohio.

Vaccination data weren't available for 4 of the infected children, but all of the others were at least partially unvaccinated, having had no doses or just one dose of the 2-shot measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR).

"Measles isn't just a little rash," the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. "Measles can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children."

Columbus public health commissioner Dr Mysheika Roberts has urged parents to vaccinate their children, CBS News reported. Public health officials recommend children receive their 1st MMR dose between 12 and 15 months old, and the 2nd between ages 4 and 6. About 90% of unvaccinated people exposed to measles will become infected, Columbus health officials warned. About 20% of those wind up hospitalized with the virus.

The Ohio outbreak comprises most of the 2022 measles cases in the United States, CBS News reported, with numbers now greater than reported cases in 2020 and 2021 combined. No children have died in this outbreak at this time, CBS News reported.
