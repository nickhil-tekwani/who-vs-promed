Rambler 'started pig fever' with ham sandwich
----------------------------------------------
A rambler's [hiker's ham sandwich could have caused the outbreak of
classical swine fever (CSF) costing the lives of 35 000 pigs, the
Ministry of Agriculture said. Landowners immediately called for stricter
controls on ramblers.
They urged the Government to insert a clause in the Labor set to renege
on footpaths deal, which began its committee stage in the Lords
yesterday. This would make it an offense for visitors to feed farm
animals and wildlife while exercising their new rights of access to the
countryside. The Country Landowners Association said: "Feeding farm
animals with the remains of a packed lunch is not just unnecessary but
could be the death knell for the livestock industry."
Ministry scientists believe the sandwich was made with a product
containing illegally imported ham. The strain of the CSF, which is
harmless to humans, is common in the Far East, not Europe. The ministry
said the outbreak, which has hit 14 farms in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex
and cost the industry BPS20 million, had been traced to a single free-range
pig that lived beside a footpath on a farm at Quidenham, Norfolk. The
sow, known by her number 847Y, was moved indoors last June after 8 of her
12 piglets died. Within less than a month the sow and her remaining
piglets had died after showing symptoms of the disease. By then, it is
believed they had infected other pigs in the herd.
The disease spread when piglets were sold to other farmers. Jeremy
Havers, 30, who owns the Quidenham pig unit, said: "I suppose whoever was
responsible thought they were doing no harm. They might even have thought
it was funny to feed a ham sandwich to a pig."
The Ramblers' Association, which has about 130 000 members, said it would
be willing to "contribute constructively to any form of Government
consultation" on tougher legal restraints. It urged all walkers to avoid
the temptation to feed livestock.
