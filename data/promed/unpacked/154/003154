BSE, COWS TO BE SCREENED - FRANCE

France said it would set up a screening program in the next few weeks to
check cattle ready for slaughter were not infected with mad cow disease
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE).
Health Minister Dominique Gillot said cattle with no outward signs of the
disease would have their brains and marrow tested to ensure infected cows
did not reach abattoirs. France has asked all members of the European
Union, including Britain, to carry out similar testing in order to identify
the means of transmission of BSE across Europe's cattle population.
In the interview, the minister confirmed the screening tests are ready, but
final decisions have yet to be made concerning the organization of the
testing, including safety conditions for people performing the tests.
"These tests permit us to know more about the reality of the risks," Gillot
told Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche in an interview. "On their own,
they are not enough to guarantee security," she was quoted as saying.
The European Commission took France to court earlier this month for
refusing to lift its blockade on British beef over BSE fears. The EU lifted
the ban in August.
The EU-wide ban was put in place in 1996 after a serious outbreak of the
disease among British herds, but EU scientists have said the meat is now
safe to export under a regime of checks.
French health officials said earlier in January the screening would be
carried out on a sample of cows to find incubating cases of BSE.
France reported a case of BSE on January 17, the first discovered this
year. France registered 31 cases of the disease in 1999. [They reported
another case of BSE 27 Jan 2000] The EU ban on British beef was imposed
after the British government admitted a possible link between BSE and a
form of the human disorder Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) which has so
far killed at least 48 people.

[I inquired of Prof. Jeanne Brugere-Picoux as to the type of testing to be
used. - Mod.TG]
The test will be the French test commercialized by Biorad (ELISA test). A
first pilot study will be done on 40 000 cows at risk (emergency slaughter
and found dead). In the next months it will be very interesting to compare
this French test in the field with "prionics" test (the evaluation of the
European Commission) and demonstrate the very good sensibility of French
test (X30 by comparison with "prionics").
It will be sure that we will find more cases of BSE (like in Switzerland).
If French experimentation confirm the demonstration of the experience of
Switzerland, it will be very important to ask for an official application
of the test in all European countries with or without BSE sporadic cases.
We know the difficulty of the antemortem diagnosis of this disease : only
clinical and with changes of behavior only seen by the owner and not
recognized at the slaughterhouse with this early changes. And we cannot
exclude - a reluctance of some owners to declare a suspicion (English
estimation was 1 out of 2 cases) - that some cases can be atypicals and
difficult to be recognized at the clinical examination (cases of emergency
slaughters, downers cows...)
