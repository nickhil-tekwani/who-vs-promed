Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Outbreak investigation has been conducted
by Disease Investigation Center, Region II, Bukittinggi. 180 nasal
swabs and serum samples were collected in pigs in the breeder, weaner
and farrow/finishing units. 33 samples were positive for influenza A
and divided on 11 pool samples, which were sent to the Indonesian
Research Center for Veterinary Sciences and to the Australian Animal
Health Laboratory for advanced tests. 6 samples were positive for
pandemic influenza A/H1N1. The Ministry of Agriculture officially
declared on 23 Nov 2009 that an outbreak of pandemic influenza A/H1N1
occurs in pigs.

Control measures - Measures applied: Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Screening; No vaccination; No treatment of
affected animals.

Measures to be applied: No other measures

[Pandemic H1N1 infection has been reported in swine and turkeys with
some epidemiologic evidence that it may come from humans -- see the
OIE webpage FAQ summary at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/press/h1n1/en_h1_n1_faq.asp>. Indonesia in
particular, is a place where it is particularly useful to cross
reference the H5N1 situation because of the unlikely potential for
reselection when both pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 are circulating in the
same area. The fact that of the 139 cases confirmed human H5N1 cases
to date in Indonesia, 113 have been fatal provides a firm rationale
for integrating influenza events in the geographic region.
Furthermore, in September 2009, Singapore detected pandemic H1N1 in
swine imported from Palau Bulan, Indonesia, which is in the same
region as the current outbreak in swine.

There were at least 27 outbreaks in poultry of H5N1 highly pathogenic
avian influenza in Riau province Indonesia in 2008, and no
information has been submitted to OIE on the H5N1 situation in 2009
-- see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=weekly_report_index&admin=0>.
This should make everyone watchful for the emergence here, and in
other location around the globe where both H5N1 and pandemic H1N1
circulate together in people or in birds and swine, of a virus that
has changed to kill both a large proportion of humans and spreads
rapidly and efficiently between people. Fortunately, there is no
indication that the pandemic H1N1 virus in swine reported here
spreads efficiently in pigs and there no indication of high mortality
in the pigs, despite 250 000 susceptible hogs in all 3 stages of
production being located on the farm.

In fact, the last reports of H1N1 in people posted on the WHO website
indicates a very low mortality with 1097 human cases and 10 deaths as
of 13 Sep 2009 (see
<http://www.searo.who.int/EN/Section10/Section2562_15044.htm>). It
was deemed, at the time, to indicate an decreasing trend in human
H1N1 cases but there have been no more recent updates and many places
are no longer counting individual cases. Of course, this reassuring
picture is the result of the present viruses in the area and that
picture could change if reselection were to occur. Both pandemic H1N1
and H5N1 viruses may be in the same region of Indonesia based on this
report in swine. The lack of information reported on H5N1 in poultry
since the end of 2008 becomes a more serious gap, given the swine
report as does the failure to report individual cases in an area that
is high risk because of the H5N1 circulation in people and poultry.

Thus, although this report of H1N1 in swine is very useful, updates
on the H5N1 situation locally in birds and people would help develop
a comprehensive, geographically integrated picture. Integration of
contemporaneous reports on pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 in humans and
animals in geographically co-located areas are need to provide an
ongoing, complete the epidemiologic risk picture. Having a
geographically integrated, across species picture of pandemic H1N1
and H5N1 events in people and animals is a particularly important
step forward in outbreaks like the one reported here, especially
since the majority of human deaths from H5N1 worldwide have occurred
in Indonesia. - Mod.PC]
