[Please refer back to the previous thread on Undiagnosed deaths -
Bangladesh (Rajbari) listed in the see alsos below The illness has now
been diagnosed as due to a Nipah/Hendra-like virus.- Mod .DK]
WHO/CDC Experts to Probe Suspected Nipah/Henra-like Virus Outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
DHAKA: Four experts from WHO Geneva and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) of USA arrived here on Wed 4 Feb 2004 on a mission to
probe the source of the mysterious disease that so far has claimed 20
people in Bangladesh. They are Dr Eric Bertherat and Dr Alice Croisier from
WHO in Geneva, and Dr Joel Montgomery and Dr Kathy Hanlon from CDC-Atlanta.
Another expert from CDC, Dr Darrin Carroll, is expected to arrive today
(Thu 5 Feb 2004). Dr Robert F Breiman, the Head of Programme on Infectious
Diseases and Vaccine Science of ICDDR,B, Dr Kazi AHM Akram of WHO Dhaka,
and six more experts, including animal virologist and entomologist from DG
Health Services, will also work with the newly arrived team. The experts
had a meeting with DG Health Services Dr Mizanur Rahman in the afternoon to
chalk out a plan for investigating the disease and for a briefing about
Bangladesh.
Experts in Dhaka have identified the disease as viral encephalitis that has
no link to avian influenza. Quoting a viral special pathogen laboratory
report conducted by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)-Atlanta in USA, Health Secretary AFM Sarwar Kamal on Sun 1 Feb 2004
said the outbreak of the disease was caused by a virus closely related to
Nipah and Hendra viruses [a novel group of paramyxoviruses, the former
previously isolated in Malaysia and Bangladesh, and the latter in Australia
- Mod.CP]. Nipah or Hendra viruses could be linked to pigs and bats, as
cases in Malaysia and Singapore pinpointed pigs, while bats appeared to be
a "reservoir" for the viruses, according to Dr Robert F Breiman of ICDDR,B.
The experts will evaluate the source of the Nipah/Hendra-like viruses and
define the mechanisms of transmission of the virus to humans - to establish
how the virus moved from animals to humans.
These viruses were the cause of two previous outbreaks of fatal
encephalitis in Bangladesh in 2001 and 2003, according to official sources
here [see ProMED-mail post below]. The government found no link of the
mysterious disease to the avian influenza outbreak in Asia and there is no
evidence that any of the patients in question were infected with avian
influenza virus. So far, the government received reports of 66 cases
affected by the mysterious disease.

[As indicated previously Nipah and Hendra viruses are related but distinct
paramyxoviruses which now comprise a new genus (_Henipavirus_) in the
sub-family _Paramyxovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. These viruses
have molecular characteristics that distinguish them from previously known
paramyxoviruses. It is likely that the virus associated with the outbreaks
of encephalitis in Western Bangladesh is a novel member of the genus
_Henipavirus_, in view of its epidemiological characteristics that
distinguish it from the two established virus species in the genus. - Mod.CP]
