Between mid-September and 19 Oct 2008, 9 clusters of norovirus
infection involving around 90 primary cases and over 100 secondary
cases were identified in patients from the Netherlands, Ireland,
Italy, and France, linked to pilgrimage to Lourdes, France.

Introduction
------------
Norovirus is a highly infectious causative agent of acute
gastroenteritis (AGE). Transmission can easily occur through contact
with people shedding the virus, through consumption of contaminated
food or water, through contaminated aerosols resulting from vomiting,
and through environmental contamination [1]. Once the virus is
introduced in settings with a high concentration of people,
person-to-person transmission is likely to occur [2]. Attack rates
are high among all groups of people; however, the impact of the
disease is more serious among the elderly [3]. Within Europe,
norovirus outbreaks are monitored by the Food-borne Viruses in Europe
(FBVE) network, which has been collecting molecular and
epidemiological data since 1999 [4].

Lourdes, France [Hautes-Pyrenees department], is a major destination
for Christian pilgrimage following claims of apparitions in 1858. A
yearly number of 5 million people, including many with underlying
diseases, visit Lourdes and often collect spring water for
consumption, which is believed to possess healing properties. With
2008 being the 150th anniversary of the apparitions, the number of
visitors has increased to 8 million this year, with a peak in visitor
numbers around the time of the Pope's visit. Norovirus outbreaks have
previously been linked to pilgrimage to Lourdes in 2002 [5, FBVE
unpublished data].

Outbreak report
---------------
On 20 Oct 2008, the FBVE network was notified of an outbreak due to
norovirus in a mental health care institution for the elderly in the
Netherlands that had serious consequences. Norovirus was confirmed in
2 patients.

A group of 10 patients and 14 health workers at the institution had
visited Lourdes between 26 Sep and 1 Oct [2008] as part of a group of
1025 Dutch pilgrims. On 29 Sep [2008], one of the health workers
started showing symptoms of AGE that lasted 24 hours and made it
necessary that she stayed in the hotel room. During the return trip
by train on 1 Oct [2008], one of the patients in the group became
symptomatic and required medical assistance. After the group had
returned to the Netherlands, the virus spread within the institution.

A total of 119 of the 550 institutionalised patients and health care
workers (22 percent) showed AGE symptoms. At the time of publication
of this report, the outbreak was still ongoing due to difficulties in
compliance with the control measures in this particular group of
patients. Four people (3 percent) died during this outbreak, with
norovirus reported as a contributing factor. One patient is still
hospitalised and in critical condition.

Norovirus infection is not a notifiable disease in the Netherlands
unless outbreaks occur in institutions. As information form the Dutch
organisation that facilitated the trip indicated that more pilgrims
were returning from Lourdes with symptoms of AGE, the Center of
Infectious Disease Control (RIVM/CIb) requested the Municipal Health
Services and microbiologists to report norovirus infections related
to Lourdes. This resulted in 3 more AGE notifications: 2 clusters of
Dutch pilgrims who had visited Lourdes between 16 and 23 Sep [2008],
one of which led to secondary cases in the patient's family, and an
elderly pilgrim with confirmed norovirus infection who required
hospitalisation 32 hours after returning from Lourdes on 18 Oct
[2008]. RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction] and
subsequent sequencing of parts of the polymerase (region A) and VP1
capsid (region D) genes identified this strain as the widely detected
genotype II.4 2006b variant.

Other cases related to this outbreak
------------------------------------
An alert within the FBVE-network revealed that other outbreaks of AGE
with a link to Lourdes had been reported. Ireland noted 3 clusters of
norovirus infections:
- one involving 40 patients infected in Lourdes in late September [2008],
- one involving 20 cases infected in Lourdes between 1 and 15 Oct [2008],
- and one cluster involving 2 cases infected in Lourdes between 1 and
15 Oct [2008], one of whom required hospitalisation and caused 11
secondary cases in the hospital.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
Local investigation by the French Institute for Public Health
Surveillance (InVS) pointed out that at least 6 hotels with Dutch,
French, and Italian visitors were coping with AGE patients, who may
include 2 Dutch clusters and one Irish cluster, in the period between
28 Sep and 16 Oct [2008]. Laboratory tests were done in France and
norovirus was confirmed in 3 people, housed in 3 different hotels
that experienced outbreaks: 2 samples from Dutch patients and one
sample from a French patient. All 3 samples were found to be positive
for the genotype II.4 2006b variant, with the sequence of region A
and parts of the capsid gene identical to the one detected in the
Dutch cases described above, but also to isolates found in outbreaks
not linked to Lourdes.

To summarise, around 90 primary cases of AGE were reported in
Lourdes, belonging to 7 different pilgrim groups from the
Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, and France, resulting in more than 100
secondary cases. These groups were housed in 6 hotels in Lourdes
between mid-September and 16 Oct [2008]. Physicians and pharmacists
in Lourdes reported a small peak in diarrhoea consultations between
22 and 26 Sep [2008], coinciding with the peak in the number of
pilgrims related to the Pope's visit.

The French district health office regularly checks the
bacteriological quality of the tap and spring water in Lourdes, which
were both in accordance with the required standards.

Discussion
----------
In this rapid communication we report one single case in the
Netherlands and at least 9 clusters of AGE that occurred between
mid-September and 19 Oct 2008 following pilgrimage to Lourdes: 3
clusters in the Netherlands, 3 in Ireland, and 6 in France, of which
3 are possibly overlapping. One case/cluster and 4 clusters were
tested by RT-PCR, and noroviruses of a commonly detected genotype
were found in all of these patients. One of the confirmed clusters
led to a large outbreak in a mental health institution that is still
ongoing. The substantial attack rate and case fatality rate in this
institution reflects the vulnerability of the patient group in which
the virus was introduced.

Although detailed information on the source of exposure is not (yet)
available, person-to-person spread is likely to be the most important
route of transmission in this outbreak, given the large numbers of
people visiting Lourdes and the health condition of the exposed
population, since it is mainly people with delicate health who visit
the site for its healing properties. In 2002, a comparable situation
was reported from Switzerland [5]. Once norovirus is introduced in
settings with high concentrations of people, environmental
contamination is likely to occur, for example due to projectile
vomiting, which is an effective transmission route [6]. Furthermore,
introduction of the virus through food or water cannot be ruled out.
The spring water that is drunk by the pilgrims was approved according
to bacteriological quality standards, but this does not exclude the
presence of viruses [7,8]. Information on locations visited by the
cases in the days before their illness will be collected to support
France in the outbreak investigation.

It is of interest to know whether norovirus continues to circulate
among pilgrims in Lourdes. If so, travel agencies and visitors should
be informed to be able to take preventive measures around any visitor
showing symptoms of AGE during their stay in or returning from
Lourdes. The latter is particularly important if the traveller lives
among fragile people, for instance in a nursing home or hospital.
Hotels housing vulnerable people should be alert when visitors show
symptoms of AGE.

To determine whether the outbreak is still ongoing in Lourdes, and to
determine the consequences of this outbreak, the FBVE network is
interested in laboratory specimens of related cases. If you have any
additional information on confirmed cases linked to Lourdes, please

[This preliminary report describes a single case in the Netherlands
and at least 9 clusters of norovirus-associated acute gastroenteritis
that occurred between mid-September and 19 Oct 2008 associated with a
pilgrimage site in Lourdes, south-west France. Three of the clusters
are located in the Netherlands, 3 in Ireland, and 6 in France.
Food-borne transmission of infection has been discounted, but the
original source of the outbreak remains to be identified. It is
likely that the outbreak is ongoing and that norovirus continues to
circulate among pilgrims in Lourdes. Travel agencies and visitors
should be made aware of the situation and take appropriate
precautions.

Lourdes is a town and commune situated in the southwest of the
Hautes-Pyrenees department, lying in the first Pyrenean foothills, in
southwestern France.
