Alert as Disease Kills 200 Pigs
-------------------------------------
More than 200 pigs have died in an outbreak of a highly contagious
disease that broke out 2 weeks ago in Kiambu & is spreading very fast.
Kiambu District Veterinary Officer Dr Joseph Njuguna said that the
disease known as African Swine Fever could wipe out the entire pig
population if prompt measures were not taken.
The veterinary department has imposed a quarantine in 4 of the 5
divisions in Kiambu District and banned the movement of pigs and their
products in the affected areas.
Dr Njuguna said the viral disease had no cure and advised farmers to
avoid rearing pigs in the first 6 months of the outbreak. He told them
to disinfect their farms to avoid contamination of their new herds. He
advised those whose farms had been affected to kill all their pigs and
burn and bury their remains to prevent further spread of the disease.
"Only pigs from confirmed uninfected areas will be allowed to move for
slaughter after my department issues the concerned farmers with a
clearance certificate, and the movement has to be by motor vehicles,"
he said.
The veterinary boss said that in the advanced stages of the disease,
the infected animal isolates itself from the herd and its skin turns
bluish. The animal then starts bleeding from the mouth, nose, and the
ears and the mouth turns red. In some instances the animal dies
without showing any signs of sickness.
The disease has not been established to affect human beings since pork
is cooked before eating, Dr Njuguna said.
He warned farmers not to feed their pigs on hotels' [uncooked
leftovers.

[As an epidemiologist, I would point out that when the Pope visited
Zambia some years ago, a large number of Catholic clergy came in from
the bush to participate in the various activities. One arrived at the
local seminary not having eaten all his pork sandwiches or sausages
(the details evade me). These were thrown out and got fed to the pigs
kept in pens behind the buildings. They promptly came down with ASF.
This was told me by my one-time graduate student, Dr Kenny Samui, now
Dean of the veterinary school in Lusaka, so I know it to be so. -
