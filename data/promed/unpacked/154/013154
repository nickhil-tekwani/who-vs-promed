A strange disease caused the death of 3 people in Caripito, Bolivar municipality in Monagas state, reports the National Institute of Hygiene, which has now received samples.

The director of epidemiology of the institute, Luis Jimenez, will announce the results that will reveal the origin of the strange disease that has the populace of El Rincon de Caripito worried.

The victims of the strange illness were a 24 year old man, who died last Saturday [4 Aug 2012], a 46 year old woman who died on Monday [6 Aug 2012], and an 11 year old boy who died on Wednesday [8 Aug 2012]. The 3 died with the same symptoms: very high fever, bone and abdominal pain, skin bruises, and also bloody vomit.

Immediately, vaccination [against what?] was initiated for fever in Rivero Street at the end of Chaima Street in the El Rincon de Caripito area, where the epidemiological barrier was activated.

The 47 families affected in this situation have now received prophylaxis [against what?]. About 20 nurses of the Dr Dario Marquez Hospital, 13 of civil protection, 18 of malariology, and 13 physicians of Barrio Adentro, helped with the administration of 200 ceftriaxone vaccines [antibiotics] for the inhabitants of the place, while malariology personnel worked on fumigation.

"We do not know how much time it will take to offer a precise diagnosis of the disease that ended the life of these people, but do not be carried away by speculation," stated the epidemiologist Luis Jimenez, who has requested patience by the community, because it is necessary to await the results coming from the National Institute of Hygiene.

[As the epidemiologist above noted, laboratory diagnosis is necessary to know what the etiology of this fatal disease might be. Yellow fever virus and Guanarito virus that causes Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF) are possible etiologies. Because ceftriaxone, a 3rd-generation cephalosporin, with broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria is being administered, apparently prophylactically, perhaps the medical team suspects a bacterial disease. ProMED-mail would be very interested in knowing the results of the laboratory tests when they become available, as well as about any additional cases.

Guanarito virus is an arenavirus related to 2 other South American arenaviruses: Machupo virus (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever) and Junin virus (Argentinean hemorrhagic fever). Venezuela has had several epidemic outbreaks of VHF -- in March of this year (2012) (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120313.1069429), in 2002-2003, and in 1997-1998. There is no vaccine available for Guanarito virus. The rodent reservoirs of Guanarito virus are the cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ and the cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_.

An image of _Sigmodon alstoni_ can be accessed at http://monde.des.mammiferes.free.fr/Placentaires/Rodentia/Cricetidae/Sigmodon%20hispidus.jpg and of the short-tailed cane mouse, _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ at http://www.mammalogy.org/uploads/imagecache/library_image/library/1583.jpg.
