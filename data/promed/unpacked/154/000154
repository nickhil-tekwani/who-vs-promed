Syphilis outbreak among Northern Territory [NT] Indigenous youth prompts fears for unborn children. Children as young as 12 [years of age] are testing positive for syphilis in an outbreak of the disease affecting young Indigenous people in the Northern Territory, new data has revealed.

The NT's Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said there had been 134 reported cases of the sexually transmitted disease in the Central Australia, Barkly and Katherine regions since July last year [2014]. That is up from 15 reported cases in the 2013-14 financial year. The majority of the notified cases are in Indigenous people 15 to 19 [years of age].

CDC spokesman Dr Matthew Thalanany said before the outbreak, the disease was at low levels across the Territory. "For quite a few years it was on the decline in the Northern Territory and we were really pleased it was on its way out," Dr Thalanany told 783 ABC Alice Springs. "But suddenly in July last year [2014] we noticed a more-than-expected number of cases."

Dr Thalanany said it was important doctors tried to determine the sexual partners of anyone that tested positive for the disease. "It's a very delicate matter, it's difficult, but it is necessary," Dr Thalanany said. "It's necessary we get to know who all the contacts are and we get to test them."

The disease can also spread from mother to unborn baby, potentially causing severe health problems for the child and even death. 3 babies tested positive in the past financial year [2013-2014].

NT Health Minister John Elferink said the outbreak was "disappointing", but vowed his Government was doing everything possible to tackle the problem. "We do what we can possibly do, but unfortunately we cannot police people's bedrooms," Mr Elferink said. "What we do do, of course, is education programs ... [and] provide treatment." He said some people could be breaking the law in spreading the disease. "Any child under the age of consent who develops a sexually transmitted disease is subject to an investigation and prosecutions are launched when we identify the people who rape children," Mr Elferink said. "If a person knowingly spreads a sexually transmitted disease then they are also committing a crime."

[The Northern Territory (NT) is a federal territory in central northern Australia, located between the states of Western Australia to the west and Queensland to the east, and bounded to the north by the Timor Sea, the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria; and with a population of 233,300, it is the least populated of Australia's eight major states and territories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory). Its capital city is Darwin, located in the Darwin Region. A map of NT showing the location of the 5 NT regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barkly_Tableland#/media/File:Alice_Springs_region.jpg.

The current syphilis outbreak is said to be concentrated in the Katherine, Barkly, and Central Australia regions in Australia's Northern Territory; (Central Australia is also known as the Alice Springs Region). A prior news report in Feb 2015 said that the outbreak was occurring in young Aborigines in remote Aboriginal communities in these 3 regions and that the cases were "linked", without specifying the nature of the linkage (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-02/warning-over-syphilis-outbreak-in-central-australia/6064064).

Aboriginal (Indigenous Australian) people make up 32.5 percent of the Northern Territory's population and their life expectancy is below that of non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory, which is likely a reflection of their inadequate access to medical care (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory#Demographics). "Only 20 percent of Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of more than 50 people have access to a doctor on a daily basis according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures from 2006. A further 41 percent have local access to a doctor once a week or once a fortnight" (http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/health/hospitals-doctors-health-aboriginal-people#ixzz3fk6Jag2m).

In contrast to the rest of Australia, where syphilis has been attributed mainly to sex between men, the very high incidence of infectious syphilis in 2012 in the mining regions of northwestern Queensland was attributed to heterosexual activity with itinerant prostitutes (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Australia: (QL) 20120215.1042038). Subsequent news reports told of an outbreak of syphilis in northwestern Queensland among heterosexual young people aged 15 to 24 years of age in remote indigenous communities that was also associated with cases of congenital syphilis (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631), which may have represented a spillover from the syphilis outbreak in Queensland miners and which continued in northwestern Queensland into 2014 (ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Australia (02): (QL) RFI 20141204.3011086). Perhaps the current outbreak in remote indigenous communities among young Aborigines in NT represents a spillover from the syphilis outbreak in northwestern Queensland. A more detailed description of the epidemiology of this syphilis outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
