SCOMBROID POISONING, TUNA - SWEDEN: (STOCKHOLM) RESTAURANT

On 7 Oct 2011, a restaurant in central Stockholm informed Stockholm
city's health administration and the Institute for Infectious Disease
Control that several lunch guests had reported suspected food
poisoning after eating tuna fish. According to the Swedish Institute
for Infectious Disease Control, around 100 people had been served tuna
at the restaurant and they received 20 reports of food poisoning.

The Institute for Infectious Control suspects that the fish may have
contained histamine, a substance which can take form in fish that is
kept too warm after being caught. When the fish is cooked the bacteria
die, but the histamine survives and can cause an allergy-like
reaction.

The tuna came from Senegal and have been tested for histamine. The
results are however not yet ready.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of
accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced
and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally
occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held
at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F / 21.1 to 32.2
deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures
(over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately
after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish
poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and
mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and
are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish
(such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also
have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic
reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in
scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not
secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally
begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolve within several
hours. - Mod.LL
