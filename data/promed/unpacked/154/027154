Finally, we have confirmatory sequence on the cow in southern Oregon. As
suggested by the monoclonal antibody results, the cow was infected with a
variant commonly found in big brown bats (_Eptesicus fuscus_). The majority
of fox samples ( 1 fox in 91, 4 foxes in 93, 3 foxes in 94, 2 foxes in 95)
from southern Oregon contained a virus associated with [fringed myotis
bats (_Myotis thysanodes_) and so the cow case is unrelated to the earlier
fox cases.

[This may be the grey fox (_Urocyon cinereoargenteus_) or the red fox
(_Vulpes vulpes_). However the strain of rabies is the same regardless of
which species of fox is involved. - Mod.TG
