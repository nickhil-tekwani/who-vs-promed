Update. Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (7 May 2009)
Epidemiological Alerts Vol. 6, No. 23

Up to 6 May 2009, the total of confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1)
recorded is 2214, including 44 deaths, in 7 countries of the Americas
(Mexico, United States, Canada, Costa Rica, Colombia, El Salvador and
Guatemala).

To date, the United States has confirmed a total of 896 human cases
of influenza A (H1N1), including 2 deaths, in 41 States: 4 in
Alabama, 48 in Arizona, 106 in California, 17 in Colorado, 4 in
Connecticut, 38 in Delaware, 5 in Florida, 3 in Georgia, 3 in Hawaii,
1 in Idaho, 204 in Illinois, 15 in Indiana, 5 in Iowa, 7 in Kansas, 2
in Kentucky, 7 in Louisiana, 4 in Maine, 4 in Maryland, 71 in
Massachusetts, 1 in Michigan, 1 in Minnesota, 4 in Missouri, 4 in
Nebraska, 5 in Nevada, 2 in New Hampshire, 7 in New Jersey, 8 in New
Mexico, 98 in New York, 7 in North Carolina, 5 in Ohio, 1 in
Oklahoma, 15 in Oregon, 2 in Pennsylvania, 2 in Rhode Island, 17 in
South Carolina, 2 in Tennessee, 91 in Texas, 8 in Utah, 11 in
Virginia, 23 in Washington and 26 in Wisconsin. Other suspected cases
are being investigated.

From [1 Mar 2009 to 5 May 2009], Mexico has reported 1112 confirmed
cases of influenza A (H1N1), including 42 deaths, in 28 of 32 states.
The states with the highest number of confirmed cases are Distrito
Federal, Estado de Mexico, San Luis Potosi and Hidalgo. The majority
of these have occurred in previously healthy young adult people.

In Canada to date, 201 human cases of influenza A (H1N1) have been
confirmed in 8 of 13 provinces: 30 in Alberta, 54 in British
Columbia, 2 in New Brunswick, 53 in Nova Scotia, 10 in Quebec, 1 in
Manitoba, 49 in Ontario and 2 in Prince Edward Island, some of them
with recent travel history to Mexico. All the cases developed a mild
form of influenza-like illness. Some of the cases presented, in
addition, gastrointestinal symptoms. Indigenous transmission is not
discarded, since not all the confirmed cases have trip history to Mexico.

On [2 May 2009], Costa Rica notified one confirmed case of influenza
A (H1N1). On [3 May 2009], Colombia reported one confirmed case of
influenza A (H1N1), while El Salvador reported 2 confirmed cases of
influenza A (H1N1). On [5 May 2009], Guatemala notified one confirmed
case of influenza A (H1N1) in a person that has traveled to Mexico.
Various countries of the region are reporting suspected and probable
cases. This indicates that surveillance enhancement is producing results.

Total: 1204 (42)

[The epidemic curve available at the given link shows a rapid
decrease in the number of confirmed cases by date of onset beginning
approximately 27 Apr 2009, with no cases effectively reported since 5
May 2009. This may change with time, but the curve is highly
suggestive that the epidemic is ending.

Calculating the overall confirmed case fatality rate, with today's (7
May 2009) report of 44 deaths, the rate is 3.7 percent. Of interest
are the higher case fatality rates by age group, which may be a small
number phenomenon. To date, information on results of investigations
into the actual clinical courses of the fatal cases has not been
available for review. - Mod.MPP]

[To summarize the current situation as of 7 May 2009, there have been
a total of 2371 cases and 44 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection
officially reported to WHO/PAHO coming from 24 countries, up from
1893 confirmed cases and 31 deaths from 23 countries yesterday (5 May
2009). The newly added country is Poland. (According to newswires,
Brazil and Argentina have confirmed 4 cases and one case,
respectively, and will probably appear on tomorrow's (8 May 2009)
official reports).

The USA has officially reported 896 laboratory confirmed cases coming
from 41 states (compared with 642 cases from 41 states on 6 May
2009), and 2 deaths (one in a Mexican child visiting in the USA and a
2nd in a resident of Texas with known pre-existing illness). Canada
has reported 214 cases from 9 provinces with no deaths, up from 201
cases from 8 provinces on 5 May 2009. Mexico has reported 1204
confirmed cases with 44 deaths (compared with 1112 cases and 42
deaths on 4 May 2009.

According to data available, the overall reported case fatality rate
in Mexico has been 3.7 percent, but higher CFRs have been observed by
age groups. Results of further studies on the fatal cases are not
presently available to permit a better understanding of what may have
transpired in Mexico. Questions still remain as to whether there was
primary viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or
secondary bacterial pneumonia and possible overwhelming sepsis as the
contributing factors to the fatal outcomes following H1N1 infection.
