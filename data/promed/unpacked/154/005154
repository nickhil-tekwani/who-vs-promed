[A total of 12 FMD outbreaks caused by serotype O, involving mixed species (sheep, goat and bovine) farms, were reported between March and April 2015 in Algeria's provinces El Bayadh (9), El Oued (1), Sidi Bel Abbes (1) and Siada (1). The event was resolved on 3 May 2015. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17331.

In fact, the 2015 event was regarded as a continuation of a major FMD epizootic which had started in the Maghreb in April 2014, initially reported from Tunisia, later (July) from Algeria where 419 outbreaks were reported until end September (spread throughout all the country's northern provinces between Tunisia and Morocco), and finally, in October 2014, spreading to Morocco. The causative serotype O FMD strain was genotyped as topotype ME-SA, lineage 2001d.

Algeria has suffered later also an epizootic caused by FMD serotype A, genotyped topotype Africa, lineage G-IV. This took place between March and June 2017, affecting cattle, goats and sheep. During this event, 108 outbreaks were reported. A final report was submitted to the OIE on [Mon 4 Jun 2018], stating that the outbreak had been resolved on 12 August 2017. The source of the event was not identified. See event's summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000026529_20180604_160029.pdf

Previous to the 2014/15 event which involved all 3 Maghreb countries, the region was reportedly free of FMD since 1999. In May 2012, the 3 countries obtained, through a joint approach, the OIE endorsement of their FMD national official control programs, consistent with the FAO/OIE FMD progressive control pathway (FMD-PCP), which aims at obtaining an FMD-free status, with or without vaccination. Morocco stopped vaccination in 2007, Algeria and Tunisia continued annual vaccinations. Unfortunately, the efforts to attain the FMD-free status were disrupted by the 2014 epizootic.

The deteriorating animal health status in Algeria, reflected by repeated introductions of FMD serotype A and O, is a cause for concern regionally and beyond. Genotyping results of the current strain may be helpful in the detection of the source.
