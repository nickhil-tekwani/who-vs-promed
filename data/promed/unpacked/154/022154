Manitoba: West Nile Virus Update
--------------------------------
Birds

The following additional birds have been confirmed positive for West Nile
virus: 1 magpie in the RM of Cameron, 1 American crow in the RM of
Boissevain, 2 American crows in Winnipeg, 1 American crow in the RM of
Wallace, 1 American crow in the RM of Glenella, 1 American crow in Portage
la Prairie, 1 blue jay in the Town of Altona and 1 magpie in the RM of
Hanover. This brings the total number of birds from the crow family
confirmed positive for West Nile virus to 73 in Manitoba.

Mosquitoes

Since 2 more positive mosquito pools have been identified in Winkler and in
Winnipeg, that brings the total to 7 positive pools so far in 2002.

Others

In Manitoba, the virus has also been previously found in geese, ducks,
sentinel chickens, an owl, and horses. There have been no human cases of
West Nile virus diagnosed in this province.

The hunting season is upon us. The extent to which West Nile virus may be
present in wild game is unknown. The risk of West Nile virus transmission
from handling or consuming game is considered very low. There have been no
documented cases of West Nile virus being transmitted to hunters from game.
However, hunters are encouraged to take precautions when handling,
cleaning, and cooking game birds and mammals including wearing gloves, hand
washing, and thorough cooking.

Saskatchwan: West Nile Virus Update
-----------------------------------
Birds

The latest tests for West Nile virus in Saskatchewan birds have produced an
additional 14 confirmed positive results. The 14 confirmed positive results
include 9 crows, previously presumed positive, found in Yorkton (5),
Melville, Melville area, Crooked Lake Provincial Park, and Loreburn plus 6
new birds found in Estevan, Kamsack, Perdue, Moose Jaw, St. Gregor, and a
second bird in Regina. There are currently no birds that are presumed
positive. The total number of confirmed West Nile virus-positive birds is
now 21 collected from 13 localities in Saskatchewan.

Equines

[The ProMED-mail post referenced below reported in addition the diagnosis
of West Nile virus infection in 6 equines. It was incorrectly stated in the
Moderator's comment that these were probably the first equines to test
positive in Canada. The above report indicates that equines in Manitoba
have also tested West Nile virus-positive, but details are not given. - Mod.CP]
