[Austin Demby and others published just such a study. (Demby AH,
Chamberlain J, Brown DW, Clegg CS (1994) Early diagnosis of Lassa fever by
reverse transcription-PCR. J Clin Microbiol 32:2898-903) Abstract: We
developed a method based on a coupled reverse transcription-PCR (RT- PCR)
for the detection of Lassa virus using primers specific for regions of the
S RNA segment which are well conserved between isolates from Sierra Leone,
Liberia, and Nigeria. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by
Southern blotting with a chemiluminescent probe. The assay was able to
detect 1 to 10 copies of a plasmid or an RNA transcript containing the
target sequence. There was complete concordance between RT-PCR and virus
culture for the detection of Lassa virus in a set of 29 positive and 32
negative serum samples obtained on admission to the hospital from patients
suspected of having Lassa fever in Sierra Leone. Specificity was confirmed
by the failure of amplification of specific products from serum samples
collected from 129 healthy blood donors in Sierra Leone or from tissue
culture supernatants from cells infected with related arenaviruses (Mopeia,
lymphocytic choriomeningitis, Tacaribe, and Pichinde viruses). Sequential
serum samples from 29 hospitalized patients confirmed to have Lassa fever
were tested by RT-PCR and for Lassa virus-specific antibodies by indirect
immunofluorescence (IF). RT-PCR detected virus RNA in 79% of the patients
at the time of admission, comparing favorably with IF, which detected
antibodies in only 21% of the patients. Lassa virus RNA was detected by
RT-PCR in all 29 patients by the third day of admission, whereas antibody
was detectable by IF in only 52% of the patients. These results point to an
important role for RT-PCR in the management of suspected cases of Lassa
fever.
