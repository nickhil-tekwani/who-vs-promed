Ukraine reports 6 botulism cases since beginning of the week
------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Public Health Center (PHC) of Ukraine today [15 Jun 2022], since the beginning of the week, 6 people with a diagnosis of botulism have been hospitalized in different regions of Ukraine -- Volyn, Chernihiv, Zhytomyr, Rivne, Kherson and Kyiv.

Among the causes of the disease, experts from the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention point to the consumption of fried and dried river fish of their own cooking or unknown production and home-canned food.

Symptoms of botulism often appear gradually, without sharp rises in temperature. Later there is a visual impairment -- one of the first signs of botulism.

At the same time, there is thirst, dryness of the mucous membranes, and swallowing disorders, that may change the tone of voice. Patients complain of a feeling of "lump" in the throat, pain when swallowing, and sore throat. Neurological symptoms last for several days and are accompanied by a general toxic syndrome -- patients complain of severe headache, dizziness, insomnia, general weakness, and fever. In severe cases, patients are concerned about the feeling of shortness of breath. Respiratory failure develops, which is the cause of death in botulism.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of a preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _Clostridium botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the spores germinate in the intestinal tract).

Types A, B, and E of human botulism are the commonest. Although all types have a similar symptom complex, Hughes and colleagues report that type E is much more likely to produce initial lethargic mental status and more autonomic dysfunction (1). In Eastern Europe, many of the cases are type E related to the ingestion of salted or dried fish.
