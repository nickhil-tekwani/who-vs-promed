North West (South Africa) hit by another anthrax outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
Another case of the outbreak of anthrax has been reported in the North West
province. The outbreak of the deadly disease is the third to be reported in
less than 2 months around villages near the provincial capital Mafikeng.
The first case of the outbreak was reported early last month in Ramatlabama
village near the Botswana and South African border post. This time around,
it has struck the villages of Dibono and Disaneng. Several people have been
treated at the provincial hospital for exposure to Anthrax, while some
livestock have also died.
State veterinary officials have been deployed to 11 villages, to start
vaccinating thousands of animals. However, the South African meat exports
have not as yet been affected.
Despite warnings of the danger of consuming dead animals, some villagers
were adamant that they would eat the meat because of poverty. The
vaccination process is planned to continue throughout December and the
first quarter of the new year. Farmers have already been served with
quarantine notices, which forbid them to sell or move their stock during
the next 2 months.

Village under quarantine following Anthrax infection
--------------------------------------------------
The whole village of Miga on the border with Botswana has been put under
quarantine after the area was hit by anthrax infection, killing 5 cattle;
11 villagers fell ill after eating meat and 97 residents were given
preventative treatment. A veterinary student of the University of the North
West has been rushed to hospital also after been infected.
The deadly disease has also been reported from other parts of the North
West, [such as] Taung, which is known for agriculture produce, especially
livestock. Molifi Sefularo, the North West Health MEC, has already urged
North West communities to refrain from eating meat from dead animals.
Health officials are working round the clock to contain the disease from
spreading, particularly into the commercial farming sector.
