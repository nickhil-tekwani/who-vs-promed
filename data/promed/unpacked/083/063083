Contaminated blood could have caused hepatitis
----------------------------------------------
More than a week after police busted a massive racket in adulterated
blood in Uttar Pradesh, another report on the quality of blood seized
reveals that it was infected with the highly contagious hepatitis B
and hepatitis C viruses -- painting an alarming picture of the
possibility of patients having contracted [hepatitis].

The Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences
(SGPGIMS), in another report to the government on Friday [28 Aug
2009], said the hepatitis viruses were found in the adulterated blood.
The report was also submitted to the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), an FDA source said on Sunday [30 Aug 2009].

A detailed examination of the blood, seized by the authorities from a
private nursing home run illegally by a government doctor had revealed
that very poor quality blood with extremely low levels of haemoglobin
was being supplied to patients in different hospitals. Over a period
of 2 years, 100 000 units of the contaminated blood were sold.

Uttar Pradesh Police arrested 6 people, including an anesthetist from
the state-run Balrampur Hospital, in connection with the racket on 22
Aug 2009. The racket was allegedly being run with the connivance of
several well-known private blood banks and doctors. "We have received
the report but the details cannot be revealed now because it will be
presented in the court as evidence against the accused on Monday [31
Aug 2009]," FDA commissioner Lalit Verma told IANS. The blood seized
by the police with fake labels of the state's largest blood bank at
King George's Medical College (KGMC) were sent for detailed
examination to the SGPGIMS.

Earlier, a report by the SGPGIMS revealed that saline water was being
mixed with the blood to increase its quantity, which led to further
dilution of the already low haemoglobin level in the blood. Lucknow
superintendent of Police (City) Paresh Pandey, who busted the racket,
had initially said he suspected animal blood was being mixed with
human blood. Later, it was found that the blood was being diluted with
saline water.

Last week a joint team of the FDA and police raided a number of
private hospitals and blood banks across the city and a [show cause]
notice was served to 3 blood banks. "Charak Pathology, Indira
Diagnostic Centre, and Kohli Blood Bank were found to be functioning
without proper facilities for blood collection and storage. They were
also not carrying proper certificates," an FDA official said.

The gang used to buy blood from professional donors like drug addicts,
rickshaw pullers, and beggars and would [dilute] it with saline water
to make 3 units from one unit of blood, police said. This was sold at
INR 1000-1500 [USD 20.50 to 30.75] per unit.

[The state of Uttar Pradesh and its capital Lucknow can be located on
the maps of the Indian states at
<http://rulers.org/indmap.html>
and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00K3>.

The extent of the illegal supply of this contaminated blood is
alarming. Apart from the circumstance that saline dilution of the
blood is likely to reduce its therapeutic value, the inclusion of
unscreened blood would allow transmission of many infections agents in
addition to hepatitis viruses, not least HIV -- see PromED archive for
2004 below. Information on the known consequences of the sale and
distribution of this contaminated blood should be made public as soon
as it is ascertained. - Mod.CP]
