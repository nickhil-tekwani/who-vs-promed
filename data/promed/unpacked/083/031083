Crypto outbreak spreads to 5 more counties
----------------------------
Topeka and State health officials today said an outbreak of
cryptosporidosis in Douglas County has extended to 5 more counties.
"Some of these cases are connected to the Douglas County outbreak,
while others have not yet been linked," the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment said in a news release. KDHE planned to
release details later this afternoon about cases of crytposporidosis
in Shawnee, Jefferson, Johnson, Leavenworth, and Wyandotte counties.
More than 80 people in Douglas County have been diagnosed with the
illness that carries symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal
cramping. Health officials have been under fire for knowing about
crypto cases in late July 2003 but not alerting the public for nearly
a month. The illness is spread through oral-fecal contact, including
transmission from person to person, water, and food.

Parasitic illness hits northeast Kansans
-------------------------
An outbreak of infections from a fecal-borne parasite has spread from
Lawrence to 5 surrounding counties, state health officials said
Friday. Most cases of the illness caused by cryptosporidium have been
linked to day care centers and swimming pools. So far, 99 cases have
been reported.
None are linked to public drinking-water supplies, said Gianfranco
Pezzino, epidemiologist with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment. However, the agency is warning health officials and
residents of 24 northeast Kansas counties to look out for symptoms.
Cases have been reported in counties that include 3 of the state's
largest population centers: Topeka, Lawrence, and suburban Kansas
City. The Sedgwick County Health Department is sending out an alert
to infection-control nurses at area hospitals and to doctors who
specialize in infectious disease. Physicians are being asked to test
for the parasite if patients have prolonged watery diarrhea or have
symptoms of a food-borne or gastrointestinal illness.
No cases have been reported in Sedgwick County. Mansoor Tahir, a
senior epidemiologist at the Sedgwick County Health Department, said
he does not expect an outbreak in Wichita because most swimming pools
are closed for the year. Cryptosporidium is a one-cell parasite that
causes diarrhea and stomach cramps. Though seldom deadly, it can be a
threat to people with weakened immune systems, such as AIDS patients.
So far, no one has been hospitalized, Pezzino said.
3 of the people suffering from the parasite were known to have been
at the Great Wolf Lodge water park in Wyandotte County. The facility
was closed and the water was hyperchlorinated to kill the parasite.
Normal levels of chlorine in pools will not kill cryptosporidium,
Pezzino said. The first cases of cryptosporidiosis surfaced in late
July 2003 in Lawrence, and the total there had reached 82 Friday. 54
of those were in people under age 18, and many others were in family
members of children who stayed at day care centers where the parasite
was found, said Kay Kent, director of the Lawrence-Douglas County
Health Department. 5 of the 17 cases in neighboring counties were
linked to the Lawrence cases. In addition to Douglas County, 8 cases
were identified in Johnson County, 4 in Shawnee County, 2 each in
Jefferson and Leavenworth counties, and one in Wyandotte County. Last
year, 16 cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported across the state.
