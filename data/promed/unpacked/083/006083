An epidemic attacks the Sarrias [Chamois - mountain goat]
---------------------------------------------------------
"We saw 2 Sarria (chamois) lonely and sick on the journey. The 1st
walked with difficulty and swollen eyes. The 2nd was spinning his
horns around himself, blind. It was rubbing its eyes on the grass
until it became blind. They were bleeding and flies were all around
and in them."

This is the story related by a mountaineer, telling about his
encounter with 2 Sarria [chamois] suffering from keratoconjuntivitis,
during a recent excursion by the crests of the Alanos in the
Navarro-Aragonese valley. This is an epidemic that was ongoing this
past summer [late June through late September 2008] with expansion
through some of the central Pyrenees valleys, such as Benasque, where
decreases in the population [of chamois] of up to 15 percent have
been reported, and which has also extended to the colonies of chamois
in Navarra.

Keratoconjunctivitis is an infectious disease affecting the eyes that
damages the cornea of the infected animals and is primarily
transmitted through insects, primarily flies. The mortality in case
is often related to the residual blindness caused by the disease and
their living in rugged terrain. The animals that the mountaineer
encountered in the Alanos zone were quite sick, so that even though
they are usually very elusive animals, he was able to approach them.

Other hikers and hunters have encountered also affected chamois in
recent weeks.

The impact that the outbreak of keratoconjunctivitis is having on the
chamois population in Navarra has not been determined as yet. The
Environmental Guardians are maintaining a record of affected animals
"especially in zones where the population density [of chamois] is
greater, such as Larra. However, there is no evidence that the
populations to the west, such as those who live west of Mintxate
(Uztarroz) up the slopes of Pico Orhy (Ochagavia) have been affected
in similar degrees."

In the coming weeks, the guards will conduct the annual count of
chamois and will then know the effects of the disease on these
populations. Some 600 animals have been counted this past spring in
Navarra. Compared to their smaller number 3 or 4 years ago, the
chances of the population to survive the epidemic are better now.
Nevertheless, if the mortality in Navarra will be similar to the one
seen in Aragon, some 100 animals are expected to disappear.

Keratoconjunctivitis has been known to affect the Navarra chamois for
some years. The infection can affect sheep and cattle as well,
although in such cases treatment is more feasible. Neither Navarra,
nor Aragon, has mounted a veterinary intervention for the chamois
population, although in Aragon they had banned hunting in the
affected zones. This measure is not necessary in Navarra as the
chamois, although clearly increasing in population, is a protected
species whose hunting is not permitted.

[Infectious keratoconjunctivitis (IKC) caused by _Mycoplasma
conjunctivae_ is a highly contagious ocular infection which is common
in domestic sheep and goats. In the European Alps, IKC is often
observed in Alpine chamois (_Rupicapra r. rupicapra_) and in Alpine
ibex (_Capra i. ibex_), but the disease has also been described in
other wild Caprinae in the Pyrenees and in New Zealand. The infection
is characterised by inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea, and
in the most advanced stages, the cornea is opaque or even perforated.
In IKC outbreaks in chamois and ibex, spontaneous recovery is the
most prevalent outcome of the disease. However, mortality can
occasionally reach 30 percent. Studies in eastern Switzerland
indicated that _M. conjunctivae_ infection is not self-maintained in
chamois. In contrast, the disease is endemic and self-maintained in
the domestic sheep population.

Spillover of the agent from sheep living in proximity during summer
may be the origin of point-source epidemics in wild Caprinae. Flies
are likely to play a central role in interspecific transmission of
_M. conjunctivae_ on alpine meadows. When outbreaks of IKC occur in
wildlife, a special effort should be made to avoid unnecessary human
disturbance in affected areas. However, animals presenting
irreversible ocular lesions should be shot by professional
gamekeepers to prevent suffering. Prevention of IKC in wild Caprinae
should focus on preventing the spillover of _M. conjunctivae_ from
livestock. However, studies are required to evaluate the distribution
of _M. conjunctivae_ infection in domestic sheep in several countries
and to assess the risk of IKC spillover from domestic animals to
wildlife. In addition, immunological studies should be performed to
develop tools which could lead to the control of _M. conjunctivae_
infection in domestic sheep.

The above data have been mainly derived from the paper "Infectious
keratoconjunctivitis of ibex, chamois and other Caprinae" by M.
Giacometti, M. Janovsky, L. Belloy & J. Frey (2002). Rev. sci. tech.
Off. int. Epiz., 21 (2), 335-345. The full text is available on-line at:

The Pyrenean Chamois, (French: izard or isard, Spanish: rebeco or
gamuza, Aragonese: sarrio or chizardo, Catalan: isard ) _Rupicapra
pyrenaica pyrenaica_ is a Goat antelope that lives in the Pyrenees,
Cantabrian Mountains and Apennine Mountains. See picture at:

They browse on grass, lichens and buds of trees. They are found
anywhere up to 3000m. The Chamois belongs to the Caprinae subfamily
of bovids, along with sheep and goats. - Mod.AS]
