I'm surprised that anyone accepts the use of organs from donors that die due to causes that, with a high probability, are caused by an infectious agent.

From my past experience in meat inspection and vet public health, we certainly would not accept letting meat from animals that were diseased (or worse, dying from possible infectious disease) at the time of slaughter enter the food chain. Are there no guidelines on organ use, or are they lacking in certain areas?

That apart, the symptoms described in the donor remind me of symptoms described in an Egyptian corneal donor who died in the late 1970s from "unspecified cerebral inflammatory disease," which, with the wisdom of hindsight, was found to be the cause of rabies infection and death in the recipient.

[This case is unusual in that the organ donor had no recollection of any encounter with any animal likely to have transmitted rabies virus. An encounter with a bat, the usual source of human rabies in the United States, might have been overlooked, but the rabies virus transmitted by organ donation was, in this case, a raccoon-variant rabies virus. - Mod.CP
