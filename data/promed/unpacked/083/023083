The doctor who treated Patrick Sawyer, the Liberian-American who brought Ebola into the country, at First Consultant Hospital, and was subsequently infected with the virus, has recovered and has since been discharged from the Isolation centre in Lagos.

The doctor was the 1st Nigerian infected with the virus and had been receiving treatment at the Isolation centre ... [more]

[2] Hand sanitizers: effectiveness

The WHO recommends in general the use of an alcohol-based hand rub for routine hand disinfection. In its latest publication about the Ebola virus in August 2014, the WHO also describes hand disinfection as the standard of hand decontamination.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand rub. The German Robert Koch Institute (RKI) recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand rub with a proven efficacy against at least enveloped viruses. Many hand disinfectants are known to be broadly effective against enveloped viruses.

Hand washing alone is definitely not the most effective decontamination method for clean hands. Furthermore, the ebolavirus is spread into the surrounding area where it can remain infectious for up to 3 weeks. This is an avoidable risk of cross contamination. Disinfection alone can ensure that the virus loses its infectivity.

[Stratford-upon-Avon-based [UK] toiletries manufacturer DCS Group owns the Enliven brand and also makes other hand sanitiser brands. Denys Shortt OBE -- CEO of DCS -- said: "Phone enquiries have been coming in from Africa for urgent supplies of Enliven hand sanitiser. We are helping as much as we can and we are currently planning to urgently produce over 500 000 bottles for a customer in Nigeria."

EVD and Thermal Scanners
------------------------
In reference to [Ebola virus disease - West Africa (127): Guinea, screening, more 20140815.2691736], Liberian officials using older contact thermometers and then Mod.JW's comments to use non-contact thermometers [I was supposing that tympanic (contact) thermometers were not swabbed with alcohol between passengers, thus carrying a potential risk. I have been unable to find a video on the internet showing them in use at an airport. - Mod.JW]:

What is the actual effectiveness of the use of non-contact thermometers in detecting febrile individuals in an open-air, non-temperature-controlled environment? What have we learned during the SARS and H5N1 endemics that could be useful in improving the screening processes to detect individuals who may be ill?

Experience doesn't equal data; but my experiences are that while thermal scanning, if done in ideal settings, may be effective; similar techniques used outside of a temperature and airflow controlled environment are simply ineffective. The use of contact (temporal, tympanic) thermometers are necessary in those circumstances, and even these do not respond well if the environment is overly hot or cold.

Much of the data I could find supports my experience; such as that published in Eurosurveillance or in Emerging Infectious Diseases over the past few years [see refs. below].

Used inside of a temperature controlled air terminal, the large and very expensive thermal imaging devices work well enough; I suspect more simplistic non-contact devices would do so as well; but the airports in West Africa, at least those that I have been to, including Liberia, are not temperature controlled; and individuals have to walk in from the tarmac. These are not ideal conditions for keeping the sensitivity high enough to be beneficial.

Furthermore, they are not using thermal imaging devices; instead they are using a non-contact point and scan device which only measures the temperature over a small area. Used in the field, at a makeshift roadside inspection station, and using such non-contact point and scan devices, the effectiveness would be even less, I suspect.

Are they also using questionnaires? Do they have personnel trained and experienced in identifying potentially sick travelers? I don't know that Liberia, or any of the other countries in the region, has the resources to roll this out in an effective manner. I've visited hospitals and clinics in Monrovia -- I was unimpressed. Their health system was in dire straits before the outbreak; it is crumbling under the pressure of the outbreak; I don't see how they will be able to manage effective screening checkpoints.

My point in all this is just that I don't think the advice should be increasing (and placing their hopes of containment) in such screening checkpoints. Resources are already limited (the daily SitRep from MOHSW in Liberia remarks on how difficult it is to get bleach and gloves), don't limit them further. Improve the conditions for the current contact tracing teams, for the current healthcare workers; but avoid utilization of resources on methods that are inefficacious. What good advice can be given to the people in West Africa fighting this that will actually work to help contain and control the outbreak?

Ebolavirus Epidemic Is Like 'War Time' Says MSF
-----------------------------------------------
15 Aug 2014: Medical charity pleads for the international community to unite to combat the outbreak as the death tolls climbs above 1100. Health experts have revealed they are struggling to contain West Africa's deadly ebolavirus outbreak, and described the situation as like being in "wartime". The charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said if the situation in Liberia is not brought under control then the region will never be stabilised. "The main thing I come back to is that it is deteriorating faster, moving faster than we can respond," MSF international president Dr Joanne Liu said.... "I really feel that it is like wartime, in terms of fear and nobody knowing what is going on.... We need a response in terms of international organisations and states, and it needs to happen now if we want to contain this epidemic."

IFRC calls for co-ordination
----------------------------
New chief of International [Federation of] Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [IFRC] calls for co-ordinated efforts to halt spread of ebolavirus. In response to the EVD outbreak, over 1500 volunteers, mobilized by National Red Cross Societies in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and supported by IFRC, have been actively engaged in numerous activities at community level such as social mobilization, dead body management and contact tracing, as it was introduced ...

Ebola NOT airborne
------------------
15 Aug 2014: Ebola virus may be spread by droplets, but not by an airborne route: what that means.
http://virologydownunder.blogspot.co.uk
[People who still believe ebolaviruses are airborne in nature should read this scholarly yet easily understandable explanation of the difference between airborne and aerosol-borne. - Mod.JW]

Nigeria: nanosilver treatment
-----------------------------
15 Aug 2014: On Thursday [14 Aug 2014] this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Ebola victims in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos will receive Nano Silver in an attempt to treat the infection.
http://www.riskscience.umich.edu/nano-silver-used-treat-ebola-victims-nigeria
[This is a carefully researched article that concludes: "Given the commercial interests involved here and the paucity of evidence for nano-silver being in any way an appropriate treatment for EVD, the wisdom of treating patients in Nigeria with the material has to be questioned on both medical and ethical grounds." - Mod.JW]

Senegal: US basketball clinic cancelled
---------------------------------------
16 Aug 2014: The US national team has canceled a trip to Senegal after the EVD outbreak in West Africa. The Americans were scheduled to ... travel to the African continent for the 1st time, conducting a joint clinic on 27 Aug 2014 with the Senegal national team.... But USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said Friday [15 Apr 2014] the Americans had no choice but to call off the trip because of the risk involved with Senegal's location near countries where the outbreak has been deadly ...

Guyana: sensitization campaign
------------------------------
16 Aug 2014: Guyana strengthens Port Surveillance and other Clinical Health Systems. During a press conference yesterday [15 Aug 2014], [it was] noted that a sensitization campaign is pertinent to ensuring the safety of the Guyanese populace ... recommended that posters, pamphlets, advertisements and other forms of public notices be used to educate the masses on the deadly effects of the ebolavirus.

Visas for the Hajj
------------------
16 Aug 2014: Nigeria is not included as there have been no cases outside the cluster related to the index case. As for citizens of banned countries living outside the 3 countries, it has not been clarified, as it will be left to the embassies in those countries to decide depending on risk and recent travel.

Russia: protective masks that can be worn for 15 days
-----------------------------------------------------
16 Aug 2014: A Russian holding company is planning to organize shipments to Africa of personal protective masks ... designed to prevent and protect the local population from infection with ebolavirus. The innovative material has a bactericidal and bacteriostatic action, which lasts for 360 hour.... This mask can be used 20 times after washing.

UK (England): false alarm
-------------------------
16 Aug 2014: Patient 'quarantined' during Ebola scare at Weston General Hospital. There was an Ebola scare at Weston General Hospital today [16 Aug 2014]. The man, believed to have been from Libya, walked into the accident and emergency department at about 9:00 am this morning. When a triage nurse raised concerns about how he was presenting, and the fact that he had recently been to Africa, medical staff isolated him and carried out a full examination to see if he was infected with the deadly, contagious virus. "They ... isolated him in one of the bays away from the other patients..." [more]

Rapid Threat Assessment
-----------------------
5 Aug 2014: In August 2012 [historical data from International Air Travel Association (IATA)], travelers departing from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone predominantly traveled to African destinations (55 percent). Most of the remaining travelers went to Europe (30 percent) and the Eastern Mediterranean (7 percent). The Americas received less than 5 percent and the USA only 2.5 percent. Also noteworthy, the total volume of international traffic from these 3 countries is quite low relative to other major countries. Finally, the countries at the center of the outbreak have announced a cross-border isolation zone ... [more]

This will evidently change when British Airways and Kenya Airways suspend their flights at the end of August 2014 (Emirates has already stopped flying to West Africa).
