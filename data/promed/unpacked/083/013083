The Ministry of Public Health has confirmed there has been no influx of
Burmese people seeking medical treatment in Thailand but added the country
is prepared to let them in for humanitarian reasons if they need
medication. [Readers should remember that the previous report had the Thai
army actively returning such folk to Myanmar.
Recent reports confirmed the spread of an epidemic which reportedly killed
hundreds of people over the past 2 months in the United Wa State Army town
of Yawn. Concerns arose that along with patients seeking medication in
Thailand, some Wa drug dealers might also have sneaked into the country.

Dr Sombat Thanprasertsuk, director of the Ministry of Public Health's
Epidemiology Division, said it is still unknown if Wa people are infected
with scrub typhus, typhoid or malaria. A source at the World Health
Organisation said it was likely that health authorities in Rangoon had not
been alerted about the matter because of internal politics between the
government and minority groups. About 5000 Wa people have reportedly fallen
ill or died from malaria, anthrax, typhoid, scrub typhus and leptospirosis.

Chiang Rai governor Samroeng Panayopakorn yesterday warned Thai medical
practitioners along the border to notify authorities if they accepted
seriously sick people for treatment.
Pol Col Songkran Sangkhakorn, the immigration police chief in Mae Sai
district which is opposite the Burmese border township of Thachilek, said
it was possible some Wa patients might have crossed the border to seek
treatment at any of the 20 or so private clinics in Mae Sai district by
disguising themselves as Burmese. He said about 300 Burmese [normally came
across the border via the Mae Sai permanent crossing and 2 other
checkpoints each day to work or shop.

[Readers will note two things ... that the reports are replacing numbers
dead with numbers sick and at a lower level. And that there is less
certainty in what is happening. Until such time that we have harder
information this thread will be kept in abeyance. - MHJ
