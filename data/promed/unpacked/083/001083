Turkey
------
Veterinary officials in Turkey have confirmed an H5N1 avian influenza
outbreak in the western part of the country near the border with
Greece, according to a report yesterday [18 Mar 2008] from the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

The virus struck 22 backyard chickens at a village near Ipsala in
Edirne province, according to the OIE report. The remaining 16 birds
were destroyed. Turkish officials listed fomites, which could involve
contamination spread by humans, vehicles, or animal feed, as the
source of the outbreak.

Turkey's last H5N1 outbreaks occurred over several weeks in January
and February 2008 at 6 sites, all of which involved backyard poultry
[see ProMED refs. at end]. The OIE report on the outbreaks said the
source of the virus was contact with wild species.

All of the previous outbreaks occurred near villages along the Black
Sea, an area that officials from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) have said is vulnerable to H5N1
outbreaks, because surrounding countries are a winter home to
migratory birds from Siberia and often have poor separation between
wild and domestic birds. However, the OIE report map detailing the
most recent outbreak location shows that the Ipsala area is close to
the Mediterranean Sea [see comment below].

Laos
----
Government officials in Laos reported a fresh H5N1 outbreak in
chickens in Luang Namtha, in the northwestern part of the country near
the border with China and Myanmar, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
today (19 Mar 2008).

Yong Chanthalangsy, the country's foreign ministry spokesman, told
VNA that 800 birds were destroyed in a 2-mile [3.2km] radius around
the affected village, and that the outbreak is the 6th to strike the
area in the past month.

In mid-February 2008, Laos reported that the H5N1 virus had reemerged
in poultry after about a year's hiatus [see ProMED refs. below].

[The Turkey OIE map showing Ipsala in Edirne, Turkey, which is
referred to in the above report, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6907>.
According to the Turkish notification, the outbreak was recorded in
the village Esetce, district Ipsala, province EDIRNE. The township
Ipsala is situated about 60 km [37.3 miles] south of the city Edirne,
and the village Esetce -- 8 km [5 miles] south-east therefrom, about
15 km [9.3 miles] from the Greek border; see (go to Thrace, zoom in!) at

Is this location significantly distant from the flyway of migrating
birds?! - Mod.AS]
