The Wyoming Game and Fish Department confirmed that a bull elk harvested by a hunter tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Elk Hunt Area 66. The elk was killed northeast of Meeteetse and this is the 1st time CWD has been found in this elk hunt area.

To ensure that hunters are informed, Game and Fish has the practice of announcing when CWD is found in a new hunt area.

Additionally, Game and Fish follows the human health recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control [CDC], which state hunters should strongly consider having their elk, deer and moose tested if harvested in an area where CWD is known to occur, and not consume any animal obviously ill or tests positive for CWD.

Elk Hunt Area 66 is quite close to Elk Hunt Area 48 where CWD was 1st documented last year [2017]. Additionally, Game and Fish has previously confirmed CWD in deer in the deer hunt areas that overlap with this elk hunt area.

A map of CWD endemic areas is available on the Game and Fish website https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Wildlife-in-Wyoming/More-Wildlife/Wildlife-Disease/CWD-in-Wyoming-Wildlife/CWD-Map.

Last year [2017], Game and Fish personnel tested 3351 CWD samples throughout the state, a significant increase from past years, and continues to evaluate the new recommendations for trying to manage the disease.

Please visit the Game and Fish website for more information on chronic wasting disease transmission and regulations on transportation and disposal of carcasses https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Wildlife-in-Wyoming/More-Wildlife/Wildlife-Disease/Chronic-Wasting-Disease.

[Chronic wasting disease has previously been found in deer in hunt area 66, however it has not until now been found in elk. So while this neurological disease has not expanded in a geographical issue, it has claimed another species in this particular area. - Mod.TG
