According to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, the
proliferation of viruses in agriculture and horticulture has been
alarming over past years. In 1939, there were 89 known viruses; in
1991, they were estimated at 700, and in 2005, at 1200.

Last year [2007], Omkar Singh's wheat crop began shrinking in the UP
[Uttar Pradesh] countryside. He lives in Raipur Babu village, 40 km
(25 mi) north of Lucknow [capital of Uttar Pradesh]. Singh's crops
began showing strange signs of poor growth. "We wondered if we hadn't
used the right amount of sulphur or if there'd been a loss of zinc in
our soil. We did everything we could. We finally realised it was a
new virus that had caused knots at the bottom of the stem, causing it
to shrink."

[While there are over 55 viruses known to affect wheat, the symptoms
described above do not seem to match diseases caused by any of them.
Generally, "knots" on lower stems are more often a symptom of
soil-borne fungal pathogens, nematodes, or even due to pest damage.
We would be most grateful for any further information on the wheat
disease that is being reported here as emerging in Uttar Pradesh.
