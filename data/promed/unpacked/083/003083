Burkina Faso: Government Confirms Yellow Fever Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
The government of Burkina Faso stated on Thu 13 May 2004 that 25 suspected
cases of yellow fever had been reported in the southeastern city of
Bobo-Dioulasso and the nearby town of Gaoua, which is close to the border
with Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana and 4 of them had been confirmed. A Ministry
of Health official told IRIN by telephone from the Burkinabe capital
Ouagadougou that 16 blood samples had been collected from the suspected
victims of the mosquito-borne disease. Laboratory tests carried out by the
Pasteur Institute in Dakar Senegal had so far confirmed 4 cases of yellow
fever among them.

However, the official, who asked not to be named, said there was no cause
for alarm. "It is true that just one confirmed case of yellow fever
strictly speaking constitutes an epidemic but there are 4 confirmed cases
and none of those people are dead," he told IRIN. The official said all 4
confirmed cases were from Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso's 2nd largest city,
which has a population of around 400 000. The World Health Organisation
(WHO) confirmed the yellow fever outbreak in Bobo- Dioulasso in a
statement. However, officials from the vaccination section of WHO in
Ouagadougou were not available for comment as they were all on mission
investigating the outbreak.

In its mildest form, yellow fever resembles a bout of influenza, but in the
most serious cases can lead to severe hepatitis, hemorrhagic fever and
death. Up to 20 percent of all cases end in death, though mortality rates
are much higher for children. Outbreaks of yellow fever can give rise to
sudden and severe epidemics, especially in densely populated areas, where
the mortality rate can be as high as 50 percent.

Once contracted there is no treatment for the disease, though a safe and
reliable vaccination has been available for decades. WHO has recommended
that yellow fever be added to the list of child immunisation vaccines in
countries where the disease is endemic. This, they say, would be more
cost-effective than reliance on emergency vaccination programmes. A study
carried out in Nigeria by Cambridge University in Massachusetts, US,
calculated that routine immunisation for yellow fever would cost US$ 0.65
per child, compared to US$ 7.84 per person under an emergency vaccination
programme.

[The 4 confirmed cases of yellow fever originate from Bobo-Dioulasso, the
2nd largest city in Burkina Faso, which has a population of around 400 000.
The threat of an imminent outbreak of urban yellow fever is real,
therefore, notwithstanding the reassuring statement from a local official.
