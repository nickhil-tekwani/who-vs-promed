Seven cases of cholera were confirmed by the National Hygiene Institute in
the jail of El Rodeo II in Guatire [about 50 km east of Caracas --es. This
has required health authorities in the state of Miranda to declare a
epidemiology alert in this central penitentiary to prevent the disease from
affecting the other 600 inmates. The regional epidemiologist, Irene
Engelke, reported that from the
appearance of the first cases, methods to confirm the disease and to
prevent its spread have been implemented. The source of the infection (food
or water) is not yet known, but unhealthy conditions in the prison were
reported. As a preventative measure, they will stop the use of water
supplied by truck from the town of Zamora, as well as consumption of fresh
juices, seafood, fish, and foods that have not been well cooked.
