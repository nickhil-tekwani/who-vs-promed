The northern Philippine province of Pangasinan has been placed under alert
status following an initial outbreak of dengue fever in 2 cities and 2
towns of the province. A report from the Provincial Health Office showed
the disease has killed 5 persons in the cities of Dagupan and San Carlos,
and in the towns of Calasiao and Malasiqui.
Provincial Health Officer Alyle Orchotorena said although the situation has
not yet reached alarming proportion, her office has intensified its
education and information drive, fogging operation and environmental
cleanup. Dengue fever raged in Pangasinan last year.

El Salvador's Health ministry on Wednesday described as "alarming" a high
incidence of dengue fever in the country, where 291 cases of classic dengue
fever and 46 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever have been reported this year
[confirmed by the Health Ministry, and warned that the country stands "on
the verge of an epidemic."
Benjamin Bloom Hospital spokesmen identified [a 7-year-old female as the
latest victim, claimed by hemorrhagic dengue fever Tuesday. Hospital
Director Sergio Parada said that 6 other children are being treated for
hemorrhagic dengue fever at the hospital, raising the total number of cases
to 34 this year in the institution.
A Health ministry statement indicated that 8 of every 10 Salvadoran
households are infested with the dengue-transmitting mosquito, a situation
described as "alarming."
"Only a suspicion of hemorrhagic dengue fever is enough to warrant the
immediate attention of health care workers at the patient's home and
surroundings," as well as other measures to curtail the spread of the
disease, health officials said. Although the cases have been treated at
public and private hospitals nationwide, the Benjamin Bloom Hospital has
dealt with most of the children's cases. Some cases have not been confirmed
by lab tests.
The Health Ministry went on to say that diseases that mimic the symptoms of
dengue fever are also being researched, so samples have been shipped to
labs abroad for consultation. Researchers are waiting for these results.

[We have received other reports of the occurrence of the odd case of
dengue, these in the South Pacific. It is clear that dengue viruses are
prevalent in many areas of the tropical and subtropical world, which is the
reason that ProMED-mail is not at present reporting each case or outbreak
separately. - Mod.CHC
