Nigeria health officials reported 5 new confirmed monkeypox cases in September [2019], as the country continues to report sporadic cases for the past 2 years.

In September [2019], 15 new suspected monkeypox cases were reported from 6 states -- Lagos (5), Rivers (2), Akwa Ibom (3), Zamfara (1), Delta (1), and Imo (2) -- and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT (1).

Of the 15 suspected cases, 5 were confirmed positive for monkeypox in 3 states: Lagos (3), Rivers (1), and Akwa Ibom (1).

Of the suspected cases, 5 tested positive for chickenpox while others are being further evaluated.

No death was recorded in the reporting month.

A total of 81 suspected cases have been reported so far in 2019, of which 39 confirmed cases were recorded in 9 states (Bayelsa, Lagos, Delta, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra, Cross River, and Oyo) and one death.

Monkeypox is a rare disease that occurs throughout remote parts of Central and West Africa, often near tropical rainforests. It is spread through contact with the monkeypox virus from an animal or human (alive or dead) or with materials contaminated with the virus.

Symptoms begin with fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion, and is followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it.

[Sporadic cases of monkeypox [MPX] continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2019), with 39 confirmed cases in 9 states. There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Although a new live, nonreplicating vaccine for the prevention of smallpox and monkeypox disease in adults aged 18 years or older who are at a high risk for smallpox or monkeypox infection has been USA FDA approved, but because cases often occur in remote areas, vaccination of people living in these remote areas for a disease that occurs sporadically would be logistically difficult and costly to administer. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where it occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. - Mod.TY
