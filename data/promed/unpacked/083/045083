The following background information on hantavirus infection in China was
abstracted from the GIDEON database <http://www.cyinfo.com>.
Although [hantavirus-related haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
disease was first described in 1935, outbreaks probably occurred among
Japanese troops in Manchuria in 1932. Most cases occur in the eastern and
northeastern regions. Hantaan virus is endemic to Hubei, Heilongjiang,
Jiangxi, Jilin and Shanxi. 52.2 percent of infections in Hubei are caused by
Hantaan virus, and 31.5 percent by Seoul virus. The overall case-fatality
rate is
2 percent to 10 percent. It is estimated that 2000 to 10 000 died of the
disease each
year. 2925 fatal cases were reported in 1984. 115 985 cases (most in the
northern region, 2561 fatal) were reported in 1986. 910 800 cases were
registered during 1950 to 1997. 1568 cases were reported in Xianju County
(Zhejiang Province) during 1976 to 1997. The local reservoirs are the
striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_) for Hantaan virus; and the rat
(_Rattus norvegicus_) for Seoul virus.

[Hantaan virus and Seoul virus are serologically distinct hantaviruses (i.e.
members of the genus _Hantavirus_) which co-circulate in endemic disease
regions of China. Three genetic subtypes of Hantaan virus have been
described, whereas Seoul virus has exhibited less variability. Seoul virus
probably originated in East Asia, but because of its associated with _Rattus
norvegicus_, is now found world-wide in the environs of sea-ports. - Mod.CP
