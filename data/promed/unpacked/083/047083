An often fatal infectious disease, commonly called swamp cancer, has attacked several local horses this summer [2015], and one affected horse owner is on a mission to get the word out.

Anita Meisen, owner of Dancing Cloud Horse Rescue outside of Ochlocknee, said she walked out to see her horse, Jubal E, on Friday [7 Aug 2015] and was terrified to see a large swollen area on the left side of his face. She thought her beautiful trail horse had been bitten by a snake.

Dr Dale Hodges of Clanton-Malphus-Hodges Veterinary Hospital came right out, but as he examined the beloved equine, he realized this was no snakebite. He thought it might be an abscess, but when he injected it, instead of pus and a little blood, Meisen said nothing came out but little, hard, calcified masses called kunkers. She explained that kunkers are calcified pus and blood vessels. "They came out in big clumps, some as big as a nickel," she said. Hodges then knew the news was not good. He diagnosed Jubal E with pythiosis, an infectious, usually fatal, disease caused by the pathogen _Pythium insidiosum_.

According to the University of Florida Large Animal Hospital, the pathogen thrives in swamps or marshes but can live in any standing water that does not freeze. However, pythiosis can develop despite good management and housing. Horses can get the disease by drinking water with _Pythium insidiosum_ in it or when the pathogen enters a wound that is submerged in water that contains _P. insidiosum_.

The commonest place for a lesion to occur is on the lower limb, but horses can develop lesions in other places on the body. Jubal E's is on his face.

[Pythiosis is an uncommon cutaneous/subcutaneous, gastrointestinal, or multi-systemic disease caused by a water mold. It has been reported in dogs, horses, cats, cattle, humans and a captive zoo bear. [10] Cases have predominantly been documented worldwide in tropical, subtropical and other wet, warm climates. Recent emergence of pythiosis in more temperate regions suggests that the disease is more widespread than previously suspected. Horses are most commonly affected followed by dogs and, rarely, cats.

Pythiosis is caused by the aquatic pathogen_ Pythium insidiosum_ in every reported case of mammalian disease. [10] There are nearly 85 species of _Pythium_, most of which are parasites of plants, fish, and crustaceans. [10] An as yet undetermined species of _Lagenidium_ is responsible for lagenidiosis in dogs. [4] The genus _Lagenidium_ includes more than 50 species of which most are natural parasites of algae, fungi, rotifers, nematodes, crustaceans, _Daphne_, and mosquito larvae. [4] _L. giganteum_, a parasite of mosquito larvae, has been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the United States as a biological control of the adult mosquito population. [4] Both _Pythium_ and _Lagenidium_ species belong to the kingdom stramenopila, phylum oomycota, and class oomycetes. [10] The oomycetes, often referred to as water molds, have many characteristics in common with the fungi but are phylogenetically distinct. [3] Oomycetes differ from true fungi in that they produce motile, flagellate zoospores, have a cell wall that does not contain chitin, and have different metabolic pathways and organelle structure. The lack of sterol components within the plasma membrane of oomycetes is clinically significant since ergosterol is the target molecule for the action of most antifungal drugs. [3]

_Pythium_ sp. and _Lagenidium_ sp. are believed to have life cycles that are similar to that of other oomycetes (Figure 1). [10] When placed in water, oomycete hyphae develop sporangia which eventually form multiple biflagellate zoospores. The zoospores then break through the vesicle wall and swim away and encyst. These zoospores are thought to be the infectious stage and have been shown to display chemotactic behavior toward damaged animal and plant tissues. Oomycetes also have the ability to form resistant spores when ambient conditions do not favor zoospore formation. [10]

The diagnosis of oomycete infections can be difficult due to the clinical and histological similarity between the oomycetes themselves as well as the similarities between oomycotic and zygomycotic infections. [4] Some cases of lagiendiosis have probably been misdiagnosed as pythiosis. Though misdiagnosis of lagenidosis as pythiosis does not have clinical repercussions, misdiagnosis of zygomycosis as oomycosis may lead to inappropriate treatment regimens as zygomycetes are true fungi. Although there are histological differences between _Lagenidium_ sp._, Pythium insidiosum_, and zygomycete organisms, they are not distinct enough for definitive diagnosis. [4] A _P. insidiosum_-specific polyclonal antibody has been developed that does not stain _Lagenidium_ sp. hyphae. The effectiveness of this primary antibody in immunohistochemical staining is currently under investigation. [4]

Currently, the diagnostic test of choice is culture of infected tissue followed by morphologic and molecular identification of the pathogen. Small pieces of tissue are placed on PYG agar and incubated at 37 C [98 F]. Growth should be apparent after 24 hours. Samples that must be shipped should arrive within 48 hours and should be packaged at ambient temperature (organisms may be impossible to culture if the tissue has been refrigerated or frozen). Bacterial contamination often prevents adequate growth of oomycetes. In such instances, antibiotic impregnated agar can prevent bacterial overgrowth. [4] Even under the best of conditions, _Pythium_ sp. is very difficult to grow and even harder to identify because it requires sporulation and identification of the zoospores.

PCR assays are available to detect oomycete DNA sequences in nucleic acid extracted from agar cultures, blood, or tissue biopsies. This technique also can differentiate zygomycosis, pythiosis, and lagenidiosis. [4]

Two ELISA tests are available for detection of anti-_P. insidiosum_ antibodies in animals. Both of these tests are highly specific and sensitive. [4] ELISA also may be useful in monitoring the response to treatment. Elimination of oomycete infection results in a serial decrease in antibody titer if treatment is successful. [5]

The treatment of choice for oomycosis has been aggressive surgical resection. [3,10] Whenever possible, complete amputation of affected limbs may be curative. [2] In cases of advanced gastrointestinal and disseminated disease, total surgical excision may be impossible. In advanced gastrointestinal disease, infection usually involves the extensive portions of the alimentary tract and mesentery. Furthermore, the recurrence rate after surgery also is very high if the affected area is not completely excised. [3,10] Due to possible recurrence, it has been recommended that surgical excision be followed by systemic administration of antifungal drugs. [10] However, antifungal therapy may not be effective because of the lack of ergosterol (the target molecule of antifungal drugs) in the plasma membranes of oomycetes. This probably explains why antifungal chemotherapy alone has shown very little success in treating oomycosis. [5]

Recently, immunotherapy using a newly formulated vaccine has been successful in treating cutaneous pythiosis in horses and dogs. [5] This vaccine has been shown to be effective for both acute and chronic cutaneous pythiosis in the horse. [5,10] In one report, a dog was cured of cutaneous disease with only 2 injections of this vaccine given 2 weeks apart. [5]

For most oomycotic infections the prognosis is guarded to poor regardless of the advances in treatment. The reason is that many dogs have extensive gastrointestinal disease, and many horses have multiple bone lesions at the time of initial presentation. [3,10] Disseminated disease and bone lesions are negative prognosticators in any species. The rate of recurrence after attempted surgical excision has also been a major factor in the failure of treatment.

This disease is not specific to horses. Below is information that focuses on horses but is not as informative about testing and specific treatments.

Pythiosis -- which especially in horses is also known as swamp cancer, leeches, or kunkers -- is caused by _Pythium insidiosum_, a one-celled organism that is similar to fungi but classified into the kingdom Protista.

Pythiosis in horses usually occurs as a serious skin infection. The skin develops raised, ulcerated lesions that ooze serum. Most affected horses are extremely itchy at the site of infection and may self-traumatize by vigorously scratching or biting at the lesions. Pythiosis may also involve the horse's bone or intestine. Important rule-outs for pythiosis include proud flesh (exuberant growth of granulation tissue), summer sores (habronemiasis), fungal infections, or cancer. Pythiosis in horses usually occurs as a serious skin infection.

In nature, pythium organisms live in water and parasitize plants. Animals are believed to become infected when they enter _P. insidiosum_-infested water with incised or damaged skin. Pythiosis most commonly occurs in warmer areas of the world, including the Gulf Coast of the United States. However, it is increasingly diagnosed outside of its expected range.

The diagnosis of pythiosis is not always straightforward because the organisms can be difficult to detect and identify. Pythium organisms can sometimes be seen when biopsies are examined with special stains using a microscope or cultured from biopsy tissue. There are also specialized tests to detect antibodies against _P. insidiosum_ or its DNA.

Treatment of pythiosis can be very difficult, and severe lesions have a guarded prognosis. Lesions can be large and often must be surgically debulked before specific treatment begins. Immunotherapy (vaccination) improves recovery, especially in cases that are diagnosed early. Antifungal drugs, such as potassium iodide and amphotericin B, can be effective in some cases.

Pythiosis is an uncommon diagnosis, and the best outcome depends on early recognition of infection. Pythiosis should be ruled out as the cause of proliferative skin lesions in geographic areas where it often occurs, especially in cases that do not respond to conventional therapy for commoner conditions.

Cutaneous pythiosis is an infectious disease caused by the pathogen _Pythium insidiosum_, which leads to granulating skin lesions. The pathogen thrives in swamps or marshes but can live in any body of water that does not freeze. However, pythiosis can develop despite good management and housing.
