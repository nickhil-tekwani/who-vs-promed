Health officials in South Sudan's Northern Bahr el Ghazal State say that about 16 children under the age of 5 [years old] have died of meningitis across the state in the last 2 weeks.

Aleu Pioth Akot, the state ministry Director-General told Radio Tamazuj that despite efforts by the health ministry, the disease has continued to spread in the state. He said the cases were reported between mid-April and now. "We have 16 death cases out of 155, and the targeted group is children of one year and under five years of age. Some cases happened in the counties and others occurred in Aweil town," said Pioth.

He revealed that the government and its partners have taken samples for investigations to verify the type of meningitis before the official declaration of a meningitis outbreak in the state. "They died of meningitis but there is no clear verification on what type of meningitis has killed this big number. The samples are taken from here to South Africa via Juba [the capital of South Sudan], people are now working but until now there is no declaration of an outbreak. We are just waiting for them," he explained.

Aweil West County health director Dr Alich Wol said his office has recently recorded 2 cases of meningitis. "In Aweil West, we have already reported to the state ministry of health through the emergency team and the meningitis cases are not so much. There was one case in Udhum and the other in Marial Baai," Dr. Wol pointed out.

For his part, Wek Garang, the Executive Director of the Peace Culture Association (PCA) has urged the government to take a lead in fighting the disease and said the government must provide healthcare to its people. "For the government, it is among the duties the government implements. If a disease emerges, the government has to provide health services. It is a national duty and a responsibility of the government," he added.

According to the World Health Organisation, meningitis is a dangerous inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, predominantly caused by infection with bacteria and viruses. Meningitis that is caused by bacterial infection tends to be the most serious - leading to around 250 000 deaths a year - and can cause fast-spreading epidemics. It kills 1 in 10 of those infected -- mostly children and young people -- and leaves 1 in 5 with a long-lasting disability, such as seizures, hearing and vision loss, neurological damage, and cognitive impairment.

[South Sudan is divided into 3 regions, 10 states, 2 administrative areas, and one area with special administrative status (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan#States), which are further divided into 79 counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_South_Sudan). Juba is the capital and largest city of South Sudan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juba). Northern Bahr el Ghazal is a state in the Bahr el Ghazal region of northwestern South Sudan. This state borders East Darfur in Sudan to the north; Aweil is the capital of Northern Bahr el Ghazal state. Aweil West County is an administrative area in Northern Bahr el Ghazal state (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aweil_West_County). A map showing the location of counties in Northern Bahr el Ghazal state can be found at (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_South_Sudan).

Cases of meningitis are occurring in the town of Aweil and in the surrounding countryside, including Aweil West County. There are a total of 155 cases of meningitis, including 16 deaths, in children aged 1 to 5 years old, since mid-April 2022. The cause of the meningitis is still under investigation, awaiting laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis and its microbial etiology. More information from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak would be appreciated.

South Sudan is one of the countries in the African "meningitis belt" that stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east. This region has been plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis. The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to June). Larger outbreaks occur every 5-12 years (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis have ranged from 100 to 800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as high as 1000 per 100 000 (http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ms03017).

However, the epidemiology of meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed after preventive mass vaccination of the population with conjugate meningococcal meningitis serogroup A vaccine (MenA) was introduced in 2010. Prevention consisted of vaccinating all those aged one to 29 years in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of November 2017, more than 280 million people have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Subsequently, serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species. Recent epidemics have been primarily due to serogroups C and W. Serogroup X outbreaks have also been previously reported in this region (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html).

During 2016, preventive campaigns with MenA were conducted for the first time in South Sudan, including Northern Bahr el Ghazal state (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/254901/1/WER9213.pdf?ua=1). - Mod.ML
