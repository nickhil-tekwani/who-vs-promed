San Diego County residents now have one more reason to find and dump out standing water in and around their homes to fight mosquitoes.

County environmental health officials said they've found a new type of invasive, aggressive, day-biting mosquito in La Mesa - the Australian backyard mosquito, _Aedes notoscriptus_, also known as the "Aussie Mozzie."

County officials said they believe the mosquito is more nuisance than human health risk. However, they said it is aggressive and prefers to live and breed near people; in yards and even inside homes.

"One of the best things you can do to protect yourself from mosquitoes is to get rid of all standing water so they can't lay eggs and breed near you," said Chris Conlan, a supervising vector ecologist with the County's Vector Control Program. "That means dumping water out of the saucers under flowerpots and toys laying in the yard. These mosquitoes are called the 'backyard mosquito' for a reason."

County Vector Control found 3 adult female Australian backyard mosquitoes last week in a trap they placed in La Mesa in response to a complaint about mosquito bites. The mosquito had previously been found in Los Angeles about 3 years ago.

_Aedes notoscriptus_ is the 3rd type of invasive _Aedes_ mosquito that has been found in San Diego County in the last 4 years. _Aedes aegypti_, the yellow fever mosquito that originated in Africa, were found here in 2014. _Aedes albopictus_, the Asian tiger mosquito native to tropical forests of southeast Asia, was found here in 2015.

_Aedes notoscriptus_ looks similar to the other 2 invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes; small to mid-sized, with pale markings and banded legs, and in some cases, a hairy back.

All 3 of the invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes like to live near people and, unlike San Diego County's native mosquitoes, like to bite during daylight hours. All 3 can potentially transmit different diseases to people -- but only if they 1st bite another person or animal carrying a disease they can spread.

In laboratory studies, _Aedes notoscriptus_ has been shown to be capable of transmitting Murray Valley encephalitis, Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus if they 1st bite an infected host, but those diseases have been limited to Australia and surrounding areas.

However, like the _Aedes aegypti_, the Aussie Mozzie is also known to transmit dog heartworm to dogs and cats if it bites an infected animal and then bites pets.

Both the American Veterinary Medical Association and American Heartworm Society recommend pet owners have veterinarians test and prescribe heartworm preventives to protect pets. Heartworm preventives are available only by prescription from veterinarians.

County of San Diego officials, meanwhile, said county residents could protect themselves and their pets from invasive _Aedes_ mosquitoes by remembering to follow the County's "Prevent, Protect, Report" guidelines.

Prevent Mosquito Breeding
Dump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as unused swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.

Protect Yourself from Mosquito Bites
Protect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.

Report Possible Mosquito Activity
Report increased mosquito activity, or neglected, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds -- dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls -- to environmental health's Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov. Also report if you are being bitten by mosquitoes during daylight hours, or if you find mosquitoes that match the description of _Aedes_ mosquitoes by contacting the Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888.

[It is not surprising that _Aedes notoscriptus_ has been found in San Diego county following the 1st detection of this mosquito in Los Angeles county in 2015. A 2015 ecological study identified large areas in Southern California and limited areas in Nevada and Baja California Norte state, Mexico, that have suitable conditions for this mosquito (see reference below). Laboratory experiments indicate that _Aedes notoscriptus_ is not a vector for dengue or Zika viruses, although it can transmit Murray Valley encephalitis, Barmah Forest and Ross River viruses that are found in Australia. As the above report and published studies indicate, this mosquito can transmit canine heartworm (_Dirofilaria immitis_), that can cause serious disease in canids. Since dogs are in and around houses where these mosquitoes breed, that underscores the importance of maintaining dogs on preventive heartworm medication.
