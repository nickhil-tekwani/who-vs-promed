[This is a fuller account of research previously reported in ProMED-mail as: Circovirus - Viet Nam: acute CNS 20130618.1780170, and which further substantiates the authors' belief that a novel circovirus (CyCV-VN) may be responsible for some cases of acute CNS infection in humans. The nomenclature is somewhat confusing. The virus associated with the presumptive disease belongs to the species _Cyclovirus_, which is a member of the family _Circoviridae_. - Mod.CP]

Abstract
--------
Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, but the etiology remains unknown in a large proportion of cases. We identified and characterized the full genome of a novel cyclovirus (tentatively named cyclovirus-Vietnam [CyCV-VN]) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens of 2 Vietnamese patients with CNS infections of unknown etiology. CyCV-VN was subsequently detected in 4 percent of 642 CSF specimens from Vietnamese patients with suspected CNS infections and none of 122 CSFs from patients with noninfectious neurological disorders. Detection rates were similar in patients with CNS infections of unknown etiology and those in whom other pathogens were detected. A similar detection rate in feces from healthy children suggested food-borne or orofecal transmission routes, while high detection rates in feces from pigs and poultry (average, 58 percent) suggested the existence of animal reservoirs for such transmission. Further research is needed to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this novel, potentially zoonotic virus.

Importance
----------
Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, but the etiology frequently remains unknown, which hampers development of therapeutic or preventive strategies. Hence, identification of novel pathogens is essential and is facilitated by current next-generation sequencing-based methods. Using such technology, we identified and characterized the full genome of a novel cyclovirus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from two Vietnamese patients with CNS infections of unknown etiology, which was subsequently detected in none of 122 CSF specimens from patients with noninfectious neurological disorders but 4 percent of 642 CSF specimens from Vietnamese patients with suspected or confirmed CNS infections. Similar detection rates in feces from healthy children suggested food-borne or orofecal transmission routes, while frequent detection in feces from Vietnamese pigs and poultry (average, 58 percent) suggested the existence of animal
reservoirs for such transmission. Further studies are needed to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this novel, potentially zoonotic virus.

Introduction
---------------
Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality in children and adults, especially in tropical regions. While the causative microorganisms include a wide variety of bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and particularly viral pathogens, the majority of cases remain undiagnosed, despite extensive diagnostic efforts. The identification of previously unknown pathogens in patients with acute CNS infections remains essential to improve prevention and clinical management of this frequently devastating syndrome. The discovery of such novel pathogens is facilitated by the availability of sensitive sequence-independent molecular methods.

Using a combination of an amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based virus discovery assay (VIDISCA) and next-generation sequencing, we set out to look for nucleic acid sequences of potential novel pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from Vietnamese adults and children with acute CNS infections of unknown etiology. Here we report the identification and full genome characterization of a novel virus belonging to the recently proposed genus _Cyclovirus_ in the family _Circoviridae_. In addition, we report the results of initial studies to explore the pathogenic potential of this virus in humans as well as the existence of possible animal reservoirs for zoonotic transmission.

Results
-------
The cyclovirus species of the completed genome was tentatively named cyclovirus-Vietnam (CyCV-VN). The single-stranded circular DNA genome consisted of 1856 bp and revealed a genomic structure characteristic of the genera _Circovirus_ and _Cyclovirus_ in the family _Circoviridae_ with the typical feature of 2 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 2 major proteins, the replication-associated (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, arranged in opposite directions.

Discussion
----------
The availability of highly sensitive molecular methods such as PCR and sequence-independent techniques based on next generation sequencing technology allows enhanced detection of (novel and unknown) pathogens in clinical specimens, which is essential to guide prevention strategies, aid clinical management, and identify the sources of outbreaks. Using a sequence-independent virus discovery assay, VIDISCA-454, we identified a cycloviral sequence in the CSF of patients with acute encephalitis with unknown etiology. Whole-genome characterization indicated that the sequence represented a novel species within the genus _Cyclovirus_ of the family _Circoviridae_ that we tentatively named CyCV-VN.

The _Circoviridae_ is a family of non-enveloped viruses containing a circular single-stranded DNA genome and is subdivided into 2 genera, _Circovirus_ and _Gyrovirus_, both of which have been associated only with disease in animals, including birds and pigs. Avian circoviruses have been associated with beak abnormalities, lethargy, and anorexia in pigeons and production losses and mortality in geese, and porcine circovirus 2 causes respiratory and enteric diseases, dermatitis, and reproductive problems in pigs, resulting in economic losses in the pork industry. Recently, novel viruses belonging to the family _Circoviridae_ have been identified which have been proposed to represent a novel genus, _Cyclovirus_. In addition to being found in farm animals (such as sheep and bovines), chimpanzees, bats, cockroaches, and dragonflies, cycloviruses have been detected in the blood of patients with febrile illness, stool samples of children with acute flaccid paralysis, and skin swabs and feces of healthy adults and children, respectively. However, a causal link between cycloviruses and human or animal disease has not been proven.

After initial discovery and characterization, we detected CyCV-VN by PCR in a total of 12 CSFs from 273 patients with acute encephalitis of unknown etiology. We also tested the CSF from patients with other laboratory-confirmed CNS infections and found a detection rate similar to that in patients with unknown etiology (16/369; 4.3 percent). In contrast, CyCV-VN DNA was not detected in 122 CSF specimens from patients with noninfectious CNS conditions (P = 0.015). However, it should be noted that 88 percent of 122 CSF samples from patients without CNS infections were collected over a short period of time (August to October 2011), possibly introducing bias.

The detection of CyCV-VN in CSF of patients with CNS infections, both with known and with unknown etiology, but not in CSF from patients with noninfectious CNS disorders may imply a pathogenic role of CyCV-VN, either as a single agent or as a coinfecting agent, such as by enhancing severity of disease or facilitating entry of other pathogens into the CNS compartment. While the mortality of CyCV-VN-infected patients seemed relatively low, comparison of clinical severities and outcomes between CyCV-VN patients with and without coinfection with other pathogens could not be done reliably because of incomplete data collection at discharge and the small numbers of patients (Table 2 -- available at the source URL above).

CyCV-VN was detected in patients of all ages, from less than 1 year to over 60 years, from 7 different provinces in southern and central Viet Nam over a 10-year period from 1999 to 2009. This suggests that this virus can affect persons of all ages, has a broad geographic distribution in Viet Nam, and did not emerge very recently.

No CyCV-VN DNA was found in 3 available parallel sera of CSF-positive patients, suggesting that the detection of CyCV-VN DNA in CSF does not reflect ongoing viremia with spillover into the CSF or blood contamination of CSF after possible traumatic lumbar puncture. However, the possibility that past viremia was responsible for CNS entry cannot be excluded. The fact that CyCV-VN was not detected in 90 randomly selected blood from Vietnamese subjects renders it unlikely that cyclovirus is a ubiquitous commensal virus, like for instance Torque Teno virus (TTV), which is asymptomatically present in blood of 7 to 78 percent of people, with occasional detection in CSF.

CyCV-VN DNA was also detected in throat and rectal swabs of CSF-positive patients as well as in fecal specimens of healthy children. This suggests a possible food-borne or fecal-oral transmission route for infection, although detection in feces of healthy children may also merely reflect consumption of CyCV-VN infected food rather than true infection. To explore the existence of possible animal reservoirs of CyCV-VN for such transmission, we tested fecal samples from animals in Dong Thap Province, where the index patient lived, and found remarkably high detection rates in fecal samples collected from pigs, ducks, and chickens, ranging from 42 to 100 percent. Sequence identities between CyCV-VN strains in humans and animals were high (around 98 percent) which may suggest interspecies transmission between animals and possibly from animals to humans.

It should be noted that the PCR screening method was designed for specific detection of only CyCV-VN and closely related viruses and that complete or partial genomic sequences were not obtained in all CyCV-VN PCR-positive samples; hence, the possibility exists that genetically diverse, more distantly related CyCV species are cocirculating in Viet Nam. Future research is needed to investigate this possibility and to determine whether human infections are restricted to CyCV-VN species.

While the discovery of CyCV-VN and its frequent detection in the usually sterile CSF compartment are remarkable in themselves, the results of the present study should be interpreted with caution, because the mere detection of a novel virus in clinical specimens of patients with disease does not prove a causative role. This is illustrated by the recent discovery and subsequent "dediscovery" of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus in patients with prostate cancer and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, which attracted much attention among scientists, the media, and patient groups and required stringent follow-up studies to show the absence of a link between the virus and the disease or syndrome. According to criteria recently proposed by Lipkin, our findings only point to a possible causal relationship at present. In order to detect a more definitive causal link between infection with CyCV-VN and CNS disease, studies to determine whether CyCV-VN fulfills Koch's postulates or adapted versions of these are necessary. For these, efforts to isolate the virus in cell culture or animal models and the detection of a specific immune response to CyCV-VN are imperative and ongoing.

[As admitted above the identification of cyclovirus-Vietnam (CyCV-VN) and its frequent detection in the usually sterile CSF compartment are remarkable in themselves, they do not establish unequivocally a role for this virus in the causation of acute central nervous system disease in humans. However the authors have amassed a considerable amount of information in support of their contention. Viruses classified in the family _Circoviridae_ are widely distributed and common in non-human animals and birds. The discovery of a virus of this type in the CNS of humans in Viet Nam is in itself a provocative finding and likely to stimulate further investigations elsewhere. - Mod.CP
