The patient is receiving treatment at the Shenzhen No. 3 People's Hospital and is in a critical condition. So far, Guangdong has confirmed 6 human H7N9 cases since [10 Aug 2013], with 2 in Dongguan, 2 in Yangjiang, one in Huizhou, and one in Shenzhen.

[The WHO update does not include the case of H7N9 influenza confirmed by the Chinese authorities in Guangdong Province on Wednesday [18 Dec 2013], which raised the total of H7N9 cases in the province to 5 since August [2013]. This new patient was reported to be a 62 year old resident of Yangjiang City, according to the provincial health authority. See ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (159): China (GD) H7N9, update 20131218.2123627.

The number of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus in South China is continuing to increase (the new case described above, [2], is the 6th since August 2013) and a mini epidemic is developing. So far there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission and it is likely that infected poultry are the source of the outbreak. - Mod.CP
