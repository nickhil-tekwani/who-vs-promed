Countries re-think swine flu vaccine orders
-------------------------------------------
The United States said on Monday [11 Jan 2010] it had cut in half its
order for influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine from
Australia's CSL Ltd, but said it is not certain how far orders from
other suppliers will be trimmed. While U.S. officials are still
calculating how much swine flu vaccine they will need, it is becoming
increasingly clear that the United States will not need all 251
million doses it ordered from 5 companies. CSL Ltd said the U.S.
government was halving its order for [pandemic] H1N1 vaccines, partly
because the company had diverted some of its early output to the
Australian government and would not be able to deliver its full USD
180 million U.S. contract.

Several other governments have started to cut orders for [pandemic]
H1N1 vaccines because the pandemic has not turned out to be as deadly
as originally feared and most people need only one dose, not 2, to be
fully protected.

Original orders for flu vaccine were placed in May, June and July
[2009], when it was not known what dose would be needed and it was not
clear how severe the pandemic would be. Different manufacturers have
different contracts with governments. Some contain break clauses
allowing customers to reduce the size of orders. Germany's Bild
newspaper reported that the German government had agreed to cut its
vaccine order with GlaxoSmithKline Plc by one-3rd. The newspaper said
the agreement would save states about 133 million euros (USD 193
million). On Friday [8 Jan 2010], Britain said it was in talks with
Glaxo about reducing supplies. Sanofi-Aventis, the largest supplier of
flu vaccine to the U.S. market, said it was meeting all its U.S.
contracts for sales of swine flu vaccine.

Bill Hall, a spokesman for the U.S. Health and Human Services
Department, said U.S. officials were talking with companies about how
much to cut orders. "All the contracts that were put in place were
designed to be flexible," Hall said in a telephone interview." "There
is a balancing act to ensuring we have enough vaccine for the
population to meet the demand." The United States has received 136
million doses of [pandemic] H1N1 vaccine from its 5 suppliers -- CSL,
Glaxo, Sanofi, AstraZeneca unit MedImmune and Novartis, and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 60 million
people have been vaccinated.

While the pandemic is slowing down in North America, the World Health
Organization said on Monday [11 Jan 2010] the virus was still active
in parts of central, eastern and southeastern Europe, North Africa and
South Asia. Governments are torn between trying to encourage companies
to make influenza vaccine and wasting money on doses that are never
given. But bulk antigen -- the vaccine before it is put into a syringe
-- can be stored and might be used in next year's seasonal vaccine.

The U.S. government was still promoting vaccination, reminding people
that influenza is unpredictable and that [pandemic] H1N1 could come
back in a 3rd wave. One potentially large market for the vaccine is
children. Children under 10 need 2 doses of vaccine to be fully
protected and some U.S. school districts were planning more
vaccination clinics this week to get children a 2nd dose. Retailers
such as Wal-Mart, drug stores and supermarkets were also offering
[pandemic] H1N1 vaccine clinics.

Talks to offload swine flu vaccine under way
--------------------------------------------
The UK government is making plans to offload millions of doses of
swine flu vaccine [pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus vaccine] amid
predictions a "3rd wave" of the pandemic is unlikely to happen.
Officials are in discussion with manufacturer GSK over contracts for
remaining doses purchased by the UK. Options include selling surplus
vaccine and donating it to poorer countries but a stockpile will
remain in place. Cases of swine flu have now dropped dramatically to
well below what is usually seen in winter flu outbreaks. Last week
France announced it was selling millions of doses of swine flu vaccine
after finding they had more than enough to cope with the outbreak.

The UK bought 60 million doses of swine flu vaccine from GSK and 30
million from Baxter but the smaller contract had a break clause should
the doses not be needed. To date 23.9 million doses of GSK vaccine
have been delivered for immunisation of priority groups in the UK as
well as 5 million Baxter vaccines. An official figure for the cost of
the vaccine to the UK has never been given but it is likely to run
into hundreds of millions. In addition to selling or donating vaccine,
another option under consideration is to keep supplies of the vaccine
adjuvant, the booster chemical which is produced separately from the
vaccine, to use in future pandemics. It has a shelf life of 5 years.

Government immunisation lead Professor David Salisbury said: "We are
in discussion with GSK about future supplies of the vaccine. "We have
to keep a stockpile for ourselves anyway because we don't know what's
going to happen in 2010. "If there was a resurgence we would look very
foolish if we had disposed of a valuable stockpile."

He added that it remains important for high-risk groups, such as those
with underlying illness and the under-5s to be immunised as they are
more likely to have severe complications. Michael Summers, vice chair
of the Patient's Association, said it would have been a "dereliction
of duty" if the government had not ordered enough vaccine to cover
everyone. But he added there were "lessons to be learnt" about
negotiating contracts of this size.

Around a 3rd of those in initial priority groups -- including those
with underlying health problems -- have had the swine flu vaccine.
Roughly one in 5 pregnant women have been immunised. Among health care
workers, 37 percent have had the vaccine. So far 86 000 under-5s have
been vaccinated. This could partly be due to the cold weather but the
reason is not yet entirely clear. Since swine flu was 1st reported in
April 2009 there have been 360 deaths across the UK -- 251 in England,
28 in Wales, 64 in Scotland and 17 in Northern Ireland -- mostly in
people with underlying health conditions.

Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said they would be
calculating the economic costs of the pandemic at a later date. "We're
in the 21st century and people do not need to die from vaccine
preventable illnesses. We want to prevent deaths, people going to
hospital and that's generally been the approach we have taken."
