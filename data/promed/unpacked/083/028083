At least 99 cases of measles were diagnosed in the districts of Kwanhama,
Cahama, and Coroca in the southern province of Cunene between the 2nd
fortnight of July 2009 and 23 Aug 2009. The information was supplied to
Angop on Monday [24 Aug 2009] by the supervisor of the epidemiological
surveillance programme, Adelina Francisca.

According to her, 2 children died of measles in Cahama district, and the
disease is spreading to Kwanhama, having affected children aged from 9
months to 15 years. In order to reverse the situation, Adelina Francisca
said, the health sector is holding awareness campaigns to inform the
communities about the symptoms and care to better prevent the disease.
According to Francisca, the symptoms of measles are high temperature, skin
eruptions, pimples, conjunctivitis, eye ache, cough, and flu. She appealed
to child guardians to take their kids to health centres for vaccination
against the disease.

No cases of measles were recorded in Cunene province in 2008.

[This outbreak seems large enough to indicate a serious breakdown in
vaccination coverage in southern Angola.
