South Carolina: Outbreak of Eastern Equine Encephalitis
-------------------------------------------------------
Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] killed 4 horses in Berkeley County during
the past 2 weeks, Clemson University tests have shown. People feared that it
was an outbreak of the West Nile virus infection. It turns out that the
animals were infected with a virus that is more lethal for humans and animals
than West Nile virus. Along with the Berkeley County horses, a donkey in
Dorchester County and a horse in Georgetown County have had positive results
for "triple E." A 7th South Carolina case has been confirmed, but details
were not immediately available.
EEE kills more than 90 percent of horses that contract the disease. West Nile
infection kills 35 percent of infected horses, said Dr. Venaye P. Reece,
Clemson's equine programs coordinator and the state animal emergency response
coordinator.
EEE kills half of the humans who contract it, said Dr. Robert Ball,
infectious disease epidemiologist with the South Carolina Department of
Health and Environmental Control. "This is why it is very serious," Ball
said. "It's an awful disease to treat," said Ball, recalling a patient he saw
while he was in private practice in Charleston. The patient survived but
could not think straight, could not return to work, had difficulty walking
and suffered weakness. There is no treatment for people or horses other than
supportive care. A vaccine protects horses but [is not approved for use in]
people, who do not catch the virus as often as horses do. Nationwide, 182
human cases, including 8 in South Carolina, have been confirmed since
1964, Ball said.
Reece said EEE runs in 10-year cycles, with the last peak in 1991. "We are
due one of those spike years," she said. [South Carolina recorded equine
cases in 2000 -- see ref. below. - Mod.JW]
Like West Nile virus, mosquitoes pick up the EEE virus from infected birds
and can spread it through bites to humans, horses, dogs and pigs. With the
drought broken, more mosquitoes are breeding. Florida and Georgia also are
reporting unusually high numbers of EEE cases this year [see references
below].

[EEE virus is endemic in North America along the Eastern seaboard and Gulf
coast. EEE virus is classified in the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family
_Togaviridae_, whereas West Nile virus is classified in the genus
_Flavivirus_ of the family _Flaviviridae_. EEE is transmitted to horses
predominantly from infected asymptomatic wild birds via _Aedes spp._
mosquitoes, although other mosquito species have been implicated in some
outbreaks. Although horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for
EEE virus, some horses develop viremia [blood] levels high enough to transmit
virus to mosquitoes that feed on them. The mechanism of over-wintering of EEE
virus is unknown. The case-fatality for EEE virus is 50-90 percent in horses,
hence preventative vaccination for them is advisable. - Mod.TG]
