New almond disease can be devastating
--------------------------------------
Almond growers, particularly those who farm the Fritz variety, should be on the lookout for a new disease found in California [see comment below].

Roger Duncan, University of California [UC], reports that bacterial spot can be devastating, but there is a lot that is yet to be learned. "Although we will be implementing some field trials this year [2014], all of the information we currently have on control is from Australia where this disease has eliminated the Fritz variety in that country."

So far the disease has only been found in 2 "hot spots," said Duncan. The most severely affected area was in the Manteca/Ripon/Escalon area, the 2nd was in the Delhi/Ballico area.

[Bacterial spot caused by _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ is a serious disease of peach, nectarine, apricot, almond and plum. The pathogen was described for the first time on plum in the US in 1903. It was subsequently introduced into Europe where it has been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Symptoms may include dark spots or watery lesions on fruits and leaves, premature leaf drop, cankers, and tip necrosis on young twigs. The disease can severely reduce tree vigour by defoliation, and it reduces yield and quality of harvested fruit. Infection occurs via leaf scars in autumn, and bacteria start to multiply when conditions become favourable.

Bacterial exudate from cankers and lesions is spread by mechanical means (including insect activity) and water. Disease management may include agrochemicals (for example, copper or antibiotic sprays), reduction of available inoculum by orchard sanitation, and use of crop cultivars with resistance, or at least reduced susceptibility, to the disease.

In California, bacterial spot is also found on other stone fruit and was apparently first identified on almond in 2006 (see link below).
