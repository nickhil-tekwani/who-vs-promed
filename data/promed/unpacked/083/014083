[For ease of retrieval of archived material, variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is abbreviated both as CJD (new var.) and
vCJD in ProMED-mail]
New case of variant CJD associated with blood transfusion
---------------------------------------------------
A new case of variant-CJD associated with a blood transfusion has
recently been diagnosed. The patient developed symptoms of vCJD about
8 years after receiving a blood transfusion from a donor who
developed symptoms of vCJD about 20 months after donating this blood.
The patient is still alive and is under the care of doctors at the
National Prion Clinic.
This 3rd occurrence of vCJD infection associated with blood
transfusion is further evidence that vCJD can be transmitted between
humans by blood transfusion. All 3 cases to date relate to the
transfusion of blood components and not treatment with plasma
products.
The patient is one of a small number (less than 30) of living
individuals who are known to have received a blood transfusion in the
UK from a donor who later developed vCJD. All these individuals have
previously been informed of their potential exposure to vCJD and
asked to take certain precautions to reduce the chance of passing on
vCJD on to other people via healthcare procedures, such as surgery.
Professor Peter Borriello, Director of the HPA's Centre for
Infections said, "The occurrence of a 3rd case of vCJD infection in a
small group of patients like this suggests that blood transfusion
from an infected donor may be a relatively efficient mechanism for
the transmission of vCJD, although much still remains unknown. This
underlines the importance of the existing precautions that have been
introduced to reduce the risk of transmitting vCJD infection through
blood transfusion."
"We have been in contact with the doctors caring for the other
patients who have been exposed to blood transfusion from donors who
later developed vCJD. This is to ensure that these patients are
informed of this new development and have access to the latest
information and to specialist advice about their situation."
Dr Angela Robinson, Medical Director of NHS Blood and Transplant
said, "Our thoughts go out to the patient[s] and their family. Our
prime concern is always the safety of patients through maintaining
the quality of blood and we have introduced a range of precautionary
measures against the risk of vCJD. Blood transfusion is often a
life-saving treatment and the benefit of receiving a blood
transfusion when needed far outweighs any possible risks"
vCJD is a rare disease, and only less than 2 percent of the 160 vCJD
cases to date in the UK have been associated with blood transfusion.
Notes
-----
1. 'Blood Transfusion' means transfusion with labile blood components
(e.g. red cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma). This latest case
(and the previous 2 referred to) relate to transfusion of blood
components and not treatment with plasma products (i.e. products that
are manufactured from plasma). To date, no case of vCJD has been
associated with treatment with plasma-products (e.g. clotting factors
used to treat individuals with bleeding disorders such as
haemophilia).
2. This 3rd case has been classified by the National CJD Surveillance
Unit (<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk> ) as a 'probable' case of vCJD. Of
the 154 vCJD cases that have died, all 110 that have undergone
post-mortem (44 have not) have been 'confirmed' by neuropathological
examination (examination of brain tissue).
3. The 1st clinical case of vCJD associated with transfusion was
identified in December 2003. A case of vCJD 'infection' associated
with transfusion was identified a few months later. (The patient had
no symptoms but evidence of infection --abnormal prion proteins --
was identified in a post mortem investigation. The individual died
from causes unrelated to vCJD.)
4. Following the 1st case of vCJD associated with a blood transfusion
in 2003, the Department of Health asked all recipients of blood
transfusions not to donate blood as a precautionary measure to
protect the blood supply from vCJD.
5. Patients who have received blood transfusion (i.e. blood
components) and certain patients who have received plasma products
made from blood donated by a donor who later developed vCJD are
informed that they are considered to be 'at risk for public health
purposes' and are asked to take the following precautions to reduce
the chance of passing on vCJD to other people: Not to donate blood,
tissues or organs and: To inform their healthcare providers of their
'at-risk' status so that special procedures may be arranged for
certain instruments used in their healthcare
6. A range of measures have been put in place by the Department of
Health to minimise the possible risk of VCJD being passed through
blood. [These detailed measures are omitted here, and can be accessed
at

- Mod.CP]
7. The likelihood of a person who may be infected with vCJD going on
to develop symptoms of the disease is uncertain, and may depend on
individual susceptibility. It is possible that infected individuals
may never develop symptoms.

A new case of probable variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has
recently been diagnosed in a patient in the United Kingdom (UK) who
received a blood transfusion from a donor who later developed vCJD
[1]. This patient, who is still alive and is under the care of
doctors at the National Prion Clinic, is the 3rd case of vCJD
infection in the UK associated with transfusion [2].
The 1st case of vCJD disease associated with blood transfusion was
identified in December 2003 [3]. This patient developed vCJD 6.5
years after receiving a transfusion of red blood cells donated by an
individual who developed symptoms of vCJD 3.5 years after donation
[4].
Another case of vCJD 'infection' was identified a few months later in
a recipient of red blood cells from a donor who developed symptoms of
vCJD 18 months after the donation [5]. This second patient died from
causes unrelated to vCJD 5 years after transfusion. Postmortem
investigations found abnormal prion protein in the spleen and a
cervical lymph node, but not in the brain, and no pathological
features of vCJD were found [6].
The most recent patient developed vCJD almost 8 years after receiving
a transfusion of red blood cells from a donor who developed vCJD
about 20 months after donating this blood [1]. Each of the 3 infected
recipients received blood from different donors.
To date, 160 cases of vCJD have been identified in the UK. Of these,
23 are known to have donated blood before the diagnosis of vCJD. A
collaborative study (the Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology Review)
between the National Blood Services, the National CJD Surveillance
Unit and the Office for National Statistics has been conducted since
1997 to collect evidence about transmission of CJD or vCJD via the
blood supply [7]. Blood donations have been traced for 18 of the 23
known donors, and 66 recipients of these vCJD-implicated blood
donations have been identified. 40 of these 66 recipients have died,
including the 2 previous patients with probable
transfusion-associated vCJD [4,6]. The small group of living
recipients of vCJD-implicated blood transfusion have been informed of
their potential exposure to vCJD by blood transfusion. Some were
contacted in late 2003 and early 2004, and some in 2005. They were
asked to take certain precautions to reduce the risk of onward
person-to-p!
erson transmission of vCJD during medical procedures.
All 3 infected recipients identified to date received
non-leucodepleted red blood cells. Since October 1999, leucocytes
have been removed from all blood used for transfusion in the UK. The
effect of leucodepletion on the reduction of the risk of transmission
of vCJD from an infected donor is uncertain.
The risk of vCJD infectivity in blood has also resulted in certain
other groups of individuals being categorised as 'at risk of vCJD for
public health purposes'. These groups have been informed and asked to
take public health precautions. The groups include certain recipients
of plasma products [8], individuals who have donated blood to
patients who developed vCJD [9] and certain recipients of blood from
donors to patients who developed vCJD [10]. To date, there have been
no vCJD cases associated with receipt of plasma products, or in these
other groups of individuals that have been categorised as 'at risk'.
This 3rd case of vCJD infection associated with blood transfusion
provides further evidence that vCJD can be transmitted between humans
by blood transfusion, although much remains unknown. This reinforces
the importance of the existing precautions that have been introduced
to reduce the risk of transmission of vCJD infection by blood and
blood products [11].
Numbers of vCJD cases countries other than the UK remain small: by
January 2006, there had been 15 cases reported in France, 4 in
Ireland, 2 in the United States, and 1 each in Canada, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Spain [12].

[Neither of these accounts comments on a previous observation that,
although all vCJD cases to date have been methionine homozygotes at
codon 129 of the prion protein gene, a preclinical vCJD infection has
been reported in a heterozygous patient after blood transfusion from
a donor who subsequently developed vCJD (Peden AH, Head MW, Ritchie
DL, Bell JE, Ironside JW. Preclinical vCJD after blood transfusion in
a PRNP codon 129 heterozygous patient. Lancet 2004;364:527-9.)
Clarification of the status of the patient described in the press
release would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
