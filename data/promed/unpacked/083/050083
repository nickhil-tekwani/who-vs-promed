Turkey: Diagnosis Reversed: Two Human Cases Test Avian Influenza Positive
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
At least two people in eastern Turkey have tested positive for the deadly
human strain of bird flu, Turkey's health minister has said.
A 14-year-old boy who died last weekend did have the disease, Recep Akdag
said, contradicting earlier statements.
The boy's sister, who is seriously ill in hospital, also tested positive. A
third sibling has symptoms of bird flu.
Experts are examining whether the boy died of the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu, which has killed dozens in Asia

[The appearance of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection in
Eurasia is a significant and alarming event, if confirmed independently.
The situation is confused. The Turkish Minister of Health has contradicted
the outcome of the previously reported negative tests, whereas "experts"
are reported to be still examining one of the deceased patients. Further
details are awaited. - Mod.CP]

Turkey Says Dead Boy Had Avian Influenza
----------------------------------------
ANKARA: A 14-year-old farm boy who died after developing pneumonia-like
symptoms had tested positive for avian influenza, Turkey's health minister
said Wednesday [4 Jan 2006]. Three other members of his family also tested
positive and are hospitalized, Health Minister Recep Akdag said. Akdag's
statement contradicted a ministry statement earlier this week, which said
the boy's death was not caused by bird flu.
The 14-year-old boy died on Sunday. He was among two brothers and two
sisters between 6 and 15 years old who were admitted to hospital in the
country's southeastern Van province last Saturday after developing high
fevers, coughing, and bleeding in their throats. The children helped to
raise poultry on a farm and were in close contact with sick birds. They
became sick after reportedly eating one of them.
Two other patients, aged 35 and 5, were sent to the same hospital on
Sunday, the Anatolia news agency reported.
Turkish authorities last week said some chickens had tested positive for an
H5 variant of bird flu and placed parts of an eastern town, Aralik, near
the border with Armenia, under quarantine. The sick brothers and sisters
were from the town of Dogubeyazit, just 60 kilometers (37 miles) south of
Aralik.
"As a precaution, we have forbidden the passage of any poultry into or out
of the district," local official Rauf Ulusoy was quoted as telling
Anatolia. "We are making announcements in the district that poultry should
not be eaten."
Along with Turkey, birds in Romania, Russia and Croatia recently tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 strain.
