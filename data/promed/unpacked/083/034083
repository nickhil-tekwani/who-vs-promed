Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Yanpu Township, Pingtung, Taiwan
Started: 4 Jun 2021
Ended: 16 Jul 2021
Epidemiological unit: pond
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
American bullfrog (_Rana catesbeiana_): Ranidae-farmed amphibians / 400 000 / 20 000 / 20 000 / - / - / -

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: 400 000 30-70-day-old bullfrogs were raised on the outbreak farm with 20 ponds in Yanpu Township, Pingtung County. Since 4 Jun [2021], these frogs have developed clinical symptoms such as neurological symptoms, skin bleeding and peeling, and fluid accumulation in the body cavity. More than 1000 frogs died each day, and the farm owner reported to the Local Animal Disease Inspection Authority on 24 Jun [2021]. The farm owner changed the water more frequently and quarantined the infected frogs to prevent the disease from spreading. The farm was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. By 16 Jul [2021], no more frogs showed clinical signs. There is no other frog farm in the 3 km [1.9 mi] radius area of the index farm, and no other incidents were observed in the immediate area. As of 30 Aug 2021, no other frog farms reported the disease or similar cases.

Control measures applied in domestic: surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, traceability, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result

["Ranaviruses are a group of viruses that belong to the Iridoviridae family, which is characterized by relatively large, double-stranded DNA viruses.

"Mass die-offs attributed to ranavirus have affected several species of amphibians and turtles, and the virus can also have fatal consequences for fish and reptiles. All life stages are potentially susceptible.

"Strains of ranavirus that infect amphibians may produce 90%-100% mortality in tadpoles and adults, and while some outbreaks may only involve a single species, others can affect multiple species. Infection rates are high in spring and summer, when larval amphibians are undergoing metamorphosis.

"Clinical signs in amphibians can include abnormal behavior/swimming, lethargy, swelling of the limbs or body, fluid accumulation in the body, skin hemorrhage (especially towards the hind area), and sometimes skin ulcers.

"This is also the case for fish and reptiles, though lesions can also sometimes be seen inside the mouth of affected individuals, as well as swollen eyelids and discharge from the nose and mouth. Affected animals die due to the failure of multiple organs, and often within 1-5 days.

"Ranaviruses are transmitted through several routes: contaminated water, physical contact, and ingestion of infected tissues.

"Diagnosis is made using PCR, cell culture, and/or microscopy of infected tissues." - Mod.CRD
