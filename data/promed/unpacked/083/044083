2003/050 Situation of several quarantine pests in Lithuania in 2002
-------------------------------------------------------------------
National surveys were carried out in Lithuania for the presence of several
quarantine pests. The results for 2002 are presented below. Earlier surveys
(2000) had been presented in EPPO RS 2000/136. [Note: Because only diseases
of food crops are monitored by ProMED-Plant, reports of insect damage to
food plants are not included in this report. - Mod.DH]
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ [Cmm], an EPPO A2
quarantine pest, was detected in one glasshouse of tomatoes. All infected
tomatoes were destroyed, and other plants were put under strict
surveillance. Present, found in one glasshouse, under eradication.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest):
8 outbreaks were found, 6 of them new. 8 potato cultivars were found
infected (226.5 tons) by the bacterium, including 7 cultivars of seed
potatoes (139 tons) and one cultivar of ware potatoes (87.5 tons). All
contaminated potatoes were used for human or animal consumption. Present,
found in a few areas (8 outbreaks), under eradication.
_Ditylenchus destructor_ (EU Annexes): 24 outbreaks were found in potato
farms, including 17 new outbreaks. 628.4 tons of potatoes were infested by
the nematode, including 476.9 tons of seed potatoes. All infested potatoes
were used for human or animal consumption. Present, found in a few areas
(24 outbreaks), under eradication.
_Ditylenchus dipsaci_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest): 6 outbreaks were found in
2002. 4 outbreaks were found in peat bogs (14 500 tons), and 2 outbreaks on
flower bulbs grown on peat. All contaminated bulbs were destroyed, and
commercialisation of infested peat was prohibited. Present, found in a few
areas (6 outbreaks), under eradication.
_Globodera rostochiensis_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest): 61 outbreaks were
found on a total of 344.059 ha. On infested areas it is now prohibited to
grow potatoes or any other propagating material. Present, found in some
areas (61 outbreaks), under eradication.
Plum pox potyvirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest): 28 orchards and nurseries
were inspected (231.99 ha were inspected, out of a total area of 1195.05
ha). 3 outbreaks were found (one of them is new). 439 plum trees (_Prunus
domestica_) were infected. 400 trees were pulled out and destroyed by
burning. 39 trees could not be destroyed, as the grower refused to do so
without compensation. Present, found in a few areas (3 outbreaks) on
_Prunus domestica_, under eradication.
