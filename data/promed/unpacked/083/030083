Representatives from China and an international joint mission team led by the World Health Organization (WHO) today [Tue 9 Feb 2021] in Wuhan detailed the results of a 2-week probe into the zoonotic source of the outbreaks, which didn't reveal a definitive source but did shed new light on the events.

At the nearly 3-hour briefing, officials laid out 4 main theories, some of them less likely possibilities. The 10-person joint mission team has been in China since 14 Jan [2021] and followed investigation terms that a WHO advance team fleshed out with the country over the summer.

The team was quarantined for the 1st part of its stay, followed by 12 days of field work that took them to locations in Wuhan, such as hospitals, the seafood market initially thought to have triggered the 1st outbreaks, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

At the briefing, Peter Ben Embarek, PhD, who led the WHO team, said introduction through an intermediary host species is the most likely of the 4 scenarios, according to CNN. Confirmation will require more studies and targeted research.

Ben Embarek also said transmission through the sale of frozen products is possible. China has pushed the cold-chain packaging theory and has said the virus on imported frozen foods has been one likely source of small flare-ups that followed the country's 1st surge. However, over the past months, the WHO has said there's no evidence that people can contract the virus from food or food packaging.

The group's seafood market tour found that vendors were selling frozen animal products, including farmed wild animals, and further studies into the supply chain might be useful, he said, according to Reuters. "The possible path from whatever original animal species all the way through to the Huanan market could have taken a very long and convoluted path involving also movements across borders," Ben Embarek said.

The 2 other possibilities, a direct spillover from the animal reservoir and a lab-incident possibility, are less likely, Ben Embarek said. The spillover is still considered a topic of further study, though, while investigators assessed the lab-incident possibility as the least likely cause of SARS-CoV-2 jump to humans due to safety protocols that are in place at the facility.

Ben Embarek said the team was able to question lab scientists and administrators about coronavirus work that was done at the lab.

Liang Wannian, PhD, China's team lead, said the Wuhan seafood market that first emerged as the potential source of the outbreak may not have been the 1st place where the virus transmitted. He said the earliest illness onset for a confirmed COVID-19 patient was 8 Dec 2019, and that the earliest illness onset linked to the market was 12 Dec [2019].

Ben Embarek said a detailed case database review found no indications that there were large COVID-19 outbreaks before December 2019 in Wuhan or anywhere else in China, according to Reuters.

At the briefing, Chinese officials repeated their earlier assertions that the virus could have come from outside of China, and Liang said investigations going forward should not be restricted to any locations, according to the New York Times. Though a number of scientists dispute the possibility, the WHO team said they would weigh reports of early COVID-19 cases that occurred outside of China.

Investigators also urged more studies of the animals sold at the seafood market in Wuhan linked to the 1st reported patient cluster. Peter Daszak, PhD, a team member from the United States who is with EcoHealth Alliance, said on Twitter today [Tue 9 Feb 2021] that there were no SARS-CoV-2 positives from animals at the seafood market, but some are thought to be susceptible to coronaviruses, including ferret badgers [see comment].

Some also trace back to farms or regions where bats harbor coronaviruses. "This, to me, is a critical finding."

He also said the team recommends sampling intermediate hosts and bats in and outside of China, keeping in mind a possible role of frozen wild animals that could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Liang said no labs in Wuhan worked with SARS-CoV-2, though the WIV researches coronaviruses from bats in southwestern China, including 2 known relatives of SARS-CoV-2, according to the Washington Post.

The WHO said today [Tue 9 Feb 2021] that the team will finalize a summary of the report in the coming days and that it will publish a link to the full findings, once the report is published.

[The questions raised by the international and Chinese media correspondents during the press conference in Wuhan were answered by the 3 attending WHO/China team's experts: co-chair Peter Ben Embarek, PhD (WHO), co-chair Liang Wannian, PhD (China), and the Dutch virologist Marion Koopman, DVM, PhD. A video recording of the entire briefing is accessible at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxEksRv6ctg (for its start, please go to 1:38:40). Here we wish to draw attention to the following raised question (3:52:28 - 3:54:02) about "the animals which were found, alive or dead, in the market" ("what exactly they were," etc.). This question was addressed by Dr Koopman (3:55:40 - 3:57:25), including the following: "First it is important to emphasize that the testing did not reveal any positives, but the full traceback that was done, very extensive traceback of all animals and other products on the market, showed that there were some animal species that have been confirmed as susceptible, like rabbits, or that could be suspected to be susceptible, like ferret badgers and bamboo rats. So the way that it is interpreted is to really say, well, if they were there, then maybe there could have been similar animals earlier, so it is an entry point for a traceback investigation. Because that's the step that we're now looking for. We have a deeper understanding of the early situation; where would you go for the next step of these origin studies?"

China's claim that tests (of animals) on the Huanan market "were not positive" had been pleaded in the past. Requests for details remained pending; to the best of our knowledge, no such details have become published. It was expected that the WHO experts team, including animal health professionals, would manage, during the visit, to obtain the detailed and accurate information, namely the number and species of animals -- alive or dead -- examined/sampled on the market before its evacuation/closure on 1 Jan 2020, the number of samples per species, the methods of testing and results, and the results of the samples subsequently or immediately tested. "Tracing back" may mean that the animals disappeared. Measures undertaken -- or neglected -- during the critical, acute phase on an animal market, including movement prohibition, are of high significance for the prevention of similar future pandemic-threatening events. Hopefully, the written report includes the said details, which should lead to the formulation of internationally agreed guidelines for all countries.

On top of the visit to the BSL-4 laboratory, the team reportedly visited several other diagnostic/research facilities in Wuhan, namely the BSL-2 China CDC laboratory (in close proximity to the market), the university laboratory, and an experimental animal-keeping facility. It is expected that the report will address their respective biosafety conditions, at present and as recorded at least during the recent year or 2.

Finally, a footnote about WHO's cited view that "there's no evidence that people can contract the virus from food or food packaging," referring mainly to China's "cold-chain packaging theory." At a facility such as the Huanan market, contaminated packaging of animal products might become a source of infection to traded wild animals, stray animals, or even owned animals. Cats, for example, are potential candidates. Such a scenario deserves to be studied and excluded. - Mod.AS
