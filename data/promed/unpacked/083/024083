A young Indonesian girl who died at the weekend on the island of
Sumatra was not infected with bird flu, a health ministry official
said Monday [22 Oct 2007]. The 10-year-old was admitted to hospital
on Saturday [20 Oct 2007] suffering symptoms that led doctors to
suspect she could be carrying the H5N1 virus, which has killed 88
people in Indonesia, the highest number anywhere in the world.

"The test result is negative," said Haris Sugiantoro, an official at
the health ministry's bird flu information centre.

If the ministry result is positive, a 2nd test is carried out at a
separate laboratory before a patient is confirmed as infected with
bird flu in Indonesia.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu is endemic in birds across nearly all of
Indonesia. Scientists worry that the virus could mutate into a form
more easily transmissible between humans, triggering a global
pandemic. Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation, reported
its 1st human case of bird flu in July 2005.

[Earlier, ProMED-mail was forwarded a Mathaba News Agency/Xinhua report
<http://mathaba.net/news/?x=568083>
stating that: Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari
confirmed Monday (22 Oct 2007) that the death of a 10-year-old girl
in Riau Province was caused by bird flu, bringing the total death
toll (for Indonesia) to 89. "Yes, it was positive (for bird flu),"
she told reporters at the State Palace here.

This statement is directly contradicted by the AFP report. It would
be prudent to await a confirmatory statement from WHO before the toll
of fatalities in Indonesia is raised to 89. - Mod.CP]
