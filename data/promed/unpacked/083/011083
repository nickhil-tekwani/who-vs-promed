An outbreak of human bartonellosis (Carrion's Disease) in the Sacred
Valley, Cusco [identified by] Dr. Manuel Montoya.

The presence of bartonellosis is reported. The Medical team led by Dr.
Manuel Montoya discovered a few cases in the Cusco Regional Hospital, and
the laboratory diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. Benjamin Vigo. The Instituto
de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt of the Universidad Peruana
Cayetano Heredia and the Instituto Nacional de Salud made further
confirmations. The first positive cultures were found by Biologist Palmira
Ventosilla at the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS).
The outbreak started in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. It comprises 10
localities and peasant communities in 3 Provinces (Urubamba, Calca and
Urcos). All of them are between 2,500 and 3,200 meters above sea level.
The populations are essentially agrarian.
The illness has been seen for the first time in the area. The cases
appeared with acute anemia and fever, beginning in January 1998. They were
initially attended in the Health Centers of the area and referred to the
Regional Hospital. There have been 10 suspicious cases, two of whom died,
among these hospitalized patients whose definitive diagnosis was not
confirmed.
Dr. Manuel Montoya saw two patients on April 4, in the Intensive Care Unit
of the Cusco Regional Hospital, who had the presumptive diagnosis of viral
hepatitis, and made the clinical diagnosis of Bartonellosis. The clinical
picture included acute anemia, fever and lethargy. Blood smears were sent
to the laboratory, with the clinical suspicion of Carrion's disease.
Giemsa and Wright stained blood smears were positive for intra- and
extra-erythrocytic coccobacilli, recognized as _Bartonella bacilliformis_
by the laboratory team, led by Dr. Benjamin Vigo. About 40% and 80% of the
erythrocytes harbored Bartonellae in these two first patients diagnosed.
Cultures were taken on April 7 by Dr. Manuel Montoya and Dr. Susana Zurita,
Head of the Laboratory Network of the INS. Some of the cultures were
positive on April 15 at the INS in Lima, for _Bartonella bacilliformis_.
There were 13 cases (4 women, 9 males; 5 were adult, 8 were children) with
positive blood smears in the Hospital, in the Medicine (Dr. Manuel
Montoya), Pediatrics (Dr. Ruben Caparo) and Intensive Care services. Five
had the diagnosis of acute Bartonellosis, and 8 complicated (convulsions,
anasarca [sic], pericarditis, intestinal hemorrhage) acute bartonellosis; 2
of these 'complicated' patients died, 2 adults and a child.
Uncomplicated cases responded well to the treatment, which included
penicillin and chloramphenicol. The percentage of parasitized erythrocytes
was reduced within 4 days, and most had clinical remissions in 2 days.
It is interesting that Drs. Didier Raoult, Richard Birtles and Enrique
Perez were in Calca, and took some sera and made entomological captures, 3
weeks earlier. The results of the serological survey, which was designed
for rickettsioses, were sent by Drs. Raoult and Birtles from Marseille on
April 21 by fax to Cusco. Different species of _Lutzomyia_ were found,
among them _L. peruensis_, previously reported for the area by Biologist
Abraham Caceres in Calca. [_Lutzomyia_ are sandflies, the vectors of
bartonellosis - Mod.JW]
