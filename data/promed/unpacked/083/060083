A new case of influenza A(H5N1) was confirmed yesterday in a 4-year old
boy. The boy had no reported contact with chickens and he had no link to
any of the previously reported cases. The total number of confirmed cases
is now eight, while two suspect cases are being investigated. Two of these
10 confirmed or suspected cases died, two are still in a
critical condition and the remaining six are in a satisfactory condition or
have recovered.
Detection of new cases is probably the result of a very comprehensive
surveillance programme involving all health services catering for the 6.5
million population of Hong Kong and not an indication of increased
transmission. Although the source of infection remains uncertain in some
of the cases, it is evident that the virus transmits poorly.
Surveillance of live chickens in farms and food markets will be further
intensified within the coming days to evaluate the extent of virus
circulation in the chicken population. In response to the recognition of
the first case, 2000 blood samples were collected from health workers,
family members and other contacts to investigate the extent of influenza
A(H5N1) virus infections. The results of tested samples will be available
in a week's time.
There is still no indication that a vaccine is needed but intensive
laboratory work is in progress in the WHO Collaborating Centres to produce
a seed virus which would be suitable for vaccine production should this be
needed.
WHO does not recommend any restrictions of travel to Hong Kong or elsewhere.

[This report adds a little (serosurvey being done) to what we know but this
is all starting to sound rather repetitive to me (I am easily bored).
Therefore, we will henceforth report only new and useful information as we
