[1] Iran, Suspected infection in imported camels
Date: Sun 26 Oct 2014

The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has been found in camels, which are imported to Iran.

Houshang Nazari, the deputy governor general of Iran's southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, said the slaughtering of camels will be forbidden without carrying out medical examinations, the Iranian Mehr news agency reported 26 Oct 2014. Samples should be taken from all camels in the region, he said.

In July 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the 1st 2 MERS-CoV cases in Iran.

[The said and additional information on the measures undertaken to prevent the spread of (allegedly imported) MERS-CoV in Iran's camel population has been published in multiple local media sources (e.g. http://www.mehrnews.com/news/2409632, http://press.jamejamonline.ir/Newspreview/1696340700148381365).

According to the said sources, as far as could be deduced from their machine translations, a consignment of 250 imported camels in which positive test results were found, is being withheld in the city of Zabol; information on clinical disease or its absence seems to be contradictory (one article said that the camels did not show clinical disease, but death was mentioned as well). Information on the country of origin, on the tests performed, on the clinical signs in case observed, and on the detection (or not) of infection in local camels will be appreciated. If MERS-CoV infection has been established, Iran may consider following the examples of Qatar, Oman and Kuwait and report the infection to OIE as a (not-listed) emerging disease.

[2] Saudi Arabia: camel vaccination considered
Date: Thu 23 Oct 2014

The Ministry of Health [KSA] is currently considering vaccinating camels to counter the spread of the deadly MERS coronavirus as it claimed another life on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014].

Abdullah Asiri, assistant deputy minister for preventive health, said recently that this measure is being considered because it has now been established beyond doubt that camels are carriers of the virus.

"Research studies have confirmed that camels are major carriers of the virus, and some studies recommended vaccinating them to eradicate the disease totally," Asiri told a local daily.

He said he would visit Taif to check measures being taken against the spread of the virus and explore ways to treat patients at King Abdul Aziz Specialist Hospital and King Faisal Hospital. However, he said a major obstacle is the reluctance of major pharmaceutical companies to produce a vaccine because of the high manufacturing costs and low profit margins.

The latest victim was 56-year-old Saudi who died on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014]. Saudi Arabia has now registered 772 cases since 2011, with 12 people still receiving treatment, 431 recovered and 329 deaths.

[Before dromedary-camel vaccination is indeed found to be the expected solution to the MERS-CoV problem, more research is needed. In case found effective, the authorities of the KSA, which is the predominant victim of MERS-CoV, may have to consider bearing the costs of animal vaccination as part of their public health expenditure. As far as is currently known, the virus causes mild or no clinical signs in the camels, thus no demand for their vaccination may be expected from the owners.

According to OIE's 2013 data, KSA's dromedary-camel population is 223 441. Subscribers may find the following data on dromedary-camel populations from other (selected) countries of interest:

Sudan 4 751 000
Kenya 2 985 153
Ethiopia 2 245 581
Chad 1 374 307
Pakistan (2012 data) 1 000 000 (mainly in the Pakistani Baluchistan region, bordering Iran)
Mali 978 980
Yemen 455 926
Algeria 344 015
UAE 363 806 (of which Abu Dhabi has 277 577)
Oman 243 435
Morocco 197 550
Iran 156 000 (most of them in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan; see item 1 above).
Kuwait 133 206
Qatar 74 471
Iraq 58 293

The total camel population in the Arab peninsula (6 countries) is 1 270 844, of which 17.6 percent are in the territory of KSA. Of the 896 human cases of MERS-CoV reported from the above 6 countries from September 2012 to 19 Oct 2014, 771 (90 percent) were reported from KSA. These remarkable proportions are in need of explanation.

The origin of the camels allegedly found infected upon arrival in Iran is of particular interest. Is the country of origin known to be infected with MERS-CoV? - Mod.AS
