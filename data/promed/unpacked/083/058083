In your recent posting on cysticercosis [referenced below], you stated that
the increase in neurocysticercosis in northern India may be due to
increased use of fecal material as fertilizer for vegetables.
Years ago I was informed by an South American colleague of mine that an
apparent increase in this condition in his country may have been due to the
relatively recent adoption of aerial spraying of fruit and vegetable crops
using fecally contaminated water.
It would be interesting to know whether there has been a change from
traditional ground irrigation to aerial spraying of fruits/vegetables in
those areas of India where the apparent increase has been noted.

The CDC reports reviewing 3 patients infected in the United States from
close relatives and friends who were infected abroad.

[We thank Dr Marr for his interesting comment. We have no knowledge of
whether aerial spraying of water potentially contaminated with _T. solium_
may be a problem in India, but hope our Indian colleagues can comment on
this. It is certainly an effective way of disseminating the infection via
vegetables. The report from the CDC published in MMWR in 1992 explains in
detail how asymptomatic people may shed _T. solium_ eggs for many months
(and even years) and occasionally infect close contacts. - Mod.EP]
