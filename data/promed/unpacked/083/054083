Hand, foot, mouth disease kills 240
-----------------------------------
At least 240 people, mainly children younger than 5 years old, have died from hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) from January to May as China enters a peak season of the epidemic, the Ministry of Health has said. The peak will last until October but the infection commonly seen among toddlers can be easily prevented and treated with early detection and intervention, said Xiao Donglou, a division director of the Ministry's disease prevention and control bureau.

According to official statistics the infection claimed more than 240 lives on the mainland in the first 5 months of the year. The epidemic appeared to hit harder this year in terms of scale and severity, Xiao said. From Jan to Jun last year, 132 deaths were reported. An official tally showed China reported nearly 1.62 million HFMD cases in 2011, including 509 deaths.

"The infection is expected to maintain a relatively high prevalence this year and children attending nurseries, kindergartens and elementary schools are most vulnerable to the disease," he said. In response, the Ministry has devised clinical guidelines to help with a timely diagnosis and proper treatment of HFMD particularly at grassroots-level health institutions. The ministry has distributed information and training materials, mainly at kindergartens, to help better track the infection and get timely medical intervention. Kindergartens and elementary schools are required to increase monitoring and preventive measures by carrying out morning checks and routine disinfection.Kindergartens must report any HFMD cases upon detection to local health authorities to help avert the risk of secondary infections. Kindergartens with outbreaks could be closed temporarily.

Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention, told China Daily several kindergartens in the capital had been temporarily closed after outbreaks were detected. The capital has reported three deaths, all children under 5, from the infection, she said. "All of them were diagnosed at the late stage and sent to private small clinics and their deaths could have been avoided," she told China Daily.

According to medical experts, children younger than 3 are at the greatest risk of HFMD and the infection usually starts with a light fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. The virus spreads via the digestive and respiratory systems and through close contact. Zhao Min, a sales manager in Beijing, said she has received manuals on HFMD prevention and intervention from the kindergarten her 3 year old son attends. "Starting in May, I began to regularly disinfect his toys and keep him away from crowded public places like the shopping mall," she said.

There is no vaccine to specifically target the infection so good hygiene practices should be applied to prevent the disease, Pang said. Adults could get infected but usually show no symptoms.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is generally a mild disease usually caused by an enterovirus such as human coxsackievirus A, human coxsackievirus B, or human enterovirus 71. Infection by human enterovirus 71 may have more serious outcomes, but otherwise HFMD is a mild illness. HFMD gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of feet. It can also cause ulcers in the mouth although many individuals have no symptoms.

Many countries in East and South East Asia experience very large annual outbreaks affecting many thousands of children, but HFMD is by no means confined to the developing world and remains a problem elsewhere. A few children, and rarely adults, may have severe illnesses. During the year ProMED-mail through HealthMap alerts receives many reports of HFMD from numerous Chinese provinces. These reports are almost invariably Chinese language report which we are unable to edit. The above report provides an overall estimate of the incidence of HFMD in China -- 1.62 million HFMD cases in 2011, including 509 deaths. The extent of the outbreak in the current year is likely to be similar since there have been 240 deaths already in the first 5 months of this year.

HFMD is spread from person to person through nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), blister fluid, or faeces of infected people. As noted above there is no preventative vaccine, in part because HFMD is caused by enterovirus infection and the identity of the specify infectious agent is rarely determined and may vary from locality to locality. The risk of infection can be reduced by attention to personal hygiene, washing hands often with soap and water, disinfecting dirty surfaces and soiled items, and avoiding close contact or sharing eating utensils with infected people.
