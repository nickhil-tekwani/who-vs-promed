A total of 630 diarrhea patients were admitted to International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) in 14 hours as of 2:00pm today [24 Mar 2022]. As many as 45 people were admitted to the hospital per hour.

The ICDDRB authorities said diarrhea cases have surged over the past week. According to them, the number of patients admitted to the hospital in a week till yesterday [23 Mar 2022] was 8152. Arrangements are being made to treat the extra patients by setting up makeshift facilities on the hospital premises to cope with the pressure.

Baharul Alam, the head of the hospital, has advised avoiding eating street foods and drinking clean water to stay safe from diarrhea. He told The Daily Star that usually 400 to 500 diarrhea patients come here every day for treatment, which increases slightly before the rainy season and peaks in the last week of April. But in the 1st week of March 2022, an average of 500 patients were admitted every day, which increased to 600 in the 2nd week. Since 17 Mar 2022, the number of daily admitted patients has exceeded 1000.
