Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infections are still a worldwide concern due to the severity of neurological outcomes. ZIKV neurotropism is well characterized, but peripheral tissue could be sites of viral amplification, contributing to endothelial-barrier crossing and access to peripheral nerves. During acute and late phases of infection, ZIKV can be detected in several body fluids, eyes, testis and vagina. However, the importance of initial replication sites for the establishment of infection and viral spread remain unknown. Here we demonstrated that ZIKV replicates primarily in human muscle precursor cells, resulting in cell death and inhibition of myogenesis. ZIKV also replicates in fetal muscle after maternal transmission and in infected neonate mice, inducing lesions and inflammation. Muscle was an important site of viral amplification, sustaining higher peripheral viral loads than liver and spleen. In addition, ZIKV showed rapid and sustained replication kinetics in muscle even before replication in the neural tissues, persisting until 16 days post infection. Our results highlight the importance of muscle in ZIKV pathogenesis as a peripheral site of viral amplification which may contribute to ZIKV reaching neural structures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malignant brain tumors are among the most aggressive cancers with poor prognosis and no effective treatment. Recently, we reported the oncolytic potential of Zika virus infecting and destroying the human central nervous system (CNS) tumors in vitro and in immunodeficient mice model. However, translating this approach to humans requires pre-clinical trials in another immunocompetent animal model. Here, we analyzed the safety of Brazilian Zika virus (ZIKVBR) intrathecal injections in 3 dogs bearing spontaneous CNS tumors aiming an anti-tumoral therapy. We further assessed some aspects of the innate immune and inflammatory response that triggers the anti-tumoral response observed during the ZIKVBR administration in vivo and in vitro. For the 1st time, we showed that there were no negative clinical side effects following ZIKVBR CNS injections in dogs, confirming the safety of the procedure. Furthermore, the intrathecal ZIKVBR injections reduced tumor size in immunocompetent dogs bearing spontaneous intracranial tumors, improved their neurological clinical symptoms significantly, and extended their survival by inducing the destruction specifically of tumor cells, sparing normal neurons, and activating an immune response. These results open new perspectives for upcoming virotherapy using ZIKV to destroy and induce an anti-tumoral immune response in CNS tumors for which there are currently no effective treatments.

The study included 3 dogs with different characteristics.

ref: Wheeler AC, Toth D, Ridenour T, et al. Developmental outcomes among young children with congenital Zika syndrome in Brazil. JAMA Netw Open. 2020; 3(5): e204096
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key points
----------
Question: What are the observed neurodevelopmental sequelae among young children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) identified during the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil from 2015 to 2016?
Findings: In this case series of 121 young children, nearly all children with CZS demonstrated profound developmental delays at age 2 to 3 years across all domains of functioning, with a relative strength in receptive communication. Severity of microcephaly at birth was the only significant factor associated with the severity of delays.
Meaning: In this study, most children diagnosed with CZS had profound developmental delays; however, there was variability within their developmental profile, providing direction for intervention.

Abstract
--------
Importance
Although birth defects in children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) are expected to result in significant intellectual disabilities, the extent of delay and profiles of development have yet to be fully described.

Objectives
To describe the neurodevelopmental profiles of children with CZS and to test whether prenatal and postpartum characteristics were associated with the severity of developmental delays.

Design, setting, and participants
This is a case series of the trajectories of developmental, behavioral, and medical needs of 121 young children with CZS who were assessed at a specialized rehabilitation center in Recife, Brazil, beginning in January 2018 as part of 5-year longitudinal study. Children were included if they had serologic confirmation of Zika virus and met clinical criteria accompanied by parental report of suspected exposure to Zika virus during pregnancy.

Exposures
Prenatal Zika virus exposure.

Main outcomes and measures
The Brazilian version of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd Edition, was administered by trained assessors as part of an initial comprehensive assessment battery. Caregiver interviews and medical record reviews were conducted to gather basic demographic information and medical comorbidities. Linear regression was used to identify potential factors for development.

Results
The sample included 121 young children (mean [SD] age, 31.2 [1.9] months; 61 [50.4%] girls). At age approximately 2.5 years, nearly all children in this sample demonstrated profound developmental delays across all domains of functioning, with a mean (SD) developmental age equivalent to approximately 2 to 4 months (such as, cognitive domain, 2.24 [3.09] months; fine motor subscale, 2.15 [2.93] months; expressive language subscale, 2.30 [2.52] months). A relative strength was found in receptive language, with scores on this scale significantly higher than most other domains (such as cognition: t = 3.73; P less than .001; fine motor: t = 6.99; P les than .001). Head circumference at birth was the single strongest factor associated with outcomes across all developmental domains (such as, cognitive: beta = 1.41; SE [standard error], 0.67; P = .04; fine motor: beta = 1.36; SE, 0.49; P = .007).

Conclusions and relevance
The findings of this study provide important information regarding the severity of disability that these children and their families will experience. The findings also establish an initial point from which to monitor developmental trajectories, medical comorbidities (such as, seizures), effectiveness of interventions, and cumulative consequences on families.

[This report illustrates the serious adverse effects of fetal Zika virus infection. These children will likely live many years and require constant care, resulting in emotional and economic stress on their families. Zika virus has not disappeared from Brazil nor from the other tropical countries in the Americas where the previous outbreaks occurred. Surveillance and vector control are still important measures to avoid additional cases in the future. Interestingly, in a sturdy in non-human primates, researchers found postnatal Zika virus infections in 4 rhesus monkeys until the age of 1 led to impairments in memory function, significant changes in behavior, including reduced social interactions and increased emotional reactions, and some gross motor deficits. These changes corresponded with structural and functional brain changes the researchers found on MRI scans -- findings that indicate long-term neurologic complications (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-zika-infection-birth-long-term-brain.html). - Mod.TY

[5] Placental sampling

Shortly after the explosion in microcephaly cases caused by Zika virus in Brazil in 2015-16, several scientific studies were published with evidence that the pathogen is capable of crossing the human placenta, the organ that keeps the fetus connected to the mother's body during pregnancy. From then on, the states began following a protocol established by the National Ministry of Health requiring collection of placental samples to help diagnose the disease in women with symptoms during pregnancy.

However, according to a group of Brazilian researchers at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) who have studied emerging viruses with Sao Paulo Research Foundation -- FAPESP's support, the official protocol in place nationwide should be reformulated. As they recently reported in Frontiers in Microbiology, it is crucial to ensure that samples are representative and properly stored and transported to obtain trustworthy results in detecting the virus in the placenta.

The report concludes that Zika virus can indeed infect different regions of the placenta in pregnant women, such as the umbilical cord, amniotic membrane, chorionic plate, chorionic villi and basal plate.

This discovery suggests that diagnostic tests should take several placental regions into consideration to assure adequate representativeness and more accurate results. "The protocol currently in force says each sample should be 1 cubic centimeter in size but doesn't specify the placental regions to be analyzed," said molecular biologist Jose Luiz Proenca Modena, who heads the Emerging Virus Research Laboratory (LEVE) at UNICAMP's Institute of Biology and is one of the authors of the report.

The study analyzed 17 placental samples from women who gave birth at the Women's Hospital (CAISM) run by UNICAMP; 14 tested positive for Zika virus using a real-time PCR kit developed by the researchers. The PCR method detects RNA from the virus in the samples tested.

"We collected 4 fragments from all placental regions for each patient, including the umbilical cord," Modena said. The women had symptoms of the disease during pregnancy, such as fever and rash, or delivered babies with microcephaly in 2016 or 2017. According to Modena, the collection of several placental fragments increases the chances of detecting Zika because some regions of the placenta contain more viruses than others.

The researchers were surprised to find that placental samples from the same patients tested negative when analyzed using the health ministry's protocol by the Adolfo Lutz Institute (IAL), the main reference laboratory for epidemiological surveillance in the state of Sao Paulo. "This problem highlights the urgency of changing the currently required method," Modena said.

In response to inquiries by Agencia FAPESP, IAL's press office stated that placental samples continue to be tested in compliance with the official protocol, and there are no plans to change this procedure at the moment.

"The coronavirus [COVID-19] pandemic will probably delay moves to reformulate the diagnostic test to detect Zika virus in placenta," he said. Modena has had to interrupt his normal research activities to join the efforts of the task force set up by UNICAMP to halt the spread of COVID-19 (read more at http://agencia.fapesp.br/32998/).

Talks about adjustments to the placental test protocol with the Ministry of Health began at the end of 2019 but have also had to be suspended, he said.

For Maria Laura Costa do Nascimento, a professor in UNICAMP's School of Medical Sciences and a coauthor of the Frontiers in Microbiology article, while many research projects have been redirected in response to the emergency posed by the pandemic, a systematic protocol must be established as soon as possible to ensure that placental samples are collected in the appropriate manner.

"The placenta is a very important organ for diagnosing several diseases, including Zika," Nascimento said. "About 70% of those infected are symptomatic or exhibit mild symptoms, so that they take longer to go to a doctor." The probability of a positive test result after the acute stage of infection is negligible, she added. The virus can be detected for up to five days in blood and eight days in urine, counting from the date of infection. In the placenta, however, traces of the virus can be detected months after the start of infection.

According to the Ministry of Health, 2054 cases of Zika were reported in Brazil in the 1st 3 months of this year [2020].

The researchers acknowledge that changing the protocol is no easy task. Collecting a larger number of samples from specific placental regions will make testing more expensive, for example.

"It's one thing to extract a placental fragment at random and store it in a freezer at -20 deg C [-4 deg F], as the protocol requires now. Collecting 4 or 5 specific fragments and storing them at -80 deg C [-112 deg F] is quite another," Modena said.

According to Nascimento, the challenge will be guaranteeing that Brazil's maternity hospitals have the requisite technical staff trained to perform a more complex procedure and the equipment to store samples properly until they arrive at the reference laboratory responsible for diagnostic testing.

"It's complicated to work with samples collected during or just after childbirth, especially when the procedure hasn't been scheduled in advance and is performed by rosters of hospital duty personnel," Nascimento said. "These professionals would have to be trained to collect specific placental fragments, ensuring sample quality and representativeness, as soon as possible after the baby is delivered."

The sampling of placental tissue currently in Brazil poses a dilemma: routinely use a more expensive and complex diagnostic approach or underestimate the occurrence of transplacental Zika virus infections. Given the demand for diagnosis of COVID-19 infections, it is unlikely that any changes in the standard Zika virus diagnosis protocol will be made at this time. - Mod.TY]

[6] Vaginal infection
Date: Mon 25 May 2020
Source: Zika News [edited[
https://www.zikanews.com/zika-virus-particles-were-able-successfully-enter-vaginal-epithelial-cells-through-ufo-receptor


The Zika virus is capable of replicating and spreading infectious particles within the outermost cells lining the vaginal tract, according to new research. This study's findings provide the 1st molecular-level insights into how the Zika virus can move from person to person through sexual contact.

While the Zika virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes, researchers have been aware of its potential for sexual transmission based on cases in which people became infected after having sex with a partner who had visited a Zika-affected area. Previous studies have also found Zika particles present in semen and vaginal fluid from infected individuals.

Having a more detailed understanding of how Zika infiltrates the body through sexual contact could help scientists identify new ways to prevent or treat Zika infections.

This new study examined how Zika particles behaved in cultures of human vaginal epithelial cells and identified the virus's likely entry point as a protein on the surface of the cells called tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO, which is encoded by the AXL gene.

"The outcome of this research highlights how local replication of Zika in the vaginal epithelium plays an important role in mediating sexual transmission and subsequent systemic infection in the human host," said lead study author James Mungin Jr, a doctoral candidate at Meharry Medical College, located in Nashville, Tennessee.

"Additionally, our research findings confirming that the receptor UFO (AXL) promotes viral entry can be very instrumental in developing drugs and antibody-based therapies that target and block this receptor, therefore eliminating the pathology caused by this virus."

Mungin and colleagues found that Zika virus particles were able to successfully enter vaginal epithelial cells through the UFO receptor, replicate their RNA genome and steadily release infectious viral particles inside the cells.

The research team plans to further study the factors that contribute to Zika replication for insights on how those factors might be interrupted.

Like Zika, many other viruses in the flavivirus family are spread by insects. However, research on those other viruses, such as dengue and yellow fever, does not always translate well to Zika because they are not sexually transmitted "Interestingly, sexual transmission among flaviviruses is in fact unique in nature," said Mungin. "As of now, hepatitis C and Zika virus have been identified as the [only] 2 flaviviruses known to establish infection via sexual contact with an infected partner."

Zika spread rapidly around the world during a major 2015-2016 outbreak, causing about 42 000 infections in the United States and its territories, reported the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the number of cases has since dropped precipitously, the virus is still considered a health threat in many places around the world.

The Zika virus pandemic in the Americas and Caribbean was known to cause over 1 million cases and there were reports in which the virus was found to cause severe, life-threatening complications among patients with associated comorbidities. Furthermore, infants born to mothers infected with Zika have a high risk of birth defects.

According to the CDC, using condoms can prevent sexual transmission of Zika.

In 2018 and 2019, no local mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission has been reported in the continental USA.

A proposed strategy or recommendation for the prophylactic use of a UFO (AXL) blocker is not given, so its practicality for use in the population at risk is uncertain. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Zika congenital syndrome has severe long-term, complex impacts on affected children and their caretakers, demanding state responses even after the withdrawal of the national health emergency status. This paper discusses the narratives and agency roles involved in the policymaking and implementation of a social protection response to the Zika epidemic in Brazil. It analyses the underlying narratives that have framed policy processes related to the Zika congenital syndrome (ZCS) both at the national and subnational level in a moment of political and economic crisis, the state of Rio de Janeiro being the case studied.

Background
Despite the reduction in new cases in 2016, which led the Brazilian state and the WHO to lift the status of health emergency, the long-term and severe impacts of ZCS on poor women and children remain. The disease increased social risks and required a state response that went beyond health treatments, epidemiological surveillance, and vector control. This response, for instance, was delineated in a context of economic and political crisis and was shaped by multiple actors, interests, and narratives at the national, state, and municipal level.

This paper provides an exploratory narrative on the process, discourses, and actors involved in developing and implementing social policies targeted at the population affected by the Zika virus. More specifically, it aims to provide a critical answer to the following research question: what are the underlying narratives and agency roles in the social protection response to the Zika epidemic by the Brazilian state? Considering that policymaking and implementation are complex and iterative processes (Chopra 2011) that occur at multiple sites and layers, this paper presents the narratives at national and subnational levels that permeated the state response from the epidemic outbreak, in November 2015, until December 2018. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: after introducing the methodological choices and research processes, I provide the conceptual framework that guided the analysis, followed by the background to both the Zika epidemic outbreak and social policies in Brazil. Next, I examine the dominant policy narratives that shaped the national response in the field of social protection. The context of the state of Rio de Janeiro, the case study of this paper, is presented in the next section, followed by a narrative analysis of sub-national policy responses. Finally, I offer some conclusions and policy recommendations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
To estimate the prevalence of microcephaly and central nervous system (CNS) defects during the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Colombia and proportion attributable to congenital ZIKV infection.

Study design
Clinical and laboratory data for cases of microcephaly and/or CNS defects reported to national surveillance between 2015 and 2017 were reviewed and classified by a panel of clinical subject matter experts. Maternal and fetal/infant biologic specimens were tested for congenital infection and chromosomal abnormalities. Infants/fetuses with microcephaly and/or CNS defects (cases) were classified into broad etiologic categories (teratogenic, genetic, multifactorial, and unknown). Cases classified as potentially attributable to congenital ZIKV infection were stratified by strength of evidence for ZIKV etiology (strong, moderate, or limited) using a novel strategy considering birth defects unique or specific to ZIKV or other infections and laboratory evidence.

Results
Among 858 reported cases with sufficient information supporting a diagnosis of microcephaly or CNS defects, 503 were classified as potentially attributable to congenital ZIKV infection. Of these, the strength of evidence was considered strong in 124 (24.7%) cases; moderate in 232 (46.1%) cases; and limited in 147 (29.2%). Of the remaining, 355 (41.4%) were attributed to etiologies other than ZIKV infection (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes 1 and herpes 2 viruses only, n = 32 [3.7%]; genetic, n = 16 [1.9%]; multifactorial, n = 42 [4.9%]; unknown, n = 265 [30.9%]).

Conclusions
Although 58% of cases of microcephaly and/or CNS defects were potentially attributable to congenital ZIKV infection, the strength of evidence varied considerably. This surveillance protocol might serve as a model approach for investigation and etiologic classification of complex congenital conditions.
