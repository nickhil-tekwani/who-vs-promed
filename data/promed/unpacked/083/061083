** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by state
and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West Nile
meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence of
neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not state health departments
report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site for further explanations
of neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical information was not
provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC - These numbers reflect both mild and severe
human disease cases occurring from 1 Jan 2005 through 23 Aug 2005 that have
been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments. ArboNet is the
national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist states
in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses. Information
regarding 2006 virus/disease activity is posted when such cases are reported
to CDC.
