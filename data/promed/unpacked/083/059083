Coconut and rubber plantations as well as cocoa farms in the Western
Region are being rehabilitated to increase their yield. The coconut
sector has for many years been one of the main agricultural
activities which serve as a source of livelihood and employment for
the people along the coastal areas.
Unfortunately, the sector has been devastated by a lethal yellowing
disease, locally known as Cape Saint Paul Wilt Disease (CSPWD).
Nationwide, about 4000 hectares of coconut farms in the coastal belt
have been devastated.
A 5-year Coconut Sector Development Project (CSDP) was started
between 1999 and 2005 to rehabilitate the devastated areas and to
revitalize the coconut sector. A total of 800 hectares of coconut
farms were rehabilitated, which also led to the improvement of
yields. Through the application of fertilizers and the cultivation of
high yielding seeds, the yields have doubled from an average of 60
nuts to 120 nuts per tree per year. The project has led to the
employment of over 2000 farmers and processors in the coconut sector
in the region. Although the project has ended, the government
continues to support the industry to help all those who are
interested in rehabilitating their farms.

[Cape St. Paul wilt (CSPW) disease was named from an eastern coastal
location in Ghana where reports of dying coconuts apparently date
back to the 1930s. The disease was thought to be a localised problem,
but eventually it did spread, and in 1975, a previously undocumented
outbreak was identified in the Western region. Since 1985, new
disease foci have developed at an alarming rate in the major
coconut-producing areas of the Western and Central regions. CSPW is
now perceived as a major threat to coconut plantings in neighbouring
Ivory Coast.
CSPW is caused by a phytoplasma of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or
16SrIV) group. The type species is _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae,
which can infect a large number of palm species. A number of LY group
strains have been described from the Caribbean, southern and central
America, East and West Africa, and a number of locations in southern
Asia. LY disease of coconut palm was 1st reported from the Caribbean
region and, by 1981, had killed 90 percent of the Jamaica Tall
variety of coconut palms in Jamaica. The planthopper species _Myndus
crudus_ is thought to spread _C._ P. palmae in Florida, but the
vectors for CSPW and some other LY phytoplasmas are not known yet.
Some evidence for seed-transmission has also been reported for LY
phytoplasmas, including the CSPW pathogen.
Commercial control of LY phytoplasmas is primarily being achieved by
replanting with resistant varieties suitable to the area. Resistance
breeding programmes are in progress in Ghana, but so far all the
hybrids tested seem to be susceptible to some degree. Worldwide, very
few coconut varieties have shown real tolerance to LY diseases, and
the level varies depending on disease pressure and locality.
Breakdown of resistance has also been observed, for example in
Malayan Dwarf hybrids in Jamaica (see ProMED-mail post no. 20070522.1643).
It should be noted that despite the laudable efforts described above,
only 1/5th of the coconut plantings devastated by CSPW could be
restored so far. No information is given as to the type or level of
tolerance of hybrids being used, and it remains to be seen whether
the replanted palms will again succumb to CSPW.
