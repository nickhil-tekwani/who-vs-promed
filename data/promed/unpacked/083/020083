8 autochthonous hepatitis E cases have been diagnosed since 2007 in
the microbiology laboratory of Timone Hospital in Marseille
(southeastern France) in individuals who ate raw figatellu, a
traditional sausage of Corsica, France. Figatelli are widely consumed
in France, and they are good candidates for hepatitis E virus (HEV)
transmission because they are made with pig liver and are commonly
eaten raw.

A case-control study revealed that acute or recent HEV infection was
significantly linked with consumption of raw figatellu. Moreover,
genotype 3 HEV sequences were recovered from 7 figatelli purchased in
supermarkets in southeastern France, and genetic links were found
between these sequences and those recovered from patients who ate raw
figatellu. In each case, the delay between figatellu consumption and
hepatitis onset was compatible with the incubation period of hepatitis
E.

Autochthonous hepatitis E is an emerging disease in industrialized
countries, but the source and route of HEV infections are not known in
most cases despite increasing evidence that it is a zoonosis with pigs
as reservoirs.

In France, more than 100 autochthonous cases are notified per year.
Most of them have occurred in the South, where HEV seroprevalence was
found to be higher than in the North (16.6 percent versus 3.4 percent)
and where 7 fatal cases have been reported. Our findings have been
notified to the French public health authorities, and since May 2009,
an official policy compels the manufacturers of pig liver sausages to
recommend cooking these sausages thoroughly. Indeed, it has been shown
that cooking HEV-containing food products limits their ability to
transmit infectious HEV.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Colson and Gerolami for drawing attention to
this unique example of food-borne transmission of hepatitis E virus
(HEV) infection. We regret an inadvertent delay in posting this
meticulous report.

Although humans have been considered the natural host for HEV,
antibodies to HEV or closely related viruses have been detected in
primates and several other animal species, domestic pigs in particular.

HEV is normally considered to be transmitted via the faecal-oral
route, and hepatitis E is usually regarded as a waterborne disease.
Consumption of faecally contaminated drinking water has been the cause
of most epidemics, but the ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has
been the source of sporadic cases in endemic areas. To this can now be
added the consumption of raw pig liver sausages (figatellu). Indeed,
any food product derived from pig liver should not be consumed
uncooked. - Mod.CP]
