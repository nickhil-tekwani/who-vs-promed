Acute diarrhea has spread to 11 localities in Viet Nam's northern and
central regions, affecting 1011 people since 23 Oct 2007, local
newspaper Pioneer reported Tue 6 Nov 2007. On Monday [5 Nov 2007]
alone, 115 people were admitted to hospitals due to the disease, the
paper quoted a report of the country's Health Ministry.

The affected areas include Hanoi capital city, northern Hai Phong
city, the northern provinces of Hai Duong, Ha Tay, Hung Yen, Thai
Binh, and Bac Ninh, and central Nghe An province. Hanoi has seen the
largest number of acute diarrhea cases.

Most of the patients ate unsafe food such as raw shrimp paste and
seafood salad. To prevent the disease's spread, the ministry has
asked relevant agencies and people to focus on monitoring food
hygiene, disinfecting areas housing patients, and suspending use of
raw shrimp paste in processing food.

[Although cholera is not specifically mentioned in this posting, at
least a significant number of the cases have apparently been
diagnosed as _Vibrio cholerae_ infection as noted in the next report.

This map of the country shows all the provinces clearly

All the other provinces noted are in the northern region (called Mien
Bac) with Thanh Hoa the most southerly. As noted in the last update,
one case in the northernmost province of the central region of Viet
Nam (Nghe An) was reported to have been acquired in Hanoi in the
north but the posting below reports additional cases of diarrhea with
fatality. - Mod.LL]

In a province near Hanoi 2 elderly people have died as health
officials said on Tuesday [6 Nov 2007] that some cases of cholera had
been confirmed among nearly 800 people suffering severe diarrhea in
northern Viet Nam. The state-run newspaper Hanoi Moi (New Hanoi)
quoted Health Minister Nguyen Quoc Trieu as saying the "cholera
bacterium is emerging in 8 out of 11 infected localities."

Officials in Ha Tay province were quoted by the online edition of
Saigon Giai Phong (Liberation Saigon) as saying 2 people aged 72 and
87 had died among 185 infections in the province, about 60 km (35 mi)
southwest of Hanoi. 2 other people had died of suspected diarrhea in
Nghe An province, said Dan Tri (People's Knowledge) online news.

The Health Ministry said 15 percent of the nearly 800 cases reported

With 110 cases of cholera reported in Phuket so far in 2007, the
possibility of an outbreak of the disease has raised fears of the
threat posed to tourism. Phuket Governor Niran Kalayanamit and Dr
Wanchai Sattayawuthipong of the Phuket Provincial Health Office held
a conference call yesterday [5 Nov 2007] with Prime Minister Surayud
Chulanont and Dr Prachit Prarachit, permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Public Health, to discuss the cholera situation in Phuket.

Dr Prachit said that between 1 Jan and 31 Oct 2007, there were 600
cases of cholera spread across 36 provinces. All provinces have been
put on alert to help control the severe diarrheal disease, which is
caused by ingesting contaminated food or water.

Dr Prachit said, "Khon Kaen (221 cases) and Phuket are the areas with
the most reported instances of cholera, although the disease is now
under control. The Ministry of Public Health has worked in each of
the provinces to raise awareness of the disease by asking people to
avoid eating raw food and meat for now."

The last recorded case of cholera in Phuket was on 1 Nov 2007. In
Khon Kaen, a patient suffering from cholera was hospitalized 17 Oct
2007, although there have been no cases since, added Dr Prachit.

The United Nations (UN) representatives from different levels started
monitoring the affected sites where viral cholera was found among the
patients of diarrhea in Saptari district. The UN showed seriousness
after the diarrhea spread in 54 VDCs [village development committees]
of Saptari district has claimed 34 lives. The monitoring teams in the
affected sites include UN officer Leath Beaker, Dr Sarvesh Jha from
UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), Uma Adhikari from UNICEF
(United Nations Children's Fund) among others.

The team from BP Koirala Institute of Health and Science had found
cholera last week that is said to have been eradicated from Nepal a
decade ago, in Saptari district where the incessant rain in monsoon
rendered an outbreak of diarrhea in the district.

[Although this and some earlier reports state that cholera was
'eradicated' from Nepal 10 years ago, ProMED-mail has posted reports
of _V. cholerae_ infection in the country yearly in the past few years.

This report increases the fatality rate in this district by almost 42
percent. Saptari district in the Eastern region is located some 190
km (118 mi) south east of the capital Kathmandu. It can be found on a
map of Nepal at

[5] Diarrhea - Zimbabwe: (Matabeleland North)

More than 3000 cases of diarrhea have been reported in Bulawayo,
Zimbabwe's 2nd city, in the last 2 months, as residents struggle with
water shortages.

"We have so far recorded 3600 cases of diarrhea since the 1st cases
of the outbreak were reported in August 2007, and since then figures
from the city's Health Department indicate that we have been getting
between 300 and 400 new cases of diarrhea every week," said Phathisa
Nyathi, spokesman for the Bulawayo City Council. "We expect the
situation to worsen until we get adequate rains and the water supply
situation normalizes."

Since the outbreak was 1st reported in August 2007, the city has
experienced a 10-fold increase in cases, from 300 to 3600, up to the
2nd week of November 2007.

Low rainfall and an inability to keep up with the demands of a
growing population in a depressed economic environment have left many
of Bulawayo's 1.5 million residents in the grip of water shortages
and often having to obtain water from unprotected sources.

Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said his ministry was monitoring
the situation in Bulawayo and Harare, where diarrhea outbreaks have
also been registered. "We have teams that are dealing with the
outbreak and people are getting treatment in Harare and Bulawayo, and
we have put in programs to contain the outbreak."
