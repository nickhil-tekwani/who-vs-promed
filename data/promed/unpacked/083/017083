[Trichinellosis is a worldwide disease caused by parasitic nematodes of the genus _Trichinella_ and it remains an important zoonosis. 9 species and 3 genotypes of the genus _Trichinella_ are recognized, namely, _T. spiralis_; _T. nativa_ and its related genotype T. T6; _T. britovi_ and its related genotype T. T8; _T. pseudospiralis_; _T. murrelli_ and its related genotype T. T9; _T. nelsoni_; _T. papuae_; _T. zimbabwensis_; and _T. patagoniensis_. The most prevalent species of _Trichinella_ in the Arctic is _T. nativa_, with the polar bear as the main reservoir. Human cases have been reported after consumption of meat from brown, black, or polar bears. - Mod.PMB
