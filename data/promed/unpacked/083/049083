Marine experts suspect a mysterious pathogen has killed tens of thousands
of lobsters in Long Island Sound this fall. The die-off, described as the
worst to hit Long Island Sound in nearly a decade, has alarmed hundreds of
lobstermen in New York and Connecticut and has prompted extensive
laboratory testing by state and Federal environmental officials.
While cautioning much more lab work needs to be done, Gordon C. Colvin, the
marine resources director of the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation, said water quality tests had eliminated two possibilities --
pollution or low levels of oxygen in the water. Blood samples taken from
lobsters had provided no solid evidence of gaffkemia, a common and often
fatal bacterial infection in lobsters.
For years, marine life in the western portion of the Sound has been plagued
by low levels of dissolved oxygen, which can be caused by algae blooms.
When lobster captains complained this summer of small catches, many
attributed the problem to poor oxygen levels. But, Colvin said, oxygen
levels had already returned to normal by the time the die-off began.
The working hypothesis is some other bacterium or virus is killing the
lobsters, which become sluggish before dying although they otherwise appear
normal.
Over the last few weeks, officials in New York and Connecticut have taken
blood from lobsters and sent it to several laboratories, including the
University of Arizona in Tucson, the Food and Drug Administration in
Washington and the National Marine Fisheries Service in Milford,
Connecticut (Conn.).
So far, there is no reason to fear eating lobsters from the Sound, said
Byron H. Young, chief of the finfish and crustacean unit of the New York
Department of Environmental Conservation. No one has reported getting sick
after eating lobster, and cooking lobsters in boiling water would kill any
microbes, Young said. "If the lobster is alive and kicking, there is no
reason to believe there is a problem," he said.
But for those who fish the Sound, the problem is too many lobsters are
already dead by the time they are pulled from traps. In recent weeks, some
lobstermen have stopped fishing altogether.
Jeff W. Carbone, the owner of Portland Maine Seafood Company in Huntington,
N.Y., said he was mystified. "I've never experienced anything like it and
I've been doing this for more than 30 years," he said. Carbone's lobster
supply house holds up to 25 000 pounds of live lobsters in its water tanks.
"Most of them look like a perfect lobster," he said. "They cook fine. They
eat good. Visually there's nothing wrong that you can see. But they keep
dying. They're dying every day, and the scary thing is we'll never know how
many didn't get in the traps. How many are down there dead?"
Marine experts say they are unsure of the full scope of the die-off, which
was reported late last week in several Long Island newspapers. Offering
what he described as a conservative estimate, Young said "tens of
thousands" of lobsters have died already, with roughly 8 of every 100
captured lobsters coming up dead. Blue crabs and rock crabs, too, are
dying, officials said.
Lobster boats first began reporting the deaths about 6 weeks ago,
particularly in the western third of Long Island Sound.
Millions of lobsters are caught in the Sound each year, with summer being
the prime season for lobstering, an increasingly important component of the
local fishing industry. New York alone has 900 commercially licensed
lobstermen, and lobsters now rate ahead of clams as the state's most
valuable maritime crop.
Deepening the mystery, he said, is the fact other die-offs have been
observed several times this decade. "We've had reports of lobsters in this
condition since 1990," Colvin said. "It usually starts in early autumn, and
then it seems to end by late October when the water gets good and cold.
Last year's was worse than the other years, until now."
Microbial activity tails off when the water cools, but the patterns of the
lobster die-off are difficult to read. In some parts of the Sound, such as
the waters off Greenwich, Conn., half the lobsters in a trap may come up
dead. Other times all the lobsters are fine.
Much of the initial laboratory work has been done by Richard Robohm, a
microbiologist for the National Marine Fisheries Service in Milford. He
searched for evidence of bacteria in blood from 10 lobsters recovered by
Connecticut environmental officials. In 9 of the 10 lobsters, he said, "the
blood looked fine."
But in the 10th lobster, he found evidence of bacteria. The results, he
said, suggest only one clear conclusion -- that more testing must be done.
"It's a mystery," he said.
