On [Fri 27 Apr 2018], the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed a case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in a Clearwater County, Alberta, horse. The horse had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian to comply with an organized club's requirements. No clinical signs of disease were noted at the time of sampling.

A CFIA investigation is underway and as per program policy quarantine has been placed on the infected animal and its on-premises contact animals. The quarantine will remain until all disease response activities have been completed, including follow-up testing and ordering the destruction of positive cases. Trace-out activities might require the CFIA to undertake actions at additional premises as outlined in the current program policy.
