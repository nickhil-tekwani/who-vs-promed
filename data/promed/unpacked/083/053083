Reports from the northeastern Watsa area, where an outbreak
of haemorrhagic fever has been identified, describe the security
situation as quiet. A medical team - including MSF, WHO and
Congolese doctors - says cooperation from the rebel authorities
in the area has been good. In a report received by IRIN, the
team noted that most of the victims in nearby Durba, were male
adults between 30 and 50 years of age, most of them working
illegally at the local goldmines.
The report noted that most of these workers, known as
"orpailleurs", are exploiting mines that have been abandoned.
They live in primitive and unsanitary surroundings, and their
working conditions are very often unhygienic. The majority of
them travel to Uganda to sell their gold and the areas they transit
will have to be investigated, the report stated.
So far, around 60 people have died. Tests conducted on 5 samples
in South Africa last week revealed one case of the Marburg virus.
A humanitarian flight bringing medical personnel and equipment from
Kinshasa landed in Watsa on Saturday, after a refuelling stop in Goma,
according to a statement from the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in the
DRC capital. The direct flight, facilitated by UNHCR, carried a team of
Congolese and WHO epidemiologists. This was the first direct flight
between Kinshasa and rebel-held territory since the war broke out last
August [1998].
Meanwhile, several cases resembling the "Durba syndrome", as the
disease is known, have been observed in the Bumba area of Province
Equateur, humanitarian sources told IRIN on Monday.

Disease Outbreaks Reported, 12 May 1999
As of 10 May, 90 suspected cases had been reported, of which 5 are in
hospital and 7 have recovered. The total number of deaths is currently
unknown. ***None of the patients in the isolation unit have shown clinical
features typical of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF).*** [*** added - Mod.JW]
The outbreak has featured unusual deaths among young men, the
majority of whom were involved in mining activities in Durba. There
have also been reports from several families of chains of transmission,
including a significant number of deaths.
To date, only one case of Marburg virus infection has been confirmed
by laboratory testing and results from contacts tested so far have been
negative for VHF [for any of the know agents of VHF (viral hemorrhagic
fever) - Mod CHC].
On 10 May [1999], a survivor of a similar outbreak which took place in
1994 was confirmed positive for IgG [antibody] against Marburg virus
by the National Institute for Virology (South Africa).
The investigation is being coordinated by a special committee set up
by the local authorities, including experts from the Ministry of Health,
WHO, _Medecins sans frontieres_ and the [US] Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Control efforts are now focusing on finding
active and convalescent cases to obtain laboratory confirmation of
the diagnosis of VHF, and tracking contacts. Investigations will also
aim to determine the original source of the outbreak and risk factors,
to follow up on reports of deaths from VHF and to document secondary
transmission.
An ecological team from the National Institute for Virology is expected to
arrive in the area shortly to carry out a detailed study of possible animal
sources.
