Yellowing cane disease sours crop forecast
------------------------------------------
Australia's largest sugar producer says crops in north Queensland will be significantly affected because of a mysterious disease that turns cane yellow.

Researchers have been unable to determine the cause of yellow canopy syndrome, which has been found in fields in the Burdekin, near Cairns and now in Mackay.

A spokesman says that the crop forecast for Australia's most productive cane region, the Burdekin, has been reduced by more than 500 000 tonnes.

"There's not much doubt with some trials that we've done and some others have done that [in] the affected cane the root system is starting to die, so you're going to get very low yields, very low sugar content," he said. "You're also likely to get a higher level of impurities in the cane, which makes it harder to process."

[Yellow canopy syndrome was only recently reported in Queensland and does not resemble any known diseases of the crop. It appears to spread southwards, but its means of transmission are unknown. Next to cane fields, similar symptoms have also been observed in grasses, which are therefore suspected as potential disease reservoirs. Transport restrictions on the movement of cane between districts have been introduced in an attempt to limit its spread, and some cane varieties have been reported to be more susceptible than others. An infectious cause is considered likely, but accurate diagnosis will be essential for providing control strategies. Research is being undertaken at the Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations (BSES).
