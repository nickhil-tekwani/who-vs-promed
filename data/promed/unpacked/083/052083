Tomato zonate spot virus (TZSV; proposed): a significant new tospovirus of
vegetable crops in Yunnan, China
-----------------------------------------
In 2005, a devastating virus-like disease was observed on field-grown
tomatoes and chili peppers in Yunnan Province, China. Diseased plants
exhibited concentric zoned ringspots on ripe fruits and necrotic lesions on
leaves. Based on particle morphology, host range, and serological
properties, the causal agent of this disease was determined to be a new
species of _Tospovirus_, tentatively named Tomato zonate spot virus (TZSV).

Symptoms of TZSV infection varied widely, depending on the cultivar, stage
of plant growth at the time of infection, and environmental conditions.
Plants infected in the early stages of growth were severely stunted and
failed to produce fruit. If older plants were infected, young fruit were
often malformed and showed slightly sunken patches or rings of small
necrotic flecks, while on ripe fruit the concentric ringspots were more
conspicuous. Internal necrotic lesions, which developed on the stem of
infected plants, sometimes resulted in plant death.

Mechanical inoculation of experimental test plants revealed that members of
the _Solanaceae_ plant family were more susceptible to TZSV infection than
plants of other families. During field surveys, leaves of carnation
(_Dianthus caryophyllus_), taro (_Colocasia esculenta_), curly dock (_Rumex
crispus_) and spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) were also found displaying
TZSV-like symptoms, and when tested, reacted positively to TZSV-specific
antiserum. These results suggest that TZSV has a wide host range that
includes both agricultural crops and ornamental plant species. Three thrips
species (_Frankliniella occidentalis_, _Thrips palmi_ and _T. tabaci_),
potential vectors of TZSV, were also found in the fields surveyed, however,
confirmation of disease transmission by these thrips is still under
investigation.

Vegetable crops like tomato and capsicum are hosts to dozens of different
viruses, many with diverse biological properties and highly variable
impacts. Keeping track of these viruses, their hosts, distributions, and
potential pathways, make phytosanitary regulation of these types of
organisms difficult. However, given that TZSV is at this time only known
from one part of China, its exclusion from other vegetable production areas
may be a worthwhile objective.

[Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of
infecting a large range of crops and consequently research on this virus
group has increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, many new
tospoviruses are being found and many more can be expected to exist.

The type member, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), has one of the
broadest host ranges among plant viruses and is one of few affecting both
dicot and monocot hosts. It is regarded as one of the most economically
destructive plant pathogens and has had a serious impact on many crop
species worldwide causing up to 100 per cent yield loss in some instances.
For more information on TSWV, see links and previous posts listed below.

Tospoviruses are transmitted exclusively by species of thrips, which are
found worldwide. Transmission occurs in a circulative propagative manner
meaning that the virus multiplies in the vector. Nymphs must emerge on an
infected host plant to be able to acquire the virus, which is then spread
by the adult insects. Thus, tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease
management of tospoviruses includes vector control, use of clean planting
material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitation, and
use of resistant crop cultivars if available.

Trying to limit the spread of plant pathogens by applying phytosanitary
measures, as suggested above for the new TZSV in vegetables, should be
general practice to protect all crops worldwide. Even if a pathogen is
known to exist in a certain region, quarantine regulations are vital to
prevent re-introduction which may lead to the establishment of different
and potentially more damaging strains (as has been reported on a number of
occasions for different pathogens and locations). Furthermore, eradication
of plant pathogens, once they are introduced to a new area, has been shown
to be very rarely successful in the past.
