[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 62 cases with no new deaths, compared with 51 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (26 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 78 consecutive days. There were 40 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (14), Gyeonggi (13), Daejeon (6), Gwangju (4), Jeollanam (3), Chungbuk (1), and Jeonbuk (1), and 22 imported cases -- airport quarantine (16), Gyeonggi (4), Seoul (1), and Chungnam (1). There were 10 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative positive testing rate has been 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/) steady for the past 48 hours.

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 62 newly confirmed cases are available at the English language page, notice 401 https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 240 136 cases, including 34 716 deaths, up by +175 cases and +8 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (26 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +255 cases and +30 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 77 newly confirmed cases, down from 156 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (77). Emilia-Romagna (42), Lazio (18) Tuscany (12) and Piedmont (11), are the 4 provinces reporting more than 10 newly confirmed cases but fewer than 50. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (6 provinces reported no new cases).

Italy is now 53 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 37 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. Northern Italy still warrants close monitoring.

[4] Iran: 220 180 total cases, 10 364 deaths
Date: Sat 27 Jun 2020

Iran's supreme leader warned on Saturday [27 Jun 2020] that the country's economic problems would worsen if the coronavirus spreads unchecked, saying the initial momentum to contain it had since "waned."

The Islamic republic has struggled to curb the COVID-19 outbreak since it reported its 1st cases in the Shiite holy city of Qom in February 2020. It shut down non-essential businesses, closed schools, and canceled public events in March 2020, but the government gradually lifted restrictions from April 2020 to try to reopen the country's sanctions-hit economy.

"It is correct to say that something must be done to prevent economic problems caused by the coronavirus," said Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "But in the case of negligence and significant spread of the disease, economic problems will increase, too," he said in a meeting with judiciary officials, according to his official website.

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman said there had been 2456 new cases of COVID-19 infection in the past 24 hours, raising the country's caseload to 220 180. Sima Sadat Lari added in televised remarks that 125 of those infected had died during the same period, with overall fatalities reaching 10 364.

"The sacrifice of health workers, efforts by volunteer groups, and overall cooperation by the people made Iran one of the world's successful countries" in controlling the outbreak, Khamenei said. "But that was early in the (outbreak), and now, unfortunately, that momentum and effort has waned among some of the people and authorities," he added.

Official figures have shown a rising trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May 2020, when Iran hit a near 2-month low in daily recorded infections.

Iran has refrained from imposing a mandatory lockdown on people to stop the virus' spread but has called for mask-wearing to be made compulsory.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 596 537, including 128 152 deaths, an increase from 2 552 956 cases and 127 640 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 211 229 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 27 Jun 2020, including 17 779 confirmed deaths and an additional 4662 probable deaths, representing an increase of 321 newly confirmed cases and 26 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Nevada, Alabama, Ohio, and Illinois. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. The top 8 states each reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1099 to 9585.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona (which surpassed Michigan in the last 24 hours). A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.8%. Of note is that the 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 27.9% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay increased from week 24 (6.5%) to week 25 (7.6%), consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country.
