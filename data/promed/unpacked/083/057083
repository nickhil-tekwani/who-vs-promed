A medical source at the Zaidia rural hospital north of the city of Hodeidah, western Yemen, reported the death of 9 people, including 3 children, after severe watery diarrhea and vomiting, likely to have cholera. The source explained in an interview with "Newsmen" that the center for the treatment of cholera patients in the hospital Zaidiyah received during 3 days 87 cases with watery diarrhea from the center of the district and the monasteries located west of the city.

The source said that the outbreak of the epidemic was expected due to the failure to complete the preventive measures that were supposed to be completed in October 2018, accusing the Houthi group, the Iranian arm in Yemen, with the obstruction of the work of the teams on water wells and the completion of periodic inspections according to the epidemiological surveillance map prepared by The Health Office of the Directorate and a UNICEF specialist team. He warned of the high number of victims of cholera, noting that most of the tests proved that the cases that reached the center were positive, which means that cholera began to spread in the absence of medical centers and medicines, as well as failure to respond to repeated calls. He stressed that the Houthi militia prevented many organizations from reaching the Directorate and intervening to put an end to the epidemic.

In all, 33 people died of cholera in September and October 2018 in the Zaydi district north of Hodeidah. The Houthi militia then allowed a shipment of medicines from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and a partial intervention by UNICEF in the Directorate. However, the Houthi militia did not allow UNICEF to complete preventive measures and periodic water checks in the area.

[I have not seen more cumulative numbers on cholera in Yemen in several months, although characteristically the number of cases slows early in the year.

In the 1st half of 2018, the rate of reported cases of cholera had slowed to fewer than 1000 per month (about 30 per day), but a dramatic upswing has once again occurred, with about 21 000 cases reported in the first 2 weeks of September 2018 (about 1500 per day), more than 13 000 in the 1st week of October 2018 (about 1900 cases per day), and about 14 500 in the 3rd week of October (about 2100 cases per day). This report documents about 12 300 cases in the 1st week of November 2018.

The low case fatality rate might suggest that some of the diarrhea may be non-cholera.

A list of cases and deaths from May 2017 through the current report in this horrific epidemic fed by war and famine is shown below:
