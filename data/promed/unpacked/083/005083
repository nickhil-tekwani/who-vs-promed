Re:international disinsection requirements in response to the West Nile
outbreak [in New York. Only Brazil has responded, and they have imposed
requirements only for flights from the NYC area.
DOT's Office of Environment, Energy, and Safety (202) 366-4849 website,
that lists country disinsection requirements, including Brazil's, is
located at <http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safety/disin.htm>
Here is the text copied from that site:
----------------------------------------------------------------
AIRCRAFT DISINSECTION REQUIREMENTS
Disinsection is permitted under international law in order to protect
public health, agriculture and the environment.
The World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation
Organization stipulate two approaches for aircraft disinsection -- either
spray the aircraft cabin, with an aerosolized insecticide, while passengers
are on board or treat the aircraft's interior surfaces with a residual
insecticide (residual method) while passengers are not on board.
Panama and American Samoa have adopted a third method, in which aircraft
are sprayed with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are not on board.
Although the Report of the Informal Consultation on Aircraft Disinsection
sponsored by the World Health Organization (November 6-10, 1995) concluded
that aircraft disinsection, if performed appropriately, would not present a
risk to human health, the report also noted that some individuals may
experience transient discomfort following aircraft disinsection by aerosol
application.
Although few countries now require that aircraft be disinsected, most
countries reserve the right to do so, and, as such, could impose a
disinsection requirement should they perceive a threat to their public
health, agriculture or environment. Accordingly, travelers are advised to
check with their travel agent or airline reservations agent when booking
flights. Listed below are representatives of airlines who are knowledgeable
on disinsection requirements:
