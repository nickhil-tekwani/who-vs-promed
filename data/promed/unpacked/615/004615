On Thu 2 Aug 2018, the minister of health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited Beni and Mangina, North Kivu province, accompanied by a team of 12 experts from the Ministry of Health and officials from different partner agencies, including WHO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and MONUSCO, to assess the situation and needs in the field. The delegation from Kinshasa was welcomed in Beni by the governor of North Kivu Province, the provincial minister of health, the mayor of the city, and the general who coordinates the military operations in the region. They held a 1st meeting at which the national minister explained the principles and components of the response to be put in place. It was decided to set up the coordination headquarters in Beni, where the INRB laboratory technicians from the delegation remained to set up the mobile laboratory. The mobile laboratory has been operational since Thursday [02 Aug 2018] afternoon. Then, a safe convoy accompanied the delegation to Mangina, the probable epicenter of this 10th epidemic. Mangina is about 30 km [18.6 mi] from Beni and 400 m [0.25 mi] from the neighboring health area of Makeke, in Ituri province. They were warmly welcomed by the population of this health zone, who was happy to see that, less than 24 hours after the declaration of the epidemic, the national authorities were already at their side to start the response. They visited the Mangina Reference Health Center (CSR) where some active cases are hospitalized in an isolated area of the center. The epidemiological surveillance, care and coordination teams of the Ministry of Health remained in Mangina to assist local health workers and install the various components of the response. As a reminder, of the 6 samples tested by the INRB on the night of Tue 31 Jul 2018, 4 were found to be positive for Ebola virus serotype Zaire.

[The discussions of the different ebolavirus species in the posts that follow, with the question which is the one causing the current outbreak and whether the vaccine would be effective if it is not Zaire, are now moot for this outbreak, but do pertain to future outbreaks that may not be Zaire. The question still remains whether contact tracing and ring vaccination are possible in North Kivu, DRC, where access is difficult and possibly dangerous. - Mod.LK]

[2] Ebola: new outbreak

Four people have tested positive for Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) just days after another outbreak that killed 33 people in the northwest was declared over, the health ministry said on [Wed 1 Aug 2018].

Twenty people have already died from hemorrhagic fevers in and around Mangina, a densely populated town about 30 km (18 miles) southwest of the city of Beni and 100 km [62 miles] from the Ugandan border, the ministry said in its statement, without saying when the deaths occurred.

A team of 12 experts from Congo's health ministry will arrive in Beni on [Thu 2 Aug 2018] to set up a mobile lab, the ministry said. The World Health Organization has started moving staff and supplies to the area, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

They head to a region where deep security problems could complicate efforts to contain the virus. About 1000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people. [N.B.: The virology blog site, Virology Down Under, states the DRC conflict has resulted in thousands of cases of sexual violence, food insecurity among 9.5 million people, 4.7 million internally displaced people, and 2.7 million refugees (http://virologydownunder.com/a-second-outbreak-of-an-ebolavirus-ine-th-drc/). - Mod.LK]

"This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population," Peter Salama, WHO Deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response, said in a statement.

Jeremy Konyndyk, an aid expert at the Center for Global Development, said other recent Ebola outbreaks had fortunately been in relatively safe and stable areas. "North Kivu is a different story, which makes me a little nervous," he said.

The area also has strong trade with neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, raising the risk of the virus moving internationally.

Julie Hall, chief of staff at the International Federation of the Red Cross, said the Ebola response in North Kivu would be a "highly complex" operation.

The ministry said no evidence linked this outbreak with the last one, which began in April [2018] and occurred over 2500 km (1553 miles) away in northwestern Congo.

This is the central African country's 10th outbreak since 1976, when the virus was discovered near the eponymous Ebola river in the north. That is more than twice as many as any other country.

Ebola is believed to be spread over long distances by bats and can turn up in bush meat sold at food markets throughout Congo. Once present in humans, it causes hemorrhagic fever, vomiting, and diarrhea and is spread through direct contact with body fluids.

An outbreak concentrated in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea killed at least 11 300 people between 2013 and 2016.

Congolese and international health officials were credited with responding rapidly to the last outbreak, including by deploying an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck, one of several vaccines being developed against Ebola. But the Merck vaccine is designed to be used against the Zaire strain of Ebola, and there has been no confirmation of the strain in the latest outbreak, with the WHO calling it only "presumptive Ebola." A WHO spokesman declined to comment on possible vaccine use.

Aside from the vaccine, the key factors in halting the previous outbreak appeared to be aggressive tracing of potential patients and the speed of the response.

The WHO said the fact that it already had staff and equipment in place would give it a head start against the new outbreak. "Ebola is a constant threat in DRC. What adds to our confidence in the country's ability to respond is the transparency they have displayed once again," WHO head Tedros said. "We will fight this one as we did the last."

[The danger of working in this region was also discussed in ProMED-mail Archive no. 20180801.5941427. Congo's east is volatile, with dozens of rebel groups staging attacks and vying for mineral-rich land. The health ministry said it has put in place security to protect a team of health experts arriving on Thu 2 Aug 2018]. Travel into and out of the village of Mangina has been blocked [excerpted from Washington Post (https://tinyurl.com/y7xyjuj7)].

It should also be noted that the affected region is near 2 of Africa's best-known wildlife parks, Virunga and Rwenzori.

North Kivu province, the site of the current outbreak, borders Rwanda and Uganda. Beni has been the site of intense fighting in recent decades, and between 2014 and 2016, more than 800 people were killed in the area, many of them by machete. Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group, was blamed alongside Congolese army officers for the killings.

The Bikoro outbreak was contained using an experimental vaccine provided by Merck that targeted the Ebola Zaire strain. The World Health Organization raised USD 36 million from a variety of countries (Huffington Post). There are 6 species of ebolavirus. Most Ebola outbreaks in the DRC have been caused by Ebola Zaire, but Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV), caused a large outbreak in western Uganda in 2007 (1) and in the DRC in 2012 (2), in Orientale Province in the NE (ProMED-mail thanks Helen Branswell for pointing out these recent outbreaks in the region that were a different ebolavirus species than Ebola Zaire).

Sequence analysis will determine which species is the current etiologic agent, and possibly confirm or cast doubt on this being a new outbreak. It is a remote possibility that the current outbreak is an extension of the 9th DRC outbreak because of the distance between the 2: 2500 km [1553 mi]. One hopes it is Ebola Zaire again, because the Merck vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV is designed against Zaire, as is the anti-viral ZMapp. It is unclear whether rVSV-ZEBOV, designed against Zaire Ebola virus, affords some level of cross-protection against other species of Ebola virus.

There is some hope that it would, as researchers assessed the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine's potential for protection against newly emerging, phylogenetically related strains by immunizing macaques prior to challenge with Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BEBOV). "A single vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV provided significant cross-protection (75 percent survival), suggesting that monovalent rVSV-based vaccines can be useful against newly emerging species" (www.ScienceTranslationalMedicine.org. 9 Dec 2015; 7(317): 24). http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/7/317. - Mod.LK]

[3] Preparedness

The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced today [Wed 1 Aug 2018] that preliminary laboratory results indicate a cluster of cases of Ebola virus in North Kivu province. The announcement was issued little more than a week after the Ministry of Health declared the end of an outbreak in Equateur Province in the far western part of the country, some 2500 km [1553 mi] from North Kivu.

The Ministry of Health of the DRC informed WHO that 4 out of 6 samples tested positive for ebolavirus at the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB) in Kinshasa. Further testing is ongoing.

"Ebola is a constant threat in the DRC," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. "What adds to our confidence in the country's ability to respond is the transparency they have displayed once again. Working closely with the Ministry of Health and partners, we will fight this one as we did the last."

The Government was quick to provide public updates, with press releases on [Mon 30 Jul 2018] and [Wed 1 Aug 2018].

"Since we are coming out of another Ebola outbreak, we have kept staff and equipment in place," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "This allows us to have a head start in response to this cluster."

The majority of the cases are in the Mangina health area, which is 30 km [18.6 mi] from the city of Beni. "This new cluster is occurring in an environment that is very different from where we were operating in the northwest," said Dr Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general, Emergency Preparedness and Response. "This is an active conflict zone. The major barrier will be safely accessing the affected population."

North Kivu hosts over 1 million displaced people. The province shares borders with Rwanda and Uganda with a great deal of cross border movement due to the trade activities. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries to ensure health authorities are alerted and prepared to respond.

A delegation composed of the minister of health and his 12 experts, the deputy special representative of the UN secretary general and the governor of North Kivu has arrived this afternoon [Thu 2 Aug 2018] in Beni (North Kivu). The team has just responded to the outbreak of Ebola reported in the locality of Mangina located 30 km [18.6 mi] from the city of Beni.

"I would like to congratulate the government for this quick response. We came with teams; we will visit Mangina in a few minutes. This means that the response is already underway," said David Gressly, UN deputy special representative. "MONUSCO will support this response. We will give especially logistical assistance, and if there is need, we will also support the security side. We are here to listen and learn the needs, and once we have all these details, we will begin to implement our support," he added.

This is the 10th Ebola outbreak reported in the DRC. According to data from the Ministry of Health, 20 deaths have already been reported in the health wing of Mangina located in the health zone of Mabalako, Beni territory, in the province of North Kivu.

[This report states that MONUSCO will provide logistical support and security. This organization is described in https://monusco.unmissions.org/en/resources. The United Nations (UN) in the DRC consists of a peacekeeping mission and 22 programs, funds, and specialized agencies working together and alongside the Congolese government for the stabilization and development of the DRC while providing humanitarian assistance to the needy. Its interventions are derived from the resolutions of the Security Council that secure the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) for the period 2013-2017 developed jointly with the DRC government.

DRC is a UN member since 1960, participating in discussions about the role and missions of the UN and thus influences the way in which its priorities are defined and its programs implemented. - Mod.LK
