Article 8.10.2. of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2009
edition), the free status of a country is not affected by the
isolation of Bat Lyssavirus.

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted

[The European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL) belongs to a series of viruses in
the rabies family which can cause disease in both animals and humans.
However, both the EBL-1 and EBL-2, are much less of a threat in
Europe than bat rabies in the United States or Australia. Only 4
human deaths have occurred since the 1st one recorded in the Ukraine
in 1977, 2 subsequent cases in 1985 in Russia and Finland, and a more
recent death in Scotland in 2002. This virus has been isolated from
630 bats between 1977 and 2000, largely in Denmark, France, Germany,
the Netherlands, and Spain. See Eurosurveillance article referenced below.

ProMED-mail wishes to thank Dr. Thomas Muller, Director WHO
Collaborating Center on Rabies Surveillance and Research, Institute
of Epidemiology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Germany. He most
kindly shed some light on how to interpret these tests when the bats
are testing positive on FAVN but negative on PCR and without clinical
signs. Dr. Muller suggests the following: (i) The problem of
standardization and validation of modified serological assays, e.g.
RFFIT and FAVN, for use in bats is not solved yet. Hence,
unfortunately, results obtained in serosurveys in free-living bats
across the world cannot not be compared. So the question is what does
seropositivity in this case mean? (ii) Per definition, a rabies case
should only be declared a case if the animals turned out to be
positive in the gold standard, e.g. FAT and/or confirmatory test
(RTCIT or MIT).

Photographs and videos of a Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_)
can be viewed at:

This site, ARKive, has a great introduction by Sir David
Attenborough, information and videos about a wide range of animals,
an emphasis on endangered species, and appears to be a great wildlife resource.
