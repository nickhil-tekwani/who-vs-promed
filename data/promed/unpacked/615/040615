One diagnosis that should undoubtedly be considered is melioidosis. The disease has been reported in humans in Assam (ref 1), and clusters of infection frequently follow flooding and severe weather events.

Goats are relatively susceptible, and nasal discharge and pneumonia are common manifestations (ref 2).

Culturing the organism should be relatively easy if this is the cause, as long as the investigators are familiar with it, which is not always the case.
