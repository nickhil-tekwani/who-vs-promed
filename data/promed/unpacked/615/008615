[Israel has experienced an FMD epizootic during 2018, comprising 10 reported outbreaks in its northern district ("Hazafon"), which started 2 Apr 2018 (1st outbreak), affecting cattle, sheep, wildlife (numerous mountain gazelles and several captive deer). All outbreaks, including the last one which started 7 Jul 2018, were declared resolved on 16 Jul 2018. All outbreaks were caused by a newly introduced FMDV strain, namely O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15), against which the applied vaccine was regarded as matching.

FMD has also been reported during 2018 from 4 locations in the West Bank (Palestinian Authority), where it is, reportedly still "continuing". The virus strain in the West Bank has not been serotyped nor genotyped, but considered to be similar to the one reported from Israel.

The current outbreak in Maghar, a municipality of about 22 000 inhabitants between Israel's Lower and Upper Galilee (map at https://goo.gl/maps/bot3dh3GzaH2), has been, likely, caused by the same virus strain; however, genotyping is expected to be performed.

The SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15) virus strain has probably been circulating during 2018 in the territories of other Middle-Eastern countries, including neighboring Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan. All mentioned outbreaks in Israel and the West Bank, during 2018, can be seen on OIE's interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/y75sed53 (click on Israel, zoom in). The absence of reports from other countries in the Middle east is striking.

FMD has been characterized in Israel, for decades, by a seasonal pattern; in most cases epizootics starting during January-March, peaking in May. In 2018, the virus seems to continue its circulation longer than usual. This deserves further investigation.

In Mid-May 2018, the following comment was included in posting 20180515.5798415:
"The possible role of wild boar in FMD virus dissemination deserves to be further investigated. _Suidae_ are regarded as the most prolific amplifiers of the FMD virus and have long been signified as the origin of airborne spread of the virus for considerable distances. Sampling of sera and other relevant tissues from wild boars in the Jordan valley, and their testing, should shed more light upon the role of wild boar in the epidemiology of FMD in Israel, Jordan and the region at large. It will be interesting to note whether the virus spreads further in domestic animals as well as wildlife, similar to the scenario in 1985, when gazelles were severely affected." - Mod.AS
