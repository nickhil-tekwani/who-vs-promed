Dead crow found in Windsor confirmed positive for West Nile virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
WINDSOR (Ontario): A dead crow found in a neighborhood in this southwestern
Ontario city 2 weeks ago was analyzed by Dr Harvey Artsob, chief of
zoonotic diseases at Health Canada, and found to be positive following 3
different sets of specialized tests. Preliminary tests had suggested that
the bird carried the virus.
Artsob said he was not surprised by Wednesday's positive result. He
examined a crow from the area last year that tested positive for the virus
on a first test, but because of its decayed condition, could not be
confirmed on follow up tests. "Windsor is a perfect location to expect the
virus to show up because of its warm climate and proximity to the positive
sites in the US," Artsob said from Winnipeg.
Finding the virus in Ontario now puts scientists, medical officials, and
the public on alert, said Dr Ian Barker, coordinator of the Ontario Region
Canadian Co-op Wildlife Health Centre in Guelph, Ont. "The measures to be
taken now are preventative, with people having to protect themselves from
mosquitoes by using various repellents," said Barker.
West Nile virus is carried by mosquitoes and transmitted to animals and
humans. People bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus will experience
flu-like symptoms to varying degrees. Most will have a mild reaction; a
rare few will develop an inflammation of the brain which can lead to death.
