Rabid skunk prompts calls to vaccinate pets
-------------------------------------------
With spring almost here, some amorous skunks are on the prowl looking
for love. But that means these wild creatures, which can carry deadly
diseases such as rabies, are more likely to come into contact with
our own domestic animals.

In the 1st such case listed in Williamson County in almost a year, a
skunk that was found dead near Bennett Hollow Road in the
Bethesda-Arno area recently tested positive for rabies. The skunk,
which was found by the landowner, appeared to have been killed by dogs.

The dogs that are suspected in the skunk's death were not up to date
with their annual rabies shots but were late by only a few weeks. In
the past, they had received preventative inoculations.

The state will have to decide whether the dogs will be safe by just
receiving booster shots or not.

"This happened just as I was putting together the information on our
rabies clinics," said Debby Leddy, assistant director of Williamson
County Animal Control. "It just really brought home the importance of
making sure your pets are up to date in their shots. I can't stress
that enough."

After infection, rabies is almost always fatal. Not only that, but it
is often highly contagious and transmitted through the infected
animal's saliva usually through bites. However, transmission of the
viral disease to animals is preventable with annual inoculations.
Humans also can catch the disease with the same painful and deadly
consequences.

"Usually you can tell very easily if a skunk has rabies. It will act
very obviously odd," Leddy said.

The last official case of a rabid skunk in Williamson County was
documented in April 2009, she said.

[Each state has its own set of guidelines regarding rabies
vaccinations and quarantines. While many of them follow national
recommendations, they may vary a bit from those. How the dogs are
viewed may also depend upon which type of vaccine was used. Some
vaccines are recommended to repeated in one year, while others are
not recommended for revaccination for 3 years. A force with the
American Animal Hospital Association is current examining the issue
of core vaccinations and frequency of those vaccinations.

As a follow up on this, ProMED-mail would appreciate an authority
from Tennessee letting us know the regulations and how these animals
were viewed with regard to vaccinations and possible/probable
exposure to rabies.

Clearly, a campaign to remind owners to vaccinate their companion
animals, including horses and cattle is appropriate. Included in the
campaign should be issues on avoiding wild animals that are acting
odd and to report those events to the local animal control. - Mod.TG]
