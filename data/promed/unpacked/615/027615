In response to your enquiry about imported cases of cholera into the UK...
we understand that three cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 El Tor Ogawa were
reported to WHO in July 1998. One case was in an adult male who became ill
during a holiday in Pakistan. A second case occurred in an adult female
returning from Tunisia and a third case in a teenage male, also travelling
from Tunisia.
