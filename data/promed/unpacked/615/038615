A 9-year-old unvaccinated Quarter Horse gelding from Pendleton County, Kentucky, tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV) on [Tue 28 Aug 2018]. This is the 1st confirmed case of WNV in Kentucky horses for 2018.

In a statement, E.S. Rusty Ford, equine operations consultant for the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office, said the gelding is alive and in stable condition, and it has a favorable prognosis. Ford said the gelding presented on [Sun 23 Aug 2018] with lower-lip paresis and muscle fasciculation (twitching). During the following 48 hours, the gelding developed progressive hind-limb ataxia (incoordination) and became recumbent (unable to rise).

"The patient remains hospitalized under treatment tonight (Tue 28 Aug 2018) and continues to improve," Ford said. "Earlier this evening the ... gelding was found to be bright, alert, and responsive; able to rise with assistance and stand; and eating and drinking well." The horse was not vaccinated against WNV, he added.

In 2017, animal-health officials confirmed 15 cases of WNV in Kentucky horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

Horses from Holmes, Medina, and Tuscarawas counties, [Ohio], have tested positive for West Nile virus thus far in 2018.

Ohio animal-health officials have confirmed additional cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in that state, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported this week [week of 27 Aug 2018]. The recently confirmed cases bring the total number of cases of WNV in Ohio horses this year to 4.

On 28 Aug 2018, the EDCC said the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) confirmed 2 WNV cases.

"An unvaccinated 4-year-old Standardbred gelding at a private facility in Tuscarawas County presented with a fever of 103 deg F/39.4 deg C on [Wed 15 Aug 2018]," the EDCC said. "A serum sample was collected that day and was positive for IgM antibody by capture ELISA assay. The horse appeared clinically healthy as of [Fri 24 Aug 2018] after receiving supportive treatment and care."

Additionally, "an unvaccinated 8-year-old Haflinger gelding in Medina County presented on [Sun 19 Aug 2018] with clinical signs including a temperature of 103.7 deg F/ 39.8 deg C; a stiff, stilted gait; inability or reluctance to move; tremors over shoulders and neck; lip-droop and twitching; and hyperesthesia to touch and noise," the EDCC said. "The horse appeared to be recovering as of [Thu 23 Aug 2018] after supportive treatment and care."

Then, on [Wed 29 Aug 2018], the ODA confirmed an additional case in a 3-year-old Standardbred mare in Holmes County.

"On [Sat 18 Aug 2018], the horse exhibited stiffness, lip-droop, tremors, and ataxia over a 5-day period and was unresponsive to medical therapy," the EDCC said. "The horse was euthanized on [Wed 22 Aug 2018]. After determining that brain tissue was negative for rabies, PCR assay at the Ohio Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory detected WNV nucleic acid in brain stem tissue of this horse. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV."

The mare is the 2nd WNV-positive horse from Holmes County and the 4th case of WNV in Ohio horses confirmed in 2018. In 2017, 14 Ohio horses tested positive for WNV, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) confirmed that another Iowa horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the 4th case of WNV in Iowa horses confirmed this year.

On [Tue 28 Aug 2018], the EDCC said, "The Iowa State Veterinarian confirmed West Nile virus in a 2-year-old Quarter Horse at a private facility in Polk County. On [Thu 23 Aug 2018], the mare was febrile and ataxic on initial examination and subsequently euthanized on [Sat 25 Aug 2018].

This is the first equine WNV case confirmed in Polk County in 2018. In 2017, Iowa confirmed only 2 cases of WNV in horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit
- flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile has no cure, but some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent. Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV-prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3-6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by
- removing stagnant water sources;
- dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[There is a very effective vaccine available to protect your animal. It is so much easier and cheaper to prevent the disease than to treat it and hope your animal survives. The majority of the animals mentioned in this update are deceased. Even with treatment, the animal may not be able to overcome the disease and is euthanized for humane reasons. Why do that? Why not vaccinate and save yourself the heartache and expense of treatment and watching your animal suffer. Just vaccinate your animals and follow the directions to try and protect them against mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
