[1] Japan: 2nd outbreak, H5N1

The virus that caused a 2nd outbreak of bird flu in Japan has been
identified as the same strain, H5N1, as found earlier in Japan and which is
also spreading elsewhere in Asia, the Farm Ministry said on Thursday.
Japan reported a 2nd outbreak of bird flu on Tuesday on the southern island
of Kyushu, across a narrow body of water from the site of its 1st outbreak
in Yamaguchi prefecture in Honshu.
The H5N1 strain has killed at least 22 people, all of them either in
Thailand or Vietnam. There have been no reports of the virus infecting
humans in Japan.
An official at Japan's National Institute of Animal Health said on Thursday
that tests on mice showed that the H5N1-type virus found in Yamaguchi had
the potential to infect humans, but it was much less lethal than the virus
from the same strain that killed 6 people in Hong Kong in 1997. That
outbreak was stamped out by a massive poultry cull.
"Tests on mice show that the (Yamaguchi) virus can be harmful to mammals,"
the official said. "(This means) humans are not 100 percent safe from the
virus." He said although the virus found in Yamaguchi is the same strain as
that which has caused deaths of people in Viet Nam, it has a different gene
sequence. "This means that the 2 viruses are not exactly the same." He said
the institute had been unable to obtain data to enable it compare [it with]
the strain that has killed people in Thailand.

Bird flu - Thailand reports 4 new outbreaks - update
----------------------------------------------------
Thailand today announced 4 new outbreaks of bird flu in 2 provinces,
widening a major resurgence of the disease announced earlier this week.
"From 8000 samples they have found 4 additional outbreak spots in 2
provinces that are former outbreak areas," said the Deputy Agriculture
Minister Newin Chidchob.
Thailand announced Monday that bird flu had reemerged in 14 locations in 9
provinces, just days before it had planned to declare the crisis over and
begin rebuilding its shattered USD 1.2 billion poultry export business.
Newin said the final results of a second nationwide round of testing showed
bird flu had emerged at another location in northeastern Khon Kaen province
and in 3 locations in a 10th province, Chon Buri, which lies east of Bangkok.
"Among 10 300 samples collected from 40 provinces in the 2nd round of
testing, we detected the virus in 10 provinces," he said.

[3] China: 2 new outbreaks, H5N1

China has reported 2 new confirmed outbreaks of bird flu, state media said,
citing the Ministry of Agriculture.
The 2 confirmed outbreaks were in Anning city, southwestern Yunnan
province, and in Huayin city, northwestern Shaanxi province, both of which
were previously listed as suspected cases.
This brings the total tally in China to 48 confirmed cases, with 16
provincial-level regions affected.
Although the disease has spread rapidly in China since the 1st outbreak was
confirmed in late January 2004, no human cases have been reported so far.
In response, China has culled more than 1.2 million chicken, geese, and
ducks and agreed to compensate farmers.
A team of experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization has been in
southern China this week to inspect culling and vaccinating work and,
according to state press, declared themselves satisfied.
Scientists this week said they were close to identifying the source of bird
flu in China, while stepping up warnings about the dangers posed by
migratory birds, which will begin flocking to China's north next month.
