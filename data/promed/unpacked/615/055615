There were 2 cases of suspected chikungunya reported in the district
by the District Medical Office. However, the numbers of viral fever
cases reported were about 5003.
The bus strike on Tuesday [10 Jul 2007] caused hardship for people
traveling to hospitals and primary health centres for treatment. Even
the staff at various hospitals and health centres failed to reach
their workplaces.
The health authorities are planning to conduct a virology study in
the district to help chart a health plan.

[Apparently, chikungunya virus transmission is continuing in Kerala.
Of the 5003 fever cases mentioned, only 2 were diagnosed as suspected
chikungunya virus infections, but it is not clear how these cases
were differentiated from other febrile etiologies (2 cases of
hepatitis A and one of malaria were mentioned in the article).
Perhaps the virology study mentioned will help determine how many of
these fever cases were due to chikungunya virus, in addition to the 2
suspected cases mentioned. ProMED would appreciate further
information as this virology study progresses.
