Equine piroplasmosis tally now 409
----------------------------------
The number of horses in the United States confirmed with the
parasitic infection equine piroplasmosis, as a result of an outbreak
centred on Texas, now stands at 409.

The US Department of Agriculture's latest report to the World
Organisation for Animal Health this week [week of 4-8 Oct 2010] said
more than 2300 horses have been tested for the disease as part of its
ongoing investigation into the outbreak, 1st detected on a property
in Kleberg County. To date, 409 horses have tested positive to the
disease -- one more than in the previous report, filed on 25 Aug 2010.

Dr John Clifford, deputy administrator with the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said all cases had been directly linked
with the Kleberg County index premises. Horses that have tested
positive are in Texas, Alabama, Louisiana, Indiana, North Carolina,
and Tennessee.

The positive horses either currently live or previously lived on the
index premises, live next door, or are dangerous contacts -- a
positive foal born to an infected mare, or temporarily boarded on
index premises -- or are from high-risk premises (located near the
index ranch and have similar terrain and tick populations).

In an unrelated outbreak involving 2 cases in Minnesota and 2 in
Louisiana, the agriculture department has formally declared it resolved.

The source of the outbreak was listed as unknown or inconclusive, but
the department suggested shared needles or substances between horses
may have been responsible for its spread, rather than ticks. [But a
source still had to be present. Some horse had to have had the
disease for it to pass via shared needles. And this disease passes
well by insect vectors but not by needles. The dose in a needle is
not nearly as concentrated as in the insect vector hind gut. So there
still had to be a source. - Mod.TG]

The outbreak was 1st reported around Christmas last year. The
parasites responsible for equine piroplasmosis are _Babesia caballi_
and _Theileria equi_, the latter being responsible for this outbreak.

Ticks ingest blood from infected equines and then bite uninfected
equines, spreading the disease through the blood-feeding process.
Ticks carrying the parasites can be moved from one place to another
via hay, bedding, feed and animal to animal.

The disease may also be passed from pregnant mares to foals in the
uterus and by contaminated needles and other skin-penetrating
instruments. Horses which contract the disease in the United States
are usually euthanized to eliminate the risk of spread.

Signs may become apparent 7 to 22 days after infection. Clinical
signs include weakness, loss of appetite, fever, anemia, jaundiced
mucous membranes, swollen abdomen and labored breathing. Horses that
survive the acute infection phase may carry the parasites for an
undetermined period of time in their bloodstreams.
