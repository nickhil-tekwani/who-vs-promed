The following background data on _S. typhimurium_ DT104 in the United
Kingdom were extracted from GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>:
_Salmonella typhimurium_ Definitive Type 104 (DT 104) was first reported in
the U.K. in 1990, and was the second most common cause of human
salmonellosis in England and Wales in 1995 (3837 cases that year, as
compared to only 259 in 1990). In fact, DT 104 accounted for over 55% of
all _S. typhimurium_ isolates in 1995. 4006 isolates of DT 104 were
recovered in 1996: 24% resistant to trimethoprim and 14% to ciprofloxacin.
