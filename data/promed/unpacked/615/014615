Koi herpesvirus outbreak confirmed in UK
----------------------------------------
Movements of fish into, out of, and within a fishery in [Lincolnshire
County, England] have been restricted following the confirmation of
koi herpesvirus disease. Cefas [Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Science], acting on behalf of Defra [Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], has issued a Confirmed
Designation prohibiting the movement of fish to, from, and within
Wagtail Fishery, Cliff Lane, Marston, Grantham, Lincolnshire.

Under the requirements of the designation the fishery has also been
directed to establish and maintain on-site facilities for the
disinfection of angling equipment prior to being taken out of the
designated area and anglers must comply with their use.

Samples were taken from the affected site following reported deaths of fish.

Koi herpesvirus disease affects all varieties of carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_), including common carp, mirror carp, ghost carp, and koi carp
and can result in high rates of fish mortalities.

There are no implications for human health.

Koi herpesvirus is a notifiable disease, any suspicion of its presence
should be immediately reported to: The Centre for Environment,
Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Weymouth Tel: 01035
206700; <fhi@cefas.co.uk>.

[Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a foodfish, and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as koi. Almost all countries have reported KHV, which was
first recognized in 1996 in England. However, publications (Pokorova
et al) in 2005 report that Australia does not have the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of the
gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured
fish, inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that
some fish may be carriers.
