The state veterinarian says an outbreak of canine brucellosis in central Iowa has been traced to a small commercial dog breeding facility in Marion County. Dr. Jeff Kaisand says the Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship is in the process of notifying individuals who have custody of the exposed dogs; the animals and the facilities are quarantined until the dogs can undergo testing.

Brucellosis can be transmitted to both animals and humans; the threat to most pet owners is considered low, but dog breeders, veterinary staff and anyone who comes into contact with blood, tissues and fluids during the birthing process may be at higher risk.

Any pet owners who have recently acquired a new, small breed dog from Marion County should contact their veterinarian; human health concerns should be directed to the Iowa Department of Public Health, or to your physician.

["Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by several species in the genus _Brucella_. _Brucella canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in females, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose [in dogs] with the currently available tests.

"The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf).

Furthermore, immunosuppressed people, from cancers or other diseases, may be at a more significant risk. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians or nurses, and kennel help may also be more susceptible due to their more frequent exposure to urine.
