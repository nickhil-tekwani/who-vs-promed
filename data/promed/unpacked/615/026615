Malaria outbreak reported in North Korea
---------------------------------------------
A UNICEF report from Pyongyang states that the WHO has donated $500,000 for
an anti-malaria campaign in North Korea.
[P. vivax malaria was eradicated in both North- and South Korea in the
1970es, but returned in North Korea in 1997. The South Korean news agency,
JoongAng Ilbo, reported the 3. April 2002 that North Korea had regular
outbreaks of malaria every summer close to the demilitarized zone with at
least 350,000 cases per year [_Plasmodium vivax_]. North Korea received
preventive equipment, insecticides and drugs against malaria for $650,000
in 2002 mostly from South Korea channelled through the WHO iindicating that
the malaria problem is as serious in 2003 as in the previous years. Based
on these data it seems reasonable to conclude that P.vivax malaria is now a
recurrent problem in the summer months in the southern provinces of North
Korea. More information on the actual malaria activity in North Korea would
be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
