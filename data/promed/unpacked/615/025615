Officials warn of bacterial outbreak
--------------------
Southeast Georgia public health officials yesterday issued a community
health alert advising residents to take precautions against a recent
outbreak of a contagious bacterial intestinal disorder. There has been "a
significant increase" in shigellosis, an infectious disease with symptoms
of diarrhea, fever, stomach cramps and dehydration over the past 3 months,
said David Page, a physician and medical director of the 6 county Coastal
Health District based in Brunswick [Brunswick is about 90 miles north of
Jacksonville, Florida -Mod. LL].
Children, the elderly and others with weakened immune systems are
particularly susceptible to the infection that can be prevented by frequent
and thorough washing of hands with soap and warm water, Page
said. "Anybody who prepares food, whether at home or in a restaurant,
should wash their hands carefully before handling the food," Page said.
"People who take care of young children should wash their hands after
changing diapers and people who care for children, whether at home or
school, are encouraged to help the children wash their hands frequently,
most importantly after using the toilet and before eating."
For more information about the disease, people can call the Public Health
Communicable Disease Control Unit at (912) 264-3907.
Other precautions include disinfecting diaper changing areas immediately
after using them, keeping children with diarrhea out of day care centers
and not letting people with diarrheal illnesses prepare food or beverages
for others,
Page said.
"We've had 27 cases of shigellosis in Glynn and McIntosh counties since
mid-March 2002. Those patients ranged from 9 months up to 84 years old,"
said Robert Hamilton, district communicable disease specialist. "It is
really easy to transmit. We think there probably are a lot more people out
there who've gotten sick from it but didn't seek medical treatment,"
Hamilton continued, "There have been no fatalities reported from the
infection but some patients were severely dehydrated as a result of the
chronic diarrhea and required medical care."
"We have not come up with any common denominator as the source of the
infection. None of them shared a common restaurant, water supply, grocery,
school, day care, swimming pool, river or lake," Hamilton said. "All but 2
of the known patients came are from Glynn County. The others, from
McIntosh, had spent time in Brunswick and other parts of Glynn County
before becoming ill, he added. "I can't tie it to any one source ...The
cases are like buckshot all over a map," Hamilton said.
Before March 2002, there had been only 1 other case reported in the
district that includes, Glynn, McIntosh, Camden, Bryan, Liberty and Long
counties, Hamilton said. Meanwhile, the number of reported shigella cases
statewide has tripled during the past year -- jumping to 939 from 330
during the same period the previous year, public health department records
show.

[The species of shigella in these cases is not reported nor is how many of
the cases are secondary. This cause of bacterial enteritis has a very low
infectious dose and can be spread from person-to-person as well as being
transmitted by contaminated food or water. With cases scattered over the
area and the state overall and with a substantial increase from a similar
time period, a commercial food vehicle should be suspected which could, for
instance, be distributed in different groceries throughout the area. More
information about the outbreak and possible vehicles for spread will,
hopefully, be available to ProMed-mail in the near future. - Mod. LL].
