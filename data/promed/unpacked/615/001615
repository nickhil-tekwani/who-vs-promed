Canberrans might think twice about taking their pets on holiday this
year [2010], due to a severe outbreak of paralysis ticks.

Unseasonally humid weather has created such perfect breeding
conditions for the pests that veterinarians are struggling to treat
pets fast enough.

Sydney clinics have run out of anti-venom serums. South Coast
veterinarians are working through the night to nurse paralysed
patients. Some animals have died.

Moruya Veterinary Hospital veterinarian Dr Janelle Dunkley said her
staff normally treated about 40 cases in November before these cases
generally eased by Christmas. This year [2010] they treated 68 cases
in November and a similar number in December, including a foal and
some alpacas.

"We've lost about 6 pets [compared to one in 2009] and certainly the
severity of the ticks is quite bad," Dr Dunkley said. "[The pets]
seem to be quite respiratory-affected. Their larynxes are paralysed
and they can't breathe. So we're having quite a bit of trouble saving
them. We've had to put a lot on respirators. Others we've had to give
quite intensive care."

Dr Dunkley said ticks latched on to the skin of an animal and sucked
its blood, releasing toxins into the bloodstream via their saliva.
The toxins could be cleared from the bloodstream reasonably quickly
using an anti-venom. But if too much time was lost, the toxins could
enter muscles and make it very hard to save an animal's life.

Signs in pets included tiredness or reluctance to exercise, wobbly
hind legs, excessive panting, grunting noises, or full paralysis.

They are signs [a couple from] Deua River Valley knows all too well.
At their property just outside Moruya, they find a tick a week on at
least one of their 4 dogs. Their cat recently spent 4 days in
hospital on a drip after a tick bite. "We knew something was wrong
because the cat went missing and we couldn't find her anywhere," the
man said. "We eventually found her all curled up under the shed,
unable to meow because her throat had been paralysed."

[Tick paralysis is caused by over 40 species of ticks worldwide (5 in
North America, including the deer tick) and can occur in almost any
region where ticks are found. It has killed thousands of animals,
mainly cows and sheep, in other parts of the world. Although tick
paralysis is of concern in domestic animals and livestock, human
cases are rare and usually occur in children under the age of 10.

Tick paralysis occurs when an engorged and gravid (egg-laden) female
tick produces a neurotoxin in its salivary glands and transmits it to
its host during feeding. Experiments have indicated that the greatest
amount of toxin is produced between the 5th and 7th day of attachment
(often initiating or increasing the severity of clinical signs),
although the timing may vary depending on the species of tick.

Unlike Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, which are caused
by the systemic proliferation and expansion of parasites in their
hosts long after the offending tick is gone, tick paralysis is
chemically induced by the tick and can therefore continue only in its
presence. Once the tick is removed, symptoms usually diminish
rapidly. However, in some cases, profound paralysis can develop and
even become fatal before anyone becomes aware of a tick's presence.

Signs of tick paralysis generally begin between 5 to 7 days after a
tick becomes attached, beginning with fatigue, numbness of the legs,
and muscle pains. Paralysis rapidly develops from the lower or rear
to the upper or front extremities and, if the tick is not removed, is
followed by tongue and facial paralysis. The most severe
complications may include convulsions, respiratory failure and, in up
to 12 percent of untreated cases, death. Signs are almost the same in
human cases.

There is no diagnostic test for this disease, but rather clinical
signs and presentation of the animal. Treatment is many times
supportive, such as a respirator, but removal of the tick or ticks is
essential. Frequently, multiple ticks are attached to an animal. The
entire integument should be searched diligently and repeatedly,
especially on long-haired animals. Most ticks are found around the
head or neck, but can be anywhere on the body. Some practitioners
prefer to kill the tick before removal, using a suitable acaricide.

In Australia, the disease commonly continues to progress after
removal of ticks, and treatment is indicated for animals with motor
or respiratory impairment. In cases in which an adult female _Ixodes
holocyclus_ has been removed but the animal shows no adverse clinical
signs, the owner should monitor the animal for 24 hours and return
for treatment if signs of tick paralysis develop.

Canine tick hyperimmune serum, also called tick antiserum (TAS), is
the specific treatment for _I. holocyclus_ -induced tick paralysis.
This should be given as early in the disease as possible; subsequent
"top up" doses are not very effective. Animals with multiple ticks or
in the acute stages of paralysis should receive a higher dose. Some
debate exists about the required dose of TAS. It has been suggested
that a standard dose should be given, based on the amount needed to
neutralize the toxin from one tick, not on the weight of the dog. On
this basis, a minimal dose of 10 mL is recommended for dogs, but
increased for multiple ticks or severely affected animals. Atropine
is recommended before giving TAS; this reduces the incidence of an
adverse effect that is seen in some small dogs soon after the
injection is given -- a temporary collapse with profound hypotension
and bradycardia lasting several minutes, associated with the
Bezold-Jarisch reflex.

Minimization of stress and anxiety cannot be overemphasized.
Acepromazine may be given subcutaneously before any other medication
or handling that may upset the animal. However, acepromazine should
be avoided or given at a reduced dose if the animal is depressed or
hypothermic. Opiates are an alternative. Any procedure (such as, IV
injection, searching for ticks) that may excite the animal should be
postponed until the animal settles.

The animal's condition can be expected to deteriorate for the next 24
hours after ticks are removed. Hospitalization, with monitoring and
good nursing care, is advised during this period. The animal should
be kept in a quiet, dark, comfortable place. Sternal recumbency
should be maintained if comfortable; otherwise, the animal should be
positioned in lateral recumbency with its shoulder being the highest
point. Eye protectants should be used to prevent corneal ulceration
or dry eyes, and the bladder expressed once or twice daily. Suction
of the pharynx, larynx, and proximal esophagus minimizes respiratory
distress caused by saliva pooling and esophageal dysfunction. An
esophageal tube may be inserted to provide drainage. General
anesthesia may be indicated in animals that are severely dyspneic to
allow administration of oxygen, esophageal suction, and pulmonary
drainage. Mechanical or manual ventilation may be required for 24 hours.

Nothing should be given by mouth until the paralysis has resolved.
During hospitalization, regular searches for attached ticks should be
done. Long or matted hair should be clipped. Application of an
acaricide may kill ticks missed in searching. However, the stress of
clipping or bathing can be detrimental in severely affected or
nervous animals and may increase hypothermia.

About 5 percent of animals are likely to die despite all treatment
efforts, especially those with advanced paralysis and dyspnea. Older
animals or those with pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease are at
greatest risk.

For animals that recover, owners should be advised to continue
searching for ticks, use appropriate preventive methods to avoid
reattachment of ticks, and avoid stressing or strenuously exercising
the animal over the next 2 months.
