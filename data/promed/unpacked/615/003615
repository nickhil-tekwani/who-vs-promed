Almost all the 11 children who were admitted by the time the National Rapid Response Team reached the district tested positive for malaria by RDT [Rapid Diagnostic Tests].

We have shipped blood and urine samples from all the 11 children and they are undergoing laboratory analysis at the National Reference Laboratory of the Ministry of Health. By yesterday [Tue 29 May 2018], a total of 65 case-persons have been line listed.

Based on the clinical presentation, medical history, and preliminary laboratory findings, the strange disease in Manafwa District, Uganda is likely to be black water fever (BWF), a severe form of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in which blood cells are rapidly destroyed, resulting in dark urine. There is no hemorrhagic fever in the district.

[ProMED-mail greatly appreciates the additional information provided by Dr. Alex Riolexus Ario on the outbreak.

We look forward to the results of the further analysis. RDTs (Rapid Diagnostic Tests) for malaria does not quantify parasitemia, and so called "black water fever" is haemoglobinuria due to a high _P. falciparum_ parasitemia with intravascular haemolysis.

Still it is rare that such clusters of severe malaria are seen in endemic area, and ProMED appreciate the efforts of the Ministry of Health to rule out other causes as discussed in the moderators comment yesterday (Tue 29 May 2018).

Over the recent 2 years, several outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, Marburg Virus diseases, Crimean Congo Haemorrhigic Fever and Yellow Fever have been seen in Uganda (see ProMED posts below). In a malaria endemic country a malaria infection can simply be a bystander and not the real course of the clinical symptoms. ProMED will be happy to post further information when available. - Mod.EP]

[According to Wikipedia, the average elevation in the Manafwa district is 1967 meters, so it is possible that malaria in this zone is "highland malaria" which has presented in periodic epidemics and is not well known in the population as seen in lower elevation and coastal areas of East Africa.
