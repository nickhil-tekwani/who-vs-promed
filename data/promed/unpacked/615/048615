[1] Oman, additional information - EpiCore Surveillance Project
Date: Mon 6 Nov 2017

In response to an RFI sent through the EpiCore Surveillance Project requesting more information on the reported case of MERS-CoV infection in Oman, we received the following information from an EpiCore member.

The patient is a 27 yr old male from the North Sharqiyah governorate who sought medical help on [22 Oct 2017] at a health center and again on [24 Oct 2017] at a private clinic before finally being admitted to a hospital on [28 Oct 2017]. His presenting symptoms include fever, cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath). Bilateral pneumonia was confirmed. On [1 Nov 2017],an infection with the MERS-CoV was confirmed by the National Public Health Laboratory. There is ongoing tracing of all contacts including observation and continued follow-up.

The patient has a history of direct close contact with camels routinely on weekends.

[Many thanks to our EpiCore surveillance project members for their rapid reply to our RFI. Using the Saudi system of classification, this case would be considered a primary case with a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. We've also learned from a reliable source that the patient has been discharged from hospital and is home recovering.

MERS-CoV has previously been documented in Omani camels. In a 2013 Lancet publication, Reusken CB et al, found 50/50 (100 percent) of Omani camels to have protein specific antibodies against MERS-CoV spike to the MERS-CoV (1). In a 2014 Eurosurveillance report, Nowotny N and Kolodziejek J documented that nucleotide sequencing of camel derived MERS-CoV in Oman were closely related to human MERS-CoV sequences from the same geographic area (2). In 2015, 8 dromedary camels were transported to the UAE from Oman and were found to be RT-PCR positive for the MERS-CoV ORF 1A and upstream of E genes. Testing of the 2 men who accompanied these camels revealed while asymptomatic, they were also RT-PCR for the MERS-CoV (3).

[2] Saudi Arabia, 1 new case - MOH
Date: Mon 6 Nov 2017

https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2017-11-06-001.aspx


As of Mon 6 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
1736 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
701 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 percent],
1016 recoveries, and
19 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update yesterday [5 Nov 2017], there have been a total of:
1 newly confirmed case,
1 newly reported fatality, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

Information on newly confirmed case (1 case)
- A 49-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Riyadh [Riyadh region] noted to be in stable condition. Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history currently under investigation.

Information on newly reported fatality (1 case)
- A 49-year-ol Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Unaizah [Al Qaá¹£im region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [reported as a newly confirmed case on 31 Oct 2017 at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. He was classified as a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP]

[Of note this is now the 4th newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported from Riyadh in the past 5 days. There was 1 case reported on 2 Nov 2017, 2 cases reported on 5 Nov 2017 and this case reported today (6 Nov 2017). All 4 cases are classified as primary cases with high risk exposure histories still under investigation. This may just be a coincidence as Riyadh is the major city and population center in Saudi Arabia; that being said, based on past observations, one can't help but wonder if something is going on in some healthcare facility, perhaps an outpatient facility leading to common exposures resulting in increased transmission of the MERS-CoV in Riyadh.

We await more information.
