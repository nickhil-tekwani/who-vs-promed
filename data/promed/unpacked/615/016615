Bolivar epidemic outbreak of malaria
------------------------------------
Epidemiological bulletin number 9 of the Health Ministry for the week 26 Feb to 3 Mar 2012, shows Bolivar state has an epidemic with 876 of the 932 malaria cases [reported] nationwide.

The report of the national health authority indicates an increase of 5 percent in outbreaks of the disease in Sifontes municipality, which recorded the highest number of infected, with 669 cases of malaria. Similarly, establishing an increased incidence of _Plasmodium falciparum_ in the region, taking into account that of the 165 cases reported in the country 163 were recorded in Bolivar state, while mixed plasmodium species comprise 24 of the 27 diagnosed nationally.

Absence of control
Ricardo Alcala, controller of the malariology social sector, says the Guyanese region recorded 7,433 cases of malaria, and insists that there are no coherent policies for vector control, even though 80 percent of the mines are closed.

He says there is an increase of the disease of 41.3 percent over the year 2011, when 620 cases were recorded at this time. Alcala, who has for years denounced the situation and lack of control of this disease in Bolivar state, says that region leads the accumulated figures in the same way; of 8966 cases, 7,433 correspond to this area. "This means we're talking about 86 percent of cases throughout the country," he says," as evidence of an increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of 2011. That is, a report of 5661 cases," he adds. “Bolivar and Delta Amacuro are the only entities with malaria epidemiological [figures], "with the aggravation that Bolivar has more than 7000 and the Delta 244 cases."

Responsible
The social comptroller for malariology, Ricardo Alcala, blames the regional government and regional health director for the rebound of the disease, and for not applying vector control, despite mining areas being closed. Alcala points out that in only these years of the current management there have been reported "262 258 cases of malaria, compared to 14 years prior to this administration, which reached 166 800 cases. He also indicates "How is it that under the management of [name deleted], in Bolivar 221 168 cases of malaria have been reported?”

[The previous ProMED posting on malaria in Bolivar State, Venezuela, 22 Oct 2010 (see below) highlighted the problem of illegal mining in the area. This report shows that malaria continues to be a problem even though the majority of the mines apparently have been closed.
