Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 48
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed a further case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a 35
year old man from West Jakarta. He developed symptoms of fever, cough, and
breathing difficulty on 6 Nov 2005, was hospitalized on 9 Nov 2005, and
died on 19 Nov 2005. Family members and close contacts were placed under
observation and tested for possible infection. No evidence of additional
cases has been detected.
Investigations have been undertaken to determine the source of the man's
exposure. While he did not keep poultry in his household, chickens and
other birds were found in his neighbourhood. Samples from these birds have
been taken and are undergoing tests to determine whether they may have been
the source of infection.
The newly confirmed case is the 14th in Indonesia. Of these cases, 9 have
been fatal.

Indonesia: 6 more suspected human avian influenza cases in Jakarta
------------------------------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: Minister of health Siti Fadilah Supari has confirmed that a 35
year old man who died last month is the country's 9th human bird flu
fatality. "The World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory in Hong Kong has
confirmed the test results. We now have 9 confirmed bird flu deaths from a
total of 14 infections," Siti said on Tuesday. The latest casualty was a
resident of West Jakarta, who died on 19 Nov 2005 at the private Pantai
Indah Kapuk hospital in North Jakarta.
Doctors had initially planned to transfer the patient to the avian
influenza treatment center at the Sulianti Saroso Hospital, but were unable
to move him due to his critical condition. The Ministry of Health's
director general of disease control I Nyoman Kandun said the man had been
in contact with chickens that carried the H5N1 virus. "He was building his
house and around it there were many chickens and birds running free.
Researchers tested those birds and they tested positive for the H5N1
virus," Kandun said.
Meanwhile, Sulianti Saroso Hospital spokesman Ilham Patu said that 5 new
suspected avian influenza patients were admitted overnight on Mon 12 and
Tue 13 Dec 2005 from several areas of Jakarta. "We now have a total of 6
patients being treated for suspected avian influenza infections," Patu told
Agence France Presse. Some of the 5 new cases, he said, were in a worse
condition than the 6th patient, a 23 year old woman, who has been in
intensive care for the past few days.
Siti said over the weekend the government expected to vaccinate 47 million
people who have direct contact with poultry and birds across the country
against regular human influenza. This would reduce the opportunity for H5N1
to [interact by genetic reassortment] with the ordinary human flu virus and
becomes easily transmissible. The cost of the vaccination drive, however,
is estimated at Rp 5 trillion (nearly US$500 million), which the state
budget cannot afford.
The H5N1 virus has killed 71 people in Asia since 2003, out of 138 people
known to have been infected. There has been fear that contact between
infected birds and humans could eventually result in the virus mutating
into a form that could easily pass between humans, sparking a pandemic that
could kill millions.
The highly pathogenic H5N1 strain is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia,
and has affected poultry in two thirds of the provinces in the country. The
WHO has recommended the mass culling of poultry to effectively contain the
spread of the virus, but the government said it lacked the funds to
compensate farmers and bird owners.

Viet Nam: avian influenza may have killed toddler
-------------------------------------------------
HANOI: Avian influenza may have killed a 3 year old child in Viet Nam where
the H5N1 virus has struck in 15 of the country's 64 provinces, a doctor
said on Wed 14 Dec 2005. The toddler from the southern province of Hau
Giang died on Mon 12 Dec 2005, 7 hours after admission to hospital for
severe lung infection, a doctor at the Paediatric Hospital in Can Tho City
said. "All the clinical symptoms indicated ...bird flu and we are waiting
for test results now," said the doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The child's blood sample has been sent to the Pasteur Institute's avian
influenza laboratory in Ho Chi Minh City for tests. The H5N1 flu virus has
killed 71 people including 42 in Viet Nam, the country worst affected in
Asia, since it swept through in late 2003.
