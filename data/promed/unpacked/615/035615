Scientists have identified the mystery disease that killed fish in
parts of the Zambezi River last year [2006] (see ProMED post at end).
Researchers have identified the disease as epizootic ulcerative
syndrome, (EUS), caused by a fungal pathogen. Infected fish develop
large sores and die from secondary infections.
The researchers say this is the 1st known outbreak of the disease in
Africa, but they still don't know how the pathogen got into the
Zambezi, which flows through 8 southern African countries.
EUS also affects fish in Australia, the United States, and many
countries in Asia. When EUS broke out in Asia in the 1970s,
approximately 80 percent of the fish population perished.
In December last year [2006] fishermen in Namibia reported finding
sores on fish caught in the Zambezi [see ProMED-mail 20070102.0009].
The government imposed a 2-month ban on fishing to safeguard the
public. A similar ban was imposed in Botswana, and was only lifted at
the end of March this year [2007].
Shaft Nengu, a member of the research team and Botswana's assistant
director of fisheries, said the spread of the disease downstream is
inevitable. The research team has warned that the disease could
become pandemic, damaging aquaculture, fisheries, and aquatic
biodiversity.
"We do not have the capacity to establish the extent of the outbreak.
We are trying to come up with a regional effort to respond to this
outbreak and have written to all countries that share the Zambezi
River to support this initiative," Nengu said.
Nengu said the fungal pathogen does not pose any human health
implications, but that fish exhibiting sores, which could harbour
secondary infections, should still be treated with caution.
Zimbabwean microbiologist, Percy Chimwamurombe, said that it is
"presumptuous" to say that people will not be affected, and a
coordinated regional response is essential to determining the extent
and effects of the outbreak. "There is need for a concerted public
awareness campaign given the possibility of secondary infections,
which can be terrible," he said.
Fish biologist Ben van der Waal, from the Integrated Management of
the Zambezi/Chobe River System Fishery Resource Project and also a
member of the research team, said there was nothing anybody could do
to eradicate the outbreak now that it was in a natural setting. He
warned that fish losses during the first few years of the outbreak
may be colossal, and that it would take many years to adapt to the
disease. "In Asia it took about 20 years for the outbreak to go down
to endemic levels," he said.
The team of scientists included experts from the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Thailand's Inland Aquatic Animal
Health Research Institute, and the Network of Aquaculture Centres in
the Asia-Pacific.

[Epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) is considered to be an infection
with an oomycete known as _Aphanomyces invadans_ or _A. piscicida_.
It is a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and
farmed freshwater and estuarine fish; it has a complex infectious
aetiology and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive
_Aphanomyces_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions typically
leading to a granulomatous response.
EUS is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis
(MG), and ulcerative mycosis (UM). Recently, scientists proposed that
EUS should be re-named as epizootic granulomatous aphanomycosis or
EGA. At present, RSD, MG, UM, and EGA are synonyms for EUS.

Organisation for Animal Health) Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic

The chapter also contains further information on the EUS agent, host
factors, disease pattern, control and prevention, and particularly,
diagnostic methods. Mod.AS
