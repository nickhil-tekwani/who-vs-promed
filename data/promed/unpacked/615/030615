N.meningitidis W135 in a person returning from Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------
On the 26 Mar 2001 a 62 year old male presented to our hospital with a
history of fever, weakness and loss of consciousness. _N.
meningitidis_ W135 was isolated from blood culture. CSF culture was
not requested. The patient had recently returned from Saudi Arabia
after performing Haj.

Is the quadravalent vaccine for _N. meningitidis_ (which includes
W135) widely available in the UK? Also, given the high rate of disease
in contacts of Haj pilgrams (2/3 of the case-patients), should broader
use of vaccine be considered, especially in Arab communities?
In response to the moderators comment, "one wonders whether compulsory
vaccination should be considered," it is my understanding that
vaccination is required. However, should vaccination with a vaccine
that contains W135 be compulsory for travel to the Haj?

W135 virus (Haj meningitis) prompts warning: Singapore
MUIS urges pilgrims to get vaccinated
---------------------------------------
Muslims travelling to Saudi Arabia on pilgrimage should get vaccinated
against the rare W135 meningitis strain. This advice from the Islamic
Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) came in the wake of the death of
a Singaporean from meningitis last week after coming into contact with
Haj pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia. Another Singaporean was also
infected, but the patient recovered. Both had been infected with the
uncommon strain of the disease.
Earlier this month, 7 Muslims in Britain who had been on the
pilgrimage this year or been in close contact with pilgrims died after
being infected. Another 29 are infected with it, and at least six are
in a serious condition.
Last year, 4 Singaporeans reportedly contracted the disease while in
Saudi Arabia.
Haj pilgrims are required by Saudi Arabian authorities to be
vaccinated against two common strains of meningitis - A and C. But
this does not protect them against the W135 strain.
Both the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Environment Ministry (ENV)
have advised Singaporeans going to Saudi Arabia to be vaccinated
against the W135 strain as well. MUIS has also asked Muslim travel
agencies to encourage potential travellers to Saudi Arabia to be
vaccinated. So far, the majority of the 3969 Singaporean pilgrims have
already been given the vaccination.
In addition, MUIS has advised all newly-returned pilgrims to go to a
doctor immediately if they spot signs of the disease like high fever,
cough, severe headache, vomiting, stiff neck and drowsiness. MUIS
will be working closely with the two ministries on necessary
precautionary measures.

[Dr. Montgomery raises some good points in her questions. Personal
communication with Dr. Natasha Crowcroft of the Immunisation Division
of the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) in the UK revealed that
none of the cases of meningococcal meningitis W135 related to this
year's Haj had a history of vaccination with the W135 component.
As Mod. JW mentioned in the prior posting, the Saudi Government does
not mandate the W135 component be part of the vaccine received by
pilgrims prior to obtaining a visa for travel to Saudi Arabia. Thus,
it is voluntary to include the W135 component. The PHLS recommended
that the quadrivalent W135-containing vaccine be used for all pilgrims
travelling to Saudi Arabia this year [2001. Estimates are that
approximately 50% of pilgrims did receive the W135 component this
year.) Following the outbreak last year, sufficient stocks of vaccine
with the W135 component were made available for use in this year's
Haj-bound population.
Vaccine containing the W135 component has not been used in the UK
previously, either for outbreaks or for travelers to the Haj, as
there is little indigenous circulation of W135, and W135 was not
reported in association with the Haj before 2000. There was an
outbreak of group A meningococcal meningitis in returning hajis in the
UK in 1987 that remained isolated in the affected communities. Group A
did not become established as an important strain in the UK population
subsequently. After the initial outbreak of the W135 last year, a
similar pattern was seen, suggesting that spread has largely been
within communities associated with Haj attendees.
The quadrivalent vaccine costs more, which may be a deterrent to
vaccination with it until it is mandated.
The occurrence of cases in Pakistan and Singapore in addition to those
already reported from European countries serves as a reminder of the
global village we live in, and the importance of vaccinating Haj
attendees appropriately.
Perhaps after this year's repeat of the W135 outbreak, the required
vaccine for receipt of a visa to attend the Haj will include the W135
component. This depends upon action by the Saudi government. -
