Update on the report of Friday, December 5, 1997 identifying two new cases
of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong.
Department of Health Deputy Director Dr. Paul Saw indicated in a statement
made at a press conference immediately following the emergency meeting on
Saturday that stepped up surveillance since the appearance of the first
case, in August, may have resulted in detecting the three subsequent cases
of H5N1 influenza, and may also mean that other cases have gone undetected.
Surveillance has been extended to all General Out-patient Clinics and
public hospitals. The Agriculture and Fisheries Department has also
increased its monitoring of poultry.
The Department of Health has issued guidelines for the use of amantadine,
which is useful as a chemoprophylactic agent, and in reducing the severity
of symptoms for many influenza A virus infections.
[One study by the well respected Georgia poultry group looks at amantadine
resistance and H5 avian influenza subtypes. Many subtypes were not
sensitive to amantadine by plaque reduction assay in cell culture, but
morbidity and mortality were prevented in birds in vivo. Thus, drug
sensitivity in cell culture does not necessarily reflect responses to
amantadine in ovo and in vivo. Amantadine-resistant derivatives of H5
strains were readily isolated from birds protected by the drug in these
studies, suggesting rapid development of amantadine resistance by some H5
avian viruses. Reference: Wainright et al., Avian Dis. 35(1):31-39, 1991. -

[2 Hong Kong Standard
This paper reported today that at least 7 hospital staff members who had
contacts with the man who died and the young woman who is in critical
condition have developed flu-like symptoms and have been asked to go on
leave. Members of the 13-yr-old girl's family, also having developed
symptoms, are being monitored.
CDC Chief Epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda, who is in Hong Kong, said this
cluster of cases could not be classified as an epidemic, and indicated that
only time would tell if the virus completely vanishes or if the number of
cases increases.
WHO officials have said that leading vaccine researchers would decide this
week on the question of developing a vaccine for H5N1.

[This one bears watching because this H5N1 appears to have jumped directly
from birds to humans without the usual swine intermediate. Only time will
tell the potential of this virus. Let's hope the known contacts are as far
as it goes. - Mod.PC
