Identification of clubroot of crucifers on canola (_Brassica napus_) in Alberta
-------------------------------------------------

Albert, AB; M Hartman, Alberta Agriculture, Food and Rural Development,

and Agri-Food Canada, C & E Trail, Lacombe, AB. Accepted 16 Oct 2004.
Clubroot, caused by _ Plasmodiophora brassicae_, was detected for the 1st
time on canola in Alberta. Galling, typical of the disease, was observed on
roots of canola (_Brassica napus_) in a dozen fields near St Albert, AB.
Presence of resting spores of the pathogen was confirmed by light and
electron microscopy. Spores of the pathogen were isolated from diseased
tissue and used to inoculate roots of _B. napus_ 'Westar', on which they
produced symptoms similar to those observed in the field.
Resting spores were recovered from galls on inoculated plants.
Identification of clubroot on the Alberta canola crop is a matter of
concern, as the disease is associated with appreciable yield losses and can
be managed only with extended intervals between host crops, because other
management strategies may be too expensive to implement or are of limited
effectiveness. Further studies are under way to determine the extent of the
problem.

[Clubroot, caused by _Plasmodiophora brassicae_, remains one of the
important diseases affecting members of the mustard family (_Cruciferae_).
It is a soilborne disease of field crops such as canola, mustard, cabbage,
broccoli, cauliflower, radish, and turnip. Clubroot is not a new disease
and is common in British Columbia and eastern Canada. According to the
authors, this is the 1st report in which clubroot has been found on canola
in the Canadian prairies. The origin of the present outbreak is under
investigation. Given the previous reports of clubroot in home and market
gardens, it is possible that vegetable gardens may be acting as initial
foci of infection, particularly if growers are unknowingly importing
contaminated transplants.
