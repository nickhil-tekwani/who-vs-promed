Parasite threat to panda conservation
-------------------------------------
The giant panda is a global symbol of wildlife conservation that is
threatened by historic and current habitat loss. Despite a great deal
of research on the physiology, reproductive biology, and diet of
pandas in the wild and in captivity, there is little information on
wild panda mortality. Here, we integrate previously unavailable data
on mortality of wild pandas. We report 3 recent phases of panda
mortality: deaths due to bamboo flowering in the 1970s and 1980s;
surprisingly extensive poaching in the 1980s and 1990s; and the
growing importance of a parasitic infection over the past few years.
Our analyses suggest that the current most significant threat to wild
panda survival is disease due to extra-intestinal migration (visceral
larva migrans) of an ascarid nematode. We demonstrate that the
probability of death of wild pandas being caused by this disease
increased significantly between 1971 and 2006 and discuss the
possible factors leading to the emergence of this disease.

[We are grateful to Dr Daszak, one of the authors, for providing the
abstract above with his following comments:

"Further to the posting about unknown illnesses in giant pandas, I
wanted to alert you to an upcoming article in the journal EcoHealth,
which supports the comments of Dr Karesh, that infectious diseases
have been reported from pandas in the past, and are perhaps
surprisingly important as a cause of death in wild pandas. The
article is in press, and will appear in the March 2008 edition of
EcoHealth (a Springer Journal, <http://www.ecohealth.net/>), but will
likely appear online during January or February (2008). In the spirit
of ProMED-mail as the key early reporter of emerging disease issues,
here is the abstract -- please feel free to post this information on
ProMED". - Mod.AS]

[This is welcome information and serves both as a reminder of the
various factors that can affect wildlife population dynamics, and
also as a great example of how important health information can
quickly flow from a scientific meeting via ProMED-mail to a global
audience and be confirmed (or corrected) long before the information
is available via traditional journal publication.
