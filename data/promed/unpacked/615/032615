Hospital patients in Kassala suffering from chikungunya fever have been transferred to health centres to "show a decrease of their numbers in the main hospitals", witnesses claim. A government official in Kassala state justified the action to move a number of chikungunya patients away from the main hospitals by saying it "aims to transfer the patients to health centres to ensure access to the service for free."

Eyewitnesses told Radio Dabanga that the hospitals in Kassala town were "emptied" before the visit of prime minister Motaz Mousa on [Mon 24 Sep 2018]. Ibrahim El Sheikh told this station that the aim of the transfer of chikungunya patients is "to show a decrease of their numbers in the hospitals and give the impression to the visiting delegation that the epidemic is decreasing, as the state governor insists in his interviews."

On [Sun 23 Sep 2018], the children's ward, laboratory, and pharmacy at Kassala Teaching Hospital were closed after 2 children vomited blood. One of the children died.

On [Mon 23 Sep 2018], prime minister Motaz Mousa visited several health centres in the eastern and western parts of Kassala, including Hai El Arab, El Sikka Hadeed, and El Hidaya centre in El Khatamiya. He issued a decision to send 2 tons of pesticides and instructed the sanitation of the environment to be addressed.

Adam Jamaa, the governor of Kassala, admitted the existence of daily deaths in the state, but he claims that they are "unrelated to the disease". He confirmed that 10 900 infections have been diagnosed. Governor Jamaa acknowledged 11 days ago the death of 7 people from chikungunya fever, and that more than 6000 people have been infected in the recently confirmed outbreak of the virus.

According to unofficial statistics issued by the popular committees that oversee the provision of graves and coffins 25 people are dying per week. A number of residents said that the authorities should have declared Kassala as a disaster area, so that activities to address the disease and prevent the spread would be carried out at national and international levels.

Chikungunya, in Sudan popularly known as kankasha, is a virus transmitted by the same kinds of mosquitoes that spread dengue and Zika [and yellow fever] viruses. It is characterised by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by joint pain.

Speaking to Radio Dabanga, Ibrahim El Sheikh demanded that schools be closed so that the number of infected would be reduced. "People have stopped the work in Kassala although it is the main market for the surrounding countryside." El Sheikh said that although there have been initiatives and appeals to confront the crisis from in and out of Sudan, they did not notice any activity to provide medical or humanitarian assistance to affected people by any party. On social media platforms, activists and others have gathered to comment on the situation. On Twitter, for example, the hashtag #KassalaIsDying is being used.

The federal Ministry of Health has confirmed the outbreak of the virus chikungunya in Kassala. Noteworthy is that Kassala declared a state of emergency starting December 2017, justifying the measure by claiming that the state can better combat human trafficking and the smuggling of consumer goods.

Sennar
------
The authorities in Sennar [state] have declared a state of alert to counter the spread of the chikungunya fever, after it recently appeared in [Gedarif] state. Sanitary measures have been taken for travel buses and the first awareness campaigns have been set up.

The director-general of the Sennar Teaching Hospital said that as there is no cure for the disease, he called upon people to use mosquito nets in their homes.

In the northern part of Red Sea state, 52 cases of chikungunya fever have been recorded in the past 10 days. So far most infections of chikungunya were mainly reported in Kassala [state].

A medical source in Jebeit town told Radio Dabanga that doctors sent samples to Port Sudan to ascertain the nature of the disease, noting that the clinical examination has proved identical to chikungunya fever. So far most infections of chikungunya had mainly been reported in Kassala, the state that shares the Red Sea state's southern border. Jebeit, however, lies in the north of Red Sea.

Salah El Mubarak, the director of emergency management at the Ministry of Health, warned of the spread of mosquitoes, which are the carrier of the fever. "The situation in Kassala needs 1108 health workers," he claimed.

On [20 Sep 2018] Radio Dabanga reported that health sources in Red Sea state confirmed a number of cases of chikungunya. People then called on the authorities to intervene to contain the disease so as not to spread to the towns and rural areas. The outbreak was 1st confirmed in Kassala by doctors in late August [2018].

In Khartoum, health minister Mamoun Hameida announced the arrival of 5 patients suffering from chikungunya to the state. He stressed that there are no pills to prevent the disease. "The provision of anti-bacterial drugs is ineffective because the disease is viral," he told Sudanese media.

The state minister of health, Souad El Karib said that the percentage of deaths due to chikungunya accounts for 2 per cent of all reported infections. Earlier government statistics showed the total number of infection cases to be 12 080 people. This would mean there have been 2416 deadly cases [this number implies a 20 per cent case fatality rate. A 2 per cent CFR would mean 242 fatal cases. - Mod.TY]

Meanwhile residents in Kassala have called for the suspension of basic and higher secondary schools until the epidemic has been contained. Listeners reported to Radio Dabanga that the rate of absent teachers and students is on the rise because of the fever.

Majzoub Abu Mousa, a spokesman for the Kassala administration, told Reuters that his state had received health and technical aid from Sudan's health ministry, but expressed concern over the spread of the virus and called for further help.

Kassala outbreak with more than 100 000 cases and about 100 deaths is chikingunya with cases of dengue as well causing haemorrhagic fever, Ministry of Health not declared anything, but I saw some laboratory PCR results showing positives of chikingunya in Kassala state. Also there is a case of suspected arboviral disease in Gedarif area.

[The apparent outbreak is spreading, with the 2 reports above indicating that there are cases in Kassala and Red Sea states. An earlier report indicated that there is an unspecified number of cases in Gedarif state. Previous reports of case numbers are discrepant. An earlier report by local and international humanitarian aid workers indicated a non-verified case number of about 100 000 patients and 119 deaths.

This outbreak is unusual if chikungunya virus is the only etiological agent involved. Hemorrhagic manifestations are not part of the usual chikungunya virus infection clinical picture. Dengue virus infection is mentioned in the above and previous reports as also circulating in the areas, suggesting that a mixed outbreak is possibly occurring. O'nyong nyong fever virus, closely related to chikungunya virus, is another possibility. It is not indicated if yellow fever has been ruled out in the hemorrhagic cases. YF outbreaks have occurred in Sudan previously.

Mod.MPP commented on the high reported CFR, noting that there was an outbreak in Reunion with a calculated CFR of 1:1000 [0.1 per cent] and cited an interesting paper in EID (Mavalankar D, Shastri P, Bandyopadhyay T, et al. Increased mortality rate associated with chikungunya epidemic, Ahmedabad, India. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008; 14(3): 412-5. doi: 10.3201/eid1403.070720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570824/). This paper stated that, "India reported 1.39 million cases of chikungunya fever in 2006 with no attributable deaths; Ahmedabad, India, reported 60 777 suspected chikungunya cases. To assess the effect of this epidemic, mortality rates in 2006 were compared with those in 2002-2005 for Ahmedabad (population 3.8 million). A total of 2944 excess deaths occurred during the chikungunya epidemic (August-November 2006) when compared with the average number of deaths in the same months during the previous 4 years. These excess deaths may be attributable to this epidemic. However, a hidden or unexplained cause of death is also possible."

If all of these excess deaths were due to chikungunya virus infection, the CFR would be 5 per cent, also a number considerably higher than the CFR in the Reunion outbreak. Fatalities were sporadic and low in in the chikungunya virus outbreak is Colombia and Venezuela. This makes one wonder if, in fact, a mixed outbreak of chikungunya virus and some other etiological agent is responsible for the deaths and the hemorrhagic manifestations. Any additional information concerning this outbreak would be welcome. - Mod.TY
