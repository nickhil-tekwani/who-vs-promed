Danger meat enters Britain
-----------------------------
Meat from countries infected with Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) is still
being imported into Britain, 12 days after the disease was discovered,
write Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Rosie Waterhouse. The meat is coming from 4
countries having suffered outbreaks in the past 12 months: Namibia, Brazil,
Uruguay and Argentina.
Imported Argentine meat was blamed for the last serious outbreak in Britain
in 1967. Senior veterinary experts are calling for a review. "Of course
there is a risk factor if you import meat from countries infected with FMD"
said Mac Johnson, a professor at the Royal Veterinary College in London.
The government's admission over the imports came as the number of confirmed
cases in Britain rose to 52, including one in Northern Ireland.
Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, also announced an inquiry into
farming practices relating to disease control.
Belgium suffered a FMD scare yesterday after signs of the disease were
detected in pigs imported from Britain at a farm near Diksmuide in the
southwest of the country. More than 300 animals were slaughtered while
officials awaited the results of tests. If confirmed it will be the first
case in continental Europe since the British outbreak.
France, which is investigating its own first possible case among sheep in
the Loire valley, closed its border to Belgian livestock.
The British government banned exports of meat and milk products when the
first case of the disease was confirmed on 20 Feb 2001.
This weekend officials confirmed it is allowing imports from 4 countries
which have had outbreaks in the past year; 300 suspected cases were
reported in Argentina last week and Brazil, Uruguay and Namibia have also
had cases recently. FMD is endemic in parts of South Africa; an outbreak
was confirmed last September, but Britain did not ban imports until 5 Jan 2001.
Vets said extra meat supplies from foreign sources, including countries
with the disease, are being used instead of British meat. The agriculture
ministry said responsibility for approving countries from which it was safe
to export meat lay with the European Union. There was anger this weekend
among farmers who claimed meat wholesalers were offering less money for
livestock, even though some supermarkets were raising meat prices.

[It seems unbelievable the UK would be importing meat from FMD positive
countries. It brings up the question, "Did they import the disease
unknowingly?" Or is it only meat from FMD countries that is being imported
during this crisis? - Mod.TG

The Ministry of Agriculture has commissioned an assessment of the risk of
all forms of wildlife catching or passing on FMD. The study comes after
outbreaks in Devon and Scotland, areas unaffected by the last big outbreak
in 1967, where there are herds of red, fallow and roe deer which are
susceptible to the disease affecting animals with cloven hooves. There is
also concern wild boar, living in parts of the south of England, could
multiply the disease.
A ministry spokesman said a team from the Farming and Rural Conservation
Agency, the British Veterinary Association and the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency was conducting risk assessments of the dangers of all British
wildlife catching and passing on the disease. The assessments are being
carried out "as quickly as possible" and will be published probably in the
next 2 weeks.
Although the ministry is examining the threat of wildlife contracting the
disease, ministers and the chief vet have so far said the risk is very low
and there is no evidence any cull of wildlife will be necessary. Among the
wild animals that can catch the disease are hedgehogs, rats and deer in
addition to zoo animals such as elephants.
Keith Baker, a former assistant chief veterinary officer and a past
president of the British Veterinary Association, said he believed a
wildlife cull could cause more problems than it would solve. "If you were
to start going in and trying to cull wild deer you could spook them and
they would end up going all over the place," he said. "My biggest worry is
feral pigs as they are such prolific multipliers of the disease."
There are estimated to be more than 300 wild boar roaming the Kent and
Sussex countryside. These are animals escaped from specialist farms and
pigs having cross-bred with them. Others have been reported on Humberside
and in Scotland.

[Penned zoo animals should present zero-risk to a county's livestock even
if they are chronically infected. Hedgehogs are known to harbor the disease
but not develop a level of virus capable of transmitting to other animals.
A few deer may acquire the disease, but in the present situation, not
enough to make a difference. Feral hogs are entirely different, as are
safari parks. Recommendations regarding vaccinations for zoo and safari
animals are best obtained from OIE because of international regulations and
Pirbright may be helpful in risk assessment for the safari animals.
The knowledge and insight of Dr. Hugh-Jones who was in the UK at the 67-68
outbreak is very helpful and I would like to express my thanks. - Mod.TG
