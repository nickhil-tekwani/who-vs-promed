On 22 Aug [2008], the Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Central African
Republic [CAR] reported a laboratory confirmed case of yellow fever
[YF]. This is the 2nd yellow fever event reported by the Central
African Republic in 2008. The case has been laboratory confirmed for
yellow fever by the Institut Pasteur, Dakar.

The initial case is a 32-year-old male from Ngotto village,
sub-prefecture of Boda, Prefecture of La Lobaye, who presented with
symptoms of fever and jaundice. He is alive and continues to recover
from his illness. The case was detected by the national yellow fever
surveillance system.

The outbreak investigation team evaluated 34 contacts in Boda
sub-prefecture. [Of these], 4 presented with symptoms of fever or
jaundice, and the other 30 were asymptomatic.

On the basis of the assessment of the outbreak situation, it was
decided to vaccinate 183 992 people against yellow fever [virus] in
the 4 sub-prefectures of the Prefecture of La Lobaye (Mbaiki,
Mongoumba, Boda and Bogonda) and part of the neighboring Prefecture
of La Sangha (sub-prefecture of Bambio).

The Prefecture of La Lobaye is not an endemic area for yellow fever
[virus]. In March 2008, the Central African Republic reported some
yellow fever cases in the northwest of the country, and a mass
vaccination campaign against yellow fever was conducted successfully
in the region.

In response to the outbreak, the MoH has made a request for yellow
fever vaccines and operational costs for the preventative mass
vaccination campaign from the GAVI funded Global Emergency Stockpile
for Yellow Fever Vaccine, managed by the International Coordinating
Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control (YF-ICG).

[This WHO report confirms the earlier press article indicating that
YF cases occurred in the CAR (see ProMED archive no. 20081010.3214).
Given the difficulties in transportation and communication in that
part of the CAR, one wonders whether there are additional but
undetected cases in the region. Archive 20081010.3214 has a
description by Mod.MPP of sylvan (jungle), bridge (intermediate) and
urban transmission cycles of YF virus. If the area of the above YF
cases is not endemic for the virus, it would be of interest to know
where the nearest YF virus-endemic areas are located.

[As noted in archive no. 20081010.3214, Boda is approximately 100 kms
(60 miles) to the southwest of the capital, Bangui. While 60 miles
may not seem a far distance, see
<http://www.multimap.com/world/CF>
for an interactive map of the Central African Republic, in which,
when one zooms in the map, one can see the sparse road network in the
country, thereby increasing the difficulties in transport and
communication. - Mod.MPP]
