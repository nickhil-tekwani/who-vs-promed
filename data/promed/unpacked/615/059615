Potato spindle tuber disease found in Western Australia tomato crop
------------------------------------------
Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid (PSTVd) which affects the potato family
has been detected in Western Australia, 20 years after it was supposedly
eradicated from Australia. [AGWEST senior development officer, Dennis
Phillips says it was found in a tomato crop, in a greenhouse in
the Great Southern region of the State. [The disease can reduce tomato
yields by up to 50 per cent. Mr Phillips says the discovery, which
represents a potential threat to Australia's potato and tomato industries,
has sparked a nationwide survey of greenhouses.

[According to a AGWEST press release dated 18 June 2001, no tomatoes are
allowed to leave the property, movements to and from the quarantined farm
have been restricted, & the affected tomato plants in the greenhouse
will be disposed of by burial. Phillips said this was the first time that
PSTVd had been found in Western Australia. Three separate outbreaks in other
States were successfully eradicated 10 to 15 years ago. He also said that
the disease had been detected recently in New Zealand [see ref. above. The
viroid is seed-borne and is found in solanaceous plants including tomato,
potato and eggplant. He said the affected plants were from
a European-bred variety, which is not grown very widely in
[Western Australia, suggesting that the risk to other properties from the
disease is low. According to Phillips, AGWEST is undertaking a survey of
greenhouse grown tomatoes in the Great Southern and in other parts of the
State to determine if the disease is present on other properties, which
should be completed in about 2 weeks. So far no other crops showing
visual symptoms have been reported after 2 weeks of surveying. Other
States are also undertaking surveys of glasshouse-grown tomatoes. Phillips
said the risk of other properties becoming infected was relatively low
because the affected property is in a remote location from other
horticultural properties. There is no known treatment for PSTVd, which can
only be eradicated by destroying infected plants.
PSTVd and other viroids are extremely infectious. They are autonomously
replicating pathogens that consist solely of unencapsidated,
single-stranded, circular RNAs of 246-375 nucleotides. Viroids do not code
for any protein products. The native structure of viroids is an extremely
stable and highly base-paired rod. Some viroid RNAs have ribozyme activity,
meaning that they are capable of self-cleavage. Implementation of strict
phytosanitary measures -- viroid-free planting stock, disinfection of planting
equipment, etc. -- is required to prevent infection and subsequent spread.
