[As usual, ProMED-mail requests information on the country from which
these cases were imported & the type of cholera involved. We are
especially interested in the spread of type O139. We would also remind
countries that they have an obligation under the International Health
Regulations to report cases of cholera, plague & yellow fever to the
World Health Organization, *even if unconfirmed*, immediately, & not
after a delay of a few weeks as in these cases. - Mod.JW
