Environmental group Greenpeace said Friday it believed the risk of dioxin
contamination was wider than people thought, as Belgian authorities
struggled with a crisis over food tainted with the cancer-causing chemical.
"This is not an isolated case. There were at least 2 similar cases last
year," Greenpeace's Axel Singhofen said.
The 15-nation European Union (EU) imposed a de facto ban on imports of
Brazilian citrus pulp -- a key ingredient in cattle feed -- a year ago
after scientists traced worrying levels of dioxin in some European milk
back to shipments from Brazil.
In February 1998 French authorities closed 3 waste incinerators in the
north of the country after excessive levels of dioxins were detected in the
milk of nearby dairy cows.
Greenpeace said dioxins did not just enter the food chain directly, through
contaminated feed, but also indirectly via air, water and soil pollution.
"There's a long-term problem because of constant emissions of dioxins into
the environment," Greenpeace's Jan Turf said.
Dioxins can be formed when chlorinated substances are burned in the
presence of carbon and oxygen, such as during the incineration of plastics
like PVC (polyvinyl chloride, a plastic) or in the manufacture of
chemicals, pesticides, steel and paints.
They can be spewed out during accidents, such as the factory explosion in
Seveso, Italy, in 1976, when dioxins killed animals and caused skin
diseases among local residents.
These toxic chemicals, thought to be hormone disrupters, remain in fatty
tissue in the body for years and can pass from mother to infant during
breast feeding.
A recent study by Liege-based research organization ISEP showed one
incinerator in Belgium's central-south Wallonia region, which has no legal
limits on dioxins, was emitting 200 times the legal threshold that will be
introduced in 2001. [But what about the legal limits, now? - Mod.TG
Europe-wide laws exist to prevent dangerous pollution. But the EU's
executive Commission says the rules are not always respected. "We are
currently pursuing around 30 (court) cases against Belgium," one European
Commission official said.
These included infringements of EU laws on waste incineration, PCBs
(Polychlorinated Biphenyls)(toxic chlorinates), other hazardous chemicals
and used batteries. Belgium was in contravention of the EU's "Seveso" law,
designed to prevent and contain accidents involving dangerous substances
such as occurred in the Italian town, the Commission official said.
"Belgium has one of the worst records as far as violating EU environmental
laws are concerned," he added.
But he warned other EU states, some of which have banned Belgian meat
imports because of the health scare, had no reason for complacency, adding
that France, Germany and Spain were facing court action for a similar
number of violations.
"We are upgrading our incinerators and doing a survey of dioxin emissions
from all industrial sources in preparation for new European laws," said
Pascal van der Wegen, a senior official in Belgium's Walloon regional
government.
"It takes more time to transpose European law in a federal country like
Belgium," he said, adding that Belgium regularly monitored cattle grazing
near incinerators for dioxin levels.
