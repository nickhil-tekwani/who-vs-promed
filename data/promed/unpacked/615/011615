A strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] previously not
recorded in sub-Saharan Africa has been detected in Nigeria for the
1st time, FAO [UN Food & Agriculture Organization] said today [11 Aug
2008]. Nigeria has recently reported 2 new highly pathogenic avian
influenza outbreaks in the states of Katsina and Kano [see ProMED ref.
below].

Laboratory results from Nigeria and an FAO reference laboratory in
Italy show that the newly discovered virus strain is genetically
different from the strains that circulated in Nigeria during earlier
outbreaks in 2006 and 2007. The new strain has never been reported
before in Africa; it is more similar to strains previously identified
in Europe (Italy), Asia (Afghanistan), and the Middle East (Iran) in
2007.

"The detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in Africa raises
serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been
introduced to the continent," warned Scott Newman, International
Wildlife Coordinator of FAO's Animal Health Service.

"It seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to
Africa, since the last migration of wild birds from Europe and
Central Asia to Africa occurred in September 2007 and this year's
[2008] southerly migration into Africa has not really started yet,
Newman said. It could well be that there are other channels for virus
introduction: international trade, for example, or illegal and
unreported movement of poultry. This increases the risk of avian
influenza spread to other countries in Western Africa."

"Uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge
for control campaigns. Increased surveillance is key to monitoring the
situation and keep track of virus spread," said FAO chief veterinary
officer Joseph Domenech. "FAO greatly appreciates Nigeria's swift
reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus
strain,"

Since the avian influenza epidemic caused by the H5N1 strain started 5
years ago in Asia, the disease has affected over 60 countries; the
vast majority of countries have succeeded in eliminating the virus
from poultry. In Nigeria, the virus was first confirmed in February
2006, and it infected poultry in 25 states before being contained.

FAO supports affected countries and at risk countries to detect bird
flu outbreaks at a very early stage. In Nigeria, FAO has a team of
animal health experts and veterinary epidemiologists working with the
government and its veterinary services. FAO has assisted the
government with disease surveillance and outbreak investigations, as
well as establishing a stockpile of veterinary drugs both at central
and state levels. FAO and the Federal Government of Nigeria have
identified priority areas where animal health and transboundary
animal disease prevention measures need to be improved.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Nigeria sent to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health)
immediate notifications on separate H5N1 outbreaks, on 24 and 25 Jul
2008, addressing outbreaks in 4 different, distant Nigerian states,
namely Katsina, Kano, Kebbi, and Gombe. The reports, including maps,
are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7220>
and
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7217>.

Follow-up reports, due weekly until the epizootic is resolved or
declared endemic, and hopefully including additional epidemiological
information and available data on the origin of the outbreak, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
