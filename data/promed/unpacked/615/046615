The cause of a foodborne outbreak that affected a total of 3453 students and others at 15 public schools in the city of Yashio, Saitama Prefecture, eastern Japan, has been pinpointed to a seaweed salad harboring _Escherichia coli_ bacteria, the city's board of education advised on 13 Jul 2020.

Students had developed symptoms including stomach pains and diarrhea after eating the school-lunch [which included] salad. Stool tests by the prefectural city of Soka's public health center, along with other investigations elsewhere, showed the offending dish to have been the seafood salad served on 26 Jun 2020. The cause of the food poisoning was found to be that wakame seaweed and seaweed salad mix ingredients were not heated up to kill bacteria after being soaked in water.

School lunches remain suspended at the city's schools, and students are expected to bring their own packed lunches until 4 Aug 2020.

[It is unclear whether the _E. coli_ here is an enterohemorrhagic strain such as O157:H7 or one of the other enteropathic strains. Currently available technology can identify these strains. Information from knowledgeable sources in the area will be appreciated. - Mod.LL
