Deschutes County Public Health, Deschutes County Environmental Health, and
the Oregon Department of Human Services are investigating an outbreak of
_E. coli_ O157:H7 infection with common exposure at McGrath's Fish House in
Bend.

To date, 18 cases of diarrhea have been reported; 2 have confirmed _E.
coli_ O157 infection. The restaurant is fully cooperative and working with
the agencies to help identify the source and address any issues. At this
point in time no specific food item stands out as a likely source.

"We ask that persons who ate at McGraths in Bend between 12-18 Oct 2005 and
afterwards who developed diarrhea to call the Deschutes County Health
Department at 322-7451," said Dan Peddycord, Deschutes County Health
Administrator. "Persons with severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, or inability
to keep fluids down should seek medical attention," he added.

Peddycord also cautioned persons with suspected O157 infection to avoid
over-the-counter anti-diarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), and
avoid antibiotics, because these medicines may increase the risk of
complications. "_E. coli_ O157 can be spread easily to other family members
if infected persons don't wash their hands after using the toilet," said
Peddycord.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 produces a powerful toxin and can cause severe illness.
_E. coli_ O157:H7 infections may be spread from a variety of food products,
most commonly undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk and apple cider,
other foods cross-contaminated with raw beef, and untreated water. _E.
coli_ O157:H7 can also be spread person-to-person, primarily within households.

[The vehicle for acquisition of O157 in this outbreak is not yet known.
Once a standard food survey is given to both those affected and unaffected
who ate at the target facility, the information is likely to point to a
source. Since the apparent source is a fish restaurant, the salad bar may
be a prime suspect.

It is often stated that both antimicrobial and antimotility agents should
be avoided in cases suspected to be due to _E. coli_ O157 infections to
avoid complications, particularly hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS). Although a number of studies, including an oft-cited one from the
New England Journal of Medicine (1) suggest that antimicrobial therapy
increases the risk of HUS, a more recent meta-analysis (2) revealed a
pooled odds ratio of only 1.15 with 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of
0.79-1.68, suggesting no higher risk. A thoughtful and analytic editorial
in the same issue of JAMA by Molbak and colleagues (3) agreed that the
bottom line in this issue is not yet known and may relate to the particular
strain of O157, the antimicrobial used, and the timing of antimicrobial
treatment.

Regarding the use of antimotility agents, a retrospective analysis of 278
children who developed O157 enteritis during a 1993 outbreak in Washington
State USA had an odds ratio of 2.9 with CI 1.2-7.5 (4). In those who did
not develop HUS, there was no difference in the median duration of diarrhea
among children who received antimotility agents, but the median duration of
bloody diarrhea was longer (4 vs. 3 days, p less than 0.05). In another
study of 118 _E. coli_ O157 enteritis cases (5), a relative risk of 44.11
was found for those receiving prolonged antimotility agents with CI
8.48-229.4. The proceedings of a recent seminar on this illness, published
in March 2005 in The Lancet (6), categorically states that antimicrobial
agents, antimotility agents, narcotics (also antimotility), and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (can diminish renal blood flow)
should be avoided.
