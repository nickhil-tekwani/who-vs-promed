Latin America
----
- Brazil (Rio Grande do Norte state). 4 Jun 2011. The dengue problem
in Rio Grande do Norte became even greater yesterday [3 Jun 2011]. The
reason is that the 1st dengue [virus] type 4 [infection] in the state
was confirmed. This virus type has not been confirmed in Rio Grande do
Norte for over 30 years, so that few people are immune to this [virus]
variety. These 1st cases were confirmed in the Santa Cruz
municipality, 119 km [74 mi] from Natal. Currently, the main types of
dengue [virus] that afflict the population are types 2 and 3. Of the
13 265 cases reported in the state, 535 are Santa Cruz.
