The Peruvian Ministry of Health (MoH) confirmed that 3 children died because of wild rabies in Napo District, Maynas Province, Loreto region, after being bitten by vampire bats. The 1st case occurred in a 9-year old girl who died 29 May 2015; the 2nd case was a 3-year old girl who died 12 Jun; and the last case was a boy who recently passed away. All infected children lived in Soledad native community.

Dr. Oswaldo Cabanillas, Coordinator of the Zoonoses Sanitary Strategy in the Peruvian MoH, declared that the 1st 2 fatal cases were confirmed on the basis of clinical and epidemiological diagnosis, and the 3rd case was confirmed by laboratory tests. After learning of this situation, both the Regional Government and the MoH appointed health care teams including physicians, nurses, veterinarians, biologists, sanitation inspectors, and epidemiologists, in order to perform surveillance activities in the affected area.

The Peruvian MoH is currently evaluating whether to soon start a massive vaccination campaign against rabies to all inhabitants of Napo district, approximately 20 000 persons. "In the case of vaccination against rabies, 5 doses of the vaccine will be administered to persons who had already been bitten, and 3 doses will be administered to non-exposed persons", said Dr. Cabanillas.

The rabies virus is present in some areas of the Amazon jungle, and it is transmitted by vampire bat bites, and these animals also attack cattle and pigs.

In March, the Soledad native community reported the death of 10 cattle, and the Pipischa community reported 12 cattle dead because of rabies; and for this reason coordination activities are being performed with SENASA (Peruvian Service for Animal Sanitation) in order to also vaccinate domestic animals.

[Unfortunately exposure to vampire bats is all too frequent in the Amazon basin. They feed on sleeping individuals in their hammocks at night when feet come out from under the mosquito nets, and their bite is painless. If they can vaccinate livestock, the Peruvian MOH has to seriously consider vaccinating humans, though 20 000 is a large number. - Mod.MHJ
