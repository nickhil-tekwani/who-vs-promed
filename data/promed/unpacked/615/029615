North Carolina: Death of Youth Infected in September 2003
---------------------------------------------------
A 14-year-old North Carolina youth who suffered from leukemia has died from
West Nile Virus infection that he contracted in September 2003, state
health officials said on Mon 23 Feb 2004. A resident of Kill Devil Hills
who suffered from acute lymphatic leukemia when he was diagnosed with West
Nile virus infection died on 19 Jan 2004. Chemotherapy had weakened his
immune system, making him more susceptible to the effects of West Nile
virus infection, health officials said.
The youth, who would have turned 15 on [Mon?]day, was eulogized earlier
this month during the National West Nile Conference by Dr. Lyle Petersen,
director of the vector-borne infectious disease section of the Centers for
Disease Control. Petersen told West Nile virus experts from across the
country that the youth's passing put a "human face" on the disease. He
emphasized that the disease must be taken seriously and vigorously
controlled in order to prevent future tragedies.
During 2003, 22 North Carolinians were infected with West Nile virus and 2
of them died. 2 other people were diagnosed with West Nile virus infection
in North Carolina, but they were infected in another state. The other North
Carolina fatality was an elderly Davie County man who also had a weakened
immune system.
Mosquitoes transmit the virus, and wild birds serve as natural hosts for
it. Mosquitoes bite the birds and then can transmit the viruses to humans
and animals. A person can't catch the diseases from another person or an
infected animal.
