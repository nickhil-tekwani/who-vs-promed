San Link Inc in Brooklyn, NY, is recalling vacuum-packaged dried
chechon because the product was found to be uneviscerated. The
recalled vacuum-packaged dried chechon was distributed in New York
State in random weight plastic bags (0.66 pound average), coded
21.12.2008. The fish is a product of Russia.

The vacuum-packaged dried chechon was sampled by a New York State
Department of Agriculture and Market Food Inspector during a routine
inspection. Subsequent analysis of the product by New York State Food
Laboratory personnel confirmed the fish was not properly eviscerated
prior to processing.

The sale of uneviscerated fish is prohibited under New York State
Agriculture and Market regulations because _Clostridium botulinum_
spores are more likely to be concentrated in the viscera than any
other portion of the fish. Uneviscerated fish have been linked to
outbreaks of botulism poisoning.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

The NY state Agriculture Department is warning consumers against
eating a brand of steamed mackerel distributed from a downstate
importer. The product, Steamed Mackarel, distributed by the Gusto
Food Inc., in Maspeth, NY, was sold in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, Ohio and Michigan in uncoded,
half-pound plastic bags. The bag indicates the product is from
Thailand.

State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker said the mackerel was
uneviscerated, which goes against state regulations. No illnesses
have been reported in connection to Gusto Food's steamed mackerel.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to
defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily
do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_.

The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Regulations Section 540.650: Uneviscerated Fish Products that
are Salt-cured, Dried, or Smoked (CPG 7108.17)
<http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg540-650.htm>:

Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several
outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous
in fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent
a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative
cell growth and toxin production.

A total of 3 outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11
illnesses, resulted from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and
1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is
also known as "rybetz," "ribeyza," or "rostov." Kapchunka is an
uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may
not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as
cooking.

The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a
minimum of 25 days and then air dried at ambient temperature for 3 to
7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly
stored under refrigeration.

In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" was
implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh
is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh
mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which
may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. In another, an
ethnic fish product called "moloha" caused a botulism outbreak
involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated,
salt-cured fish product similar to "faseikh." The preparation steps
in the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of
the "moloha" could not be found. - Mod.LL]
