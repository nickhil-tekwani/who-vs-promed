Investigators attached to the U.K. BSE inquiry, which starts on Monday, were
combing through files at the Treasury today as part of what this story
called an unprecedented search of Government departments. Teams of
"para-legals" (young helpers with legal training working under the
supervision of experienced lawyers) have been set to work sifting through
thousands of documents locked away in Whitehall vaults. Armed with laptop
computers, they are looking for anything which might shed light on events
leading up to the beef crisis, and linking pieces of the jigsaw together.
The aim of the deep probing inquiry, headed by Appeal Court judge Lord
Justice Phillips, is to explore the root causes of "mad cow disease" and the
former Tory Government's handling of the crisis. Today it emerged that the
inquiry, which will hear evidence from former ministers and senior civil
servants, is expected to cost more than 2 million. Much of the money will
ultimately come from the tax payer. The five Government departments involved
(the Department of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Welsh, Scottish and
Northern Ireland offices) are meeting their own costs.
The inquiry team has received more than 500 submissions from members of the
public, ranging from letters to 200-page documents. The investigators have
sought evidence from more than 100 scientists and members of the rendering
food (sic) industry and written to more than 300 ministers, ex-ministers and
civil servants. The team has been given unfettered access to Government
files, and so far has not encountered any resistance from ministers or
officials.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The formal hearings of the official BSE Inquiry begins on Monday 9 March
1998. As indicated in Lord Justice Phillips's opening speech the daily
transcripts of evidence will be put on a dedicated Web site at
<http://www.bse.org.uk>. This has already been set up. It already contains
useful background information relating to the Inquiry itself and the history
of BSE.

get some idea of how UK Public Inquiries are run; Tom, I believe, is an
American. - Mod.MHJ

Who? Expert in what? How about naming "our London expert"? Otherwise we have

>>"The Philips enquiry starts Monday. The enquiry has been neutered by the
fact that witnesses can't be forced to give evidence, if witnesses choose to
give evidence they cannot be made to testify under oath, and there is no
protection for witnesses from legal assaults by the agro-chemical industry
or other punitive measures taken by those witnesses criticise (including
their employers). Also, government papers from the last administration may
be seen by the enquiry but their contents cannot be included in the
enquiry's final report."<<
"Our (anonymous) London expert" (and Tom) both appear completely to lack
knowledge or understanding of how the UK Public Inquiry system works. We
(except for "our London expert") saw an example of its working in the Scott
Inquiry into the arms for Iraq scandal, which resulted in discrediting
specific Government Ministers and civil service officials who were involved
in the illegal provision of British-supplied arms to Iraq before the Gulf
war. That Inquiry did not have the Web site that this one has, with daily
verbatim transcripts of the evidence, but the media reported it very
extensively day by day. It was that day-by-day reporting that played a large
part in the downfall of the then Government at the General Election last year.
Witnesses are required to give written evidence in advance and are then
subjected to very intense pubic grilling by the Inquiry's counsel and by the
Judge himself. And Tom's "London expert" should have advised him that
"taking the Fifth" is a peculiarly US provision that does not operate in
the UK.
In his speech on 28 January, Phillips said
"This Inquiry has no statutory powers to order people to help or to attend.
Having regard to the subject matter of the Inquiry I would not expect to
need such powers. We have already been promised the fullest co-operation
from the various Ministries involved and I anticipate that anyone who is
asked to assist us will be anxious to do so. I should add that, in order to
ensure that those who give evidence have no inhibition about speaking
frankly, I have been authorised by the Head of the Civil Service to say that
no evidence or other assistance given by any civil servant will be used as
the basis for any disciplinary proceeding against him or her."
With the addition of the Web site verbatim transcripts of evidence and the
full details of the arrangements that Lord Justice Phillips described, any
witness "invited" to give evidence, any refusing would be so publicly
pilloried that none would dare to decline.
Perhaps we all ought to re-read the speech of Lord Justice Phillips about
how the enquiry will be run. It has been on the IFST Web site at
<http://www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/bseedm.htm>
since the day it was given, and is now on the BSE Inquiry Web site at
<http://www.bse.org.uk>
Incidentally, the BSE Inquiry Web site has a feedback e-mail form for any
member of the public to bring to the attention of the Inquiry any relevant
matter that they wish. I have already made use of it to point out that
"history of BSE" pages do not include any reference to research, and should
be enhanced by including references to significant research milestones and
the dates of publication.
I am encouraged by the reported fact that the investigators are not only
trawling through MAFF and Department of Health papers, but Treasury papers.
I have used the feedback form to suggest that they extend their
investigations to the Department of Trade and Industry, too.
Unlike Tom and his "London expert", I would not prejudge the outcome but I
shall wait to see what emerges day-by-day and will judge the outcome
accordingly.
[A further posting by Ralph, adding to the above.
... but here is an afterthought.
Throughout the BSE events from 1985 onwards, the strongest critic of the
then Tory Government's handling of affairs was the Labour Opposition. The
General Election of May 1997 turned out the Tories and returned a Labour
Government with a thumping great majority. It is that Labour Government that
has set up the BSE Inquiry.
IFST is a-political, and both being associated with IFST and as an
individual scientist, I keep clear of politics. But as an observer for over
half a century of adult life, I recognise the realities of life, one of
which is that the political party in power will always act in self-interest,
the main plank of which is to do its very best to discredit the opposing
party.
In the Government's eyes this must be seen as a splendid opportunity to
discredit its predecessor, now the Opposition party.
So I invite Tom, usually a realist and cynic, to ponder and explain why he
thinks the present Government has set up the Inquiry so as do the very
opposite of what is in its self-interest. [Tom had suggested that the
"process itself has been given a good coat of whitewash. Hamstrung as it
were, from the get-go."

be excruciatingly boring except to the most dedicated, I am sure it will be
instructive to visit. - Mod.MHJ
