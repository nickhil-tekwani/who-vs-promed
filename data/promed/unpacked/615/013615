---------------------------------------------------------------------
_Cocos nucifera_ is considered the most important crop along the coastal belt of West Africa. In Cote d'Ivoire, it is cultivated on approximately 50 000 hectares and represents the main source of income in the coastal region.

Lethal yellowing (LY)-type diseases affecting coconut and other palm species worldwide have mostly been associated with phytoplasma strains of group 16SrIV 'Coconut lethal yellows'. However, LY-type diseases like Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) in Ghana, the "maladie de Kaincope" in Togo and Awka disease (Lethal Decline, LD) in Nigeria, previously included in 16SrIV group have been recently classified as a new group 16SrXXII [http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/57/8/1855.full - Mod.DHA].

[An] LY-type disease has quickly developed among coconut palms in the Grand-Lahou in Cote d'Ivoire, currently affecting more than 7000 hectares [ProMED-mail post 20130301.1563457]. Symptoms include leaf yellowing starting in the old leaves quickly moving to the young ones, drying of spikelet progressing to blackening of the whole inflorescence, rotting of heart [and] immature fruit drop. Crown death of the palm [occurs] after 6 months of initial symptoms appearance leaving a scenery of bare trunks, typically known as "telephone poles".

[Samples of] symptomatic (17) and symptomless (8) coconut palms were [analysed by] nested PCR assay. Samples that yielded amplicons (7/17) were sequenced. No PCR amplicons were obtained from symptomless coconut plants surveyed. Phytoplasma [amplicons] shared 100 percent sequence identity with each other. The consensus sequence exhibited 99 percent identity with phytoplasma members of group 16SrIV with the highest score for the CSPW phytoplasma from Ghana. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rDNA sequence supported the grouping of the Cote d'Ivoire lethal yellowing phytoplasma (CILY) within the LY cluster, closely related to the Ghanaian CSPW strain.

There have been no previous official records of LY-type disease [in coconuts in Ivory Coast]. Since the country hosts one of the 5 multi-site International Coconut Genebanks for Africa and the Indian Ocean, CSPW was always a threat to Cote d'Ivoire. Considering the devastating effects caused by CSPW in Ghana, the 1st report of a CSPW strain in Cote d'Ivoire represents a significant impact for the national coconut industry. There is an urgent need to develop effective control measures to halt spread of the disease.

[Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease is caused by a phytoplasma tentatively assigned to the palm lethal yellowing 16SrIV group. The disease was thought to be a localised problem in Ghana, but since 1985 new disease foci have developed at an alarming rate in the major coconut-producing areas of the Western and Central regions. The Ivory Coast coconut population has long been considered under threat from CSPW spreading from neighbouring Ghana (ProMED-mail post 20090831.3067). A new undiagnosed disease of coconut reported earlier in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20130301.1563457) has now been shown to represent the arrival of CSPW in Ivory Coast.

A research programme on the epidemiology of CSPW was launched in 2007 in Ghana to provide information for the development of management strategies. No insect vector could be identified with certainty so far, but preliminary evidence suggests that species of _Derbidae_ may be involved in the spread of LY in Tanzania and possibly also in CSPW spread in Ghana.

Worldwide, very few coconut varieties have shown real tolerance to LY diseases, and the level of susceptibility varies depending on disease pressure and locality. Recent observations of breakdown of resistance in some widely used hybrids are causing great concern for coconut replanting programmes worldwide. Reasons for the breakdown are still uncertain and may include genetic variation of the host, the pathogen, or the vector. In Ghana, despite major efforts, only one 5th of the coconut plantings devastated by CSPW could be restored so far because replanted palms have again been killed by CSPW. Resistance breeding programmes are continuing in the region.

Coconut palms in Ivory Coast have also been reported to be affected by bud rot (also called heart rot) caused mainly by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora katsurae_ (ProMED-mail post 20100721.2444).
