Two confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 infection have been linked to a farm in England. Acton Scott Historic Working Farm in Shropshire temporarily closed this past week to take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of visitors becoming infected. The steps include providing more handwashing facilities and improving safety information about feeding and touching animals.

Members of the Public Health England (PHE) West Midlands Health Protection Team and environmental health colleagues from Shropshire Council are involved in the investigation at the farm, which is owned by the council. No information was provided about the patients.

Dr. Adrian Phillips, consultant with PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said _E. coli_ O157 can cause illness ranging from mild symptoms to severe bloody diarrhea. It can also lead to kidney failure and death in severe cases. "The farm has multiple hand sanitizer points across the site to help protect from coronavirus; however, if people have been touching things which could be infected with _E. coli_, including touching farm animals, handwashing with warm water and soap is necessary to prevent stomach bugs," he said.

"During spring and summer, especially over holiday periods, there is generally an increase in gastrointestinal infections which are often associated with a range of activities including farm or park visits, where infections can be picked up by handling or stroking animals. Good hand hygiene for all, and supervised hand hygiene for small children, is essential to minimize the risk of developing a stomach bug."

Cecilia Motley, Shropshire Council's cabinet member responsible for leisure said once it was informed of a possible _E. coli_ link, the decision was taken to temporarily close the farm. "We are using this time to explore the work that is needed to meet the requirements to keep everyone safe. Work will include things like more handwashing facilities, extra training for staff and better signage, along with other alterations to how the farm operates. Until such time as measures can be put in place the farm will remain closed."

PHE advice includes washing hands after going to the toilet and before preparing food or eating, keep hot food hot and cold food cold, don't eat or drink or put fingers in your mouth while near animals or before washing hands, ensure small children are supervised when washing hands with hot water, soap and paper towels, and clean shoes and pushchair wheels before leaving the farm and ahead of entering the car and your home.

[Not much information is given about the farm in the posting, but a description can be found at https://www.actonscott.com/historic-working-farm. The illnesses seem to be related to direct or indirect exposure to livestock, but it is not clear that unpasteurized dairy products from the farm have been ruled out as a cause.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:

"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised."
