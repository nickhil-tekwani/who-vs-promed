A new sexual fetish sweeping across Japan has led to an outbreak of pink eye in schools, unofficially called "oculolinctus". Fans of the fetish become sexually aroused by licking their partner's eyeballs or having their own eyeballs licked. Authorities first became aware that something was going on when kids began showing up at school wearing eye patches.

Pink eye is caused by bacteria getting into the eye, causing the eye to become irritated, red, and swollen, so it is no surprise that eyeball licking ended up causing issues. According to a teacher, almost one-third of 6th grade students have tried eyeball licking. "When I looked inside, a male pupil and a female pupil had their faces close together and were kind of fumbling around," the teacher said. " 'Could it be bullying?' I wondered, but when I had a good look, the boy was licking the girl's eye."

Eyeball licking is considered to be the new "2nd base", according to The Daily Caller.

A rash of eyeball licking -- a strange erotic activity -- in a Japanese elementary school reportedly led to a pink eye epidemic.

Alternatively called "oculolinctus" or "worming", eyeball licking has few public advocates but they include a 29 year old environmental science student in the US Virgin Islands. "My boyfriend started licking my eyeballs years ago and I just loved it. I'm not with him anymore, but I still like to ask guys to lick my eyeballs," she told The Huffington Post.

Eyeball licking has been around at least since the mid-2000s and a simple YouTube search brings up hundreds of videos from "oculolinctus" lovers who want to share their peeper porn with others.

However, eye experts are worried that this dangerous fad is gaining popularity with preteens, especially after news reports of elementary school students in Japan who dared to test their ocular boundaries and caused multiple cases of pinkeye, otherwise known as conjunctivitis, the Daily Caller reported. In one classroom of 12 year olds, one third of students confessed to "worming" or being "wormed". Officials only noticed something was up when some of the licked students showed up to school wearing eye patches, ShanghaiList.com reported.

Currently, eyeball licking is only attempted by a small percentage of adventurers, including HuffPost Weird News journalist Andy Campbell, who said he had his own eyeball tongued to see what it's like. "It's strange to have something touch the eye without it hurting," Campbell said. "I was a receiver, not a giver. I don't see it as a sexual thing. But you have to be comfortable with someone."

San Diego ophthalmologist Dr David Granet is worried that the news of eyeball licking will cause it to spread. "Nothing good can come of this," Granet warned HuffPost. "There are ridges on the tongue that can cause a corneal abrasion. And if a person hasn't washed out their mouth, they might put acid from citrus products or spices into the eye." Dr David Najafi, an ophthalmologist in La Mesa, California, said if the licker has a cold sore, it is possible to spread herpes into the eye as well. "The cornea is very sensitive and could be scarred," he warned.

Other dangers from "oculolinctus" include conjunctivitis or "pink eye," a swelling of the thin, filmy membrane that covers the inside of the eyelids and the white part of the eye.

You might have been told the superstition that masturbation causes your vision to blur, but eyeball licking can actually cause blindness, according to Dr Phillip Rizzuto, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. "The bacteria in the mouth are nothing like the bacteria in the eyeball, which is why we no longer recommend people lick contact lenses to moisten them," Rizzuto said.

Those serious problems may not be enough to stop eyeball licking lovers like the [29 year old student], who admits her habit did put her eyesight at risk at one point. "I got some weird offshoot of TB in my eye once. I ended up with corneal ulcers and I spent like a month in the hospital," she said. "Nobody really knows why. Well, I got over it, and I'm fine now. That was like 6 years ago. I'm just safer now, I guess ... Live and learn. I mean they don't really make tongue rubbers, but maybe they should."

[Conjunctivitis is commonly referred to as "red" or "pink" eye, a sign of inflammation that is usually accompanied by a discharge of varying viscosity. Conjunctivitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, fungi, allergens, or toxins (such as chlorine in swimming pool water). A watery discharge is most consistent with viral or allergic conjunctivitis. A mucopurulent or purulent discharge, often associated with morning crusting and difficulty opening the eyelids, strongly suggests a bacterial infection. Pain, photophobia, or blurred vision suggest a more serious disease process such as keratitis.

Keratitis, which is inflammation of the cornea, is accompanied by conjunctivitis; it may be due to corneal injury, toxins, or infection itself, or the corneal injury (such as due to contact lens) may facilitate bacteria or fungi gaining access to the cornea through the damaged surface. Eyeball-licking, that is, rubbing the rough surface of the tongue over the conjunctiva and cornea, as described in the news reports above, may traumatize the eye's epithelial surfaces and introduce potential pathogens that are found in saliva.

The normal conjunctival sac is either sterile or contains small numbers of strict anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria; _Propionibacterium acnes_ is the dominant anaerobe and _Staphylococcus epidermidis_ is the dominant facultative organism (http://archopht.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=632712). Saliva, however, unlike the conjunctiva, contains large numbers of hundreds of different bacterial species that have been washed off multiple different mucosal habitats in the oropharyngeal cavity. Some are distinct pathogens, which can attach to the epithelial surfaces and withstand attack by lysozyme, an enzyme present in tears that destroys the cell wall of some bacteria.

The commonest bacterial causes of conjunctivitis that may be found in saliva are _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5204a2.htm), _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _Staphylococcus aureus_. Other bacterial pathogens that may be found in saliva include _Neisseria meningitidis_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2237127), _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, and _Chlamydia trachomatis_. Gonococcal, as well as meningococcal ocular infection, if left untreated, can cause rapid and severe corneal involvement and, ultimately, permanent loss of vision.

Adenoviruses, which are associated with upper respiratory tract infection, common cold, or sore throat, are by far the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis; another viral pathogen found in saliva is Herpes simplex virus, which can cause corneal ulceration and possible scarring. Rarely, amebae and fungi can cause conjunctivitis, usually in immunocompromised persons or in an eye traumatized by a contact lens.

Keratitis is a serious complication when contact lenses are worn. In severe cases, it can lead to corneal scarring that impair vision, and may lead to the need for a cornea transplant. Contact lens users are admonished never to put contact lenses in the mouth or moisten them with saliva because of the fear of introducing pathogens found in saliva on the mucosal surface of the conjunctiva and cornea traumatized by the lens (http://www.gpspecialists.com/pdf/bostonxo_insert.pdf and http://visionmd.org/2012/09/10/urine-and-other-things-you-shouldnt-put-into-your-eye/).
