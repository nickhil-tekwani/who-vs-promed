Chikungunya outbreak in Reunion: epidemiology and surveillance, 2005
to early January 2006
--------------------
Last week, Eurosurveillance reported on the chikungunya outbreak in
Reunion [1]. The epidemic pattern of the outbreak has considerably
changed since the end of December 2005, as the weather conditions are
currently favourable for vector multiplication. The article below
describes the situation as it was in early January 2006 [2].
The weekly number of reported cases has been underestimated for the
last 2 weeks of December [2005] and the 1st week of January [2006],
as transmission is now occurring very rapidly. The surveillance
system described in this article, based on active case finding, was
replaced by a sentinel system in January 2006.
Introduction:
A large outbreak of chikungunya [3,4] occurred in the Comoros
islands, off the east coast of Africa, in early 2005, with more than
5000 cases notified between January and March. Since then, the virus
has been circulating to other islands in the Indian Ocean, and cases
have been reported in Mayotte and Mauritius. The first case of
chikungunya infection was identified in the island of Reunion, which
is an overseas administrative departement of France, in March 2005,
and an outbreak has been ongoing in Reunion ever since.
While the outbreak situation is constantly subject to change, this
study gives an overview of the epidemiology of chikungunya disease,
10 months after the first cases were reported in Reunion. The study
also highlights the existence of neurological forms of the disease
never described before.
Method:
The epidemiological surveillance system for chikungunya infections
aims to describe the characteristics of the outbreak, and make early
identification of new transmission clusters. It is based on data
transmitted from mobile vector control teams, who carry out active
case finding based on information from cases notified through the
network of sentinel physicians, microbiology laboratories and general
practitioners, and from patients themselves. This surveillance is
complemented by a surveillance of severe cases by hospitals.
A suspected case is defined as a patient with a rapid onset of fever
over 38.5 C with incapacitating joint pain. A case is confirmed by
the detection of anti-chikungunya virus IgM and/or detection of viral
[RNA] by RT-PCR or virus isolation.
Results:
Between 28 Mar 2005 and 8 Jan 2006, 7138 cases of chikungunya
infection were reported by the surveillance system implemented in
Reunion, representing an attack rate of 9.4/1000 inhabitants. The
epidemic curve shows a first peak of 450 cases between 9 and 15 May
2005. From the end of September 2005, the number of cases rapidly
rose again to over 300 cases in the last week of 2005 (figure 11). A
total of 2147 cases (30 percent) were laboratory confirmed.
Figure 1. [see URL link provided above]:
Chikungunya cases (confirmed and suspected, n=7438), Reunion, 28 Mar
2005 - 8 Jan 2006. Source: CIRE Reunion-Mayotte.
The male/female ratio is 0.68. The predominance of female cases is
observed in all age groups, except in children under 15 years. All
age groups are affected, and the attack rate increases according to
age, from 3.8/1000 in the 0-15 years age group to 10.2/1000 in people
60 years and over (Chi square for linear trend 853, p<10 to the -5).
Distribution of cases is heterogeneous on the island territory. The
comparison of attack rate according to the area of residence for each
of the 3 outbreak periods shows successive cluster patterns. The
north of the island was affected by the 1st outbreak peak, and the
south and east of the island were affected by subsequent peaks from
the beginning of the southern hemisphere summer (Figure 2).
Figure 2. [see URL link provided above] Attack rates for chikungunya
infections per 100 000 inhabitants, by administrative commune,
Reunion, March 2005 - January 2006
The main clinical symptoms in patients are fever (99.6 percent),
joint pain (99.2 percent), muscle pain (97.7 percent) and headache
(84.1 percent). Almost a quarter (23 percent) of patients had
haemorrhagic symptoms, such as bleeding from the nose or gums. From
the 2570 completed medical forms, the proportion of patients admitted
to hospital was 3.9 percent. No death directly due to chikungunya
infection has been reported since the beginning of the outbreak in Reunion.
The French national reference centre for arbovirology confirmed a
diagnosis of chikungunya for 6 newborns who showed symptoms of acute
infection, and presented with a meningoencephalitis picture within 5
days of birth. The mothers of all 6 children had acute chikungunya
infection within the 48 hours before delivery. 6 adult cases of
meningoencephalitis were reported and confirmed by the national
reference centre in elderly patients who were already in poor health
due to old age or an underlying chronic disease. These neurological
forms represent 1.7/1000 of all patients.
Furthermore, acute severe infections with no neurological picture
have been reported in 2 newborns and 13 infants. All were admitted to
hospital following pain and fever syndromes resistant to common
treatments. Some of the infants needed artificial feeding because of
jaw pain. Evidence of mosquito bites was found in at least 3 of the infants.
Discussion:
In contrast to what had happened in neighbouring islands, and despite
a period of lower transmission between July and October [2005],
transmission of chikungunya virus did not stop in Reunion, and case
numbers began to increase again with the arrival of the southern
hemisphere summer in December.
Most of the available data used to estimate the size of the outbreak
came from active case finding carried out as part of the vector
control campaign. From the end of December 2005, the increase of the
daily number of notifications exceeded investigation capacity, and
this led to an underestimate of the number of cases. Because of this
situation, and the fact that infections in people who had no or very
few symptoms were not notified, the surveillance data currently
available underestimate the true size of the outbreak.
Despite this limitation, the surveillance system has been able to
describe disease spatiotemporal trends, and to detect transmission
clusters early, and this has been useful for optimizing control
measures. Most of the island has been affected by the virus, except
for high-altitude areas where vectorial transmission is low. It seems
that the outbreak disseminates as clusters, affecting each town in
turn. The impact of vector control measures, combined with the
progressive acquisition of immunity by the exposed population, could
explain this dynamic.
12 meningoencephalitis cases associated with chikungunya infection
have been classified as confirmed following detection of
anti-chikungunya virus IgM and/or viral genome in the cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) or in the sera, associated with clinical symptoms and
brain imagery. Although described for the first time, these
observations are not surprising, considering that the chikungunya
virus belongs to a family of viruses, Togaviridae, which are known to
be neurotropic and cause human meningoencephalitis in North and South America.
Mother-to-child transmission is the most likely route of transmission
for the 6 affected children with encephalitis diagnosed between 3 and
5 days after birth, and born to mothers with acute infections. The
outbreak in Reunion is the first outbreak of this size in a
population that has an efficient surveillance system and access to a
healthcare structure with sophisticated paraclinical and
microbiological facilities. This may be why neurological forms have
been detected in addition to mother-to-child transmission of the
chikungunya virus, never described during previous outbreaks [5,6,7].
To date, these neurological forms remain very rare compared with the
total number of chikungunya cases observed. All patients so far have
recovered, although it is not yet possible to draw mid- and long-term
consequences on the psychomotor development of affected newborns. In
addition to neurological complications, there may be indirect
consequences for debilitated and weak patients, such as elderly
people and those with chronic diseases.
These events have led to a reinforcement of prevention and control
measures. The surveillance system is being further simplified and
modified, in particular, by mobilizing clinician networks on the
island to be better adapted to the new epidemic dynamics.

[This over view article gives readers a general picture of the
chikungunya outbreaks during the past 10 months on the offshore
islands in the Indian Ocean of East Africa. Most, if not all, of the
archipelagoes, including the Comoros, Seychelles, mayotte, mauritius
and Reunion islands are affected. There have been more than 15 000
cases officially reported in Reunion alone (see prior ProMED-mail
postings below). The 12 laboratory-confirmed cases, with IgM and RNA
in the CSF, are proof of neurological
involvement. Meningoencephalitis has not been seen frequently in the
past and has been considered a rare finding. 6 cases of
mother-to-child transmission have emerged so far in the current
outbreak. - Mod.RY]
