Guatemala: 24 deaths in outbreak of rotavirus infection
-------------------------------------------------------
Raquel Leon, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, reported that a 1
year old child died yesterday in San Juan Sacatepequez, a village located
about 18 miles west of Guatemala's capital. The death toll in an outbreak
of rotavirus infection, over the past 2 weeks, has reached 24.
According to statistics, 15 children have died in the state of Guatemala
(center), 6 in Escuintla (south), 1 in Suchitepequez (south), and 2 in
Sacatepequez (west). In the period between last Saturday [7 Feb 2004] and
last Monday [9 Feb 2004], 230 new pediatric cases of "acute diarrheal
disease" were registered. Of these, 88 are children under 1 year of age,
124 are children between 1 and 4 years of age, and 18 are 5 year olds.
Due to the crisis last weekend, the Ministry has opened 11 health centers
available 24 hours a day to handle the large number of cases. The centers
are located north, south, and west of the capital, as well as in the states
of Suchitepequez, and Sacatepequez.

[Rotavirus infection primarily affects young children under 2 years of age
and is manifested as vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Spread is mainly by the
fecal-oral route. The virus destroys the apical cells of the duodenum and
upper ileum, which results in maladsorption. Dehydration is common and if
not dealt with promptly has serious consequences. - Mod.CP]

USA: suspected norovirus outbreak at Philadelphia hotel
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials are investigating an outbreak of illnesses at a
Philadelphia hotel that recently played host to about 200 Republican
leaders, including President George W Bush. At least 69 guests at the Loews
Philadelphia Hotel -- all attending a business conference -- went to the
hospital last week when an [undiagnosed presumptive infectious agent]
caused dizziness and vomiting. More fell ill, but did not seek medical
attention.
In addition, 2 people at a Republican retreat to discuss party policy on 29
to 31 Jan 2004 -- a member of House Speaker Dennis Hastert's staff and a
second staff member's spouse -- became ill the day after checking out, an
aide to the Illinois Republican said on Tuesday. Neither was admitted to
hospital.
Philadelphia Health Department spokesman Jeff Moran said investigators are
looking at several possible causes for the outbreak, including food
contamination and norovirus infection, an illness that has been known to
afflict travelers on cruise ships. Most of the sicknesses did not occur
until several days after the Republicans left. Moran said there was nothing
to indicate the outbreak was linked to the Republican gathering, and no
foul play was suspected.
Hardest hit were employees of Cendant Mortgage attending a meeting on 2 Feb
2004 for a sales conference. Jeanine Dooley, a spokesman for the Mount
Laurel, New Jersey-based company, said 69 employees sought treatment in
emergency rooms. "Everyone is fine now," she said. About 13 employees of
Cytogen Corp., an oncology pharmaceutical group based in Princeton, New
Jersey, also became sick but did not seek medical attention, said senior
sales director Corey Jacklin. This meeting was held between 2 and 8 Feb
2004. "It was like a 24-hour gastroenteritis virus infection," Jacklin said.
Valerie Ferguson, regional vice president and managing director for Loews,
said the company hopes to know the origin of the outbreak within a few
weeks, and praised the city for doing a "thorough job" investigating. City
health officials were contacting hotel guests to ask what they ate, and
some have been tested, which may help identify the illness, Moran said.
There have been no new cases in several days.

[Although norovirus infection is suspected, apart from the abrupt onset and
self-limiting nature of the illness, there is no confirmatory evidence that
this outbreak is a consequence of virus infection. Further information is
awaited. - Mod.CP]
