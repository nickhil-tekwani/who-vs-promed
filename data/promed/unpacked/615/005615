A Standardbred horse at a private facility developed neurological signs on 10 May 2018 and was subsequently euthanized.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 23 May 2018 that a horse from York County, Maine has been diagnosed with equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

"One Standardbred horse showed an onset of clinical signs on 10 May 2018, including acute neurologic signs rapidly progressing to recumbency," the EDCC said. "The case was confirmed with testing sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, and a quarantine was initiated on 15 May 2018. The index case was euthanized, and 12 horses remain in quarantine on the facility."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurological form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurological signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[This is a very nasty disease for horses and their owners. Biosecurity when you travel with your horse is paramount in helping to keep your animal safe. Be sure to take the temperature at least twice daily. Record it. A slight rise in body temperature may be the earliest sign of a problem. Seek medical care immediately. - Mod.TG
