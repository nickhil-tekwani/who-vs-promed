The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Cowichan Valley Meat
Market are warning the public not to consume the pepperoni products
described below because they may be contaminated with _Clostridium
botulinum_. Toxins produced by these bacteria may cause botulism, a
life-threatening illness.

The following pepperoni products, bearing PKGD. ON (packaged on) dates
up to and including JL 28 (July 28), are affected by this alert:
- Pub Style Pepperoni
- Mild Pepperoni
- Hot Pepperoni
- X-Hot Pepperoni
- Teriyaki Beef Sticks

These products were sold at Cowichan Valley Meat Market, located at
5191 Koksilah Frontage Road, Duncan, British Columbia. There have been
no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.

Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or
smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with the toxin may
cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision,
dry throat, respiratory failure, and paralysis. In severe cases of
illness, people may die.

The manufacturer, Cowichan Valley Meat Market, Duncan, BC, is
voluntarily recalling the affected products from the marketplace. The
CFIA is monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in these cases)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of
_Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
