On 22 Jun 2007, blood specimens collected by the Yap Department of
Health Services and tested at CDC (Centers for Disease Control) labs
showed that the recent illness in Yap is likely caused by the Zika
virus.
The Yap outbreak appears to have started in April 2007 and to have
peaked in late May [2007]; however, cases continue to present. In
this outbreak the symptoms are mild and generally last for 4-7 days,
consisting of:
* a maculopapular rash involving the trunk and extremities that is
sometimes pruritic;
* conjunctivitis; and
* joint pain that can affect both large joint and the smaller joints
of the hands and feet.
As of Thu 29 Jun [2007], there have been 42 cases confirmed to be
Zika by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] and IgM analysis. An
additional 65 probable cases with at least 2 of these symptoms have
presented to the outpatient department of the Yap Memorial Hospital
and at the Wa'ab Community Health Center. No patients have been
admitted to the hospital and there have been no deaths. Because the
disease is mild, many more infections are thought to have occurred in
the community that did not seek medical attention. An initial
assessment in the community indicates that a significant proportion
of the population has been affected. Geographically, cases have
occurred all over the island of Yap.
Rapid tests used in Yap for dengue have given false positive results
on patients with Zika virus (PanBio and Pentax).
Traditionally, illness caused by Zika was termed "Zika Fever."
However fever has been an inconsistent feature of this Zika outbreak.
Other symptoms that have been noted in the Yap outbreak include
retro-orbital eye pain, myalgias, lower extremity edema,
lymphadenopathy, and diarrhea.
An enhanced environmental campaign to reduce mosquito-breeding areas
in Yap is ongoing. The Yap community has been asked to avoid mosquito
bites by wearing long clothing, staying within screened areas and
using mosquito repellents and coils, especially when ill.
The Yap Department of Health Services is conducting further
investigations to better characterize the clinical presentation of
the illness, the magnitude of the outbreak, and the mode of
transmission in order to determine the best control measures. They
will be continuing to work with FSM [Federated States of Micronesia]
Department of Health, Education, and Social Services, the WHO,
Institut Pasteur, and the CDC.

[The Zika virus etiology in this epidemic appears to be clear, given
the PCR results, although this report does not mention isolation of
the virus. ProMED-mail awaits with interest further results of the
investigations that the Yap Department of Health Services plans to
carry out.

The Institut Pasteur / IRD (Institute for Research and Development)
database on viruses in Africa mentions 23 species of mosquitoes
harboring Zika virus from West Africa countries and provides several
references. Please, look at:

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Mondet for these references, citing the
isolation of Zika virus from mosquitoes in Senegal, Cote d' Ivoire,
the Central African Republic, and Burkina Faso. Most of the isolates
are from various _Aedes_ spp, _Eremapodites_ spp., and _Mansonia
uniformis_.
This site also lists several references that cover field and
experimental work (articles mainly in French). - Mod.TY]
