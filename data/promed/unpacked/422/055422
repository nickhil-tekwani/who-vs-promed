[1] 2 suspected new cases

Citizens of the Armenkol area in Sirba locality, West Darfur, fear that yellow fever may have claimed 2 more lives and are now "in a state of panic and fear" they told Radio Dabanga. 2 people suffering severe bleeding and high fever died on Thursday [24 Jan 2013] leading locals to suspect the disease could be yellow fever, sources say.

Armenkol residents confirmed to Radio Dabanga they have not been vaccinated against the disease because the Ministry of Health indicated yellow fever had not reached the area.

Witnesses urged authorities to contain the situation before the disease spreads.

Ishaq Ahmed Yaqoub, health minister of West Darfur, told Radio Dabanga on Thursday [24 Jan 2013] he is not aware of the emergence of any cases of yellow fever in Armenkol.

He affirmed that the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign will be launched in the state, namely in Sirba and Kulbus localities, as vaccines arrive from Khartoum.

Over 840 people were diagnosed with the disease as of 23 Jan 2013 and 171 have died, according to WHO. The outbreak has affected more than 35 localities in Darfur.

[Given the large geographic area of the Darfur states, limited infrastructure including roads and a dispersed population over the area, it will not be surprising if a few additional yellow fever cases appear. As vaccination coverage continues with significant coverage of the population, the risk of new cases occurring becomes much reduced.

If these 2 cases are confirmed as yellow fever virus infections, one hopes that the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign in the geographic area where the infected individuals contracted their infections will prevent occurrence of new cases. However, it does take 10-11 days following the vaccination for protective immunity to develop, so timely surveillance is critical.

[2] Phase 3 vaccination

The Darfur yellow fever outbreak has affected more than 840 people, killing 171 people in 35 localities in Darfur since the outbreak began during the last months of 2012 [the 1st cases occurred in September 2012. - Mod.TY]. Thanks to the international donor community, 2 phases of a mass vaccination campaign have been completed from late November 2012 through early January 2013, which covered some 3 million-plus people.

The 3rd phase of the yellow fever vaccination campaign is scheduled to begin 26 Jan [2013] and is expected to cover more than 2 million more people at risk, according to a World Health Organization in Sudan news release 23 Jan [2013; http://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-donors-yellowfever.html].

According to WHO, the operational requirements as well as costs of vaccines for phases 1 and 2 of the emergency vaccination campaign were supported by the European Commission Directorate General for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection (ECHO), the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), and the Government of Sweden.

The United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are supporting phase 3 of the campaign.

Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice that affects some patients. The yellow fever virus is an arbovirus of the _Flavivirus_ genus, and the mosquito is the primary vector. It carries the virus from one host to another, primarily between monkeys, from monkeys to humans, and from person to person.

Once contracted, the virus incubates in the body for 3-6 days, followed by infection that can occur in one or 2 phases. The 1st acute phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3-4 days.

The current outbreak in Darfur has seen a 20 per cent case-fatality rate.

[The cooperation of various groups of the international community has been instrumental in mounting the vaccination campaign and helping with surveillance and treatment of cases. The mobilization of this help in a relatively short period of time is commendable, and doubtless has saved many lives. Yellow fever outbreaks can get out of hand quickly if the response with an aggressive vaccination campaign is not initiated quickly. - Mod.TY]
