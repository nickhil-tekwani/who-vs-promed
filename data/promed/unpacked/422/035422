Less than 2 months after issuing a travel notice for Brazil because of the dengue fever outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today [9 Jun 2015] issued another one because of a different mosquito borne virus, Zika virus.

This follows a report last month [May 2015] of 16 confirmed, locally transmitted cases of Zika [virus infection]. Cases have been reported in the states of Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte.

Zika is an illness caused by a virus that is spread to humans through mosquito bites, specifically the _Aedes mosquito_, the same one that transmits dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever [viruses], all found in Brazil.

Symptoms of Zika may include fever, headache, red eyes, rash, muscle aches, and joint pains. The illness is usually mild, lasting 4-7 days. There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

[Zika virus continues to spread in Brazil. In addition to the cases in Bahia and Rio Grande do Norte states mentioned in the report above, 3 cases have been identified retrospectively in Alagoas state, with onset at the beginning of 2015 in Mata Grande, which is on the border with Bahia state. There is also one confirmed case in Dom Eliseu, in the northwestern part of Para state and one confirmed locally acquired case in Rio de Janeiro state.

Some South and Central American countries have heeded PAHO advice and officially are on alert for cases of Zika virus infections. However, no mention is made of whether they have the laboratory capability to diagnose Zika virus infections, which is essential to differentiate them from cases of dengue and chikungunya virus infections, which are clinically and epidemiologically similar to each other.

[On 11 Jun 2015, Brazil news media reported 34 confirmed cases of Zika virus infection up to 10 Jun 2015 in 8 states: Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, Sao Paulo, Alagoas, Para, Roraima, Rio de Janeiro and Maranhao, see:

Zammarchi L, Tappe D, Fortuna C, Remoli ME, Gunther S, Venturi G, Bartoloni A, Schmidt-Chanasit J. Zika virus infection in a traveller returning to Europe from Brazil, March 2015.

Abstract:
We report a case of laboratory-confirmed Zika virus infection imported into Europe from the Americas. The patient developed fever, rash, and oedema of hands and feet after returning to Italy from Brazil in late March 2015.

The case highlights that, together with chikungunya virus and dengue virus, 3 major arboviruses are now co-circulating in Brazil. These arboviruses represent a burden for the healthcare systems in Brazil and other countries where competent mosquito vectors are present.

The case: A male Italian traveller in his early 60s presented to the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Careggi, Florence (Italy) 4 days after his return from a 12-day holiday in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil at the end of March 2015. Results of the serological tests for the other viruses tested were negative. A follow up sample, taken 26 days after symptoms onset, showed a 3-fold increase of the anti-ZIKV-IgM and -IgG antibody titres. In addition, a low-titre DENV IgG was now observed, most likely representing a serological cross-reaction of the anti-ZIKV-IgG antibodies. ZIKV-specific real-time reverse transcription-PCR was negative from both samples. Generic flavivirus and alphavirus RT-PCR were also negative. The presence of ZIKV-specific neutralising antibodies in the 2nd serum sample was confirmed by a virus neutralisation assay. The patient was discharged, managed, and followed up in the outpatient department. The patient was recommended symptomatic treatment with paracetamol. The symptoms rapidly resolved in the following week (fever and rash lasted for only 4 days).

[This is an example of long-distance travel of a viremic individual to a country where a given virus, Zika virus in this instance, is not present. A similar situation occurred when chikungunya virus was introduced into Italy from India in 2007 and transmitted by _Aedes albopictus_.
