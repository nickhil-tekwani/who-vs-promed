Recommendations of the Pennington Group final report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The final report of the Pennington Group on the serious outbreaks of E.coli
O157:H7 food poisoning in central Scotland and Tayside was published on 7
April. It extends and elaborates on the recommendations made in its interim
report published in January. The main features are summarised as follows --
Farms and livestock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- education/awareness programme for farm workers, repeated and updated
periodically to assure their awareness of prevalence and nature of e.coli
O157; of the potential for spread of infection on farms and need for
scrupulous personal hygiene; of the need for care in use of untreated slurry
or manure; and of absolute requirement for presentation of animals in clean
condition for slaughter.
Slaughterhouses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- rigorous enforcement by Meat Hygiene Service, including additional
powers; application of HACCP in slaughter and subsequent handling of
carcasses, training of abattoir workers in good hygiene practice during
slaughter.
Meat production premises and butchers' shops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- HACCP approach and all 7 principles should be adopted by all food
businesses to ensure food safety, and the Government should take the
necessary legislative steps beyond those already existing. There should also
be new regulations for selective licensing, with requirements for
documentation of hazard analysis, labelling and record-keeping, temperature
control and monitoring; all food handlers to have undergone basic food
training, and supervisory staff and those running one-person operations to
be trained to at least intermediate level. Licensing should also cover
suitability of premises, equipment and hygiene practice, as well as physical
separation in storage, production, sale and display, between raw meat and
unwrapped cooked meat or meat products and other ready to eat foods,
including separate refrigerators, production equipment, utensils and,
wherever possible, staff. Wherever the use of separate staff cannot be
achieved, alternative standards (such as the completion and implementation
by the operator of a HACCP or the provision and use of additional facilities
eg for hand washing in the serving area) "might be regarded as sufficient to
permit the award of a licence". Where neither separate staff nor that
alternative can be achieved, the premises concerned should not be permitted
to sell both raw and unwrapped cooked meat or cooked meat products (although
they may be permitted to sell pre-wrapped cooked/ready to eat meat products
prepared elsewhere and brought in for that purpose.
Point of consumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- food hygiene training to be provided in primary and secondary school
curricula; food handling and hygiene guidance and education to be included
in all food and catering courses; local authorities to encourage adoption of
HACCP principles in non-registered premises where there is catering for
functions for groups of people involving serving of more than just tea,
coffee and confectionery goods; employers to ensure that food handlers.
particularly those working with vulnerable groups or in areas such as
nursing homes and day-care centres, are aware of and implement good hygiene
practice, and trained in food hygiene at least to basic and preferably
intermediate level.
Enforcement
~~~~~~~~~~
The Government should give a clear policy lead on the need for enforcement
of food safety measures; Government and local authorities to ensure that
there are available suitable and adequate Environmental Health Officer (EHO)
skills and resources for both enforcement and education/awareness, with
adequate funding.
Surveillance
~~~~~~~~~
A number of improvements to surveillance and to testing of specimens, but
these appear to related solely to the system in Scotland.
Research
~~~~~~~~
New proposals for research related to E.coli O157 should be dealt with
through normal processes for funding, but with appropriate weight given to
the threat that the organism represents to public health.
Handling and control of outbreaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Health Boards and local authorities to ensure that designated medical
officers (DMOs) have adequate time and opportunity to work with EHOs; and to
ensure availability of adequate numbers of personnel with appropriate skills
in public health medicine and environmental health, plus laboratory
facilities and resources required to meet their
obligations for disease control and environmental health.
Comment on the Report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is, however, one weakness; the "wherever possible" proviso in relation
to provision in butchers' shops of separate staff. The alternative that
"might be regarded as sufficient to permit the award of a licence" is
unsatisfactory. The provision of handwashing facilities would. at busy
times, tend be used perfunctorily or not at all, with consequent risk of the
very cross-contamination that the recommendations are intended to prevent.
That apart, these recommendations are excellent, and it is to be hoped that
the reported undertaking by the Scottish Secretary that they will be
implemented by the Government, will be honoured, and quickly, by the present
Government and whichever Government we have after 1 May.
