Turkish authorities are testing whether a 4-year-old girl who died
earlier on Friday had contracted avian influenza virus, doctors and
the family said. "We have sent samples taken from her to Ankara...We
cannot say anything more right now," Diyarbakir hospital doctor Eralp
Arikan Diarba told Reuters.
The girl's father said his daughter could hardly breath when she was
taken to hospital and he had not yet been told the cause of death.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been found in wild birds and
poultry across Turkey, particularly eastern Turkey. It has killed 3
children and infected a further 15 people since the start of 2006 in
the country.

Health authorities are investigating whether avian influenza may be
the cause of the death in a hospital in a southeastern Turkish city
of a 2-and-a-half-year-old girl, doctors say.
If confirmed, the child would become the 4th victim of H5N1 avian
influenza virus in Turkey, but Dr Eralp Arikan, head of the
microbiology department at Diyarbakir hospital, denied the immediate
suspicion was bird flu.
"She had a serious bacterial infection in the right lung," and not a
viral one, he told Agence France Press, adding the girl did not have
a history of contact with birds.
He says samples from the girl had in any case been sent to a
laboratory in Ankara for analysis, along with other samples from
people suspected of having contracted the disease.
The girl was brought to the hospital late on Thu 12 Jan 2006, about a
week after she fell ill and her parents tried to treat her with
antibiotics at home, but her condition continued to deteriorate, Dr
Arikan says.
She was from the town of Cinar, near Diyarbakir.

[One should be reminded here that a secondary bacteria pneumonia can
be a complication of an influenza infection and hence the caution on
the part of the health sector in Turkey. The absence of exposure to
sick birds further reduces the likelihood of avian influenza in the
above "suspected" case. It is clear that the health care sector in
Turkey is well sensitized to submit specimens for influenza testing
when there are severe respiratory illnesses, or when there is a
history of exposure to sick birds. - Mod.MPP]

I have a few comments on the avian influenza situation in Turkey:
The virus found in Turkey is mostly related to the virus strain that
caused an outbreak in migratory waterfowl at Qinghai Lake starting in
Apr 2005. All of the virus isolates sequenced from that outbreak were
shown to have the lysine mutation at position 627 in the PB2 gene,
which has been associated with increased virulence in mice, and
observed in all human influenza virus strains, including the 1918 H1N1 virus.
If the viruses circulating in Turkey have retained this mutation,
this could explain the number of human cases observed there,
especially if the H-gene has mutated in a form that allows
recognition of the human variant of the sialic acid receptor.
The change in receptor specificity would as well allow the H5N1 virus
to infect the same target cells as the seasonal human influenza
viruses, increasing the risk of getting a novel reassortant with an
enhanced pandemic potential.
It can otherwise be noted that 2 of the Turkish cases (2 children in
the Ankara region) seem to be the 1st reported human cases following
contact with wild birds.

[Dr. Jonassen's comment in the final paragraph refers to the reports
that there was transmission of infection via gloves used by the boys'
parent to handle a wild bird. This is circumstantial evidence and
without direct confirmation, should not be given too much weight at
this stage. - Mods. CP/LM/MPP]
