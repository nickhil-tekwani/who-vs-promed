Re: Botulism, bovine - Israel: (HZ) raw milk, RFI
-------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's request for information regarding the toxin typing in the described event:

Botulinum toxin producing _Clostridium botulinum_ was isolated from ruminal content of 2 affected cows, received at the Kimron Veterinary Institute from a farm in Kfar Kish with clinical manifestations suspected to be botulism.

The toxin was identified as type D by the mouse neutralization assay of the culture's supernatant.

[We are grateful to Prof Elad for the above 1st-hand information.

Bovine botulism caused by toxin serotype D is generally regarded as of extremely low or no toxicity to humans.

As indicated in the previous posting, reportedly the quantity of the milk supplied from the affected farm in Kfar Kish was about 3500 liters. About 250 000 liters of raw milk, mixed with the said consignment, were destroyed. The scientific considerations leading to the destruction are worth a discussion. - Mod.AS
