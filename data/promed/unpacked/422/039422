Number of persons infected with measles in Georgia exceeded 2600
---------------------------------------------------------
The number of people infected with measles in Georgia reached 2668 people, 835 of whom were hospitalized due to complications, according to the National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia. Georgia has recorded a significant increase in measles virus infections. An 11-month-old child and a 19-year-old male died on 7 May 2013 as [a result] of measles virus infection. Because of the threat of the epidemic, in early April [2013], the country began a free vaccination campaign against measles for people who have not been vaccinated earlier, as well as those in contact with patients. According to the center, in Georgia measles infected mainly persons from 20 to 29 years (950 cases). Measles has infected 565 people over 30 years of age, 302 teenagers aged 15 to 19 years, 176 teenagers between the ages of 10-14 years, 169 children between the ages of 5 and 9 years old and 323 children of 4 years of age and below. Also of measles was diagnosed in 183 children under one year of age.

Measles is an acute infectious viral disease that is characterized by high temperatures (up to 40.5 degrees C), inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and upper respiratory tract, conjunctivitis and characteristic maculopapular skin rash, general intoxication. Measles is spread by airborne droplets, the virus is released into the environment in large quantities from a sick person with mucus during coughing, sneezing, etc.

Measles outbreak in Bavaria -- doctors sound the alarm
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety (LGL) and the Health Office in Munich since early April [2013], nearly 60 people contracted measles. This mainly affects the government districts of Upper Bavaria and Swabia, including Augsburg, Donau-Ries, Oak Ried and Freising. More and more people, especially in the capital, have contracted this highly contagious virus infection. This week alone 16 new cases were reported in Munich -- and the number is increasing. Teenagers and young adults especially predominate among the victims. To prevent further spread of measles, Bavarian family doctors are now advising their patients to obtain vaccination against measles. The Bavarian House Medical Association (BHÃ„V) and the Professional Association of Child and Adolescent Physicians (BVKJ) are targeting those people who still have no protection against measles. For this it is essential that the large vaccination gaps that still exist particularly among adolescents and young adults should be closed quickly. These groups are therefore being specifically targetted by general practitioners and paediatricians. "This year there have been major measles clusters in Berlin -- now spreading again to affect Bavaria unfortunately. This is not acceptable. Two vaccinations against measles are required to provide adequate protection. Paediatricians and general practitioners jointly are striving to eliminate measles from Bavaria.

Although school entrance examinations show that vaccination coverage against measles in recent years has increased significantly, so far only the 5 and 6-year-old pupils from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have reached the necessary vaccination level of over 95 percent for both vaccinations against measles. Consequently a backlog still exists with respect to children in preschool and school age. "We intend that almost 95 percent of all children in Bavaria will have had at least one dose of vaccine and almost 90 percent a 2nd vaccination against measles. We should be able, therefore, by 2015 to achieve the World Health Organization (WHO's) immunization target. That's why the GPs of children and adults are now working closely together as widely as possible to close the still existing vaccination gaps.

Each infected adult can spread infection to infants not yet vaccinated. And for these small children, measles can have serious long-term consequences warns Dr. Martin Long, chairman of the National Association of Bavarian Paediatric Physicians. Especially serious is chronic measles encephalitis, which can occur after illness in the 1st year of life. "The vaccination campaign against measles is part of a joint initiative by general practitioners and paediatricians in Bavaria to strengthen the primary care of patients in the Free State. Over 9000 practicing physicians function to provide comprehensive medical care in Bavaria. For this reason it will be necessary in the future to further invest in primary care," admonish both chairman.

Measles spread further
-------------------
Two more children in Deiningen are ill with measles. The sick children were in contact with the 1st cases of measles in Deiningen last week. Because of these cases and the persons who have been in contact precautionary measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the viral disease at the middle school Deiningen, the secondary school Wemding and at the Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium.

"These are definitely measles" the medical officer Dr. Rainer Mainka said after examination of the children. Both children have not been vaccinated and because of another family member who is on a training course outside the district, the training centre is affected as well. According to Dr. Mainka one reason for the new cases is that the health department did not receive the complete information about contacts of the 1st cases of measles. "Now we constantly learn about other persons in contact which hadn't been notified to the authorities earlier."

The incubation period is 2 weeks. The health authorities now have to act accordingly; i.e., banning children from schools as with a 2 week incubation period the disease could spread on for quite some time and hoping this has not already happened. The cooperation with parents is crucial to protect public health Dr. Mainka made clear. The health department has now introduced various measures for the above 3 schools. In the 2 schools attended by the sick children vaccination documentation of all children has to be investigated as had been done last week in the day care centre in Deiningen. Dr. Mainka didn't disclose the details of the schools for privacy reasons of those affected.

Children not protected against measles by vaccination will be sent home and are banned from attending lessons. For all 3 schools the authorities issued a call to vaccinated the children against measles. "In Deiningen the sports club is affected thus virtually the whole population" Dr. Mainka states and calls upon all parents in the region of Deiningen, Wemding and Alerheim to have children not protected yet vaccinated immediately as the immunization rates are particularly low. Children not properly vaccinated should not attend family gatherings, social or sporting events.

Asked about warnings from members of the anti-vaccination movement Dr. Mainka said : "I have to respect their private opinions but my 1st priority is to protect public health and those affected by the disease from further damage"

School nurses called in to fight Shropshire measles outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
A team of school nurses has been called in to help contain the growing measles outbreak in Shropshire, it emerged today. At the start of this month Shropshire had 41 cases of measles, with more than half in the Oswestry area. Latest figures show Shropshire now has 47 -- 6 confirmed cases and 41 suspected cases. In Telford and Wrekin there have been no confirmed cases but 24 suspected cases.

The measles outbreak is a particular problem in Oswestry and health bosses said school nurses have been working with GP practices to help vaccinate children and young people who may not have had their full course of the MMR vaccine. Health chiefs say there have been localised outbreaks of measles in the past few weeks across England and Wales, including in Powys, and there have recently been confirmed cases in the Oswestry area.

They say town GP practices have offered special clinics to provide those who have not had their full vaccination course with an opportunity to "catch up". Maggie Bayley, director of nursing and quality for Shropshire Community Health Trust, said: "Our school nurses are skilled in providing vaccinations to children and young people, and are used to answering any questions or concerns.

Dr Caron Morton, accountable officer speaking on behalf of Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "We are working hard to make sure that all those patients who have not completed their MMR vaccination get the opportunity to do so. "The GP practices in Oswestry have been in contact with all relevant patients -- either by phone or letter -- and hope that they will come along to get vaccinated."

Swansea measles: Cases rise by 20 to 1094
------------------------------------
MMR vaccination is being offered in parts of south Wales Measles cases in the Swansea epidemic have risen by 20 in the last 5 days to 1094 as health chiefs warn the uptake of MMR is too low to eliminate the disease in Wales. Public Health Wales (PHW) continues to warn that the outbreak may spread. It said 95 percent uptake of MMR would prevent further outbreaks. But vaccination rates remained low in Wales, especially among those aged 10 to 18 who are hardest hit.

In total, 1257 people across Wales have now contracted the disease since last November [2012], as the latest figures were released. PHW said more than 43 000 non-routine MMR vaccines had been given since the outbreak began. It said it was still concerned about a possible future outbreak in the old Gwent area [A successor to both the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport], where 84 measles cases had been reported since November [2012]. Public Health Wales stated that In the 7 days up to last Thursday [9 May 2013], 201 children aged between 10 and 19 had received the MMR vaccine in the old Gwent county - leaving around 10 000 children still vulnerable to measles. In the whole of Wales, PHW said 823 people aged between 10 and 18 received MMR in the same period.

Meanwhile, it said only 381 people turned up at drop-in clinics in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area on Saturday [11 May 2013], fewer than a quarter of the numbers seen on previous weekends. Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for PHW, said: "I am concerned there may be a perception that because the number of new cases we are seeing each day in this outbreak is slowing, the threat of measles is going away. This is not the case. "In 2011 we had only 19 cases of measles in Wales all year and that should be compared with the 20 new cases we have seen since the end of the last week alone.

"The 84 cases in Gwent are a huge concern to us and with 10 000 children there still in need of vaccination, we are warning young people and parents not to be complacent just because they don't live in the outbreak area. "The message is simple -- measles is highly contagious and it's everywhere in Wales. If you haven't received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, you are at risk from a disease that can be highly dangerous."

Four drop-in clinics will be held at Singleton and Morriston hospitals in Swansea, the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot Hospital on Saturday [11 May 2013] between 10:00 and 16:00 BST. Aneurin Bevan Health Board is also holding a clinic between 11:00 and 15:00 BST on the same day at the outpatients department of the Royal Gwent Hospital, Newport.

[7] Wales -- rubella risk
Date: Sun 19 May 2013

Rubella warning after Swansea measles outbreak
-----------------------------
Health officials have warned that action is needed to prevent a rubella outbreak, which can be particularly dangerous to pregnant women. Public Health Wales and the national deaf-blind charity SENSE say about 38 000 young people in Wales have not had the measles mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. They welcomed the efforts to increase vaccinations in light of the measles epidemic centred on Swansea. But they said more people need to have the recommended two doses.

1st, [a woman] told Peter Johnson of BBC Radio Wales what happened to her son after she caught rubella in pregnancy, and Dr Marion Lyons, of Public Health Wales, said they were concerned for future pregnant women.

According to SENSE more people need to have the recommended 2 doses. "We can't sit around and wait for rubella outbreaks to follow measles -- now is the time to catch up and stay ahead of rubella" The measles epidemic has seen 1094 cases reported in the Swansea area, with 1257 across Wales. If rubella is contracted by a pregnant woman, it can cause babies to be born with combined sight and hearing loss along with life-threatening heart conditions and a long list of other health issues. "We must act now to protect pregnant women and their unborn babies. Women who are unsure of their vaccination history and are thinking about becoming pregnant should contact their GP for advice."

Mr McGill of SENSE added: "The large group of 38 000 unvaccinated young people in Wales, along with evidence of increasing susceptibility to rubella in younger woman and in women from ethnic minorities, means immunisation can no longer be a childhood issue. He said the single measles vaccination did not protect against rubella and a programme of single vaccines would mean more people unprotected for longer.

Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, added: "We have been warning for some weeks now of the risk of measles to those not vaccinated with 2 doses of MMR, but it should be remembered that the vaccine also protects against mumps and rubella. "At present we have not seen cases of rubella in Wales for several years, but the disease is not eradicated and there is every possibility of rubella outbreaks in the future.

LHC summons 3 MS on measles outbreak
---------------------------------
The Lahore High Court [LHC] summoned medical superintendents [MS] of Jinnah Hospital, Services Hospital and Mayo Hospital for [21 May 2013] on plea against the measles outbreak. Justice Muhammad Khalid Mehmood Khan passed the orders a plea filed by Judicial Activism Panel, a public interest litigation firm besides seeking a reply from Punjab government.

Earlier, the petitioner's counsel contended that the government had failed as measles related deaths continued. The counsel alleged that corrupt health officials were responsible for deaths and demanded action against them. The court after hearing arguments summoned the 3 said medical superintendents in person for [21 May 2013]to know about steps taken to control measles.

Measles Outbreak Hits Borough Park and Williamsburg
---------------------------------
A measles outbreak has hit one Brooklyn community and may be spreading, health officials say. There have been 21 cases of measles reported in Borough Park and one case in Williamsburg this year, according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Those infected are between 10 months and 32 years old,

The 1st case was imported from London, according to the health department. Measles is a highly contagious disease and can be deadly. Symptoms include rash, fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat. The disease can be prevented with a vaccine. The new outbreak may have spread between families who had refused vaccinations. This is the 4th time since 2008 that a measles outbreak has hit the ultra-Orthodox community in Borough Park, All of those who were infected this year have recovered, but officials say there may be more cases because of the large number of people exposed to the disease in the community.

It is the 4th time the disease has taken hold in Borough Park since 2008. Like Borough Park, London also has a large ultra-Orthodox Jewish community with families that have an anti-vaccination attitude, said Rabbi Moshe Tendler, the Rabbi Isaac and Bella Tendler professor of Jewish medical ethics and professor of biology at Yeshiva University. "It has nothing to do with religion," Tendler said. "Most likely there's a failure in their understanding of exactly what modern medicine is, largely due to the fact that so many of the families have not had a secular education. It's not only religious communities that have an aversion to vaccinations," Tendler noted. "I found it true here as well as in England: There is a heavy reliance on what's called by us here in America 'pseudo science,' or perhaps a better term is holistic medicine -- a reliance on herbals," he said.

The overall immunization rate among Orthodox Jewish groups in New York City is similar to that for other communities, health officials said. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene did not immediately provide statistics on immunization rates. But Tendler said some private schools in Orthodox neighborhoods are not as stringent about vaccine requirements as public schools. "There is a laxity concerning health regulations," Tendler said. "It's not part of the educational process. But measles is not a minor disease; in adults it is even more severe, and measles in pregnant women is particularly dangerous."

Measles outbreaks occurred in Borough Park in 2008, when there were 30 cases citywide; in 2009, there were 18 cases; and in 2011, there was a rise in measles internationally and the city saw 25 cases, according to the Department of Health. Last year, the city only had 5 measles cases, health officials said. The health department warned of additional cases because of the large number of people exposed to the illness in the community. It was working closely with medical providers in the affected communities, officials said. Outbreaks of the highly contagious illness can occur in any neighborhood with infants too young to be vaccinated or even with just a few residents who refuse to get vaccinated, according to health officials. Children should get the first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccination when they are 12 months old and the second dose at age 4 to 6. Delaying the 1st dose can increase the number of susceptible individuals and the risk of measles outbreaks. All of the people affected this year recovered without hospitalization, health officials said.

Measles cases have state health officials concerned
-------------------------------------------
23 cases of the measles have been reported in North Carolina in a recent outbreak and has state health officials concerned. "It (measles) is a highly contagious disease that is spread in the air by coughing and sneezing," said Susan Rogerson, nursing director at the Edgecombe County Health Department. Outbreaks of measles in the United States are rare because of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. No cases of the measles have been reported in Edgecombe County. The majority of the cases reported were in rural Stokes County, but cases were also reported in Orange County.

The majority of the North Carolina residents affected by the measles outbreak had not been vaccinated. In the case of the Orange County family, one person had been fully vaccinated and another had a partial vaccine, as WRAL reported on [8 May 2013]. The MMR vaccine is available at the Edgecombe County Health Department by appointment, although most school-aged children will have received the vaccination.

"Two doses are required before admission to kindergarten," said Rogerson. "Typically the 1st one's given at 12 months." The vaccine is free to those eligible for the Vaccines for Children program. For those not eligible for the program, the vaccine is USD 103 per shot. "Measles is very uncommon in North Carolina, so many people aren't aware of the symptoms," Dr. Laura Gerald, state health director, said in a statement. "Measles spreads quickly, particularly in children and adults who aren't vaccinated. We want to make the public aware of this outbreak so individuals can take steps to protect themselves and their families." Early symptoms of measles are fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and cough. A rash appears after a few days and spreads over the whole body.

Most people who have measles do not develop complications from the disease, but it can pose a serious health threat to young children and pregnant women. Measles can cause a pregnant woman to miscarry or deliver prematurely. About one of every 10 children with measles will get an ear infection and up to one in 20 will develop pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One or 2 children out of every 1000 will die. Infants under the age of 12 months are more susceptible to catch measles because they will not have had the vaccination. To schedule an appointment to get the MMR vaccine, call the health department at 641-7511.
