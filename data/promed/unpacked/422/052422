In 2015, symptoms of leaf rust were observed in several blueberry (_Vaccinium corymbosum_) fields in 4 localities (Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Dujiangyan, Yaan) in Sichuan province. Blueberry leaf rust symptoms were 1st observed in April, causing extensive defoliation in the following months.

Random field surveys were performed in early October [2015] to determine the incidence of the disease in Wenjiang by assessing 20 leaves from 100 plants of each cultivar. The disease incidence was estimated to be 87.2, 5.1, 3.5, and 0.0 percent on cvs Sharpblue, Misty, Bluegold, and O'Neill, respectively. Laboratory analysis (morphology, PCR and sequencing, pathogenicity test) confirmed the presence of _Thekopsora minima_ (EPPO Alert List) in symptomatic leaf samples.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_ and also another rust species (_Naohidemyces vaccinii_), depending on the region. The disease affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including blueberry, bilberry, cranberry (_Vaccinium_ spp) and ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides which release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Southern highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.
