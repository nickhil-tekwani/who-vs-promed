Citation: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Assessing SARS-CoV-2 circulation, variants of concern, non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccine rollout in the EU/EEA, 15th update -- 10 Jun 2021. ECDC: Stockholm; 2021.

Although SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains widespread in large parts of the EU/EEA, most countries report declining trends in 14-day COVID-19 notification rates, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) occupancy, and mortality. Many countries have initiated partial lifting of different non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that aim to reduce the degree of citizens physical contact and mobility. Since January 2021, EU/EEA countries have reported an increase in the number and proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases of variants of concern (VOC) associated with increasing transmissibility and/or severity, with Alpha (B.1.1.7) the current dominant variant across the EU/EEA. Estimates across the region show that a large proportion of the population across Europe still remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that population immunity is far from being reached. As of 3 Jun 2021, the median cumulative vaccine uptake in the EU/EEA adult population (aged 18 years and older) had reached 46.2% for at least one vaccine dose and 22.3% for the full vaccination course. The highest level of vaccine uptake was observed among the elderly aged over 80, in which the uptake reached 80.5% for at least one dose and 66.3% for full vaccination coverage. For healthcare workers, the median level of at least one dose uptake was 87% and the median uptake for the full vaccination course was 65.2%. Increased vaccine supply has allowed countries to expand eligibility for vaccination to younger age groups.

Executive summary
Risk assessed in this update: The assessment of the risk posed by the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is stratified by 4 population groups (the vaccinated and unvaccinated general population and the vaccinated and unvaccinated vulnerable population). The assessment is based on the following elements: (i) the vaccinated group has a lower probability of infection and (ii) a lower impact of such infection than the unvaccinated, while (iii) the vulnerable population suffers a higher impact of such infection when compared with the general population. Specific separate assessments were not performed for partially vaccinated and previously infected individuals in this risk assessment, although it is known that some protection is conferred to such persons. Due to differences in the epidemiological situation, vaccination strategies and NPIs implemented, EU/EEA countries are experiencing different levels of risk posed by SARS-CoV-2 to the general population and to vulnerable groups and, thus, require different targeted interventions. ECDC classifies the epidemiological situation in EU/EEA countries into 4 categories based on the level of concern (low, moderate, high, very high). In most countries, the contribution of the intensity indicators to the overall score has been higher than that of the severity indicators in recent weeks. As such, the overall classification...provides a conservative estimate of transmission intensity.

As Africa's cases continue to climb amid dried-up vaccine stocks, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office today [10 Jun 2021] praised the United States and France for their recent dose donations and lauded the Mastercard Foundation's recent announcement of USD 1.3 billion to support efforts to battle the virus.

In other developments, European officials today [10 Jun 2021] weighed in with updated COVID threat assessments, noting that the region isn't out of the woods yet with the pandemic. At a briefing today, Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, said cases in the region have seen a sustained increase over the past 3 weeks, with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Zambia experiencing a resurgence, and a new surge underway in South Africa.

She said only 2% of people in the region have had one vaccine dose, compared some wealthier nations that have already passed the 60% mark. In welcoming the new tangible support from countries and other groups for vaccination, Moeti said, "These are the kinds of partnerships needed to bring an end to the pandemic." Overall, Africa needs 225 million doses to meet the global push to vaccinate 10% of every country's population by September [2021], she added.

Global health officials are hoping more vaccine donations and support announcements come from a meeting of G7 leaders that starts in the United Kingdom tomorrow [11 Jun 2021]. Ahead of the meeting, the leaders of the United States and UK today agreed on a new partnership for addressing pandemic threats, which will bolster surveillance and genetic sequencing, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/britain-us-agree-partnership-tackle-new-pandemics-2021-06-10).

At a separate briefing today [10 Jun 2021], the head of the WHO's European regional office said the situation this summer is still fragile, with vaccination levels still below their targets and more transmissible variants spreading. Hans Henri Kluge, MD, MPH, noted that cases in the region rose last autumn [2020] after countries relaxed measures over the summer. Currently, 36 of the region's 53 countries are easing restrictions due to declining cases. Kluge urged people to rethink travel and to keep their guard up by avoiding the 3 Cs: settings that are closed, confined, or crowded.

In related developments, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control today [10 Jun 2021] issued its 15th COVID risk assessment update, which notes that the overall risk is lower, but countries are still at risk, with only 30% of the population having received one vaccine dose -- not enough to protect against another wave. Only 15% of people in the region have been fully vaccinated [see ECDC report above].

More global headlines: India's Bihar state raised its overall death total by 75% after a 3-week verification effort, bolstering suspicions that the country's official death count is well below the real total, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/06/10/coronavirus-covid-live-updates-us).

Canada has signaled that it will begin easing border restrictions in July [2021] by allowing vaccinated citizens to enter the country, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-reopen-border-phases-starting-with-vaccinated-citizens-source-2021-06-09/).

The global total is at 174 567 430 cases, with 3 764 439 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

Immunoglobulin may benefit those with COVID vaccine-related blood clots
High doses of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in conjunction with an anticoagulant were associated with resolved vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) in 3 patients, according to a report yesterday [9 Jun 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107051). VITT occurs when antibodies attack protein factor 4 (PF4), leading to blood clumping and clots.

The patients, one woman and 2 men, were 63-72 years old and received the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine in Canada from 31 Mar-13 Apr 2021. (At that time, Canada restricted AstraZeneca use to those older than 55 because VITT is mostly observed in younger populations.)

Two patients with no comorbidities were diagnosed as having leg clots and initially had leg pain. The 3rd, who had arterial and venous brain clots, had headaches and confusion as well as a history of non-insulin-dependent diabetes, high blood pressure, obstructive sleep apnea, pre-stage prostate cancer, and heparin exposure 9 months prior followed by daily aspirin use.

One patient with leg clots was discharged with an oral anticoagulant when IVIG treatment was associated with platelet counts of 114 000 per cubic millimeter (mm3) during a 2-day period. The other's platelets increased to 640 000 per mm3 7 days after IVIG treatment began, but he still faced foot amputation because of lingering clots.

The patient with the cerebral clots needed 4 IVIG doses because the 3rd dose's effects appeared to wane. With therapeutic plasma exchange, he achieved normal platelet levels of 158 000 per mm3 by day 62 post-vaccination. No new or progressive blood clots were associated with IVIG use.

To help measure VITT, the researchers used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test with a reaction well for PF4 without heparin. They say its results support its use before administration of IVIG and that ELISA reactivity was not inhibited by the treatment.

While the researchers know using high-dose IVIG for clotting is unusual, they point to the association between IVIG's serum-induced platelet-activating properties and increased platelet counts.

"Increasing the platelet count is especially important when patients have severe thrombocytopenia and multiple unusual thromboses that require therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, especially in the context of hemorrhagic transformation after cerebral infarction," write the researchers. "Since patients with VITT can have severe thrombocytopenia that potentially lasts for several weeks, early administration of IVIG may be an important adjunct therapy to anticoagulation for the management of VITT."

Improved heart health may result in better COVID-19 outcomes
A consolidation of 32 literature reviews on COVID-19 and heart health or comorbidities found that high blood pressure, smoking, obesity, heart disease, and diabetes were associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes, according to the European Heart Journal -- Quality of Care & Clinical Outcomes yesterday [9 Jun 2021] (https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjqcco/qcab029 and https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/improving-heart-health-may-reduce-the-severity-of-covid-19-disease).

The reviews were published from 2 Mar-11 Aug 2020, and all were either considered of moderate quality (31) or high quality (1) according to the AMSTAR 2 appraisal tool.

Comorbidities associated with both mortality and severe infection in COVID-19 patients were renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 3.07), cerebrovascular disease (risk ratio [RR], 2.75), cardiovascular disease (OR, 2.65), high blood pressure (OR, 2.50), diabetes (OR, 2.09), and smoking history (relative risk [RR], 1.26). Liver disease had higher odds of mortality but not severe infection, as did obesity (ORs, 2.81 and 2.18, respectively). Current smoking had the opposite effect, with greater risk of severity but not mortality (RR, 1.80).

All listed odds and risk ratios are for mortality, but the study includes severity ratios as well. The compiled data also showed that those hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced venous thromboembolism (25%), pulmonary embolism (19%), arrhythmias (19%), myocardial injury (10%), angina (10%), deep vein thrombosis (7%), myocardial infarction (4%), and acute heart failure (2%).

Not all reviews looked at all factors. Subject matter data ranged from one review for alcohol (consisting of one study and 30 patients) and one for multiple cardiovascular risk factors (consisting of 21 studies and more than 77 000 people) to 18 on diabetes and COVID-19 outcomes, with the largest diabetes review covering 63 studies.

"Our study indicates that COVID-19 patients with heart disease or its risk factors are at greater risk of hospitalisation, ventilation or death due to COVID-19 and might need more intense treatment and monitoring," study author Stephanie Harrison, PhD, of the University of Liverpool, said in a European Society of Cardiology (ESC) press release.

"Promoting heart health may be another way to improve outcomes for COVID-19 patients. More research is needed on the long-term impact of COVID-19 on the heart."

[Explanations how cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases the risk of severe COVID-19:

"We now have 2 explanations. The 1st is that pre-existing heart conditions, such as damaged heart muscle or blocked heart arteries, weaken the body's ability to survive the stress of the illness. A person with a vulnerable heart is more likely to succumb to the effects of fever, low oxygen levels, unstable blood pressures, and blood clotting disorders -- all possible consequences of COVID-19 -- than someone previously healthy.

"A 2nd explanation relates to poor underlying metabolic health, which is more common in those with heart disease. Poor metabolic health refers to diseases such as type 2 diabetes or prediabetes and obesity, which themselves cause inflammation and risk of blood clots, compounding the effects of COVID-19 and increasing the likelihood of devastating complications of COVID-19.

"How does COVID-19 cause heart damage? The SARS-CoV-2 virus can damage the heart in several ways. For example, the virus may directly invade or inflame the heart muscle, and it may indirectly harm the heart by disrupting the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Heart injury, which may be measured by elevated levels of the enzyme troponin in the bloodstream, has been detected in about one-quarter of patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 illness. Of these patients, about one-third have pre-existing CVD.

"Inflammation of the heart muscle: The majority of people with COVID-19 will have mild symptoms and recover fully. However, about 20% will develop pneumonia, and about 5% will develop severe disease. In the severe form of COVID-19, the body's immune system overreacts to the infection, releasing inflammatory molecules called cytokines into the bloodstream. This so-called 'cytokine storm' can damage multiple organs, including the heart.

"Inflammation of the heart muscle, called myocarditis, typically occurs only in patients with advanced COVID-19 disease. Myocarditis can result from direct heart invasion by the virus itself, or more commonly by inflammation caused by cytokine storm. When this occurs, the heart may become enlarged and weakened, leading to low blood pressure and fluid in the lungs. While this severe form of myocarditis is rare, recent studies have suggested that a milder form of heart muscle inflammation may be much more common than previously recognized. A recent study showed that asymptomatic heart inflammation was seen on magnetic resonance imaging in up to three-quarters of patients who had recovered from severe COVID-19.

"Increased oxygen demand and decreased oxygen supply lead to heart damage: Fever and infection cause the heart rate to speed up, increasing the work of the heart in COVID-19 patients who develop pneumonia. Blood pressure may drop or spike, causing further stress on the heart, and the resulting increase in oxygen demand can lead to heart damage, especially if the heart arteries or muscle were unhealthy to begin with.

"Heart damage is most often caused by heart attacks, which result from the formation of a blood clot in a vulnerable heart artery, blocking delivery of oxygen to the heart muscle. COVID-19-related inflammation raises the risk of this type of heart attack by activating the body's clotting system and disrupting the blood vessel lining. When inflamed, this lining loses its ability to resist clot formation. These blood clots in the large and small arteries of the heart cut off its supply of oxygen. The increased clotting tendency can also lead to blood clots in the lungs, which can cause a drop in blood oxygen levels. Severe pneumonia drops blood oxygen further. When the oxygen demand exceeds the supply, the heart muscle is damaged.

"Finding a silver lining and lowering risk through healthy lifestyle: People with CVD who adopt healthy behaviors can strengthen their defenses against COVID-19 while also reducing the long-term risk from cardiovascular disease itself. This means plenty of physical activity and following a healthy diet like the Mediterranean diet. Cook at home when you can, and walk outdoors with friends if your gym is temporarily closed. Purchase an inexpensive and easy-to-use monitor to measure your blood pressure at home. And continue to follow the CDC's safety guidelines to wear masks, physically distance, and avoid large gatherings" (excerpted from https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/covid-19-and-the-heart-what-have-we-learned-2021010621603).]

[4] Delta variant: gangrene, hearing loss
Date: Tue 8 Jun 2021 08:26 EDT
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-07/gangrene-hearing-loss-point-to-delta-variant-being-more-severe


The coronavirus variant driving India's devastating COVID-19 2nd wave is the most infectious to emerge so far. Doctors now want to know if it's also more severe.

Hearing impairment, severe gastric upsets and blood clots leading to gangrene, symptoms not typically seen in COVID patients, have been linked by doctors in India to the so-called delta variant. In England and Scotland, early evidence suggests the strain -- which is also now dominant there -- carries a higher risk of hospitalization.

Delta, also known as B.1.617.2, has spread to more than 60 countries over the past 6 months and triggered travel curbs from Australia to the USA. A spike in infections, fueled by the variant, has forced the UK to reconsider its plans for reopening later this month [June 2021], with a local report saying it may be pushed back by 2 weeks. Singapore found that the mutation accounted for 95% of the local COVID samples linked to variants of concern. Higher rates of transmission and a reduction in the effectiveness of vaccines have made understanding the strain's effects especially critical.

"We need more scientific research to analyze if these newer clinical presentations are linked to B.1.617 or not," said Abdul Ghafur, an infectious disease physician at the Apollo Hospital in Chennai, southern India's largest city. Ghafur said he is seeing more COVID patients with diarrhea now than in the initial wave of the pandemic.

"Last year [2020], we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed," Ghafur said. "This virus has become so, so unpredictable."

Stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hearing loss and joint pain are among the ailments COVID patients are experiencing, according to 6 doctors treating patients across India. The beta and gamma variants -- first detected in South Africa and Brazil, respectively -- have shown little or no evidence of triggering unusual clinical signs, according to a study by researchers from the University of New South Wales last month [May 2021] (https://jglobalbiosecurity.com/article/10.31646/gbio.112/).

Some patients develop micro thrombi, or small blood clots, so severe that they led affected tissue to die and develop gangrene, said Ganesh Manudhane, a Mumbai cardiologist, who has treated 8 patients for thrombotic complications at the Seven Hills Hospital during the past 2 months. Two required amputations of fingers or a foot. "I saw 3-4 cases the whole of last year [2020], and now it's one patient a week," Manudhane said.

India has reported 18.6 million COVID cases thus far in 2021, compared with 10.3 million last year [2020]. The delta variant was the "primary cause" behind the country's deadlier 2nd wave and is 50% more contagious than the alpha strain that was first spotted in the UK, according to a recent study by an Indian government panel (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delta-variant-primary-cause-behind-indias-second-covid-wave-expert-panel/articleshow/83227102.cms).

The surge in cases may have driven an increase in the frequency with which rare COVID complications are being observed. Even still, Manudhane said he is baffled by the blood clots he's seeing in patients across age groups with no past history of coagulation-related problems.

"We suspect it could be because of the new virus variant," he said. Manudhane is collecting data to study why some people develop the clots and others don't.

Doctors are also finding instances of clots forming in blood vessels that supply the intestines, causing patients to experience stomach pain -- their only symptom -- local media have reported.

Some COVID patients are also seeking medical care for hearing loss, swelling around the neck and severe tonsillitis, said Hetal Marfatia, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital. "Every person is showing different symptoms" in the 2nd wave, she said.

The unusual presentations for delta and a closely related variant known as kappa, whose spread led to a 4th lockdown in the Australian city of Melbourne, are still being confirmed, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. "In the meanwhile, it is important to take note of this and be aware of possible atypical presentations," she said.

The most alarming aspect of the current outbreak in India is the rapidity with which the virus is spreading, including to children, said Chetan Mundada, a pediatrician with the Yashoda group of hospitals in Hyderabad.

Apollo's Ghafur said he was also seeing entire families with COVID symptoms, unlike last year [2020] when individuals dominated, reflecting an increase in household transmission caused by the delta variant.

Cases of mucormycosis -- a rare opportunistic fungal infection -- have also been surging in India. It had infected more than 8800 COVID patients and survivors as of 22 May 2021, forcing local healthcare authorities to call it an epidemic.

Even as India's outbreak begins to ease -- daily infections have slipped to less than a quarter of the 7 May 2021 peak -- the delta variant is sparking outbreaks elsewhere, including hitherto virus havens such as Taiwan, Singapore and Viet Nam, bolstering calls for mass immunization.

German politician and scientist Karl Lauterbach said Tuesday [8 Jun 2021] the variant will probably become more prevalent in Germany too in the coming months. "To avoid it completely seems unrealistic to me," he said on Twitter in German. "The decisive factor is a very high vaccination rate, which reduces mortality."

But with emerging evidence delta and at least one other variant may be adept at evading vaccine-induced antibodies, pharmaceutical companies are under pressure to tweak existing shots or develop new ones. "New vaccines have to [be] prepared with new variants in mind," said Ghafur. "We can't get ahead of the virus, but at least we can least keep up with it."

Many hospitals in the districts along the border are at full capacity as they are grappling with an increasing number of COVID-19 patients.

There is hardly any bed for new COVID-19 patients in at least 5 hospitals in Satkhira, Khulna, Natore, Rajshahi, and Panchagarh. These hospitals have been turning away patients for the past few days.

Besides, the number of daily new cases has increased across the country. For the 24 hours preceding 8:00 am yesterday [10 Jun 2021], the Directorate General of Health Services [DGHS] reported 2576 new cases, the highest daily cases since 28 Apr 2021. The DGHS said 40 people died in the same period, which was 36 the previous day.

The positivity rate has also gone up. It was 13.25 yesterday [10 Jun 2021] from 12.33 the day before.

With the new cases, the total number of active COVID-19 cases rose to around 50 000. Of them, 3200 were being treated at hospitals, according to a press release from the DGHS.

The official death toll in the country has reached 12 989 and the death rate stood at 1.58%. Of those who were reported dead yesterday [10 Jun 2021], the highest -- 12 -- were in Chattogram division, followed by 8 each in Dhaka and Rajshahi, and 6 in Khulna, 4 in Rangpur, and 2 in Sylhet.

With no beds available, the authorities of Khulna Medical College Hospital (KMCH) stopped admitting patients in its 100-bed COVID-19 unit, reported our correspondent in the city. As of yesterday afternoon [10 Jun 2021], 126 patients were admitted there.

"We're at capacity. There is no empty bed and that's why we stopped taking in new patients," said Resident Medical Officer Suhash Ranjan Halder of the COVID-19 unit at KMCH. "Doctors and nurses are always struggling to handle the rush of critical patients. If we admit any more patients, we won't be able to properly treat the critical ones," he said.

Our correspondent from Natore reported that the district hospital was in a similar situation. Besides, the hospital does not have a central oxygen supply system to provide high flow oxygen to patients, who have been gasping for oxygen. Yesterday afternoon [10 Jun 2021], there were 43 COVID-19 patients against 30 beds in this hospital, which was struggling with an inadequate number of physicians and technicians, said Assistant Director Paritosh Kumar.

Our correspondent from Chapainawabganj reported that the 250-bed district hospital had 55 COVID-19 patients admitted yesterday afternoon [10 Jun 2021] against its capacity to treat 50. As the number of patients was increasing, the hospital authorities were thinking about raising the bed number to 70, said Dr Ahnaf Shahriar, focal person of the COVID-19 unit of the hospital.

Our Thakurgaon correspondent reported the district hospital, with a 50-bed COVID-19 unit, cannot provide ventilator support to critical patients. "We have a limited capacity to treat patients. So we are advising patients to follow our treatment protocols at home," Dr Rokibul Alam, resident medical officer at the hospital, told the Daily Star yesterday [10 Jun 2021].

Meanwhile, the administrations of Khulna, Chapainawabganj, Satkhira, Bagerhat, and Noakhali districts continued enforcing strict restrictions on movement to curb the virus transmission.

India on Friday [11 Jun 2021] reported 91 702 daily new COVID-19 cases, pushing the country's total tally to 29 274 823, according to the data updated by the Union health ministry. This is the 4th day in a row when the daily new cases are below one lakh [100 000].

With 3403 more deaths in the last 24 hours, the death toll has climbed to 363 079. On Thursday [10 Jun 2021], India registered a record daily rise of 6148 deaths from COVID-19. The death tally was the highest-ever because it included Bihar's previously uncounted 3951 deaths. If we discount Bihar's revised toll, a total of 2197 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.

On Thursday [10 Jun 2021], India registered deaths of 6148 people attributed to COVID-19, the highest single-day count ever from the country. This count was because of adding the previously uncounted deaths of 3951 people from Bihar state. It is unsure whether any such backlog deaths remain to be counted from any other states to amend the official COVID-19 deaths so far.

Meanwhile, the active caseload has further declined to 1 121 671. The recovery rate has increased to 94.93%. A total of 134 580 patients were discharged yesterday [10 Jun 2021], taking the total recovery numbers to 27 790 073.

While the weekly positivity rate is currently at 5.14%, the daily positivity rate stands at 4.49%, less than 10% for 18 consecutive days, show data. According to ICMR [Indian Council of Medical Research], 37.42 crore [374 200 000] samples have been tested for COVID-19 so far. Of this, 2 044 131 samples were tested yesterday [10 Jun 2021].

Pakistan confirmed 1303 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday [9 Jun 2021] with a 3.12% positivity rate, the National Command and Operation Centre [NCOC] said on Thursday [10 Jun 2021].

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 11 Jun 2021 at 06:17 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 29 274 823 / 363 097 / 261
Pakistan: 938 737 / 21 576 / 96
Bangladesh: 820 395 / 12 989 / 78
Nepal: 601 687 / 8238 / 278
Sri Lanka: 216 134 / 2011 / 94
Afghanistan: 87 716 / 3412 / 86
Maldives: 69 536 / 191 / 348
Bhutan: 1769 / 1 / 1

Over the last 7 days, 700 473, 14 415, 10149, 24 751, and 3020 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and the Maldives, respectively, compared with 1 026 645, 10 995, 17 286, 34 680, and 5573 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a sharp decreasing trend in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and the Maldives, but a steady upward trend in Bangladesh. In Sri Lanka, a stable trend was seen over the last 7 days after growing new cases sustainably in the previous 4 weeks or so. The total deaths in Sri Lanka attributed to the disease have just passed the landmark of 2000.

The daily case-positivity in several border districts in Bangladesh is currently very high, and recent sequence data of the virus from 50 samples collected in the country revealed the predominance of delta variant (previously called B.1.617.2), a variant of concern (see archive no. 20210605.8424801), which is more transmissible than the alpha variant. Only time will say whether the steady and sustainable growth in new cases, as being observed over the last 2 weeks, would turn into a significant 3rd wave of the disease in the country.

On Thursday 10 Jun 2021, India registered 6148 deaths attributed to COVID-19, the highest single-day count from the country. This surprisingly high count was the result of adding the previously uncounted 3951 deaths from Bihar state. It is not clear whether other backlogs of deaths from other states remain to be counted, amending the official number of COVID-19 deaths reported so far.
