According to Canadian Health officials, as of 24 Jul 2020, there have been 59 confirmed cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport illness linked to this outbreak in the following provinces: British Columbia (23), Alberta (31), Manitoba (3), Ontario (1), and Prince Edward Island (1). Individuals became sick between mid-June 2020 and mid-July 2020. Information is available for 28 illnesses. Out of 28 people, 6 individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 11 and 77 years of age. The majority of cases (54%) are female.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) is also investigating an outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport illnesses that have a similar genetic fingerprint to illnesses reported in this outbreak. In the USA, a total of 212 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Newport have been reported from 23 states. 31 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.

Investigators in Canada and the USA are collaborating to exchange information to identify the source of the outbreak.

Symptoms of a _Salmonella_ infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after exposure to _Salmonella_ bacteria from an infected animal, person or contaminated product. Symptoms include:

chills
fever
diarrhea
abdominal cramps
headache
nausea
vomiting.

These symptoms usually last for 4 to 7 days. In healthy people, salmonellosis often clears up without treatment, but sometimes anti-bacterials may be required. In some cases, severe illness may occur, and hospitalization may be required.
