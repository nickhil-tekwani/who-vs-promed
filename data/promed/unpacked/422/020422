Argentina: rural anthrax situation, 2010
----------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The 1st report of rural carbuncle [anthrax] in Argentina was made in
2003. Likewise, this 2010 version is aimed at reflecting the reality
of this zoonosis. The epidemiological follow-up is made over related
scenarios and concomitant activities with the subject:

1. Assessment area of rural anthrax in the province of Buenos Aires:
This assessment area covers more than 32 per cent of the cattle
raising area of the province. Since 1977, 3563 bovine bones from
suddenly dead animals have been assessed and 423 isolations of
_Bacillus anthracis_ have been made, demonstrating an anthrax
distribution in percentage terms of 12 per cent during this period.
During 2010 this figure decreased to 6 per cent (7+/117) of samples
analysed. The districts involved in which positive samples were found
were: Azul, Dorrego, Olavarria, Juarez, and Ayacucho.

2. Alert and response zone before natural occurrence, accidental, or
deliberate use of _B. anthracis_ epidemics: 2 outbreaks of bovine
anthrax and one alert human skin infection took place in this area.
Overall there have been 65 outbreaks registered in the zone since
1989. Several actions have been taken: bovine voluntary vaccination,
training of public health professionals, education in rural schools.

3. Isolation of _B. anthracis_ in other veterinary diagnostic
laboratories: 113 samples were processed; 18 were positive (16 per
cent) with an increase of 8 per cent in respect to the previous year
[2009] (18+/113 in 2010 vs 11+/128) in 2009). These laboratories are:
a. Bahia Blanca Laboratory, province of Buenos Aires: 25 bovine
samples submitted, 3 positive from Puan, Torquinst, and Pringles.
b. Ministry of Agriculture, province of Buenos Aires, Rauch: 26
samples, 11 positive from Rauch, Azul, Tandil, Las Flores, and
Ayacucho.
c. INTA [National Institute for Agricultural Technology] - Balcarce,
province of Buenos Aires: 17 bovine samples, 1 positive from Mar
Chiquita.
d. Santa Rosa Laboratory, province of La Pampa: 45 bovine samples, 3
positive from Atreuco and Conhelo.

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires affected by bovine
anthrax outbreaks: 12 districts have suffered anthrax outbreaks: Azul,
Dorrego, Olavarria, Juarez, Ayacucho, Tandil, Las Flores, Rauch, Puan,
Torquinst, Pringles, and Mar Chiquita. Historically 53 districts have
been registered since 1977, which have suffered at least one outbreak
of this disease.

5. National production of anti-anthrax vaccine for veterinary use:
the official body SENASA [National Food Safety and Quality Service]
reported the approval of 40 series accounting for 14 302 000 doses
manufactured by 11 production laboratories.

6. Human anthrax at the national level: 2 cases of cutaneous anthrax
were reported from Maipu (Province of Buenos Aires) and the Autonomous
City of Buenos Aires. [The origins of these 2 infections is not given
but usually they are of patients moved from where they live to these
larger urban hospitals. - Mod.MHJ]

[Our thanks to Ramon for this annual report. Livestock vaccination is
not compulsory though there is an active surveillance and awareness
programme. While the overall numbers are not going down the present
incidence is a fraction of what it was during 1977 through 2006.
