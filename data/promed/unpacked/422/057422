The recent food poisoning incident at the Indian Institute of
Technology (IIT), Bombay, is being linked to _Klebsiella_.

The caterers who were serving in the IIT [Indian Institute of
Technology] canteen, were completely clueless about which food content
could have possibly triggered food poisoning and so were the FDA (Food
and Drug Administration, Maharashtra) officials. It was learned that 4
samples of the stools and water were taken, out of which 3 indicated
_Klebsiella_ and the last one _E. coli_. However, the same could not
be confirmed, as the FDA was still investigating its origin, informed
Mahesh Zagade, food safety commissioner, FDA, Maharashtra.

A source informed Food and Beverage News that _Klebsiella_ was linked
to pneumonia and known to reside in the colon. "Something in the food
must have triggered its multiplicity. The samples needed to be
cultured for validation of the claim," the source said.

"The predominant [gastrointestinal] symptoms of _Klebsiella_ are
watery diarrhea and cramps. However, vomiting does not occur.
Organisms other than commonly identified pathogens should not be
ignored if present in high concentrations in both food and feces of
infected persons," states Dr Sardesai, technical director, Equinox
Labs.

Meanwhile the IIT said that the caterers who were given the contract
of the canteen were associated with the institute for the last 4 years
and that this was the 1st incident of its kind. "We are equally
concerned and have given strict instructions to the cooks to wear
caps, wash their hands thoroughly, and follow precautions," said a
source.

[There is not enough information in this posting to assess the
significance of the _Klebsiella_ isolate but isolation of coliforms
certainly points to some sort of fecal contamination of the water.

_Klebsiella_ species are thought of as etiological agents of pneumonia
(hence the species named _K. pneumoniae_) or urinary tract infections
and have been newsworthy lately because of strains that are multiply
resistant. Diarrhea related to this genus, however, is not unheard
of.

Although the most commonly thought of cause of
antimicrobial-associated diarrhea is _Clostridium difficile_, some
cases of hemorrhagic colitis following antimicrobial use have been
linked to _Klebsiella_, particularly _K. oxytoca_. Although reported
previously, an Austrian study by Hogenauer, et al (1) reported 22 _C.
difficile_ negative adults with antimicrobial-associated colitis, 5 of
whom grew _K. oxytoca_ from the diarrhea without other pathogens found
and were found to produce a cytotoxin. Endoscopy revealed mucosal
edema and hemorrhage and not pseudomembranes. The hemorrhagic colitis
could be reproduced in a rat model following antimicrobial
administration. The same group furthermore was unable to find this
organism in non-hemorrhagic colitis cases after antimicrobials (2) but
also described the entity in an adolescent (3).

A similar illness associated with _K. pneumoniae_ was noted in a woman
returning from Egypt to France (4). This isolate adhered to HeLa cells
(similar to enteroaggregative _E. coli_) and produced changes in the
actin cytoskeletal proteins in the affected cells (similar to
enteropathogenic _E. coli_) but genes similar to the _E. coli_
pathotype virulence factors were not found.
