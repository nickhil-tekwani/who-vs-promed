Influenza update 129 (11 Mar 2011)
----------------------------------
Summary
-------
Overall, the influenza season of the northern hemisphere appears to
be peaking or in decline in most areas, though with continuing active
circulation particularly in North America and Eastern Europe.
Influenza A(H3N2) comprises the largest proportion of influenza
detections in North America. Although influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been
the most commonly detected virus in Europe and northern Asia influenza
type B has been increasing in Europe and is now the more common virus
seen in many countries. The large majority of the viruses
characterized are closely related to the vaccine strains included in
the current seasonal vaccines. A small number of influenza type B of
the Yamagata lineage are reported in North America and Europe, making
up about 5 to 7 percent of B viruses detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
Influenza activity has remained elevated in much of North America
though many indicators are beginning to show a leveling off or
decrease in activity.
In Canada, increases of influenza activity have been seen in Quebec
and British Columbia but is declining in many other regions of the
country. The influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate increased
to 36.5 consultations per 1000 patients from 29.3 the previous week
but has been relatively stable overall and is within the expected
range for this time of year. The proportion of clinical specimens
testing positive for influenza (18 percent in week 8 [21-27 Feb 2011])
has continued to decline in recent weeks since peaking in week 52 of
2010 [27 Dec 2010-2 Jan 2011]. Influenza A(H3N2) remains the most
commonly detected virus in Canada accounting for 86 percent of
influenza A viruses for which subtyping was performed. Although
influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been increasingly detected in recent weeks,
during week 8 H1N1(2009) decreased to 7 percent of subtyped viruses.
Influenza B detections accounted for the remaining 12 percent of
viruses subtyped.
In the United States of America, during week 8 [21-27 Feb 2011], ILI
activity remained above baseline nationally but has decreased from
previous weeks. Deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza reported
through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System remain at the
epidemic threshold for the 5th consecutive week. The proportion of
specimens testing positive for influenza viruses (28 percent in week
8) have declined for the 2nd consecutive week. Of the viruses for
which subtype information is available, 49 percent were influenza
A(H3N2), 34 percent were influenza B, and 17 percent were influenza
A(H1N1)2009.
In both Canada and the United States, more than 99 percent of H3N2
and H1N1(2009) viruses characterized are antigenically similar to the
strain contained in the current trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine.
Of the influenza B viruses characterized, more than 90 percent are of
the Victoria lineage contained in the current vaccine, with another
5-7 percent from the Yamagata lineage.
Influenza activity in Mexico peaked in mid-December 2010 and activity
there is currently very low associated primarily with influenza type
B.

Europe
Influenza activity is decreasing in the majority of the European
countries, more notably in the west. A majority of countries in Europe
are reporting decreasing rates of consultation for ILI and acute
respiratory infections (ARI).
In Western Europe the number of influenza infections with severe
outcome also has declined but remained high in Greece. Sentinel
surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) indicates
declining trends in south eastern part of the European Region
(Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and the Republic of Moldova) while increasing
numbers of SARI hospitalizations are reported in Romania, the Russian
Federation, and Ukraine. The overall percentage of sentinel specimens
testing positive for influenza in the whole of Europe, 36 percent of
525 specimens collected, is also declining in comparison with previous
weeks.
Influenza type B now makes up more than half of all influenza viruses
detected (51 percent). Of the influenza A viruses subtyped: 95 percent
were influenza A(H1N1)2009 and 5 percent were influenza A(H3N2). For
severe cases, some differences are noted between the countries of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and the rest of the Europe Region. Data
from 11 countries of the EEA indicate that H1N1 (2009) is much more
commonly detected in severe cases than in outpatients.
For 8 countries from Central Asia and Eastern Europe, however, the
proportions of viruses detected in 206 sentinel SARI specimens were
similar to those from ILI cases with 48 percent testing positive for
influenza, 54 percent of which were influenza A and 46 percent
influenza B. 92 percent of influenza A viruses tested from SARI cases
were H1N1 (2009) and 8 percent influenza A(H3N2).
Similar to North America, nearly all influenza A viruses
characterized this season in Europe have been antigenically similar to
the H1N1 and H3N2 strains included in the current trivalent seasonal
influenza vaccine. Approximately 93 percent of influenza type B
viruses characterized are also of the same lineage as those in the
current vaccine (Victoria) with the remainder being of the Yamagata
lineage.

North Africa and the Middle East
Influenza activity in North Africa and the Middle East remains low in
the countries where data are available. Most countries continue to
have limited co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza B.

North Asia
Overall, influenza activity in the temperate zone of Asia has
continued to decrease or remained stable at low level, with the
majority of cases involving influenza A(H1N1)2009. Northern China,
Japan, Republic of Korea, and Mongolia have all reported declining
levels of ILI in recent weeks. In northern China, influenza activity
has remained below the level seen during the previous two seasons, and
the proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza has
decreased to 13 percent.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Influenza activity remains low throughout the tropical zone and the
most common subtype detected is influenza A(H1N1)2009.
Influenza activity is sporadic in regions of Central America, the
Caribbean, and the Andean Region, with influenza A and B
co-circulating.
In sub-Saharan Africa, available data indicate little activity in
most countries.
In Madagascar activity has peaked around week 5 of 2011 and now has a
low level of activity with influenza A(H3N2 ) and type B
co-circulating.
A low level of influenza activity continues in much of tropical Asia,
though at declining rates. In southern China, during 14-20 Feb 2011,
influenza activity has decreased slightly and remains below the level
seen last season, and similar to the level seen 2 seasons ago. During
this time period, 28 percent of the 981 specimens tested were positive
for influenza. Of these, 78 percent were influenza A and 22 percent
influenza B. Of the 274 influenza A detections: 94 percent were
influenza A(H1N1)2009, and 2 percent were influenza A(H3N2). In Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region, influenza activity continues to
decrease. Influenza A(H1N1)2009 made up approximately 90 percent of
the 372 viruses subtyped during week 9 [28 Feb-6 Mar 2011], with the
remaining viruses being influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Most countries in the southern temperate regions of the world
continue to have very little influenza transmission since the end of
their winter season. Australia continues to detect low, persistent
numbers of influenza A(H3N2).

Virological surveillance
------------------------
During weeks 7 to 8 [14-27 Feb 2011], regional and widespread
outbreaks of laboratory confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2), and
B viruses continued to be reported in many parts of Asia, Europe, and
north Americas while activity deceased in some countries. Influenza
A(H1N1)2009 viruses predominated in China, while both A(H1N1) 2009 and
B viruses co-circulated in many European countries. In the United
States of America, influenza A(H1N1)2009, A(H3N2) and B viruses
co-circulated, while in Canada, the predominant viruses were still
influenza A(H3N2). The number of laboratory confirmed influenza
positive specimens remained low in the southern hemisphere. The vast
majority of antigenically characterized viruses from the 2010-2011
influenza season remain similar to the viruses WHO recommended for the
2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 7 to 8 [14 -27 Feb 2011], National Influenza Centres
(NICs) from 71 countries, areas or territories reported data to
FluNet. A total of 23 736 specimens were reported as positive for
influenza viruses, 17 762 (74.8 percent) were typed as influenza A,
5974 (25.2 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A
viruses reported, 80 percent were influenza A(H1N1)2009 and 20 percent
were influenza A(H3N2).

In brief: the influenza season of the northern hemisphere appears to
be peaking or in decline in most areas, though with continuing active
circulation particularly in North America and Eastern Europe. In
Western Europe the number of influenza infections wit severe outcome
also has declined. Most countries in the southern temperate regions of
the world continue to have very little influenza transmission

Although influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been the most commonly detected
virus in Europe and northern Asia influenza type B has been increasing
in Europe and is now the more common virus seen in many countries.

The vast majority of antigenically characterized viruses from the
2010-2011 influenza season remain similar to the viruses WHO
recommended for the 2010-2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.
Although influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been the most commonly detected
