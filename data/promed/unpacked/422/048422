Hong Kong health authorities said they have received reports from the Hospital Authority (HA) Kowloon West Cluster that 15 melioidosis cases have been recorded from August to October [2022]. According to information from the HA, a total of 29 melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong in 2022 to date.

The 29 cases include 21 males and 8 females, aged from 42 to 93 years, 20 of them live in Sham Shui Po and the other patients live in Kwun Tong, Wong Tai Sin, Sai Kung, Kwai Tsing, Eastern District and Yau Tsim Mong. A total of 19 patients have been discharged, 4 patients are still hospitalized and 6 patients died, which involved 4 males and 2 females aged from 54 to 93 years, and 5 of them were with underlying diseases.

Melioidosis, which is prevalent in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, is a disease caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. Melioidosis cases have been recorded in Hong Kong each year. According to the records of the HA, the number of melioidosis cases recorded in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2021 were 12, 6, 3, 12 and 17 respectively.

The bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is widespread in soils and muddy water, particularly common in moist clay soils. Humans can become infected through contact with contaminated soil and surface waters (especially through skin abrasions/wounds); inhalation of contaminated dust/water droplets; and ingestion of contaminated water. Person-to-person transmission is rare but may occur through contact with the blood or body fluids of an infected person. Depending on the site of infection, common symptoms of melioidosis include fever, headache, localized pain or swelling, ulceration, chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, and swelling of regional lymph nodes.

Members of the public should seek medical advice promptly if they develop symptoms. They should take the following preventive measures against infection:
- Avoid contact with contaminated soil;
- Wear appropriate protective clothing or footwear when participating in activities with possible contact with soil or water, e.g. use gloves and wear boots;
- Wash or shower after exposure to contaminated water or soil;
- Always clean any wounds as soon as possible and cover any cuts or grazes with waterproof dressings;
- Wash hands with liquid soap and water after handling with soils or gardening;
- Observe food hygiene and avoid drinking raw water; and
- Travelers can contract the disease through outdoor water sports. Risk of infection can be minimized by avoiding exposure to water sources (such as rivers, ponds or lakes) that might be contaminated.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (the commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus on the soft tissues or lungs can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be reduced to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _B. pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in the treatment of infection with the organism. - Mod.LL
