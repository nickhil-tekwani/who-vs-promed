An urgent notice to the public from state veterinarian Dr. Annette Jones by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) alerted resident areas of active virulent Newcastle disease virus spread.

Jones said in the public notice: "Due to the progression and duration of a virulent Newcastle disease outbreak in parts of Southern California, the state veterinarian has ordered mandatory euthanasia of poultry in some neighborhoods within or near the communities of Eastvale, Menifee, Mira Loma, Jurupa Valley, Norco, Nuevo, Perris, Riverside (Riverside County); Compton and Whittier (Los Angeles County) and Chino, Fontana, Hesperia, Highland, Muscoy and Ontario (San Bernardino County)."

The notice continued: "Unfortunately, even individual birds and flocks that previously tested negative but now fall within a designated mandatory euthanasia area must be euthanized. USDA/CDFA staff will contact affected bird owners with orders for their individual properties. While this action is difficult for all involved, it must be done to eradicate virulent Newcastle disease. Otherwise, the disease will continue to spread and kill additional flocks."

The CDFA has provided a Virulent Newcastle Disease FAQS sheet at http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Animal_Health/pdfs/FAQ-WhatYouNeedtoKnowvND2018.pdf. For those seeking more information, call the Sick Bird Hotline at (866) 922-2473.

[While details are somewhat limited, it is unfortunate it has reached this point, and more unfortunate for individuals with pets, the loss for producers, and the cost to the public. This is a very sad situation and is a repeat of the 2003 situation. - Mod.TG
