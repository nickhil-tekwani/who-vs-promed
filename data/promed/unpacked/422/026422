Current situation -- week 3/2011
--------------------------------
Of 44 countries reporting clinical data, 19 reported increasing trends
in consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) or acute
respiratory infection (ARI). In general, the highest consultation
rates were reported for children aged 0 to 14 years. Information on
the intensity of influenza activity was available for 41 countries.
Most countries reported medium (29) or low (9) activity, while 1
(Luxembourg) reported very high influenza activity and 2 others
(Georgia and Norway) reported high activity. Influenza activity was
reported to be widespread in 20 countries, regional in 6 countries and
local in 6 countries; 11 countries reported no or sporadic activity.
Of the 23 countries reporting on the impact of influenza on health
care systems, 17 described it as low and 6 as moderate.

Virological situation -- week 3/2011
------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 continued to predominate in the
Region, although both influenza A and B viruses were co-dominant in 13
countries. Influenza B was reported to be dominant in Kyrgyzstan,
Norway and Ukraine.

Sentinel physicians collected 3825 respiratory specimens, of which
1674 (44 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 1128 (67 percent)
were influenza A and 546 (33 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 976 were subtyped: 889 (91 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 87 (9 percent) as A(H3). In the 32 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 13 percent
to 78 percent, with a median of 48 percent (mean: 45 percent). In
addition, 4688 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 3247 (69 percent) influenza A and 1441 (31 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 2255 were subtyped: 2201 (98
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 54 (2 percent) as A(H3). In addition,
20 countries reported circulation of respiratory syncytial virus.

Since week 40/2010, 793 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 443 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-
like; 262 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); 71
were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like, and 17 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the genetic
characterization of 98 influenza viruses, 69 belonged to the pandemic
A/California/ 7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 2 belonged to the pandemic
A/Christchurch/ 16/2010 A(H1) clade; 5 belonged to the pandemic A/Hong
Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 4 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented
by A/Perth/ 16/2009; 8 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/ 2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 2 belonged to
the A(H3) clade represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 7 belonged to the
B/ Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage), and 1 to the
B/Brisbane/ 60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010 - 3/2011
-------------------------------------------------------
A total of 30 113 influenza virus detections were reported during this
period, of which 21 355 (71 percent) were influenza A and 8758 (29
percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 13 924 were
subtyped: 13 201 (95 percent) as pandemic influenza A(H1), 722 (5
percent) as influenza A(H3) and 1 (less than 1 percent) as influenza
A(H1).

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates continue to rise, following a
west-to-east progression across the Region. Influenza activity has
already peaked in 3 countries in western Europe: Ireland, Spain and
the United Kingdom (England). In week 3/2011, 44 percent of sentinel
samples tested positive for influenza, similarly to previous weeks.
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 remains the dominant virus in
circulation in most countries, although influenza B virus is
co-dominant in 13 countries, and is the dominant virus in 3.

[There has been a continued slow increase in influenza activity
west-to-east across Europe. During this period 44 percent of sentinel
specimens were positive for influenza in week 3/2011. Respiratory
syncytial virus continues to feature in some reports. Pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) 2009 remains the dominant virus in the Region. Cases
of severe disease continue to be associated mainly with influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 virus infections. The previous year's seasonal H1N1
strain has virtually disappeared. In some countries in the west of
Europe the epidemic appears to have peaked. - Mod.CP]
