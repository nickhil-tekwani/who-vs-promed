Thirty-one states, as well as Washington, DC and Puerto Rico, are reporting decreasing or plateauing new COVID-19 case averages, ABC News reports, signaling that the massive surge caused by the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant may be receding (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=82434761#82441742).

New data published today [25 Jan 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report show that illnesses caused by omicron are less severe than previous variants but have still strained US healthcare systems due to the sheer volume of cases (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7104e4).

Omicron was first confirmed in the United States on 1 Dec 2021, and as of 15 Jan 2022, represented 99.5% of all sequenced viruses in the country. To gauge the severity of cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compared that 6-week timeframe with cases and outcomes from 1 Dec 2020 through 28 Feb 2021 (winter 2020-2021, when the wild-type strain was predominant), and 15 Jul 2021 through 31 Oct 2021, when delta (B1617.2) was the most dominant variant.

"The highest daily 7-day moving average to date of cases (798 976 daily cases during 9-15 Jan 2022), emergency department (ED) visits (48 238), and admissions (21 586) were reported during the omicron period; however, the highest daily 7-day moving average of deaths (1854) was lower than during previous periods," the authors wrote.

The ratio of peak emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths to case were all lower in omicron than other variants. The findings confirm data from South Africa, the United Kingdom, and health systems in Texas and California.

According to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), nearly 1 151 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported from 13-20 Jan 2022, a 17% increase over the previous week. "Over 10.6 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic; over 2 million of these cases have been added in the past 2 weeks," the AAP said in its report. This is the 24th week in a row with child cases totaling 100 000 or more (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).

The United States reported 1 007 511 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [24 Jan 2022] and 1963 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 668 312, with 2083 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

Pfizer announces omicron booster trial
--------------------------------------
Today [25 Jan 2022], Pfizer-BioNTech announced the 1st trial meant to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an omicron-based vaccine candidate in healthy adults 18-55 years old (https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-initiate-study-evaluate-omicron-based).

"While current research and real-world data show that boosters continue to provide a high level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization with omicron, we recognize the need to be prepared in the event this protection wanes over time and to potentially help address omicron and new variants in the future," said Kathrin U. Jansen, PhD, senior vice president and head of vaccine research & development at Pfizer, in a press release. The study will compare an omicron-specific vaccine with the current Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. As many as 1420 participants are expected to enroll in the trial.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 63.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 75.6% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 40.1% of vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose, which may be crucial for offering protection against omicron (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

In related news, Florida is closing all of its monoclonal antibody treatment sites, citing the Food and Drug Administration's decision to limit use of treatments found to be ineffective against omicron, CNN reports (https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/25/us/florida-closing-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-sites/index.html).

Other US developments
---------------------
- Idaho public health officials yesterday [24 Jan 2022] activated crisis standards of care for much of southern Idaho, citing major staffing and blood supply shortages, according to the Associated Press (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-boise-nampa-twin-falls-a3001f329077b1cd60c954c81d7d0da4).

- Two COVID-19 cases caused by a subvariant of omicron, BA.2, were detected earlier this month [January 2022] in Washington, Fox News reports (https://www.foxnews.com/us/washington-state-reports-two-cases-of-omicron-subvariant-ba-2).

- Free N95 masks from the Strategic National Stockpile are now available at some US supermarket chains, and more will be arriving later this week, the Washington Post reported today [25 Jan 2022] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/25/covid-omicron-variant-live-updates/).

[BA.2 was classified as a "variant under investigation" last week by the UK's Health Security Agency (HSA). Figures released from Denmark suggested BA.2 was responsible for nearly half of all the cases reported there. But to date (26 Jan 2022), there is no evidence to suggest that BA.2 causes more severe disease than BA.1. See thread of tweets by Tom Peacock @PeacockFlu at https://twitter.com. - Mod.LK]

Two countries that experienced early omicron surges in Europe -- Denmark and the Netherlands -- today [25 Jan 2022] announced that they were stepping down their restrictions. Meanwhile in Asia, variant surges are accelerating in countries such as Japan and South Korea, triggering tightened measures.

In Denmark last week, public places such as museums opened after a 4-week COVID-19 lockdown, and today [25 Jan 2022] the country's epidemic committee recommended lifting all COVID-19 restrictions by the end of the month, according to Berlingske, Denmark's leading newspaper. The group also recommended that, as of 5 Feb 2022, COVID-19 should no longer be categorized as a "socially critical" disease. Denmark's prime minister is expected to address the recommendations at a briefing tomorrow [26 Jan 2022], and the committee's assessment is expected to have broad support in parliament.

The country was one of the 1st in Europe to experience a surge in omicron activity. Currently, Danish scientists are noting that the BA.2 omicron subvariant numbers are rising rapidly and may become dominant. Researchers suspect BA.2 may be more transmissible than the parent virus, and studies are underway to gauge any differences regarding tests, vaccines, treatments, and clinical presentation.

The Netherlands' prime minister today [25 Jan 2022] announced that bars, restaurants, and theaters can reopen tomorrow [26 Jan 2022], but with some restrictions for the next 6 weeks, including limited opening hours and sports stadiums at one-third capacity, according to Reuters. Cases in the Netherlands are still at daily record-high levels, but intensive care unit (ICU) admissions have dropped 34% (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/netherlands-expected-ease-covid-curbs-despite-record-infections-2022-01-25/).

Last week, Britain loosened some of its COVID-19 restrictions, given its assessment that the country's omicron surge was past its peak and that ICU admissions had stabilized or were falling.

South Korea reported a new daily record high for COVID cases, and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said the omicron variant is now dominant in the country, according to The Korea Herald. So far, ICU levels remain relatively low (http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220125000745). Government officials are planning new response steps, which include ramped up testing and centers to support at-home treatment.

Elsewhere, Japan's daily COVID-19 total rose above 60 000 for the 1st time today [25 Jan 2022], and officials placed 18 more prefectures under a quasi-state of emergency, which now covers about 70% of the country, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-panel-approve-extending-covid-curbs-more-regions-2022-01-25/). Government data show the percentage of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients has risen to 50% in 7 prefectures and 68% in Okinawa, according to Kyodo News (https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/01/22f7147cffe9-covid-quasi-emergency-to-cover-34-of-japans-47-prefs-amid-omicron.html).

More global headlines
---------------------
- UNICEF said yesterday [24 Jan 2022] that the scale of education losses to children during the pandemic has been nearly insurmountable and that nearly 616 million students are still under full or partial school closure. Robert Jenkins, who leads UNICEF's education efforts, said just reopening schools is not enough. "Students need intensive support to recover lost education. Schools must also go beyond places of learning to rebuild children's mental and physical health, social development, and nutrition" (https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/covid19-scale-education-loss-nearly-insurmountable-warns-unicef).

- Authorities in China yesterday [24 Jan 2022] lifted a month-long lockdown in the port city of Xian. Meanwhile, mass testing is under way in Beijing amid a small increase in COVID-19 cases just weeks ahead of the start of the Winter Olympic Games (https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-coronavirus-pandemic-sports-travel-health-63e4ebc0a67c939bf020c93cd715297a).

- Russia for the 5th day in a row reported record COVID-19 cases, with the Moscow area one of the hardest-hit areas and about 70% of the new cases reported in unvaccinated people (https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2022/01/25/coronavirus-in-russia-the-latest-news-jan-25-a69117).

- The global totals today [25 Jan 2022] reached 357 270 387 cases and 5 611 522 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/).

[3] COVID-19 news scan for 25 Jan 2022
[A] Adults: psychological distress
Date: Tue 25 Jan 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/01/covid-19-scan-jan-25-2022


Among 1068 US adults surveyed about their mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 12% to 15% reported serious psychological distress that persisted throughout the study period, mostly among young adults, low-income respondents, and Hispanic participants. The data were published yesterday [24 Jan 2022] in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2788313).

A team led by Johns Hopkins University researchers fielded the survey in 4 waves: 7- 13 Apr 2020, 7-13 Jul 2020, and 11-30 Nov 2020, and 26 Jul-16 Aug 2021, all times of increasing COVID-19 cases. Participants were drawn from the probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Average respondent age was 49 years, 48% were men, 18% were Hispanic, and 13% were Black.

The team measured psychological distress with the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, in which a score of 13 or higher on a scale of 0 to 24 indicates severe distress. Participants who reported any psychological symptoms were asked how often they saw a health professional for treatment.

Of the 1068 sample members, 129 (12%) to 157 (15%) reported serious psychological distress, with no statistically significant differences in prevalence over all survey waves. For comparison, before the emergence of COVID-19 in 2020, the psychological distress was consistently 3% to 4%.

During all 4 survey waves, adults aged 18-29 years, those with an annual household income less than USD 35 000, and Hispanic participants reported the highest prevalence.

Of the 242 respondents (22.7%) with serious distress during at least one survey period, 125 (51.7%) saw a health professional for their symptoms. Among the 59 (5.5%) who reported severe distress throughout the study period, 47 (80.0%) visited a health professional.

"Future research should consider whether and how pandemic-related distress translates into long-term shifts in population mental health burden and service needs," the study authors concluded.

[B] Myocarditis
Date: Tue 25 Jan 2022

Seven days after receipt of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, rates of myocarditis were greater than expected and were highest after the 2nd vaccine dose among males 12-24 years old -- although the condition was still exceedingly rare, finds a descriptive US study today [25 Jan 2022] in JAMA (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788346).

Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, a condition that peaks in incidence in infancy and adolescence or young adulthood. Some patients require no treatment, yet others die or experience severe heart failure necessitating heart transplant.

The study, led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers, studied outcomes among 192 405 448 US residents who received 354 100 845 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine doses from December 2020 to August 2021. The researchers calculated expected rates of myocarditis by age and sex using 2017-2019 claims data.

Among the 192 405 448 vaccinees, 1991 cases of myocarditis (0.00004%) were reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), with 1626 (0.000008%) meeting the case definition. Of all patients with myocarditis, median age was 21 years, 82% with a reported sex were male, and median time to symptom onset was 2 days.

Myocarditis rates were highest after the 2nd vaccine dose in males 12-15 years old (70.7 per million doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine), 16-17 years (105.9 per million Pfizer doses), and 18-24 years (52.4 and 56.3 per million doses of Pfizer vaccine and Moderna vaccine, respectively). Although difficult to estimate, the prevalence of myocarditis in the US general population may range from 0.00001% to 0.0001%.

Among patients younger than 30 years with detailed clinical information, 826 had myocarditis. Of these patients, 792 of 809 (98%) had increased troponin concentrations (indicating heart injury), 569 of 794 (72%) had abnormal electrocardiogram results, and 223 of 312 (72%) had abnormal results on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

About 96% (784 of 813) patients were hospitalized, and myocarditis symptoms resolved in 87% (577/661) of them by the time of hospital release. The most widely used treatment consisted of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (589/676, 87%).

The researchers said that myocarditis after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination is a rare but potentially serious event. "This risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination," they wrote.

A global total of 11 140 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 23 Jan 2022 to late 24 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 88 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 43 of the 88 countries are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South-East Asia region, and 6 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 13.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 16.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 8.7% increase in daily reported cases and a 24.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 3.95 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 359.16 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.63 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
