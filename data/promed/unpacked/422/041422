The recent ProMED post about canine influenza in Ontario appears to be incorrect. The cited news report has verbatim text from January 2018 articles describing the previous outbreak (full details at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/10/19-0196_article). I am unaware of any canine influenza activity in Canada since October 2018.

The post from today about CIV in Canada is based on an article that was duplicated from 8 Jan 2019 (https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/cases-of-canine-influenza-confirmed-in-southern-ontario-1.3750865)
There have not been any new cases of influenza A in dogs diagnosed in Canada so far in 2019.

[Indeed, our sharp-eyed readers are correct. There were several who wrote to us. Thank you for letting us know we duplicated this article. The article was first published on ProMED-mail Canine influenza - Canada: ex Asia, H3N2, 1st rep 20180109.5547445 in January 2018.

ProMED-mail apologizes for the duplication. - Mod.TG]
