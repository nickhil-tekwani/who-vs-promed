Three people were diagnosed and treated for Anthrax in Mashonaland East's Bosha Clinic in Chikwaka after they had consumed the meat of a dead cattle the Herald reports. DVS chief director, Dr. Josphat Nyika revealed the incident and said they couldn't find a carcass for sample collection because people consumed all the meat.

Suspicion of anthrax was consolidated by human contacts. There were 3 patients who were diagnosed of anthrax after they had consumed the meat of dead cattle. They were admitted and treated at Bosha Clinic.

Meanwhile, the government has received 800 000 doses of anthrax vaccines from Botswana and vaccinations are currently underway according to Dr. Nyika.

Three people have been taken ill in Chikwaka, Mashonaland East, after consuming anthrax-infected meat. The 3 were treated at Bosha Clinic.

This comes as the Department of Veterinary Services received 811 000 doses of anthrax vaccine from the Botswana Vaccine Institute to deal with outbreaks during this rainy season. The mobilised vaccines received last week are enough to cover cattle missed in the 1st round of vaccination.

Anthrax is a life threatening infectious disease caused by bacteria that normally affects animals, especially ruminants. During the rainy season, the country usually experiences outbreaks because of the rains that wash away the top soil and expose spores.

DVS chief director, Dr. Josphat Nyika, yesterday [Tue 31 Dec 2019] said the veterinary officers could not find a carcass for sample collection because people had consumed all the meat. "Suspicion of anthrax was consolidated by human contacts," said Dr. Nyika. "There were 3 patients who were diagnosed of anthrax after they had consumed the meat of dead cattle. They were admitted and treated at Bosha Clinic. We mobilised vaccines and started vaccinating cattle on [19 Dec 2019]. A total of 708 cattle were vaccinated and 597 were missed. On [23 Dec 2019], 889 cattle were vaccinated, while 1165 were missed due to vaccine shortage."

There have been cases of farmers who get infected after eating meat from cattle that would have died of anthrax. People may also get infected through contact with the infected animals. Dr. Nyika advised the public not to open, let alone eat anthrax carcasses. "Opening an anthrax carcass will lead to formation of anthrax spores that are resistant to environmental changes, heat or cold and will contaminate the soil or area for more than 40 years," he said. "The public should not handle, buy or eat meat that has not been inspected. Anthrax carcasses should never be opened, skinned or eaten. Instead, they should be buried deep into the ground."

Broadly speaking livestock anthrax tends to be under-reported in Zimbabwe. Unfortunately this means that the veterinary services spend too much time responding retrospectively. To efficiently & economically control anthrax you have to be proactive; to know where it is and where it is likely to be; and annually vaccinate the targeted villages & herds at perceived risk. It's also important to be in touch with your cattle owners & ranchers so that they call you when they suffer an unexpected death. It is far too late to be responding to suspect human medical cases. Remember, not every cattle case results in human cases, which anyway might be from exposure to contaminated meat in a street market 10 miles away. And if those unobserved livestock cases are not subjected to rapid control, their neighbouring herds are very likely to be soon afflicted either through common grazing or hungry female tabanid flies.

So talk with your farmers on the road, in the markets, or on the way back from a farm visit. Question: Who wants to sit in their office all week long?

If you have difficulty finding suitable tissue for sampling, you can start with the bloody soil where the carcass was butchered. This will stay contaminated for a long while.

Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (G.A.B.R.I.) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination.

Also if you can find the skull of the affected animal(s) extract pieces of its turbinate bones and culture them. We have cultured live _B. anthracis_ from skulls (cattle & elk) that have been out in the sun for over 3 years. - Mod.MHJ
