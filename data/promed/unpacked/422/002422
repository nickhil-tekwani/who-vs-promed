New case of _Plasmodium falciparum_ from the Dominican Republic
-----------------------------------------------
_Plasmodium falciparum_ has been confirmed in an adult female Spanish
tourist following her travel to the Dominican Republic. The patient
stayed in a Bavaro resort [La Altagracia province] from 18 Nov to 26
Nov 2006, and the onset was on 4 Dec 2006; she had not received any
blood transfusion or organ transplant in the previous 12 months.
The patient remained in the resort all the time except for one
daytime trip to Sta. Catalina island. She did not take anti-malarial
chemoprophylaxis either before or during her stay.
At present in Spain, anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis is only
recommended for travelers to the Dominican Republic who to plan visit
rural areas throughout the country.

[The World Health Organization states: "Malaria risk exclusively due
to _P. falciparum_ exists throughout the year, especially in the
western provinces and in La Altagracia province. Risk in other areas
is low to negligible. There is no evidence of _P. falciparum_
resistance to any anti-malarial drug. The recommended prevention in
risk areas is chloroquine." Source:

The last case reported in ProMED was from October 2005 -- see below.
If others have registered malaria cases in tourists visiting the
Dominican Republic, ProMED will be happy to post such reports. - Mod.EP]
