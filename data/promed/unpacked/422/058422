[This region of western Kyrgyzstan is under constant threat of anthrax from uncontrolled livestock anthrax in the Furgana valley stretching west in Uzbekistan. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg.

The 2 countries need a unified joint control programme to achieve anything in controlling this disease. The human outbreaks follow from slaughtering and butchering animals moribund with anthrax, and consuming and selling the meat in local markets. - Mod MHJ
