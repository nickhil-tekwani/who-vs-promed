Please note these corrections to the previous posting:
1) Measles vaccination recommendations and measles elimination
strategy, Brazil:
One dose at 9 months; 2nd dose at 12-15 months; follow-up campaigns
(indiscriminate vaccination of children aged 1-4 yrs) every 3-4 years,
last campaign in 2000.
2) Measles virus circulation in Brazil:
There is currently no evidence for endemic measles circulation in Brazil.
The imported case from Japan is the first confirmed case of measles in
Brazil for 2001. As of 26 Jun 2001, 2433 suspected measles case had
been reported, and 1682 of these discarded for measles [results pending
on the rest.
In 2000, of 54 589 measles and rubella cases reported (Brazil has
integrated measles and rubella surveillance), only 36 measles cases
were confirmed, 30 by laboratory (detection of IgM antibodies). 92%
of the 8362 suspected measles cases and 91% of the 46 227 suspected
rubella cases were discarded by serologic tests (IgM).
The last outbreak in Brazil occurred in March 2000 with 15 cases. The
remainder have been sporadic IgM positive cases with no identified
source of infection despite extensive investigation.
3) Airport circulation:
The child remained in the airplane during the stopover in Los Angeles.

[Thank you, Dr. Prevots, for your rapid correction of information
posted. In addition, I neglected to thank Drs. Parise, Prevots, and
Segatto from the National Health Foundation of Brazil (FUNASA) for
submitting the initial report on the imported case along with the
relevant epidemiologic information.
The information on the vaccination schedule was taken from the
FUNASA website, but apparently it was not clear to me that the 15-
month dose was a booster. The epidemiologic data presented came
from the most recent measles weekly surveillance report on the PAHO
website, having mistakenly taken the 29 confirmed cases from 2000 as
cases from 2001:
<http://www.paho.org/English/HVP/HVI/sme0721.pdf>
Mea culpa for not having double-checked the FUNASA website before
posting the data. This case is the first confirmed case of measles in
Brazil this year:

As for the classification of Brazil as endemic for measles transmission,
this information was taken from the PAHO website on measles
eradication progress:
