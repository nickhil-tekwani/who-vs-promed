The incidence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has increased
1.5 fold despite an increase in funding and implementation of
preventive measures.

This year [2008], the level of morbidity in the region is the highest
for the past 10 years. This year, the incidence is the highest for
the whole of Russia.

In total, 80 persons have contracted the disease, 6 of whom have
died. A total of 8 million rubles [USD 307 000] have been allocated
for preventive measures but not in sufficient time, and, as a
consequence, tick control measures were not initiated until the peak
of the tick season.

In the case of 5 of the 6 fatal cases, the patients were admitted for
medical treatment promptly (i.e. on the 1st or 2nd day following
onset of symptoms). But, unfortunately, diagnosis of CCHF was
delayed, and appropriate treatment was not initiated early enough. In
the Levokumsky district, the diagnosis of CCHF was not confirmed
until one month after the death of a patient. Recently, CCHF has been
diagnosed in 2 physicians in the same hospital.

[In 2007 in the Stavropol Krai (region), 64 cases of CCHF were
recorded, and 41 cases in 2006. The Stavropol Krai is part of the
Southern Federal District of Russia. CCHF in Russia has been recorded
only in the territory of this district. - Mod.NP]

The adjacent region of Crimea, the original site of isolation of CCHF
virus and description of the disease, was formerly part of the Soviet
Union and is now part of Ukraine. Northward expansion of CCHF has
been limited by the distribution of the tick vector. Detailed
information concerning the distribution of CCHF can obtained from the
WHO website at
