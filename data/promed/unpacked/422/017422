The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [18 Dec 2012] urged members of the public to maintain vigilance against scarlet fever as scarlet fever activity has been high recently.

A spokesman for the CHP said that the number of scarlet fever cases reported to the CHP up to 14 Dec 2012 reached 1445, which is approaching the annual number of cases recorded last year [2011]. The number of reports has increased gradually from 36 cases recorded in September 2012, to 66 cases in October 2012 and 134 cases in November 2012. In December (as of 14 Dec 2012), the CHP has recorded 53 cases.

Among the 1445 cases, the ages ranged between 1 month and 59 years old. 89 per cent of all cases were children under 10 years old. Most cases presented with mild illness, and their characteristics were similar to cases reported in previous years. One fatal case of scarlet fever was recorded this year (up to 14 Dec 2012). In 2012, the CHP recorded 9 severe cases of scarlet fever with complications including toxic shock syndrome (5 cases), septic shock (2 cases), shock (one case) and sepsis (one case), affecting 6 males and 3 females with ages ranging from 2 to 17 years old.

So far, there have been 31 institutional outbreaks in 2012 involving 22 kindergartens/child care centres and 9 primary schools. A total of 69 people were affected, with 2-4 people involved in each outbreak.

The spokesman said: "There may be an increase in scarlet fever activity in the coming months, and we have to watch out for severe/fatal cases. People who are suspected to have scarlet fever should consult their doctors."

Laboratory surveillance data on Group A Streptococcus (GAS) isolates showed that the most frequent emm types observed in 2012 so far are type 12 and type 1, and no significant genetic changes were detected among current circulating strains.

According to local surveillance of antibiotic resistance, around 60 per cent of GAS isolated in 2012 were resistant to erythromycin (which also predicts resistance to azithromycin and clarithromycin), while all GAS isolates are sensitive to penicillin. Penicillin or a 1st generation cephalosporin should be used for treatment of a patient presenting with symptoms of scarlet fever.

Scarlet fever is caused by GAS bacteria and can be effectively treated with appropriate antibiotics. It is transmitted through either the respiratory route or direct contact with infected respiratory secretions. This disease usually affects children under 10 years of age and presents as fever, sore throat, and rash. The rash usually appears over the trunk and neck and spreads to the limbs, especially the armpits, elbows, and groin. The illness is usually clinically mild but can be complicated by shock and heart [rheumatic fever] and kidney [post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis] diseases.

Letters have been issued to doctors and schools to remind them to take prevention and control measures. To prevent infection, members of the public are advised to:
- maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
- keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
- wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, e.g. after sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly; and
- maintain good ventilation.

[An outbreak of group A streptococcal infections, mainly scarlet fever, in 2011 in Hong Kong was extensively reported by ProMED-mail that year (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). The outbreak is apparently ongoing: we are told in the news report above that the total number of reported scarlet fever cases as of 14 Dec 2012 reached 1445, which is approaching the annual number of cases reported in 2011.

The following is extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts on the 2011 Hong Kong scarlet fever outbreak:

Scarlet fever, caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow GAS infection of the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever) or GAS infection of skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, or even the skin lesions of chicken pox. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 per cent.

GAS pharyngitis has rarely caused bacteremia that can lead to infections at distant sites (http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4456639?uid=3739600&uid=2&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21101578091627, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19812863). Tissue invasiveness of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the _emm_ gene.

Microbial strain typing is a useful adjunct to clinical epidemiology. Phenotypic typing systems examine expressed characteristics, such as the serologic M protein typing system developed by Dr Rebecca Lancefield in 1928, whereas genotypic systems examine chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Group A streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_) strains are now commonly classified on the basis of sequence variation in the 5' end of the _emm_ gene. The 5' ends of _emm_ gene are highly heterogeneous and encode for the serotype specificity used for the M-typing system. For most M serotypes, there is a one-for-one relationship with a unique _emm_ sequence type (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/2/99-0209_article.htm).

Epidemiologic studies in the US suggest that a significant percentage of the serious suppurative and non-suppurative sequelae of group A streptococcal infections are associated with a relatively small number of specific emm/M protein types. For example, the 2 most prevalent emm types were 1, 12, accounting for about 36 per cent of pharyngitis isolates in the United States and Canada (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/1/78.full). In a study from Taiwan, emm 12 was also the most frequent (43.4 per cent) emm type among a total of 242 isolates recovered from 76 patients with invasive disease, 89 with scarlet fever, and 77 with pharyngitis (http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/8/2658.pdf). The Hong Kong 2011 outbreak group A streptococcal isolates were predominantly serotype M12, with smaller numbers of M1 and M28.

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948, http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192, http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911).

Half of group A streptococci in Hong Kong have been reported in the past to be resistant to the antibiotics erythromycin and clindamycin, but they have all been susceptible to penicillin, so that both erythromycin (and related antibiotics) and clindamycin should not be chosen for empiric therapy in the current Hong Kong outbreak, before results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known.

The incidence of GAS pharyngeal disease is highest in school-aged children (5-15 years), during winter and spring, and in a setting of crowding and close contact. Person-to-person spread from infected patients by means of respiratory droplets is the most common mode of transmission. It can rarely spread through contaminated food (http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).

Persons who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm). A history of GAS sore throat or scarlet fever in the community, neighborhood, or school may increase the likelihood of infection.

The incubation period of scarlet fever (the time between becoming infected and having symptoms) is short, generally 1-2 days. The illness typically begins with a fever, sore throat, and an initially white, then bright red tongue with prominent red papillae, the so-called "strawberry" tongue (http://dermatlas.med.jhmi.edu/derm/display.cfm?ImageID=-19962688), followed 12-48 hours later by a rash. The rash usually first appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body, and is more intense in skin folds, the so-called Pastia lines (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/images/ency/fullsize/19082.jpg). The rash is described as "sandpapery" to touch. The face may be flushed with perioral pallor. The rash can last for more than a week and is followed by peeling (desquamation) of the skin around the palms, fingertips, toes, and groin area.

Diagnosis of scarlet fever is clinical. Blood cultures are rarely positive, but GAS can usually be demonstrated in the throat by culture or rapid streptococcal test. Complications of scarlet fever include local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and endocarditis, occur rarely.

Treatment of scarlet fever is no different than that of GAS pharyngitis, that is, oral penicillin, [cephalosporins], erythromycin, or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine. With proper antibiotic treatment, complications are uncommon: penicillin therapy for treatment of GAS pharyngitis within 9 days of onset of symptoms has been shown to decrease the incidence of ARF; unlike ARF, antimicrobial therapy does not prevent acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Early recognition and treatment of GAS pharyngitis is essential to prevent spread of group A streptococcal infections. Patients should no longer be infectious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours.
