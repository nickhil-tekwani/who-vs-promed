The news article quoted [in ProMED-mail post Yellow fever - Uganda: vaccination fraud 20140913.2770794] states: "China does not require travellers from Uganda to carry along this certificate, 2 officials at the Chinese embassy in Kampala confirmed to The Observer this week."

According the WHO International Travel and Health 2014 update, China does require proof of yellow fever vaccination for travellers entering from Uganda http://www.who.int/ith/en/ (See Annex 1 at http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_Annex_I.pdf?ua=1 and Country list at http://www.who.int/ith/en/.

China Yellow fever (2013): "Country requirement: a yellow fever vaccination certificate is required for travellers over 9 months of age arriving from countries with reported by the WHO risk of yellow fever transmission and for all travelers having transited through the airport of a country with risk of yellow fever transmission. This requirement does not apply to travellers whose itineraries are limited to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macao SAR."

[ProMED thanks Irene Lei for providing the WHO information concerning yellow fever presence in Uganda and China's requirement for vaccination.

There was a confirmed case in Uganda in 2012 (http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Yellow-fever--Marburg-outbreak-confirmed/-/688334/1537376/-/yt6s90/-/index.html) following a major outbreak in 2010-2011, with 3 confirmed and 226 compatible cases (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2011_01_19/en/). ProMED should have been aware of this outbreak, since it was posted in 2011 and 2012 (see citations below). We regret the oversight and any confusion it may have caused.

It seems odd that the Observer report in the previous post stated that 2 officials at the Chinese embassy in Kampala confirmed that YF vaccinations were not required and continued that:" The well-placed officials, who declined to be named, emphasised that Ugandans intending to travel to China are made aware of the requirements when they are applying for a visa, and a yellow fever certificate is not one of them." Unless the Chinese requirements have changed since the latest WHO list of requirements was issued, this discrepancy raises serious concerns about Chinese consulate awareness of the requirements. Alternately it raises questions about the accuracy of the earlier Observer report (Yellow fever - Uganda: vaccination fraud: 20140913.2770794) of fraud requiring YF vaccination certificates from individuals traveling from Uganda to China when vaccination was, in fact, required. However, if individuals were issued cards without having been vaccinated, there is, indeed, a serious public health problem, because it presents the risk of YF viremic individuals infected in Uganda arriving in China in areas where vector mosquitoes are present. If not, then the report was inaccurate. ProMED would appreciate clarification of this situation by Ugandan or Chinese health authorities.
