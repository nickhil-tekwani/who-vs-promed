As health authorities urge Albertans to guard against Lyme disease
after 5 infected ticks were found so far this year [2011], a Calgary
mother says she's frustrated her sick daughter hasn't been tested for
the illness despite repeated requests.

The pinhead-sized ticks carrying the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ bacteria
that cause Lyme disease were spotted recently on 4 dogs and a cat,
through Alberta's surveillance system, said the province's chief
medical officer of health, Dr Andre Corriveau. Alberta doesn't
typically see a lot of the infected ticks, partially because they
don't survive well in the dry climate.

[The woman], whose daughter has been sick for 9 days with a number of
symptoms linked to Lyme disease, said she's frustrated the 14-year-old
hasn't been tested for the illness, even if the possibility is remote.
"At least give parents the peace of mind you're going to rule it out
and get tested." The girl has been suffering from a high fever,
chronic neck and back pain, nausea, and lethargy since 10 Jul 2011.

Visits to 2 emergency rooms -- at the Rockyview and Alberta
Children's Hospital -- have led to several tests including a spinal
tap and CT scan, which have revealed a slightly elevated white blood
cell count and enlarged lymph nodes. The family lives near Fish Creek
Park, and [the girl] spends a great deal of time outside. She's been
tested for West Nile and mononucleosis, but despite her mother's
requests, the physicians haven't checked for Lyme disease. "That's my
concern -- how difficult is it to get this tested?" the mother said.

An Alberta Health Services spokesman said the province follows Public
Health Agency of Canada guidelines in ordering testing. The agency
states that a diagnosis should be made after evaluating both the
symptoms and the risk of exposure to infected ticks. A University of
Calgary faculty of medicine professor who studies the Lyme disease
bacteria said Alberta physicians must begin paying closer attention to
the possibility the disease could rear up again in the province. "A
lot of physicians are under the impression that you can't even get
Lyme disease in Alberta. Now things are changing, we see infected
ticks," said George Chaconas, who holds the Canada research chair in
Lyme disease. "It needs to be considered a possibility by
physicians."

Since the province began a surveillance program in 2007, roughly 25
ticks carrying the Lyme disease bacteria have been detected. The
infected ticks this year [2011] were found on pets in the Edmonton and
Calgary areas. From 1989 to 2008, 20 cases of human Lyme disease were
reported in Alberta. Most of the cases were linked to travel in the US
or Europe. Last year [2010], the province identified about a dozen
infected ticks.

The risk of human infection in Alberta is a small one, said Corriveau
on Tuesday [19 Jul 2011]. However, Albertans should take steps to ward
off possible infections. Alberta authorities believe the ticks are
imported seasonally, likely by migrating birds.

The level of concern would rise considerably if evidence surfaced the
ticks have established a home base in Alberta. That would mean they
can survive the winter, reproduce in the spring and endure Alberta's
typically dry climate. "There's been no evidence of that," Corriveau
said. "We're using the ticks and the animals as sentinels," said Dr
Gerald Hauer, Alberta's chief veterinarian.

Other parts of Canada, such as southern British Columbia and Nova
Scotia, have larger populations of the bacteria-carrying ticks.
Climate change could be a determining factor in a potential upswing of
infected tick activity in Alberta, Chaconas contended.

The past 2 years, for example, have been particularly moist -- the
type of climate in which Lyme-carrying ticks thrive. "As conditions
change, ticks can move into the area and the disease does spread from
place to place with climate change," said Chaconas.

Even with the relative dearth of local tick population, Alberta
physicians should be alert to the possibility of infection, said
Corriveau. Apart from an initial rash, symptoms of Lyme disease are
"very nonspecific," Corriveau said. "It could be a broad range of
illnesses that present in similar ways. Part of raising awareness is
making sure our physicians are aware there's a possibility."

Blood samples from suspected cases are first sent to a provincial
lab. Then, to guard against false positive results, the sample is sent
to a national lab in Winnipeg for further testing. Prevention is the
best defence against the disease, Corriveau noted. Covering up
outdoors and using insect repellent help protect against the infected
ticks.

paediatricians." Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee,

103-5. Available at

"Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete
_Borrelia burgdorferi_. The infection is transmitted to humans through
the bite of the _Ixodes scapularis_ tick in eastern Canada and _Ixodes
pacificus_ in western Canada (1).

"Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in North
America and Europe, but it is not common in Canada. The western
black-legged ticks (_Ixodes pacificus_) are distributed widely in
British Columbia and are well established in the lower mainland,
Fraser Valley and on Vancouver Island. The eastern black-legged ticks
(_I. scapularis_) have a more patchy distribution and are well
established in some locations in Ontario along the shores of Lake Erie
and Lake Ontario, in southeastern Manitoba, and in Bedford and the
Lunenburg area of Nova Scotia (1, 2). _Ixodes_ ticks are found
intermittently in most provinces in Canada, likely brought by
migratory birds; 10 percent to 12 percent of these ticks may carry _B.
burgdorferi_ (3). Therefore, one could theoretically acquire Lyme
disease from the bite of an infected tick anywhere in Canada but the
chances are quite low, except in areas where the eastern and western
black-legged tick populations are firmly established. Human cases of
Lyme disease in Canada are primarily the result of travel to areas
outside of Canada or areas in Canada mentioned above where infected
ticks are well established.

"The incidence of Lyme disease in Canada is not known because it is
not a nationally notifiable disease, but it is reportable in certain
provinces where the vector ticks are well established. [In 2010, Lyme
disease became a nationally reportable disease in Canada
(http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/id-mi/lyme-fs-eng.php).] In Ontario,
Lyme disease is a reportable disease and all cases are investigated by
public health units. Between 1999 and 2004, a total of 172 cases of
Lyme disease were reported in Ontario, of which 110 (64 percent) were
travel-related; only 31 (18 percent) were known to have been acquired
locally (4). The number of endemic cases reported in Ontario (5 to 10
per year) has not increased over the past 2 decades.

"If a patient presents with a skin rash typical of erythema migrans
and has had exposure in a region where the black-legged tick is
established, a diagnosis of Lyme disease should be made on clinical
grounds alone. In areas of the country where black-legged ticks have
been found but populations are not known to be established, a
diagnosis based on clinical findings alone is more difficult. For
rashes occurring in these areas or if the rash is not typical,
laboratory confirmation is recommended. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme
disease is accomplished based on demonstration of a serological
response to _B. burgdorferi_.

"Serological testing is recommended when patients have a rash
suggestive of erythema migrans outside of the appropriate season in a
tick-established area or in an area of the country where the tick is
not established. Testing is also suggested for patients with
characteristic neurological, cardiac, or joint involvement with a
reasonable possibility of exposure to black-legged ticks.
Immunoglobulin M antibodies are usually detectable within weeks of the
onset of symptoms; however, a substantial proportion of patients will
not have antibodies present at the time of clinical presentation.
Therefore, repeat testing 4 weeks after an initially negative test is
suggested. Antibody measurement by enzyme immunoassay is sensitive but
lacks specificity; therefore, a 2-step procedure with confirmation of
positive enzyme immunoassay results by Western blot is recommended
with interpretation of the Western blot results using the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (USA) guidelines (8)."
