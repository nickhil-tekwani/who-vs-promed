Whooping cough or pertussis, a disease that sounds ancient but is still around, is accelerating the pace of contagion in Spain. The infection is growing.

In just 8 months in 2015, there were more cases recorded than in all of 2014. Additionally, in 32 weeks, the Carlos III Institute certified 4822 new cases; 1699 more are ill from this disease than in the 12 months of 2014, a jump of 54 percent without finishing this year.

Doctors have spent months reporting people increasingly infected by the bacterium _Bordetella pertussis_, which causes the disease. The rebound has been continuing since at least 2011. In 2011, by comparison, Carlos III Institute in late December had more than 800 cases. "It is also true that now diagnostic capability is greater," said officials.

Dr. Amos Garcia Rojas, president of the Spanish Vaccinology Association (AEV), said that "the original vaccine for pertussis (whole cell) had a lot of power but had a high rate of side effects. The new generation vaccine (acellular) reduces this problem, but immune response is lower than with the other one."

There is a worldwide shortage of pertussis vaccine production, and there may not be enough vaccine available to maintain immunization schedules.

The Spanish Medicines Agency (AEMPS) warned in May [2015] this year that the "holders marketing vaccines containing the antigen against pertussis have been reporting supply problems because of difficulties in manufacturing." The patent laboratories share the market (Sanofi Pasteur and GlaxoSmithKine), and cannot meet needs for vaccine.

In France, which has also suffered supply problems, it has been suggested that vaccinating pregnant women in the last trimester may be behind the lack of product sales. The vaccine is produced by biological processes, not chemical ones, which take time.

[The increase in the number of acellular pertussis vaccines given in a lifetime has expanded to one in adolescence and an additional Tdap in adulthood, as well as immunization during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy to assist in protecting infants less than 6 months of age, where much of the morbidity and mortality occurs, and may be straining the production capacity for the pertussis toxoids. - Mod.LL
