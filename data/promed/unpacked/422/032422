An Indonesian teenager who came into contact with sick poultry has
died of suspected bird flu infection at a hospital in Central Java
province, a health ministry official stated on Tue 7 Nov 2006. The
17-year-old died yesterday (Mon 6 Nov 2005), one day after he had
been admitted to the main hospital, Ningrum, an official at the
National Bird Flu Information Center here told Agence France Presse
(AFP). Samples were sent to a Jakarta laboratory to confirm whether
the teen had bird flu, she said.
Hartanto, Director of Margono Hospital where the suspected bird flu
victim died, was quoted by the state Antara news agency as saying the
victim was admitted to hospital with "high fever, difficulty of
breathing, and other bird flu symptoms." "The patient's family said
that he had been in contact with sick birds one month before he fell
sick on 27 Oct 2006," said Ningrum.
Positive results from 2 Indonesian laboratories [will] mean that the
World Health Organization includes the case in its records. Indonesia
is grappling with ongoing outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in poultry and
has reported 55 human deaths among its 72 cases, making it the worst
hit country in the world.

[ProMED-mail acknowledges with thanks receipt of similar information
from Mary Marshall & Joseph P.Dudley This case, if confirmed, will
raise the number of human cases of H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection in Indonesia to 73, and the number of fatalities to 56. - Mod.CP]
["The patient's family said that he had been in contact with sick
birds one month before he fell sick..."
WHO's Fact Sheet on Avian influenza states:
"Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period
ranging from 2-8 days and possibly as long as 17 days. However, the
possibility of multiple exposure to the virus makes it difficult to
define the incubation period precisely. WHO currently recommends that
an incubation period of 7 days be used for field investigations and
the monitoring of patient contacts."
