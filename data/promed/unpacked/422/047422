On 3 Aug 2016, the Ohio Department of Health Laboratory reported to CDC that a respiratory specimen collected on 28 Jul 2016 from a male aged 13 years who attended an agricultural fair in Ohio during 22-29 Jul 2016, and subsequently developed a respiratory illness, tested positive by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for influenza A(H3N2) variant* (H3N2v). The respiratory specimen was collected as part of routine influenza surveillance activities.

The next day, CDC was notified of a child aged 9 years who was a swine exhibitor at an agricultural fair in Michigan who became ill on 29 Jul 2016 and tested positive for H3N2v virus at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Laboratory. Investigations by Michigan and Ohio health authorities identified 18 human infections linked to swine exhibits at agricultural fairs.

To minimize transmission of influenza viruses from infected swine to visitors, agricultural fair organizers should consider prevention measures such as shortening the time swine are on the fairgrounds, isolating ill swine, maintaining a veterinarian on call, providing handwashing stations, and prohibiting food and beverages in animal barns. Persons at high risk for influenza-associated complications should be discouraged from entering swine barns.

[Including the infections described in this report, 372 H3N2v virus infections have been reported in the United States since 2005; this report describes all reported H3N2v virus infections in the United States since 1 Jan 2016.

This report underscores the importance of implementing measures to minimize influenza transmission between swine and persons at agricultural fairs. Young persons who exhibit or have other direct contact with swine should be educated on how to protect themselves from infection, as most infections in this and previous outbreaks have been in persons aged under 18 years who had direct contact with swine. This can be done through messages about the variant influenza virus transmission risk and prevention, particularly among young persons and persons at increased risk for influenza-associated complications (children aged under 5 years, persons aged 65 years or older, pregnant women, and persons with certain health conditions) to the agricultural fair organizers and officials, fair attendees, and animal exhibitors.

Treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor is recommended for persons with suspected variant virus infection who are hospitalized, who have severe or progressive illness, or who are in a group at high risk for influenza-associated complications. Human seasonal influenza vaccine is not known to protect against commonly circulating swine-origin influenza viruses, but it can protect against seasonal influenza, which can circulate even during summer months, when most fairs occur. An annual seasonal influenza vaccine, which is recommended for all persons aged 6 months and older, might help prevent future reassortment of H3N2v viruses with human seasonal influenza viruses.
