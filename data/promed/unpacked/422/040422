Researchers in Switzerland have their eye on clostridial toxins as
the possible cause of equine atypical myopathy (EAM), a seasonal,
pasture-associated muscle disorder.

The disorder presents a particular challenge to European
veterinarians. It is characterised by a generalised complete
degeneration of muscle fibres, which leads to sudden death due to
collapse of the cardio-respiratory system in over 90 per cent of the
cases.

Writing in the latest Gluck Equine Disease Quarterly, Dr Lucia Unger
and Professor Vinzenz Gerber, from the Equine Clinic at the University
of Berne, said the economic impact is often devastating. Affected
horses can either die quickly or show profuse sweating, muscle
twitching, weakness, abnormal urine colour, reluctance to move,
recumbency and difficulty in breathing. Death can follow after 12 to
72 hours.

Since the cause is unknown, no effective protective treatment exists,
and affected horses can only be treated for their clinical signs.

Large outbreaks have been reported since the 1980s in parts of Europe
including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, the
Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, and Denmark.

In 2010, 224 new cases were reported to the Atypical Myopathy Alert
Group, managed by Dominique Votion at the University of Liege in
Belgium.

A very similar if not the same disease has also been observed in the
United States and is called seasonal pasture myopathy. From 1998 to
2005, 14 cases were described in Minnesota.

White snakeroot toxicosis (_Ageratina_ spp., formerly _Eupatorium_
spp., a perennial herb) was ruled out as a potential cause, since its
toxin (tremetone) was not found in liver or urine samples of affected
horses.

Seasonal pasture myopathy is thought to be caused by the same agent
as the European equivalent.

Environmental factors such as regular access to pasture and certain
weather conditions seem to influence the incidence of the disease,
which occurs seasonally, mostly in autumn with lesser peaks in
springtime and sporadic cases in winter.

Young horses kept full time at pasture without any food
complementation are most frequently affected, highlighting the
importance of contact with grass. Further risk factors are adjacent
streams and trees, dead leaves and branches in the pastures, and wet,
windy, unpleasantly chilly weather conditions (but not severe frost).

Removing manure from pastures, providing clean drinking water and
salt blocks, and bringing horses in from pasture during rough weather
are advised.

Causes that have been discussed and investigated include ionophores,
mycotoxins and phytotoxins. Recently, the development of the disease
was associated with ingesting maple leaves (_Acer pseudoplantanus_)
covered with European tar spot (_Rhytisma acerinum_).

Stress and metabolic imbalances within horses may be factors that
predispose horses to developing the disease, the authors noted.

Over the last decades, the incidence of the disease, however variable
from year to year, has increased, and demand is growing for the cause
to be identified and effective treatments developed and preventive
measures identified.

Identification of the causative agent is of paramount importance,
Unger and Gerber said. "Consequently, our current research at the
Equine Clinic and the Institute of Bacteriology of the
Vetsuisse-Faculty of the University of Berne is focused on clostridial
toxins, specifically the lethal toxin of _Clostridium sordellii_,"
they wrote. "This large clostridial cytoxin is able to induce severe
muscular damage when injected intramuscularly into mice. Initially, we
detected _Clostridium sordellii_ DNA in faeces and intestinal contents
of horses suffering from EAM but not in corresponding samples from
healthy pasture mates. However, this finding was not reliably
reproducible."

Subsequently, they found damage in muscle samples of affected horses,
using light and electron transmission microscopy, to be very similar
to _Clostridium sordellii_ lethal toxin-induced structural damage in
the cytoskeleton of different cell lines.

"Most importantly, we were recently able to show that the lethal
toxin of _Clostridium sordellii_ is present in skeletal muscles of
horses with EAM. Myofibers of affected horses reacted not only with an
antibody specific for the lethal toxin, which failed to bind to the
myofibers of either healthy horses or those with other myopathies, but
also [sic] with sera from other EAM-affected horses."

Previously, _C. sordellii_-derived lethal toxin has been shown to
cause gas gangrene syndrome in cattle and sheep and toxic shock
syndrome in humans. Its presence in the myofibers of horses suffering
from EAM suggests it may play a role as a trigger or even as the
lethal factor in the cause of this disease.

Anecdotal evidence and the pair's most recent body-fluid data suggest
that naturally EAM-affected horses neither mount a protective immune
response nor show a substantial increase in anti-lethal toxin
antibodies, respectively.

"Our findings may nonetheless suggest a rational approach for the
development of a protective vaccine," they said.
