Since the last update on 22 Sep 2015, 113 new ill people have been reported from 19 states. It can take up to a week from the time people eat food contaminated with salmonella before they get sick. Also, cucumbers have a shelf life of up to 14 days. It is not unexpected to continue to see illnesses reported after the recalls. Some people may not have known about the recall and eaten the contaminated cucumbers after the recall.

As of 28 Sep 2015, 671 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona have been reported from 34 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Alaska (13), Arizona (112), Arkansas (9), California (164), Colorado (17), Hawaii (1), Idaho (22), Illinois (8), Indiana (2), Iowa (5), Kansas (2), Kentucky (1), Louisiana (5), Minnesota (34), Missouri (10), Montana (14), Nebraska (5), Nevada (13), New Mexico (30), New York (5), North Dakota (3), Ohio (2), Oklahoma (12), Oregon (19), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (1), Texas (33), Utah (51), Virginia (1), Washington (21), Wisconsin (38), and Wyoming (6).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 3 Jul 2015 to 21 Sep 2015. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 99, with a median age of 17. 51 per cent of ill people are children younger than 18 years. 54 per cent of ill people are female.
