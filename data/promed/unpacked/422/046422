Plague that affects cherimoya crops
-----------------------------------
The State Plant Health Committee is conducting [surveys] in municipalities with plantations of fruit trees to monitor the crops and check if they are being affected by pests or disease.

There is the presence of an unknown plague that is affecting the cherimoya [custard apple] crops in the community of San Bartolo [San Luis Potosi state]. It is at risk of losing all of its crop, so it is important to identify the plague in order to start fighting it immediately.

[Custard apples (_Annona_ species and hybrids, including cherimoya and soursops) are important both as subtropical or tropical cash crops and as dietary components of some local populations. The trees are known to be susceptible to a number of fungal diseases (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090408.1356) as well as a bacterial wilt. As stated above, reliable diagnosis of the cause of the problems will be essential to devise control or management strategies in Mexico.
