The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease
Control, SMI, has Monday [29 Nov 2010] analyzed
drinking water and samples from the water
purification unit at Minnesgarde, Ostersund
municipality [Jamtland, Sweden]. The analysis
found cryptosporidium in both drinking water
samples and samples obtained from the purification unit.

It is, therefore, highly likely that
cryptosporidium in the municipal water supply has
been the cause of the many cases of diarrhoeal
disease seen in Ostersund during the last few
weeks. Further samples are being analyzed at SMI,
and the results will be ready by 1 or 2 Dec 2010.

The water purification unit at Missesgarde
obtains its water from Lake Storsjon and supplies
drinking water to the municipalities of
Östersund, Brunflo, Lockne, Froson and the area
from Genvalla to Orrviken, and the areas of
Byskogen and Sanghusvallen in Krokom municipality.

Ostersund municipality, Jamtland Regional
Government, and SMI are working to identify the
source of infection and, in the meantime,
recommend that people living in the areas listed
above continue to boil their drinking water until further notice.

UPI reports that cryptosporidium in the water
supply has sickened more than 2000 people in the
city of Ostersund, in northern Sweden. The source
of the contamination is unknown. It is feared
3000 to 9000 people may be infected.

A warning to boil tap water was issued Friday and
renewed Monday [26 and 29 Nov 2010].

Several members of Sweden's biathlon team,
training in Ostersund for an international
competition in the city, have come down with symptoms.

[With the report from the Swedish Institute for
Infectious Disease Control, SMI, it is confirmed
that the outbreak is being caused by
cryptosporidia. The 1st reports say that the
source is unknown, but surface water is a well
known source of contamination of drinking water,
because it usually is not cleared by filtration,
and the drinking water in Sweden is not chlorinated.

The information from the Swedish Institute for
Infectious Disease Control, SMI, states that the
water purification plant draws its water from a
large lake, Lake Storsjon, and it is highly
likely that the lake is the source of the infection. - Mod.EP]
