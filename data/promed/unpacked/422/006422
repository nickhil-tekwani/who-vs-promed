A sample of Atlantic salmon that escaped after a fish farm's net pen collapsed last summer [2017] tested positive for a contagious and harmful virus, according to findings released by the Wild Fish Conservancy on Thursday [15 Feb 2018].

An independent lab at the University of Prince Edward Island found all 19 salmon donated from different sources were infected with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV), a virus it says can cause heart and skeletal muscle inflammation and affects a salmon's ability to compete and survive in the wild.

Researchers tested heart, gill, and kidney samples from fish that were caught in the Strait of Juan de Fuca [boundary between Canada and the United States], near Cypress Island [Washington state, USA], and 50 miles [80 km] up the Skagit River.

Wild Fish Conservancy also speculated that its sampling is cause to believe that all the escaped fish are most likely infected with PRV.

But there are some holes in the report, according to Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife [DFW]. Mainly, that in its 120-page report released [30 Jan 2018], the agency essentially disputes the timing of when the Atlantic salmon contracted the virus. On page 98 of that report, DFW says when it examined more than 15 Atlantic salmon shortly after their release, biologists concluded, "The escaped population was healthy at the time of release. No endemic, bacterial, viral, or parasitic pathogens were detected in the group of fish."

On the following page, DFW goes on to say that in the weeks after their release, the Atlantic salmon contracted the virus in the wild, stating, "The fish became susceptible to bacterial infection following anorexia and stress. In other words, DFW says the fish were not when they left the pen, but got sick because they couldn't make it in the wild.

About 260 000 non-native salmon were released into the Salish Sea [southwestern portion of the Canadian province of British Columbia and the northwestern portion of the US state of Washington] in August [2017] after a net pen failed at Cooke Aquaculture's Cypress Island fish farm. Cooke was fined USD 332 000 after the failure.

[The 1st cases of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), were registered in 1999 in the Hitra/Freya area of Norway. Since then, there has been an increasing number of outbreaks along the Norwegian coast, and it was also reported in the UK and in Chile (see post 20111013.3068). Later on, piscine reovirus (PRV) was established as the causative agent. PRV was common among wild and farmed salmonids in British Columbia, western Canada, since 1987. A study conducted in that region (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.12285/full) documented presence of infected fish without heart lesions, which supports the hypothesis that fish can have high levels of PRV without HSMI, consistent with the high incidence of PRV in some wild Atlantic salmon in Norway with few heart lesions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the significance of this virus in local wild fish populations. - Mod.PMB]

[The samples are from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the international boundary between Canada and the United States on the Pacific coast. The fish farm's net pen that collapsed last summer released tens of thousands of non-native fish into Puget Sound (Washington state, USA) and as a result, Washington state officials cancelled a lease with the Canadian company that owned the farm (Cooke Aquaculture Pacific). - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
