A probe has been launched in Gansu province after thousands of students
fell ill after taking tainted iodine pills.
Education officials in the province capital, Lanzhou, sold the tablets at
hundreds of times the normal cost to the city's 7,000 school children.
More than 6300 primary student fell ill and had to be treated. On April
11, some 109 children were taken to hospital after suffering vomiting,
abdominal pains, dizziness or nose bleeds. In one school, all 470 pupils
who took the iodine pills became sick, according to a report in the
Guangming Daily.
Governor Sun Ying and Lanzhou Mayor Zhu Zouyoug ordered a swift recall of
all tablets and set up a special investigative committee.

[I can think of two reasons for dosing children with iodine: it is an
iodine-poor area with a high incidence of goiter, or there has been a
nuclear accident and the children are being protected. Any clarification
from ProMED-mail readers in China or elsewhere will be welcome - Mod.JW]
