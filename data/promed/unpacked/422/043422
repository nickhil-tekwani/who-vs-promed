Experts Investigating Marburg Fever Outbreak In Congo
----------------------------------------------------------
An international team of researchers is currently investigating a fresh
outbreak of Marburg haemorrhagic fever, which had killed 3 of the 6 cases
diagnosed last week in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Province Orientale.
The cases in Watsa area were confirmed Thursday after laboratory tests were
conducted by the National Institute for Virology in South Africa.
According to Dr P.S. Lusamba-Dikassa, the regional adviser for Emerging and
Re-emerging Diseases at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, temporarily
based in Harare, Zimbabwe, Marburg fever outbreaks had been occurring in
Watsa over the past few years.
"The current Marburg outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo started
in Watsa health zone, mostly in Durba mining town in November 1998," he
told PANA. From 1 Nov 1998 to the end of August 1999, a total of 61
suspected cases and 41 deaths were reported to the WHO, he said, adding
that among these, 12 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests.
"The outbreak subsided at the end of August 1999. However, since 29 Nov
1999 new suspected cases have been reported, mostly from Durba. Laboratory
results have once more confirmed the diagnosis of Marburg viral
haemorrhagic fever," he added.
Lusamba-Dikasa described Marburg viral haemorrhagic fever as an acute
disease, characterised by fever, malaise, muscular pain, headache, sore
throat, diarrhoea and haemorrhagic signs, including bleeding from the nose,
the mouth and bloody diarrhoea. "The disease is part of the so-called viral
haemorrhagic fevers group. There are several other diseases in this group,
such as are Ebola
haemorrhagic fever, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever and
dengue fever," he said. Marburg haemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus of
the filoviridae group, which is very similar to, but distinct from the
Ebola virus.
Lusamba-Dikasa said the disease is transmitted from a sick person to a
healthy one by contact with infected blood, urine, and other body
secretions. The period between infection and the onset of clinical disease
varies from three to nine days. He added that the disease was first
identified in 1967 in Germany and former Yugoslavia. It was linked to
contact with African green monkeys. In 1975 three cases were identified in
South Africa and in 1980 two cases were diagnosed in Kenya. Later on, a
case was diagnosed in Zimbabwe (1982) and another one in Kenya (1987).
Lusamba-Dikassa said that following the latest outbreak in Watsa,
international scientific teams have conducted two investigations on the
disease in the Durba-Watsa area. "They have been able to confirm the cause
and mode of transmission of the disease. However, research is still ongoing
with relation to the reservoir of virus which has not yet been identified,"
he added. He explained that the teams have been collecting and examining
large quantities of animal samples, including birds, rats, insects in an
attempt to discover the reservoir of the virus.
As to whether this haemorrhagic fever was curable or not like the one
caused by the Ebola virus, which decimated close to 300 people in the
Congo's Kikwit 5 years ago, he said: "There is currently no specific
therapeutic agent for Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Treatment is symptomatic."
He stressed the importance of health education once the disease is
detected. "The community should be informed that Marburg haemorrhagic fever
is highly communicable. It is caused by a micro-organism and spread from
one person to another through blood and [excreta of sick persons," he
said. Washing hands with soap helps get rid of germs on hands, he added.
Lusamba-Dikassa confirmed that for the time being, no vaccine exists to
give long-term prevention against the deadly disease. "There is no vaccine.
There is no effective, specific treatment. Currently, prevention is the
only effective control method. Prevention is achieved through strict
isolation of sick persons in appropriate health care settings," he
explained. He said that health authorities in Congo, with support from WHO,
Centres for Disease Control in the US and NIV in South Africa have
established epidemiological surveillance for Marburg and other haemorrhagic
fevers in the affected area. "Biological samples are collected and
forwarded to reference laboratories (CDC/Atlanta and NIV/South Africa) for
the confirmation of diagnosis," he added.
On whether special precautions were required when dealing with patients
affected by this haemorrhagic fever, he said "all persons approaching the
patients must wear protective masks, goggles, clothes, gloves and shoes."
In addition, all personal belongings of the patient and [excreta must be
disinfected and disposed of properly by trained health staff. He cautioned
against the manipulation of the bodies of persons deceased of suspected
haemorrhagic fever as well as manipulating or eating animals found dead.

[This is a very clear & basically accurate description of the disease, its
history & control. I would only comment that "the so-called viral
haemorrhagic fevers group" is not a taxonomically homogeneous group, merely
a symptomatic one, which also includes yellow fever. The filoviruses
Marburg & Ebola form a family quite distinct from the other viruses
mentioned, which in turn belong to several disparate taxonomic groups. By
"manipulation of the bodies" of people or animals dead from possible
Marburg virus infection is meant the removal of viscera, which risks
contaminating
the hands of the manipulator with infected blood. - Mod. JW
