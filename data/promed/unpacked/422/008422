The Australian Indigenous population is being hit by HTLV-1, the most lethal human-immune virus known thus far, with "no current cure, no treatment, and no coordinated public-health response," according to a report in The Guardian.

An acronym for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, HTLV-1 is related to other diseases like T-cell lymphoma. The disease is transmitted similarly to other human immune retroviruses: through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and via breastfeeding. In some cases, it can very quickly transform into leukemia.

The infection is vicious. It can kill people within weeks -- or inflame the spinal cord, rendering a patient paralyzed. It can also lead to a series of painful inflammatory diseases like bronchiectasis, a condition that affects the mucus-clearing system of the lungs and makes it difficult to breathe.

What's especially odd and frightening about the disease, however, is the fact that it's attacking the Indigenous population at higher rates than others -- and not much is being done about it.

Despite its higher rate of incidence among the Indigenous population, it's a disease that hasn't seen much in terms of blaring headlines and public-health initiatives. According to The Guardian, the reasons are twofold: There's shame associated with having the disease given its sexual transmission, and because it has a mostly aboriginal patient base, it's lacked public-health attention for years.

Those with HTLV-1 are often ostracized and ignored, left to suffer by themselves without proper medical attention. "People are scared," a woman who goes by B told The Guardian. "We should work quietly, telling people in language. We should show love and care to people who are sick."

The disease also remains mysterious. It's thought to have existed among aboriginal populations for at least 9000 years. Discovered in Japan in 1977, the virus is unlike most that doctors know of. While it's incurable, 90 percent of patients are asymptomatic. 20 million people worldwide are thought to carry HTLV-1, but the virus itself can show up in a range of corollary diseases.

Scientists aren't quite sure why the virus acts the way it does and shows itself in unpredictable ways; a 2010 study in the journal Clinical Microbiology Reviews suggests that HTLV-1's persistence in a class of lymphocytes known as CD4+ might be why HTLV-1 expresses itself so broadly. But how it acts -- whether it's the virus acting on the immune system, or a consequence of the immune system attacking the virus -- is not known.

A screening process was developed in 1986, and in 1993, blood donors started to be screened for the virus. But these preventative measures have not stemmed the rise of the disease. In fact, researchers are now worried more than ever that the disease could blow up into a silent epidemic of epic proportions. Lloyd Einsiedel, an infectious-diseases clinician, told The Guardian that he fears the death rate from HTLV-1 could prove to be "significant," with a sharp rise in adult bronchiectasis [the walls of the airways (bronchi) thicken as a result of chronic inflammation and/or infection] (Australia already reports the highest rate of adult bronchiectasis in the world).

There's reason to believe the disease is actually further along and more deeply embedded within Australia than we know of, particularly because HTLV-1 is a hidden disease. Indeed, HTLV-1 was discovered around the same time as HIV, the latter of which received the vast majority of the world's attention. There's also the fact that HTLV-1 almost always is asymptomatic, with many people carrying the disease their entire lives without showing any sign or facing any medical trouble.

Nearly half of aboriginal Australians carry the virus -- but it's not just Australia that is dealing with it, Einsiedel told The Guardian. "There are close to 20 million people affected and they don't live in Sydney or Tokyo," he said. "These are people who overwhelmingly live in Papua New Guinea, the Congo, Peru. They're the poorest members of society. In terms of drug companies and media interest, there's very little in the way of advocacy."

[In 1979, T-cell lymphotropic virus [Retroviridae family, genus _Deltaretrovirus_] was isolated in a patient with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.[2] This led to the discovery of the 1st HTLV and marked the beginning of the human retrovirus era. 2 years later, HTLV-2 was documented in a patient who had been diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia,[3] although subsequent studies showed no affiliation between the 2 processes.

In 1983, the 3rd and most important retrovirus was discovered. At the time of its discovery, this virus was classified in the HTLV genus. However, upon further research, it was reclassified into the _Lentivirus_ genus and given the name human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In 2005, 2 novel viruses, HTLV-3 and HTLV-4, were discovered. Little is known about these viruses, as only a few cases have been reported. Now, [more than] 30 years later after the initial discovery, 4 HTLVs are well established. HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are both involved in actively spreading epidemics, affecting 15-20 million people worldwide. [4] In the United States, the overall prevalence is 22 per 100 000 population, with HTLV-2 more common than HTLV-1. Data collection performed from 2000-2009 among US blood donors has shown a general decline since the 1990s. [5]

HTLV-1 is the more clinically significant of the 2, as it has been proven to be the etiologic agent of multiple disorders. At least 500 000 of the individuals infected with HTLV-1 eventually develop an often rapidly fatal leukemia, while others will develop a debilitative myelopathy, and yet others will experience uveitis, infectious dermatitis, or another inflammatory disorder. HTLV-2 is associated with milder neurologic disorders and chronic pulmonary infections. The novel HTLV-3 and HTLV-4 have been isolated only in a few cases; no specific illnesses have yet been associated with these viruses.

"The known. The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is endemic to central Australia according to hospital and laboratory data for Indigenous adults admitted to Alice Springs Hospital. However, the data may underestimate the overall community prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in remote communities.

The new. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection in a remote Northern Territory community was high: 30 of 74 adults tested were HTLV-1-positive, and 9 had clinical syndromes potentially attributable to HTLV-1 infection.

The implications. HTLV-1 infection may be more prevalent among Indigenous Australians and be associated with a greater burden of clinical disease than is currently appreciated."

With 30 of 74 adults positive for HTLV-1, this is clearly a neglected disease that is crying out for more attention. - Mod.LK
