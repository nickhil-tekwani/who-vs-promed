It is interesting to read the report on the undiagnosed condition causing
blindness in Monk seals. We see a high incidence of ocular pathology with
rinderpest virus in wildlife leading often to blindness. Knowing the
susceptibility of water mammals to morbillivirus is there any data on the
antibody prevalence in the affected population.

[We have had another suggestion proposing blindness following
cerebro-cortical necrosis as a result of exposure to thiaminases, which the
member had noted in stored frozen fish. Whether this is possible in the
open sea is another matter. - Mod.MHJ
