This report also raises questions about cross-reactivity on serologic
testing. Is it _H. heilmanni_ or _H. pylori_ we find on positives? Should
we also test for _H. heilmanni_ if _H. pylori_ is negative and there is no
cross-reactivity? Are the microscopic techniques used to determine if _H.
pylori_ is present on biopsy sensitive enough to distinguish one species
from the other? How does _H. heilmanni_ influence the CLO test [a rapid
test for urease production - ES?
Perhaps this is addressed in the veterinary literature.
