The Ministry of Livestock has given out an alert to dairy farmers in Murang'a County regarding a possible outbreak of anthrax. This comes after a family whose cow died from the dangerous viral [sic] disease around Ndikwe village was ordered to seek medical attention at Murang'a district hospital.

According to Murang'a East district veterinary officer Ms Priscilla Waitiki, a farmer came to her office asking for meat inspection services. "She was coming for a meat inspector saying she had slaughtered her cow after it developed some symptoms of sickness, but we insisted on taking some samples to the laboratory as we suspected the animal had died of anthrax," said the veterinary officer.

Ms Waitiki said on Wednesday [1 May 2013] the results from Karatina veterinary laboratory came out positive for anthrax, adding that they have launched a serious vaccination campaign to prevent any animal death. She said she had ordered the woman and her family members to bury the carcass and go for treatment.

Ms Waitiki asked farmers to have their animals vaccinated, saying they were targeting over 10 000 dairy cows in Murang'a East only. She said the department would charge Sh70 [USD 0.84] per vaccine, adding that the cost was affordable yet very crucial.

However, the veterinary officer lamented that farmers were declining to get the services, claiming that they could not afford the cost or out of apathy. "We have already done the vaccination at Gaturi location and will be spreading the services to other areas; we urge farmers to have their cows vaccinated," she said.

The veterinary officer asked residents whose animals die suddenly -- one of the major signs of anthrax -- to contact her office immediately.

She advised those whose animals had been diagnosed with the killer disease to either bury the carcass in a deep pit or burn it to ashes, and also seek medical help.

The veterinary officer said the disease was common after heavy rains, adding that the vaccination services would continue for the next one week.

[Bovine anthrax is regularly reported in Central Province, possibly because it was close to the major laboratory in Nairobi, but latterly it clearly has a competent diagnostic laboratory within the province: 2005 (4 outbreaks), 2006 (16), 2007 (10 in cattle, 3 in swine), 2008 (6), 2009 (8 in cattle, 3 in small ruminants with one mixed, and 3 in pigs (one mixed), 2010 (13 outbreaks with one involving cattle, sheep and pigs, plus one just sheep), 2011 (4 in cattle, and 3 in pigs), 2012 (4 in cattle, one in sheep, 2 in pigs). There have been Central Province human cases reported, sometimes with deaths, in 2009 and 2010. It is very revealing that the owner told her local veterinary officer about her concerns with this sick cow. There was a level of trust involved, which is good.

This event points up a central problem, that even though the vaccine is extremely cheap, it can be a financial challenge to local farmers. And as they prevaricate, animals die. Kenyans are not alone in this, unfortunately.
