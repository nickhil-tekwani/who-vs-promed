Early this year [2007], 21 people became ill with trichinellosis in
both Spain and Sweden. The infection was traced to consumption of
homemade wild boar sausage from an original source in Spain.
An outbreak of trichinellosis was detected on 24 January 2007, when 4
cases in residents of Castile and Leon, Spain, were notified to the
provincial and regional authorities. During the course of the
investigation, it was found that a further 3 people had been exposed
in the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands, and one person that
subsequently traveled to Sweden. This was reported to Spain's
National Centre for Epidemiology in Madrid. The information was also
sent to the regional Spanish and Swedish health authorities (30 and
31 Jan 2007, respectively) once the information needed to locate the
affected persons was obtained.
The suspected food was Spanish sausage (chorizo), made from the meat
of 2 wild boars ("jabali" in Spanish) that came from a private hunt
held in Castile and Leon. Meat from the wild boars was analyzed by
trichinoscopy by the local veterinarian and tested negative for
_Trichinella_. Homemade sausage was then prepared by a relative and
distributed within one family circle.
Most of the exposed subjects participated in a family meal held on 31
Dec 2006, in Spain. One family member was a student temporarily
residing in Sweden, who took some of the sausages with him when he
returned to Sweden, where they were consumed by a further 7 Spanish
companions. The Basque Country health authorities recommended that
the student and his companions visit the Swedish health services and
provide them with leftover samples of the sausage for further investigation.
To date (15 Mar 2007) there have been 21 cases with symptoms of
trichinellosis -- one of them requiring hospitalization -- and 2
suspected cases, with a total of 62 people exposed. Most of the
symptoms presented by the patients were myalgia, cephalalgia,
asthenia, and fever. The results of serological testing are still awaited.
The case distribution was as follows: 16 cases in Castile and Leon,
with 51 persons exposed; one case in the Basque Country, with 2
persons exposed; one case of one person exposed in the Balearic
Islands [Spain]; and 8 exposed people in Sweden, where one case has
been confirmed and a further 2 cases are awaiting confirmation.
Immediately following the detection of the outbreak, the remaining
meat and sausages were found and retained. The various pieces of meat
and sausage were studied, and the molecular techniques used both in
Sweden and in Spain identified _Trichinella britovi_. The results of
the artificial digestion method were: 1.4 larvae/gm. of trichinella
in Sweden; 12 larvae/gm. at the Spanish National Centre of
Microbiology; and 18 larvae/gm. at a Madrid University's Parasitology
Laboratory. Analysis of pieces of the frozen meat proved negative at
all laboratories.
An outstanding feature of this outbreak was the degree of cross-level
(local to international) collaboration mobilized in the 2 countries,
in the health care, laboratory, epidemiology and public health
fields. A total of 9 outbreaks attributable to consumption of wild
boar meat (all non-commercially marketed) have been reported in Spain
in the last 5 years (according to data from the Spanish National
Epidemiological Surveillance Network). Of these, 4 outbreaks were due
to _T. britovi_.

[Trichinella infection from wild boar meat is classical. The outbreak
also illustrates that food items are transported over long distances
and consumed far from the original source. - Mod.EP]
[Trichinoscopy, as done by the the local veterinarian, uses a low
power stage microscope with image projecting capacity. It has a large
field of view to facilitate easy search of the sample. A 2 cm
diameter (approx 30 g) of muscle is taken from the diaphragmatic
pillars of the animal. This is cut into pieces about 3 x 2 mm; 14
pieces are placed in a compressor and squashed. The squashes are
examined at 40x and 80x magnification. Soule and Dupouy Camet (1991)
considered that trichinoscopy is less sensitive than artificial
digestion, as done by the 3 reference laboratories. However, it is
striking that in this case all the meat, examined by various methods,
was negative but the sausage was positive. This suggests that the
parasite was in some non-muscular part of the boar(s), such as jowls,
used in making the sausages. - Mod.JW]
