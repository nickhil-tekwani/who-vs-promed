400 Chinese students hospitalized with unknown flu
-----------------------------------------------
Over 400 students at a university in central China's Henan province were
hospitalized with high fever linked to an unknown flu virus, state press
and a school official said.
The outbreak began on 26 Mar 2006 when 22 students were hospitalized with
high fever, Xinhua news agency said. The next day, the number of sick
students at the Henan University of Science and Technology, in Luoyang
city, rose to 88, and on 28 Mar 2006, there were 208 sick students in the
university's infirmary, it said. "There were over 400 students that became
feverish with the flu," a university official who declined to be named told
Agence France-Presse when contacted by phone.
He refused to detail what type of flu it was or how the outbreak had
succeeded in infecting so many students.
Local health officials were currently trying to identify the flu strain,
Xinhua said. The temperatures of some of the students reached 39.6 C, it
said. The sick students were quarantined, while school officials, under
directions from provincial health authorities, cancelled classes and began
disinfecting the university's 2000 dormitory rooms, dining halls and
classrooms, it said. Most students were only hospitalized for about 3 days
and released, the report said, adding that only several dozen students
remained hospitalized as of today [2 Apr 2006].

Henan authorities refuse to reveal cause of university flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
The Henan Department of Health has refused to reveal the cause of a
flu-like outbreak that has infected 400 students at a university in the
province.
Students at Henan University of Science and Technology, in Luoyang city,
started to become ill on 26 Mar 2006, many needing hospital treatment, as
many as 400 according to state media.
The Henan Department of Health said laboratory tests showed the infection
is not type A or type B influenza. Interfax asked vice director of the
disease control and prevention division of the Henan Department of Health,
Shan Xinguo, why so many students contracted the disease at the same time,
but he declined to give any details. He said, "What I can say is the
infection is now under control, and we can't give any further information."
Shan Xinguo said the students had contracted upper respiratory tract
infections. He said, "It's normal for students to have upper respiratory
tract infections, especially in spring. And at colleges, students are
concentrated, so it's easy for many students to become infected with the
disease at the same period of time."
Another official from the Henan Department of Health, who declined to be
named, said the situation is now under control, and the fever was starting
to pass. "The reason why so many students developed fever continuously
still remains unclear," she said. "We are still investigating the matter,
but we are sure the students are not victims of an epidemic influenza
infection." She said the main symptoms of the sick students were fever and
joint pains and that most recovered one or 2 days after medial treatment.
Shan Xinguo said the ill students had been quarantined and treated. Over
2000 dormitories as well as 130 classrooms are now being sanitized twice a
day. As of 2 Apr 2006, 10 students were still in hospital for clinical
observation.

Some 400 students at a university in central China have come down with a
mystery fever, and the cause was under investigation, state media said
yesterday [3 Apr 2006].
The 1st case was reported on 26 Mar 2006, when 22 students at the Henan
University of Science and Technology in the city of Luoyang fell ill, the
official Xinhua News Agency said on its website.
"The situation has been effectively controlled," Xinhua said. "After one or
2 days of treatment, they regained their health."
Lab tests have ruled out the possibility of an outbreak of influenza, it
said, and the health officials were still trying to determine what the
sickness was and what had caused it. Aphaluck Bhatiasevi, a spokeswoman for
the Beijing office of the World Health Organisation, said a letter had been
sent to the Health Ministry asking for more information.
One student's fever reached 39.6 C, it said. Several others also suffered
from aching bones, it said.
The students were quarantined and treated, and the surrounding dormitories
and classrooms were disinfected, the report said.

[Laboratory confirmatory data are pending. A sudden occurrence of massive
feverish contagious disease in a cluster of patients at this time of the
year -- the end of winter and the beginning of spring -- is quite
mysterious. As clinical information is largely deficient, any speculation
at this moment is futile.
