serum prophylaxis, which is 53 percent of those with registered tick
bites. Of those who sought medical assistance 39.02 percent were
adults. 88.5 percent of children with tick bites received serum
prophylaxis. [Immunoglobulin against tick-borne encephalitis is
manufactured in Russia from immunized horses. - Mod.NP]

[3] TBE in Kemerovo Oblast

2 fatal cases of TBE in Kemerovo Oblast
---------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the tick-borne encephalitis risk season --ï¿½ 10
Apr 2007 -- 26 573 inhabitants of the Kemerovo Oblast have sought
medical treatment, including 5539 children. According to Valentin
Sokolov, head of the Kuzbass Rospotrebnadzor office, 30 935 people in
the year 2006 had sustained tick bites by 12 Jul, including 6373
children.
During the past week 606 people have sought medical treatment for tick
bites. This is less than during the same week in the previous year
(1167 in 2006). The season of infection passed sooner, however, and it
also started sooner than usually. The peak of infection occurred from
21-27 May 2007, then it declined, Sokolov said. Rains and cold weather
limited visits to wooded areas and risk of tick-bite.
There have been 533 admissions to hospitals on suspicion of tick-borne
encephalitis (635 in 2006), including 33 admissions during the past
week [9-13 Jul 2007]. At total of 56 cases have been laboratory
confirmed and 2 people have died. Sokolov considered the supply of
serum in the region as sufficient, despite shortages in some places.

[The reports of new cases of tick borne encephalitis infection and
deaths continue to come from Russia. The epidemic now embraces 50
regions of Russia and the number of affected exceeds 30 000 people.
The number of tick bites [reported] has decreased but cases of
tick-borne encephalitis are not diminishing. During July [2007] 2
deaths have been registered in Kemerovo. All this is happening against
the background of global shortage of specific immune globulin, which
helps to prevent infection and improve survival. It should be
reasonable to improve the supply of the immune globulin. - Mod.VM]
[Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), also known as Central European
encephalitis or Russian spring-summer encephalitis, is a flavivirus
infection of the central nervous system. The two most important
genotypes of tick-borne encephalitis virus are the European and Far
Eastern genotypes, transmitted by the hard ticks _Ixodes ricinus_ and
_I. persulcatus_, respectively. Human infections are acquired through
bites of infected ticks or, rarely, by ingesting unpasteurized dairy
products primarily from infected goats, sheep, or cows.
A comprehensive update on tick-borne encephalitis viruses and the
availability of vaccines can be found in the "CDC Health Information
for International Travel 2007-2008," handbook which is available
online at:
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/ybToc.aspx>.

It is clear that the risk of tick-borne encephalitis virus infection
extends throughout the length and breadth of Russia. - Mod.CP]
