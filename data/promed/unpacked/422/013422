While the title of ProMED-mail post 20120325.1080432, "Chronic wasting disease, cervid - USA (05): (VA, WI)," indicated chronic wasting disease was in both Virginia and Wisconsin, the 2nd article clearly states it was in Missouri, NOT in Wisconsin.

We regret the error and appreciate our sharp reader, Ellen Hooker, for pointing this error to us. - Mod.TG
