FDA Continues to Receive Complaints About Chicken Jerky Products
----------------------------------------------------------------
More than a year after warning consumers about a possible link
between certain chicken jerky products imported from China and
illness in dogs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to
receive complaints from pet owners and veterinarians claiming these
products are making dogs sick. In addition, the University of Sydney
is currently investigating an association between illness in dogs and
the consumption of chicken jerky after recent complaints in
Australia, and one Australian firm has recalled their chicken jerky
product, which the company says was manufactured in China.

In a statement released Friday afternoon, the FDA says that "the
continued trend of consumer complaints coupled with the information
obtained from Australia warrants an additional reminder and animal
health notification." To date, no definitive cause has been
determined for the reported illnesses. The FDA and several veterinary
diagnostic laboratories in the United States continue to perform
extensive chemical and microbial testing but have yet to identify a
contaminant in the products.

The FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken
jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the
following signs which may occur within hours to days of feeding the
product: decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume
the treats to the exclusion of other foods; decreased activity;
vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; and increased water
consumption and/or increased urination.

If the dog shows any of these signs, owners stop feeding the chicken
jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are
severe or persist for more than 24 hours. Urine and blood tests may
be consistent with Fanconi syndrome. Although most dogs appear to
recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that have died.

Suspected cases should be reported to the FDA. To find the number for
the FDA district office consumer complaint coordinator in your region, visit

The AVMA is monitoring the situation and will provide updated
information on our Web site (<http://www.avma.org>) as soon as it
becomes available. Like all information on our Web site, we will only
post information that is credible and has been confirmed.
