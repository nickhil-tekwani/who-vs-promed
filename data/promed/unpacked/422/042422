New anthrax case in Logan County
---------------------------------------
There has been one new additional confirmed case of anthrax in a cow on an adjacent premises to the index ranch in Logan County, the Colorado State Veterinarians Office announced on Wed 22 Aug 2012.

There are now a total of 4 premises that have had anthrax-positive cattle. The original case was diagnosed on 8 Aug 2012.

Important facts of the outbreak:
1. None of the affected herds have recently sold cattle and therefore no animals from affected herds have entered the food supply;
2. All of the adjacent herds have been vaccinated for anthrax -- some of the herds will be receiving their 2nd dose of vaccine in the near future;
3. Anthrax vaccination is an important tool in preventing disease although full protective immunity is not achieved until 7-10 days after a 2nd, booster, dose is administered;
4. All of the affected cattle that have died have been incinerated to kill the spores and buried which is the most effective way of disposal;
5. Cleaning and disinfection of the affected premises, equipment, and corrals continues;
6. The Northeast Colorado Health Department (NCHD) has been working with livestock owners and others who may have been exposed to receive prophylactic treatment;
7. The CDA and the NCHD are continuing their investigations, surveillance, and monitoring of the outbreak in coordination with other support agencies and entities;

Remember, there is a 42 day withdrawal period after using the vaccine and use appropriate personal protective equipment when handling possibly anthrax-infected carcasses or contaminated material.

For information related to the anthrax outbreak, contact the State Veterinarian's Office at CDA.

[I would not be surprised if that is the last case in this series of outbreaks. It is about a week since the previous 2 cases on 2 other ranches, and everything has been vaccinated at least once. Sterne vaccine takes 8 days to kick in with good immunity.

All involved in bringing this under control so efficiently are to be congratulated. - Mod.MHJ
