Clinicians and microbiologists at the Central Hospital in Abu Dhabi are
investigating an illness that has killed one butcher and has left another
struggling for his life. Unconfirmed reports indicate that it could be a
viral "haemorrhagic fever" transmitted to the butcher by a parasite [tick].
The hospital has refused to comment on both the cases, labelling them as
"classified," until the results of tests are known. Blood specimens have
been sent to the UK for laboratory analyses. Asked if he could confirm the
cases as haemorrhagic fever, a physician said: "It's not clear as yet,
there could be lots of other reasons."
Dr Talat Mahmood Butt, Managing Director of the Talat Medical Centre, said
the viruses which cause haemorrhagic fever can only be transmitted through
blood infection. He said the public should not be alarmed, and should not
associate the virus to the consumption of meat.
Both patients were working in the same slaughterhouse where goats and sheep
are slaughtered and [then] supplied to the city's butchers. [The report
goes on the quote various butchers and their various and incorrect
hypotheses about the etiology of these illnesses, which must not be all
that uncommon if they have formed hypotheses. Dr. Butt was reported as
having attributed the disease to something transmitted by "tiny insects,
like mosquitoes and lice, which live in sheep and goats' wool, suck the
blood of their hosts and become carriers when they bite humans." - Mod.CHC]
The report continues by quoting Dr. Butt as having said that "Yellow fever
and other haemorrhagic fevers are normally found in African countries, so
it's a must for tourists and other travellers to get vaccinated as a
safeguard before travelling". [ProMED-mail not responsible for this non
sequitur. - Mod.CHC]

[This is a pretty squishy report, what with authorities dancing around two
patients with hemorrhages and fever and not wanting to call them
hemorrhagic fever cases. In some countries, refusing to comment on disease
cases has been found to be very useful in simplifying epidemiologic reports.
The comment attributed to Dr. Butt regarding transmission only via blood is
not at all correct if these illnesses are due to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (C-CHF) virus, which can be transmitted by infected ticks, by blood
from infected patients or infected cattle, or by aerosols of infected
blood. Someone at WHO should contact the Abu Dhabi authorities and fill
them in on etiology, transmission mechanisms, and necessary safety
precautions. If these cases are due to C-CHF virus, there likely will be
additional, perhaps nosocomial, infections. - Mod.CHC]
