4 more British tourists have been admitted to hospital after an
outbreak of a gastric virus [norovirus] on a River Rhine cruise. That
makes a total of 8 passengers who have not been able to travel home,
tour operator River Cruise Line said. The "Lady Anne" is docked at
Boppard, around 60 miles west of Frankfurt, Germany after the spread
of norovirus [infection].

The illness causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting and can cause old
people and young children to become dangerously dehydrated. A total
of 20 people were initially taken to hospital over the incident, with
another 20 being treated on board the ship.
The captain of the "Lady Anne" alerted authorities after a number of
passengers began suffering vomiting and diarrhoea.

River Cruise Line, which is based in Market Harborough,
Leicestershire, England, said in a statement: "Our passengers, crew
and staff on board the "Lady Anne" are now able to get off the ship,
and doctors have confirmed that they are fit to travel, and we are
making arrangements for them to return home. We will be arranging for
a doctor to accompany our passengers during the journey to
Folkestone. Our senior colleagues who went out to the ship will be
staying to support the crew of the "Lady Anne" and oversee the cleaning
of the vessel, which will be taking place as planned. We would like
to again express our gratitude for the excellent work of the German
paramedics and offer our apologies to all those directly and
indirectly affected. Our 1st priority has always been our passengers
and their welfare. This incident has obviously had a serious impact
on their cruise, and, with this in mind, we will be providing our
passengers with a full refund."

The passengers, who were on a 5-day "turkey-and-tinsel" trip, are due
to set off on 2 coaches soon, the company's managing director Kevin
Riley said.

[Another instance of the vulnerability of passengers confined on a
cruise ship to norovirus infection. Accessing the above URL will
provide an image of the river cruise ship the "Lady Anne". The rather
more confined condition on a small river vessel compared to an
ocean-going liner is likely responsible for the large number of
casualties and the severity of their illness.
