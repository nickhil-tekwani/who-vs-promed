Anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota for the 1st time this year
[2009]. A total of 5 yearling calves were lost in a herd of 250
unvaccinated animals in Corson and Dewey Counties.

Anthrax is a very serious quarantinable disease because it can cause
the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time.
Often, animals are found dead with no illness detected. Strict
enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of
carcasses from cattle suspected to have died from anthrax is
important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

Producers should consult their veterinarians and vaccinate their
livestock, if deemed appropriate. "It would make good sense to
continue to vaccinate cattle and other livestock in the area for the
next several years," states Dr. Dustin Oedekoven, State Veterinarian.

Dr. Oedekoven reports that anthrax spores survive indefinitely in
contaminated soil and that much of South Dakota has the potential of
experiencing an outbreak. Significant climate change, such as
drought, floods, and winds can expose anthrax spores to grazing
livestock. Alkaline soils, high humidity and high temperatures
present conditions for anthrax spores to vegetate and become
infectious to grazing livestock.

[A news report is available at:

to the above official report. Corson and Dewey are adjoining counties
in north central South Dakota. - Mod.MHJ]

RE: Anthrax confirmed in death of SD cattle
-------------------------------------------
The current outbreak has affected 5 yearling heifers (about 16 months
old) out of 250 head that were pastured on the site of a previous
outbreak in 2005. These animals were not vaccinated, despite
recommendations to do so.

Anthrax was suspected by the herd veterinarian, who submitted samples
to the state veterinary diagnostic lab prior to notifying me, so the
Navy test kits were not employed in this case.

[Many thanks to Dustin for this valuable and quick reply to my
request for information. Obviously these 5 heifers grazed together
and found that one place with contaminated soil from 2005. - Mod.MHJ]
