Vesicular stomatitis [VS] has spread to livestock in 2 more Colorado counties: Weld and Conejos. Vesicular stomatitis has been reported in horse, mule and cattle herds at 70 locations in Colorado, according to the Colorado Department of Agriculture. There were cases in 53 locations a week ago. The counties reporting cases are Weld, Larimer, Archuleta, Chaffee, Conejos, Delta, La Plata, Mesa, Montezuma and Montrose.

VS is a disease that can cause oral blisters and sores and make it painful to eat or drink, according to state veterinarian Dr Keith Roehr. "We are closing in on the fair and show season, and we want to remind livestock owners to practice vigilant disease mitigation practices to protect their animals," said Roehr.

The clinical signs of the disease include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, teats, and above the hooves of susceptible livestock. Roehr said the virus is not very contagious from animal to animal. "The primary method of spread is through insect vectors, primarily biting flies," Roehr said.

[This report says livestock and then mentions horses and mules. It is not clear whether only horses and mules are involved or whether there has been spread to other animal species, such as to bovines.

Owners should remember:
- Strict fly control is an important factor to inhibit the transmission of the disease.
- Avoid transferring feeding equipment, cleaning tools, or health care equipment from other herds.

How vesicular stomatitis spreads is not fully known; insect vectors, mechanical transmission, and movement of animals are all factors. Once the disease is introduced into a herd, it may move from animal to animal by contact or exposure to saliva or fluid from ruptured vesicles. Humans rarely contract vesicular stomatitis, but they can become infected.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Humans can also become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. Vesicular stomatitis has been confirmed only in the western hemisphere. It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically.
