At least 3 people have died, and 3 others fell sick from rabies in
Narsingdi. A 45 year old man, his 12 year old son, and a 13 year old girl
of Darikandi village (under the jurisdiction of Kathalia Union at Sadar
Upazila) [died] midday on Sunday [28 Nov 2010].

The 3 [suspected cases] are 2 women aged 40 and a 12 year old. Narsingdi
civil surgeon Abdur Rashid said the 3 affected individuals have received
post exposure vaccination [If the 3 suspected cases are exhibiting signs
and symptoms of the disease, it is unlikely that vaccination will protect
them. - Mod.CP]. The 3 affected had been bitten by a cat, he added.

The Kathalia Union Parishad chairman told BDNews24 that financial aid had
been provided for treatment of the 3 affected people.

[It is unclear from this report when the 3 deceased victims had contracted
rabies virus infection and why presumably they had not undergone
vaccination. It is similarly unclear whether the 3 people now receiving
treatment had been bitten by the same cat or another animal.

Narsingdi is a district in central Bangladesh. It is located 50 km north
east of Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. It is a part of the Dhaka
Division and is the only district in Bangladesh that does not depend solely
on agriculture. It can be located in the map at
