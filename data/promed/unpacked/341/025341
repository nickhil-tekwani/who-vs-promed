Members of a rural Walker County family took home 2 baby raccoons found in a Baldwin County attic, unaware that one of them had rabies, according to information from state veterinarian Dee Jones.

A baby raccoon taken from the attic of a Baldwin County home, transported to rural Walker County, and later found to be infected with the rabies virus has resulted in the exposure of more than 20 people, who likely will have to endure a regimen of rabies preventative vaccines. Those exposed to the disease -- 14 people in Walker County and as many as 9 in Baldwin -- may be required to undergo regimens of rabies shots, he said.

The situation, Jones said, shows the dangers of taking in "cute, cuddly raccoons."

Dana Johnson, district rabies biologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Montgomery, said that the exposure of more than 20 people marks the largest such case in his 8 years in his position.

He said it was good that the other baby raccoon, as well as 2 littermates, tested negative for the virus. "Still, it might be that it's just not active, that it hadn't reached the brain where it could start shedding itself," he said.

Also of concern is that an infected raccoon was taken to an area of the state where raccoon-variant rabies is non-existent, Johnson said.

The raccoon strain afflicts some regions of Alabama but not others. For example, it occurs in Baldwin County but is very rare in Mobile County, and is found on the eastern side of the Coosa-Alabama river system but not on the western side.

"We believe the river systems act as a natural barrier," Johnson said.

He said, "Walker County has never had a case of raccoon variant rabies, but it could have been introduced for whatever reason if either of these raccoons had made it into the wild."

State law makes it illegal to transport wild animals anywhere in Alabama or to keep certain wild animals as pets.

When Johnson became aware of the rabid raccoon on Wednesday [20 Jun 2012], he contacted U.S. Department of Agriculture agent David Beatty in Bay Minette and state conservation Capt. Kenneth Blalock in Spanish Fort.

Beatty and Baldwin conservation Sgt. Henry Lowery were able to quickly track down the 2 littermates still in Baldwin, one in Elberta and the other in Summerdale.

According to Lowery, John A. Thorpe of Bon Secour found 2 of the baby raccoons in a neighbor's attic about a week ago, then located 2 more a short time later. Lowery said the mother raccoon was supposedly killed on the highway.

Thorpe eventually gave one raccoon each to Chris Moore of Elberta and Deena Townsend of Summerdale and 2 to Charles Stanley Barnett of Summerdale. Thorpe, 55; Moore, 27; Townsend, 43; and Barnett, 60, received conservation citations charging them with unlawful possession of a protected animal, Lowery said.

In turn, Barnett gave his raccoons to visiting family members, including grandchildren, who transported them to their home in the Double Springs community of Walker County. The community is located within the borders of the Bankhead National Forest.

Within days, one of the raccoons became sick, and the family took it to a local veterinarian, who suspected it could be rabid.

The Walker County Health Department was contacted. After the raccoon was euthanized, its head, where the active rabies virus would be concentrated in the brain, was forwarded to the state public health diagnostics lab in Montgomery.

The positive test result was confirmed Wednesday [20 Jun 2012].

Said Jones: "It's bad, but it could have been much worse. There has been a lot of work done over the past 2 days making sure the people who were exposed to this rabid raccoon will get the vaccine they need. ... But we wouldn't have had anyone working on it if those raccoons had been left alone. There are rabid raccoons in Baldwin County, and people just need to stay away from them."

[Rabies is a fatal disease. Very few people have lived after exposure to this virus. Exposure can occur through both bite and non-bite exposure, such as through saliva entering a scratch or through the mucus membranes of the eye.

It is not uncommon with baby animals for them to be passed around to friends and family members exposing many individuals. However, everyone should be aware that rabies can and does occur in infant animals as well as adult animals.

Rabies post-exposure vaccinations consist of a dose of human rabies immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine given on the day of the exposure, and then again on days 3, 7, and 14. The vaccine is given in a muscle, usually in the upper arm. This set of vaccinations is highly effective at preventing rabies if given as soon as possible following an exposure.

If a person has previously received post-exposure vaccinations or received pre-exposure vaccinations, only 2 doses of vaccine (on the day of exposure and then 3 days later) are needed. Human rabies immune globulin is not required. Your doctor and local health department will be able to guide you through the process.

For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.

The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving pre-exposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore, you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities.
