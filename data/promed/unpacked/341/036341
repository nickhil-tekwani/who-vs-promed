Diphtheria has infected at least 120 people since early November 2017, and this will only worsen if health facilities don't get the fuel they need. At least one million children are at risk of contracting the disease if vaccines and medicine continue to be denied entry, according to the World Health Organization.

Stevenson [Shane Stevenson, Oxfam's country director in Yemen] said: "The longer the blockade continues, the more people need our help, but the less help we are able to offer. The international community cannot be allowed to turn its backs on the suffering in Yemen."

[The WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean reported on 19 Nov 2017: "Starting from 14 Aug up to 8 Nov 2017, a total of 118 suspected cases of diphtheria including 10 associated deaths were reported from 10 governorates in the country. According to the geographical distribution of cases, Ibb governorate has been worst affected, with 87 per cent of suspected cases reported from this governorate (https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Epi_Monitor_2017_10_47.pdf )." (Please see ProMED-mail post Diphtheria - Yemen: fatal 20171116.5447646.)

Most cases occurred in the 8-week span between epidemiological week 37 and 44. (Please see graph of suspected diphtheria cases reported in Yemen by epidemiological week at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Epi_Monitor_2017_10_47.pdf). This total number of suspected cases included 10 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 8.5 per cent); Ibb governorate accounted for 9 of the deaths (CFR 8.7 per cent). The above report apparently adds another 120 cases in the past 3 weeks to that previous total. - Mod.ML
