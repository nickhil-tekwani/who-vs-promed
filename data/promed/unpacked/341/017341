I expect you'll recall that the circumstances described by Erias [Mbuwa district, Papua Province, Indonesia chief Erias Gwijangge] are exactly what happened when Nipah first turned up in Malaysia in 1998 and Bangladesh in 2004.

In both instances, the combination of rainforest logging and drought drove fruit bats out of their favored forest habitat, into proximity to pigs, in order to feed on the fruit waste from village markets that forms a significant part of the diet of Southeast Asia pigs raised outdoors in rural areas.

Soon thereafter, Nipah began killing both pigs and people.

[ProMED-mail thanks Merritt Clifton for his excellent suggestion. A thick haze has engulfed many areas of Indonesia, including Papua, where it is suspected to be due to forest fires in the southern part of province (http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/732314/haze-crisis-spreads-with-hot-spots-found-in-papua).

Nipah virus was first isolated and identified in 1999 during an outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore. Transmission of Nipah virus to humans may occur after contact with infected bats, consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with infectious bat excretions, infected pigs, or infected people. Infection mainly causes encephalitis, but some patients have a respiratory illness during the early part of the infection (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/nipah/index.html). However, the news report did not mention a neurologic component to the illness. A more detailed description of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua occupy the western half of the island of New Guinea; the Independent State of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern half. Papua Province is the largest and easternmost province of Indonesia and is divided into 28 regencies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_(province)). The outbreak is occurring in the Mbuwa District of Nduga Regency of Papua Province.
