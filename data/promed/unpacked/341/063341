The Andalusia Department of Health confirmed an outbreak of Q fever in Villaverde del Rio [province of Seville, Autonomous Community of Andalusia] that affected 17 people. Q fever is a [zoonosis] transmitted to humans through the air, never from person to person, by inhalation of these organisms from air contaminated mostly by excreta [of infected animals].

The disease, with an incubation period of 10 to 40 days, produces high fevers and headaches, can affect organs such as the liver and, in severe cases, lead to pneumonia, but it has a low mortality and can be treated with antibiotics.

In Villaverde, the rumors that resulted from lack of information have it that more than 100 people are affected; however, the health department gives assurances that only 17 have been affected by the disease, and the clinical evolution of all of them has been favorable. Moreover, the Junta [government] says that the incubation phase has passed, and currently there are no confirmed cases. The origin of the fever was located in a cabin of goats, which was isolated.

However, other sources indicate that at least 3 people with very similar symptoms have been admitted in the Virgen Macarena Hospital, but the diagnosis of Q fever is not as yet confirmed. Among them is a 44 year old man, a barber by trade, who as of yesterday [29 Apr 2013] remained in the ICU.

Magdalena Martin, PP [Popular Party] spokesperson in the Municipality of Villaverde, asked that the local authorities and the Junta release the necessary information to reassure the residents.

[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of a biphasic developmental cycle. Q fever is a zoonosis. Domestic ungulates such as sheep, cattle, and goats serve as the reservoir of infection for humans. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is distributed worldwide with the exception of New Zealand. Q fever is primarily an occupational hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and abattoir workers in contact with domestic animals such as cattle, sheep and goats and for laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures and working with _C. burnetii_-infected animals (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). Sporadic cases occur in people living in urban areas that are downstream from farms or abattoirs where the organisms have become aerosolized. Occasional cases follow contact with farm animals or after contact with infected pets such as dogs and cats.

Q fever is diagnosed predominantly in Northern Spain, especially in the Basque and Navarra provinces, supposedly because of the greater cattle-raising activities in these areas (Maurin M, Raoult D. Q Fever Clin Microbiol Rev. 1999;12(4): 518-553. Available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88923/). A large number of cases have been also diagnosed in the Madrid area. Q fever most often presents as pneumonia in the Basque region in northern Spain, where Q fever is said to be the 2nd commonest cause of community-acquired pneumonia, whereas hepatitis is predominant in Andalusia in southern Spain. Most cases occur between March and July, corresponding to the peak in the lambing season.

Villaverde del Rio, with a population of 7614 in 2012, is a small city located in the province of Seville, the most populous province in Andalusia (http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&biw=1280&bih=598&q=villaverde+del+rio+seville). Andalusia, located in southern Spain on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, is the most populous and the 2nd largest area of the autonomous communities in Spain (see the map for the location of Andalucia at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Localizaci√≥n_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa.svg.
