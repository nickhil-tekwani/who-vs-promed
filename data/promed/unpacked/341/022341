USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is publishing a record of decision for the final environmental impact statement (EIS) on cattle fever tick fencing in southern Texas.

On 31 May 2018, USDA published the final EIS that discussed how to continue to protect US livestock from cattle fever ticks and the disease they cause, bovine babesiosis, which is severe and often fatal. The EIS found that the installation of wildlife fencing in strategic areas along the quarantine zone will create a minimally intrusive pest control measure that augments existing programs.

APHIS is now publishing the final record of decision and will begin working with property owners to install 8-foot-tall game fencing along strategic portions of the permanent tick quarantine line in Zapata County, Texas.

APHIS is taking these actions to protect the livestock industry and overall cattle health. The fences will help prevent potentially affected deer from travelling into unaffected areas. The fencing is designed to restrict movement of wildlife. The fencing will initially cover 2 miles, but if needed and funding is available, it could be expanded to cover up to 50 miles in Maverick, Starr, and Webb counties. The fencing will be paid for by APHIS, and the Texas Animal Health Commission will be responsible for ongoing maintenance.

[To quote my fellow veterinary moderator TG [see Texas cattle fever tick - USA: (TX) more quarantines, tick spread, archive no. 20170505.5014768],
"The Texas cattle fever tick represents a great loss to Texas. The recent spread of these ticks is quite concerning because of disease spread, quarantines, and a loss of animals and finances to the owner. This particular fever tick has plagued Texas for some time and was part of the history of Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine (http://vetmed.tamu.edu/about-us/history). Great strides were made against this pest. Then it rallied against the efforts to eliminate it from Texas.

It is a very expensive and time-consuming task to eradicate the carrier of this disease. In the 1940s, cattle were dipped in large vats with an arsenic-containing dip. Co-Ral is not an arsenic dip, but rather an organophosphate, which can inhibit cholinesterase. This chemical is a restricted-use pesticide, meaning special training and handling are required to use it."

Hopefully this wildlife fencing will make a significant difference in tick control. - Mod.MHJ
