2003/086 Results of surveys for potato bacteria in Germany (harvest 2002)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Germany recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the results
of the surveys carried out on the 2002 potato harvest for the presence of
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] and _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ [Rs] (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests). Results of the 2001
survey were presented in EPPO RS 2002/143.
1. Cms (ring rot)
In the potato survey of the 2002 production season, carried out on the
basis of Council Directive 93/85/EEC, a total of 17 049 samples (10 837
seed samples; 4920 ware samples) were tested in the laboratory for ring
rot. Samples were taken from seed potatoes (10 837 samples), ware potatoes
(4920 samples) as well as samples from gene banks, breeding material, and
potatoes in trade. Thorough analyses were carried out to trace back the
origin and relationship of infections. 4 ring rot samples (seed potatoes)
and 27 ware samples were infected with ringrot.
As in previous years, control measures according to Council Directive
93/85/EEC were taken. Regarding seed potato, the ring rot situation was
significantly improved in 2002 in all aspects (number of affected Federal
States, production sites, production, lots and cases) in comparison to that
of previous years. This may be attributed to application of harmonized
eradication measures and improved mutual information. Pest status: Present
in some areas at low prevalence; under eradication.
2. Rs (brown rot)
In the potato survey during the 2002 production season, carried out on the
basis of Council Directive 98/57/EC, 16 684 samples were tested for brown
rot. Samples were taken from seed potatoes (10 837 samples), ware potatoes
(4555 samples), from gene banks and breeding material, and from potatoes in
trade.
In 7 Federal States, 146 samples from watercourses were tested for
contamination with brown rot. 1 infected ware potato sample was infected
but no infected seed potatoes were found. Thorough analyses were carried
out in order to trace back the origin of infection, which could however not
be clarified. Contamination of watercourses was found at 4 sampling sites
previously found positive during the 2001 sampling. Pest status: transient,
single case; under eradication.

[Infection levels for each pathogen are low, and that is gratifying. For
Cms, 4 seed samples and 27 ware samples were infected in 2002 compared to
11 and 27 samples, respectively, in 2001. Total samples were 17 049 in 2002
and 16 985 in 2001. For Rs, no infected seed samples were recorded and only
1 ware sample was infected. Total samples were 16 684 in 2002 and 16 859 in
2001. - Mod.DH]
