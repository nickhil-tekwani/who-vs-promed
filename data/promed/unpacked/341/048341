A town of Salina resident is hospitalized in critical condition after being diagnosed with eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], according to the Onondaga County Health Department. It is the 1st human case of EEE in Onondaga County this year [2015].

The patient is an adult. Dr. Indu Gupta, the county's health commissioner, declined to disclose additional details about the case to protect the patient's privacy. She said her department was notified of the case late Monday [31 Aug 2015] by the state Health Department.

EEE is a rare, but serious viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The virus can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain. Initial symptoms, which usually start 4-10 days after the bite, can include fever, headache and vomiting. Illness can then progress to altered mental status, confusion, seizures, coma and even death. Those at greatest risk for infection are people who spend a lot of time outdoors, [with neurological cases occurring] especially in the very young and elderly.

Even though the mosquito population is declining, the health department said people need to continue using repellent and take other measures to avoid mosquito bites until the area experiences a hard frost.

Central New York is a hot spot for EEE, which kills about 1/3rd of the people infected [who develop neurological disease]. There have been 5 reported EEE deaths in New York state since 1971, all of them in Central New York.

The county has conducted aerial spraying of the Cicero Swamp twice this summer [2015] to combat mosquitoes. It has also been using insecticide to kill mosquito larvae in some mosquito breeding sites and catch basins.

[EEE virus is endemic along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Seaboard and as far west as the Upper Midwestern states of the USA. Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other mosquito species may act as bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamps into adjoining localities and transmitting the virus to humans and equine animals. Clinical cases in humans are very serious, with a case fatality rate of 33 per cent and significant neurological sequelae in those who survive the infection (see http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis). Although human infections are rare, it is prudent to follow the recommendations given above to avoid mosquito bites until killing frosts eliminate mosquito vectors and halt transmission. - Mod.TY
