A bacterial disease is the direct cause of a large fish kill on the
Ogeechee River, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)
announced Thursday [26 May 2011].

But the disease being fingered, columnaris, is only a threat to fish
when they're under environmental stress, and EPD has still not
pinpointed the cause of that stress. Humans are not known to be
affected by this bacterium.

State, federal and local agencies became aware of reports of dead
fish on the river late last week. A comprehensive sampling and lab
analysis of water, fish tissue and sediment began Sunday. The
investigation continues to try to pinpoint why the fish were stressed
enough to succumb to the bacteria. In the meantime, EPD continues to
advise citizens in Bryan, Bulloch, Chatham, Effingham and Screven
counties not to swim in or consume fish from the Ogeechee River until
further notice.

As a holiday weekend begins, the Blackwater river's legions of
swimmers, fishermen and boaters are sure to be disappointed. Dead fish
have been reported from Screven County, about a half mile below King
America Finishing Inc., a large textile factory, to Ga. 204 at the
Chatham-Bryan county border.

Ogeechee Riverkeeper Dianna Wedincamp wants more information. "It's
very disappointing because we (already) know that the fish are under a
lot of stress," she said. "We want to know what's causing the
stress."

The Riverkeeper organization is doing its own analysis of water,
tissue and sediment samples and is awaiting lab results.

"There's a ban on swimming or eating fish from Screven to Chatham, so
we know there are more issues," she said. "We're planning to get to
the bottom of that. We'll be on the river all day tomorrow [28 May
2011]."

[I am a little uncertain of the precise name of the organism. The
causative agent of columnaris is a bacterial organism that has had its
name changed from _Myxobacteria_ to _Flexibacter_ and may be now
called _Cytophaga_. However, some of the best references still list it
by older names.

A presumptive diagnosis of columnaris disease can be made by the
detection of long, slender gram-negative rods in smears of gills or
scrapings obtained from cutaneous lesions. Frequently, material
scraped from such lesions and examined under phase contrast microscopy
in a wet mount will reveal the presence of unique, characteristic
"haystack" colonies that are of diagnostic significance (Isolation of
the organism on cytophaga medium; Annacker and Ordal 1959).

Columnaris disease, caused by the bacterium _Flexibacter columnaris_
may result in acute or chronic infections in both coldwater and
warmwater fishes. It occurs both as external or systemic infections
that result in significant losses of hatchery-reared fish,
particularly at warm summer temperatures (Pacha and Ordal 1970; Becker
and Fujihara 1978).

Epizootics of columnaris disease frequently occur in natural
populations, and high losses of fish may be observed. Wood (1974)
describes strains of high and low virulence; highly virulent forms
attack gill tissue, and the latter strains are primarily responsible
for cutaneous infections. Some disagreements still exist concerning
proper taxonomic placement of this organism (Snieszko and Bullock
1976). However, Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology (8th
ed.) classifies it as a flexibacterium.

In many species of fish, the 1st sign of the disease may be the
appearance of discolored, gray, patchy areas in the area of the dorsal
fin. These characteristic "saddleback" lesions may progress until skin
erosion exposes underlying muscle tissue. These lesions may become
yellow and cratered and are often prominent in the mouth and head
regions (Wood 1979). Virulent strains of _F. columnaris_ may attack
gill tissue and cause a "gill rot" condition (Wood 1974). Systemic
infections due to less virulent strains may occur with no apparent
external signs. However, cutaneous infections seem to be more
prevalent in most species of fish.

Research has shown that _Flexibacter columnaris_ can be transmitted
from fish to fish directly through the water when virulent strains are
involved. Individual infected fish within a population harbor the
bacteria over winter (Wood 1974) and serve as sources of infection
during the following summer months when stresses occur due to
overcrowding and water temperatures above 12.2 C (54 F), etc.
Microcysts formed by _F. columnaris_ have been shown experimentally to
remain viable over a period of several years. Some uncertainty still
exists as to the possibility that these forms are sources of infection
under natural conditions (Wood 1979).

The period between exposure to _F. columnaris_ and the outbreak of
clinical disease varies depending upon the virulence of the strain of
bacteria and the ambient water temperature. Strains of high virulence
may induce acute disease within 24 hours, whereas less virulent forms
may require from 48 hours to several weeks (Warren 1981). Holt et al.
(1975) have shown experimentally that a high degree of correlation
exists between clinical disease and high water temperatures. Their
studies also revealed that host species differ in the time from
exposure to death. Existing data reveal that the disease has a
pronounced seasonal occurrence. Both natural and hatchery epizootics
are concentrated during the warm summer months.

In closed water systems, such as in a farm-raised situation or in
aquariums, there are several treatments. However, in an open water
system such as this, the treatment may be quite different.
