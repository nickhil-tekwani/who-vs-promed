Translation of information received at the OIE Headquarters on 29 Oct 2004
from Dr Luc Lengel�Chief Veterinary Officer, Animal Health and Animal
Products Department, Federal State Service for Public Health, Food Chain
Safety and Environment, Brussels:
2 avian influenza infected birds of prey from Thailand seized at Brussels
airport, Belgium
Follow-up report No. 1
Date of the report: 28 October 2004.
Further tests have been carried out by the Veterinary and Agrochemical
Research Centre (CERVA: Centre d'Etude et de Recherches V�rinaires et
Agrochimiques), the Belgian reference laboratory for avian influenza, to
determine the pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus isolated from two mountain
hawk eagles from Thailand seized at Brussels airport. The results are as
follows:
- The intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) is 2.92. This confirms that
the strain is highly pathogenic.
- The cleavage site of the H5N1 virus was sequenced. It was consistent with
that of the highly pathogenic avian influenza strains currently circulating
in Thailand (6 basic residues).
Following the tracing of birds that had passed through the customs
inspection centre during the at-risk period, the Federal Agency for Food
Chain Safety (AFSCA: Agence F�rale pour la S�rit�e la Cha�
Alimentaire) euthanised several batches of birds, notably:
- 2 parrots at the customs inspection centre;
- 200 parrots in a quarantine centre;
- 450 birds in another quarantine centre.
The euthanised birds were taken to the CERVA for further testing (RT-PCR
and virus isolation in embryonated eggs). All the RT-PCR tests were
negative for the H5N1 strain. The other tests are still in progress.

[It really is disconcerting that someone would attempt to smuggle birds
infected with the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (AI)
identified in this report, literally half way across the world. Anyone who
doubts the magnitude of challenges faced by animal and public health
officials should find out how many people were expecting the potential for
spread of the AI virus by means of smuggled mountain hawk eagles
(_Spizaetus nipalensis_) .
As pointed out earlier, smuggled birds are a well documented problem that
requires great efforts, sometimes in a losing cause, by animal health
officials stationed at international ports. Smuggled psittacines (parrots)
were the cause of the 1971 outbreak of Viscerotropic Velogenic Newcastle
Disease in Southern California in 1971, an outbreak that resulted in the
loss of somewhere around USD 65 million in 1971 dollars.
In this case, it is important to make sure that exposed shipments of birds
sent to quarantine centers in the Netherlands and Russia monitor those
birds carefully for any symptoms of avian influenza. It is indeed very
fortunate that those exposed birds are in proper quarantine centers rather
than dispersed in other countries.
The previous report (Avian influenza - Belgium ex Thailand: smuggled birds
(03) 20041029.2921) confirms that veterinarian who handled these birds got
sick, exhibiting conjunctivitis. His tear swab was negative for H5. He was
sent home with an antiviral drug, so unless there is a previous positive
test from the veterinarian, there may never be any definitive evidence for
an association of his symptoms with the strain reported here. - Mod PC]
