The Minisry of Health this [Wed 24 Jan 2018]) updated the information issued by the state health secretariats concerning the yellow fever situation in the country. In the monitoring period (Sat 1 Jul 2017 - Tue 23 Jan 2018) there were 130 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country with 53 deaths. In total, there were 601 reported suspicious cases with 162 still under investigation and 309 discarded during this period.

Last year [2017] from July 2016 to January 2017 there were 381 confirmed cases with 127 confirmed deaths. The yellow fever reports continue, since last year [2017], indicating the seasonality of the disease that shows, mainly, occurrence during the summer. In this manner, the period considered for analysis is from 1 July to 30 June each year.

"Now, the exposed areas this year [2018] are much larger and cover the large cities with the most concentrated population than last year [2017], and these numbers demonstrate that the situation this year [2018] is much better controled compared with last year [2017]," explained the Minister of Health, Ricardo Barros.

[Vaccination] campaign
A fractonal dose vaccination campaign against yellow fever will begin this [Thu 25 Jan 2018] in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The anticipated action was already taken by the Ministry of Health and now the inputs needed have already been passed along to both states. Currently, the vaccination campaign in Bahia state remains for the planned dates (between Mon 19 Feb - Fri 9 Mar [2018]).

In order to help the states and the municipalities to carry out the campaign, the Ministry of Health is sending the states R 54 million [USD 17.1 million]. Of this sum, there will be provided: R15.8 million [USD 5 million] for Sao Paulo, R 30 million [USD 9.5 million] for Rio de Janeiro, and in this allocation Bahia will be provided with R8.2 million [USD 2.6 million].

The adoption of vaccine fractionating is a preventive measure recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) when there is an intense increase in epizootics [disease in monkeys] of yellow fever, with the risk of expansion of the disease in cities with a higher population index. The fractionated dose provides the same protection as the full dose. Previous studies have demonstrated for at least 8 years and in new research continue to provide protection after this period.

The Ministry of Health, from 2017 to present, is sending to all federal units a quantity of approximately 57.4 million doses of the vaccine. For the states of Sao Paulo, Mionas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and Bahia, about 48.4 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine were sent, with the goal of intensifying a selective vaccination strategy with 18.3 million [doses] for Sao Paulo, 10.7 million for Minas Gerais, 12 million for Rio de Janeiro and 3.7 million for Bahia.,

It is important to inform [everyone] that yellow fever [virus] is transmitted by vectors (mosquitoes in 2 genera -- _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ in the forest environment). The last case of urban yellow fever was registered in Brazil in 1942; all confirmed cases since then resuled from the sylvan [forest] transmission cycle.

[The number of human yellow fever (YF) cases continues to increase somewhat. Cases in monkeys probably do as well. The vaccination campaigns are very ambitious but prudent, since new cases are occurring and there is ongoing evidence of circulation of the virus in the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. So far, there has been no evidence of _Aedes aegypti_ transmission of this virus in an urban transmission cycle. The vaccination campaign is an effort to prevent that from happening. One hopes that they will do follow-up studies on persistence of immunity following vaccination with the fractionated and the standard doses and track any adverse reactions to the vaccine.
