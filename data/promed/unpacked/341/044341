Federal officials say the number of dead harbor seals [_Phoca
vitulina_] found on beaches in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts
in the past several weeks [September-October 2011] is nearing 100, yet
the cause remains a mystery.

Meddy Garron, regional marine mammal stranding coordinator for the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Thursday [13 Oct
2011] the count is now up to 94 since 1 Sep 2011. Most of the dead
mammals are considered young.

Biologists are awaiting results of necropsies to determine a cause.
Investigators have ruled out foul play and lack of food and are
focusing on determining whether disease is the cause. A spokesman for
the New England Aquarium tells the Portsmouth Herald
(http://bit.ly/qfN9RC) biologists have sent samples of tissue,
blubber, muscles and almost every organ for testing.

The number of dead seals washed up on the New England coast is not the
only thing expanding, a spokeswoman from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday [18 Oct 2011]. The area in
which the seals are showing up is also increasing.

Maggie Mooney-Seus, a public affairs official for NOAA's [National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Northeast Region, said the
number of dead seals found along the shoreline since 1 Sep 2011 is now
at 128. Last Friday [14 Oct 2011], the figure was 94.

"The distribution of where they're showing up is expanding," she
said.

Seals were 1st found on shores from northern Massachusetts to southern
Maine. But Mooney-Seus said more seals are now being found in southern
Massachusetts. All are considered to be "young of the year," she
said.

Mooney-Seus continued to emphasize the importance of leaving the
carcasses alone. She said people should not approach or touch any
marine animals, dead or alive. Disturbing a seal, or the carcass of a
seal, is a federal violation and can lead to a hefty fine or jail
time, she said.

In addition, people should try to keep their pets, namely dogs, away
from seals and seal carcasses. Mooney-Seus said there is potential for
a domestic animal to contract a virus from a seal. "I encourage people
to keep a safe distance," she said.

The cause of the surge in seal deaths has not yet been named.
Mooney-Seus said results won't be known until test results on blood,
tissue samples and the contents of the seals' stomachs come back.

At least one expert said the cause of the seal deaths has less to do
with pathogens in the animals and more to do with contaminants in the
water.

Dr. Susan Shaw, director and senior scientist at The Marine
Environmental Research Institute in Maine, has been investigating Gulf
of Maine harbor seals and their exposure to toxic contaminants for
almost 2 decades.

Shaw said her findings have shown that polychlorinated biphenyls,
flame retardants, dioxins and other persistent pollutants found in
seal tissue could be compromising their immune systems.

The problem, according to Shaw, is that tests to identify contaminants
aren't performed right away, and often not at all, because of the cost
of conducting such tests.

"The role of contaminants as a factor should be at the front of the
list," she said. "But these studies take longer and can cost more."

Having done her own tests on harbor seals over the years, Shaw said
the ones found off the New England coast are the most contaminated in
the world. Shaw is not involved in the current testing and said she
compared her past results with testing done on the West Coast and in
Europe.

"These seals are loaded with hundreds of toxic compounds," Shaw said.

The contaminants are man-made and often find ways of seeping into the
ground and into rivers and streams, eventually finding a way into the
ocean, she said.

Shaw said there have been many "die-offs" over the years. She said
they go unexplained often because the proper testing for contaminants
is not done.

"I believe that contaminants need to have a role in these studies,"
Shaw said.

[Contaminants might be the cause of this episode, but it is worth
noting that there is no mention of other species affected. Some past
harbor seal die-off events on the US East Coast were caused by phocine
distemper virus. These outbreaks were documented mainly in winter and
spring. Affected animals appeared non-emaciated, but there was not an
obvious age pattern. The test results will certainly shed some light
on this event. Portions of this post were extracted from:
