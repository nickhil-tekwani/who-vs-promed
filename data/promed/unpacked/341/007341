Farmers in Lancashire are concerned about a new foot and mouth disease
(FMD) hotspot, which emerged over the weekend, only 20 miles from a cluster
in North Yorkshire. In the past week 7 cases have been reported around the
town of Clitheroe -- near to the town of Settle, where there are now 31
confirmed cases. The National Farmers Union (NFU) says the new outbreak is
particularly worrying because there have been no cases in the area for 5
weeks. There is also concern over 2 new cases in Cheshire, the first in the
county for over 6 weeks.
Epidemiologist Professor Roy Anderson said the 2 new mini hot spots in
Settle and Clitheroe had "probably" been triggered by the movement of
farmers and their vehicles. He said, "It seems probable, although not
absolutely certain, that movement of farmers and vehicles and such, have
resulted in these 2 mini-outbreaks... ...it is very important to maintain
rigorous measures of control and restrictions of movement not only of
animals but farm vehicles, through to the very end of this epidemic."
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) officials said [that 14
of the first 20 cases in the Settle area were linked by the movement of
people or licensed movement of livestock. All licensed movements in the
area have now been stopped. The source of the Settle outbreak is believed
to have been in sheep at a local farm but MAFF is investigating how the
infection entered the animals.
Officials say it is too early to determine the cause of the latest
outbreaks in Cheshire, although no links have yet been established with
other cases outside the county. The disease was first confirmed on Sunday
at Fir Tree Farm at Crowley, near Northwich, and another case was found on
Monday at Crowley Hall, High Legh, near Knutsford. The developments are a
serious setback, coming just days after the county council, on the advice
of MAFF, reopened 90 per cent of Cheshire's 7000 footpaths and rights of way.
A new case of FMD was also confirmed in Devon on Monday, the first in the
county for more than a week.
