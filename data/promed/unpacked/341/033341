Chefs failing to read the labelling on boxes of Korean oysters have been
blamed for hundreds of cases of food poisoning at a rugby test match at
Auckland's Eden Park last month. About 352 people developed
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis resulting in nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea, stomach cramps, fever and chills, from eating the oysters, a
report released by Auckland Regional Public Health Service today said.
The report said the caterers ran out of New Zealand-reared oysters and
served the imported ones, which they believed were safe to eat raw.
Although labelling on the packaging indicated the oysters should be cooked,
this was not heeded by the chefs preparing them.
The Eden Park Trust board today publicly apologised to patrons poisoned
during the 2nd test between the All Blacks and Ireland. "The incident has
been clearly identified as a product issue. Our caterers, Michael O'Brien
Catering, purchased oysters for the event from a leading New Zealand food
supplier. They have accepted responsibility for the incident and will be
offering compensation to affected patrons," trust spokesman Murray Reade said.
New Zealand Food Safety Authority spokesman Gary Bowering said oyster
imports from Korea have been put on hold until the authority was satisfied
they were safe. "We have asked the Government to suspend imports until we
have confidence in the Korean Government's processes of certification. That
is the standard international approach for incidents like this."
The report also revealed that subsequent to the Eden Park outbreak there
were 2 further foodborne illness incidents implicating imported Korean
oysters. One was in Porirua and involved 3 cases with confirmed norovirus
infection and one was in Auckland where there was a case with symptoms
consistent with norovirus infection. The latter involved consuming oysters
from the same batch as those implicated at Eden Park.
The report said that the [other?] 2 cases involved "carpet bag" steaks
where the steak was stuffed or garnished with lightly cooked oysters.
"These outbreaks suggest that even with a cooking process, the risk of
infection may still be significant and also that in the absence of a
consumer level recall potentially preventable cases of norovirus
gastroenteritis will continue to occur."

[Noroviruses have become associated predominantly with outbreaks of
sudden-onset gastroenteritis (designated "winter-vomiting disease" in the
northern hemisphere), particularly in circumstances where groups of people
from diverse backgrounds are brought together in close proximity (e.g.
cruise ships, hospitals, care-homes, schools, etc.). In these situations
the virus is spread by person-to-person transmission. However, outbreaks of
norovirus-associated gastroenteritis can also be a consequence of fecal
contamination of food or water, and food-borne outbreaks are not uncommon.
Contaminated shellfish are major causes of norovirus-associated
gastroenteritis, with bivalve molluscs (oysters, mussels, and cockles)
being the most common source. These animals are filter-feeders and can
become infected where there is discharge of untreated sewage.
Filter-feeding shellfish are a source of infection because they are often
consumed partially cooked or raw. Heat treatment at normal cooking
temperatures would destroy infectivity. Contamination of filter-feeding
shellfish is not restricted geographically. The present outbreak features
importation of oysters from Korea into New Zealand, whereas in the past
infection has been transmitted in the reverse direction from northern
Europe (Ireland) to Hong Kong (see: ProMED-mail post "Norwalk-like virus,
oysters - Hong Kong ex Ireland 20020331.3850"). - Mod.CP]
