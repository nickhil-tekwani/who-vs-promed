Additional FMD case found in central South Korea
------------------------------------------------
South Korea confirmed one more case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
on Tuesday [15 Feb 2011] as quarantine authorities pushed ahead with
the 2nd phase of nationwide vaccination of pigs and cattle. The case,
at a pig farm that raised 2000 animals in Daejeon, brings the total
number of officially confirmed FMD outbreaks since late November 2010
to 147, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
said.

It is also the 1st confirmed case in the city, located 160 km (100
miles) south of Seoul in the central part of the country.

"All animals showing FMD symptoms will be culled and buried, with
nearby farms to be checked for sick animals," a ministry official
said.

The latest outbreak comes after all 13 million head of cattle and
pigs in the country were inoculated as of late January 2011, but not
all have been given a 2nd vaccine shot that can enhance resistance to
the virus. Authorities plan to complete the 2nd round of vaccinations
on local livestock by the end of the month, which could help stem
further outbreaks.

Since the 1st FMD outbreak was detected, Seoul has destroyed more
than 3.33 million head of cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and deer. Losses
are estimated at more than 2 trillion won (USD 1.7 billion).

Measures to fight FMD contamination put in place
------------------------------------------------
Monitoring devices with automatic sensors will be installed at the
disposal sites of animals culled because of FMD as a part of
government efforts to manage snowballing health and environmental
concerns.

Minister of Public Administration and Security Maeng Hyung-Kyu,
Minister for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Yoo Jeong-bok
and Minister of Environment Lee Maan-ee jointly held a press
conference yesterday [15 Feb 2011] announcing the government's
comprehensive measures to prevent environmental damage from the mass
culling of farm animals. Concerns about soil and water contamination
have grown as many culled animals were buried hastily around the
nation since the outbreak last November [2010].

According to the government, there were 4632 disposal sites
nationwide as of yesterday. Basic surveys of the sites will be
completed by the end of the month, the government said, adding that 40
teams of 160 government and civilian experts will participate in the
inspections. Automatic sensors will be installed at all burial sites.
The sensors will issue warnings of contamination leaks. Underground
water surveys will also be conducted at 3000 wells located within a
300-meter-radius (one-tenth of a mile) of burial sites. Microbial
tests were also ordered for disposal sites located near the upper
streams of drinking water sources. The tests will also be done at
sites with a high risk of leaks.

The government also decided to provide funds to expand drinking water
pipelines to prepare for possible contamination of underground water.
A task force of public servants and environmental and geological
experts will also be formed to keep an eye on the sites nationwide for
3 years. Construction of underground barriers to contain the spread of
pollutants will also be completed by the end of next month, the
government said. Urgent surveys conducted at 188 sties near the
Nakdong and Han rivers have already found problems at 83 sites.

"We will make the environmental management of the disposal sites the
top priority in order to make sure that people will feel safe," said
Maeng. "We will thoroughly inspect each and every site around the
nation to prevent any environmental contamination."

[The contamination of ground water by the mass-burial of culled
animals is mainly related to public health though the possible spread
of FMD virus, affecting animals, has not been excluded; further
studies will be helpful. A useful 2004 paper, "Carcass Disposal: A
Comprehensive Review" by the Kansas State University, is available at

<http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/handle/2097/662>.
It includes the chapter "Burial" by Abbey Nutsch and Mark Spire, at
<http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2097/662/18/Chapter1.pdf>.

FMD virus is discussed on pages 39-40. - Mod.AS]
