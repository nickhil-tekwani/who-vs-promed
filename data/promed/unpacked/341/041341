Three newly published studies in Open Forum Infectious Diseases detail COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021, including one describing an increase in US hospital deaths during a community surge, one finding a rise in the risk of dying at home in North Carolina, and one showing a reduced risk of hospital death in New York City in the 2nd pandemic wave.

US hospital deaths amid community surge
---------------------------------------
In the 1st study, University of Texas researchers assessed death rates in 416 962 adult COVID-19 patients at 229 US academic and 432 community hospitals in the Vizient Clinical Database before and during a community case surge from September 2020 to March 2021. [Bela Patel, Robert E Murphy, Siddharth Karanth, et al., Surge in Incidence and COVID-19 Hospital Risk of Death, United States, September 2020 to March 2021, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 2022, ofac424, https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac424]

The unadjusted proportion of deaths among hospital patients released from the hospital was 9% before and during the surge, spiking to 12% when cases peaked and then declined. Relative to before the surge, the risk-adjusted odds ratio for death during the period of rising cases was 1.14, peaking at 1.37 and then falling to 1.30 as cases declined.

The surge-related increase in hospital deaths was observed in 7 of 9 geographic areas and was higher in community hospitals than for academic centers. "The similarity of the pattern across settings suggests shared factors contributed to elevated risk," the researchers wrote. "One possible explanation is that limited bed capacity shifted admitting preference to the most severely ill."

They added that the link between community COVID-19 surges and in-hospital deaths could not be explained by differences in demographic, clinical, or hospital characteristics.

"These data support healthcare policies aimed at containing pandemic surges to prevent case overloads for hospitals, public health and public policy efforts to provide supplemental manpower and capacity support to hospitals at risk of surge overload, and standardized hospital surge strategies," the authors concluded.

Hispanic, Black people hardest hit
----------------------------------
The 2nd study, by University of North Carolina researchers, entailed examination of state death certificate data on in-home deaths due to COVID-19 or any cause from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Dec 2021. [Jessie K Edwards, Wohl David Alain, Dying at Home Due to COVID-19, Open Forum Infectious Diseases, 2022, ofac439, https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofac439]

Of 22 646 COVID-19 deaths, 1771 (7.8%) occurred at home. The cumulative risk of dying at home of COVID-19 rose from 3.3 per 100 000 people on 31 Dec 2020, to 13.0 per 100 000 on 31 Dec 2021.

The cumulative rate of at-home COVID-19 death among Hispanic people was 9.9 per 100 000 people, compared with 2.3 per 100 000 among their White peers at the end of 2020 (difference, 7.6 per 100 000). At the end of 2021, COVID-19 home death rates were 19.0 and 11.4 per 100 000 people among Hispanic and White people, respectively (difference, 7.6).

Rates of home deaths were also higher among Black people than among their White counterparts (difference, 5.6 per 100 000) at the end of 2021. While home death rates from any cause rose overall, they were highest among Hispanic people.

"These findings suggest perennial barriers to care prevent those with progressive COVID-19 from accessing medical attention and the need for initiatives that extend healthcare access for those disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 to prevent avoidable death," the researchers wrote.

Role of hospital strain on death rate
-------------------------------------
In New York City, Columbia University Irving Medical Center researchers analyzed the clinical and demographic data of COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital during the 1st wave of the pandemic (March to August 2020) and the 2nd (August 2020 to March 2021).

The 4631 patients had lower overall and 30-day rates of in-hospital death or release to hospice during the 2nd wave (14% and 11%, respectively) than during the 1st (22% and 21%, respectively). The reduced death rate during the 2nd wave persisted after adjustment for potential confounders. Adjustment for the volume of COVID-19 hospitalizations, an indicator of health system strain, explained the between-wave difference in death rates.

Risk factors for death in both waves included high viral load, do-not-intubate status, and the need for supplemental oxygen and intensive care.

"This work suggests that increased in-hospital mortality rates observed during the 1st epidemic wave were partly due to strain on hospital resources," the researchers wrote. "Preparations for future epidemics should prioritize evidence-based patient risks, treatment paradigms, and approaches to augment hospital capacity."

[2] North Korea: cases
Date: Thu 25 Aug 2022
Source: Alarabiya [edited]
http://english.alarabiya.net/coronavirus/2022/08/25/North-Korea-reports-new-fever-cases-after-self-declared-COVID-19-victory-


North Korea's state media reported 4 new fever cases Thursday [25 Aug 2022], saying they were suspected of being infected with the "malignant epidemic" -- just 2 weeks after the country declared victory over COVID-19.

The isolated nation, which has maintained a rigid blockade since the start of the pandemic, confirmed an omicron outbreak in the capital Pyongyang in May [2022].

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- who also fell ill during the outbreak -- declared victory over the virus earlier this month [August 2022] and ordered the lifting of the country's "maximum emergency epidemic prevention system" as officially reported cases fell to zero.

But 4 new fever cases were recorded in Ryanggang province -- which borders China -- on [23 Aug 2022], the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, citing data from the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters.

Authorities "immediately locked down the area where fever cases occurred and at the same time urgently mobilized rapid mobile anti-epidemic teams and rapid diagnosis and treatment team," KCNA said.

They are also "taking measures to probe into the cause of the fever outbreak," it said.

North Korea refers to "fever patients" rather than "COVID-19 patients" in case reports, apparently due to a lack of testing capacity.

It has recorded nearly 4.8 million "fever" infections and just 74 deaths for an official fatality rate of 0.002%, according to state media. It has reported no new cases since [29 Jul 2022], until now.

Experts, including the World Health Organization, have long questioned Pyongyang's COVID-19 statistics and claims to have brought the outbreak under control.

North Korea has one of the world's worst healthcare systems, with poorly equipped hospitals, few intensive care units and no COVID treatment drugs, experts say.

It is not believed to have vaccinated any of its 25 million residents, although it may have received some vaccines from China, Seoul-based specialist site NK News has reported.

Pyongyang has blamed the outbreak on South Korea and warned of "retaliation".

[3] Prediction of long term sequelae

Citation: Eleni Gavriilaki and Styliani Kokoris. COVID-19 sequelae: can long-term effects be predicted? The Lancet Infectious Diseases. 25 Aug 2022
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on all aspects of human activity worldwide(1). Despite the positive effect that vaccination, anti-viral treatment, and monoclonal antibodies have had, unmet clinical needs still exist such as early prediction of patients who will develop severe COVID-19 or sequelae.

Given the worldwide impact of COVID-19 and the uncertain long-term sequelae, better understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition is of utmost importance. Similar to severe COVID-19, endothelial dysfunction might be commonly associated with COVID-19 sequelae. Persistent dyspnoea has been associated with lung damage and impaired lung function, and SARS-CoV-2 has been persistently detected in post-mortem lung tissue(2). Fatigue, as a part of COVID-19 sequelae, does not seem to be associated with autonomic dysfunction, although SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in endothelial cells(3). SARS-CoV-2 particles have also been documented via electron microscope in penile tissue samples, suggesting a link between COVID-19 sequelae and erectile dysfunction(4). In accordance with the observed vascular damage, endothelial dysfunction, detected by the gold-standard method (i.e. flow-mediated dilatation), has been reported after COVID-19 recovery. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was an independent predictor of flow-mediated dilatation impairment(5). Increased inflammatory response, oxidative stress, proinflammatory cytokines, and impaired mitochondrial function have been also described in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 sequelae(6).

COVID-19 sequelae have been characterised as long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome(7). No established criteria for this diagnosis exist. Patients have a variety of symptoms, involving multiple organ systems. These symptoms have not been attributed to other causes, except for previous COVID-19 disease. Studies in this field are scarce. Almost 90% of COVID-19 survivors have developed sequelae, including not only general symptoms such as fatigue but also severe neurological, cardiac, renal, or respiratory manifestations(8). SARS-CoV-2 infection has been also associated with long-term changes in brain structure according to a UK Biobank study(9).

In this context, the study by Jeremy Werner Deuel and colleagues(10), reported in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, explores sequelae after SARS-CoV-2 infection in young adults (median age 21 years [IQR 21-23]). Deuel and colleagues did a longitudinal cohort study of 501 mainly young male adults (464 [93%]) undertaking a comprehensive test battery designed to evaluate physical and psychosocial outcomes after COVID-19. All participants at the time of the study had not received a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine and were members of the Swiss Armed Forces. Increased BMI, dyslipidaemia, and decreased physical endurance 6 months after COVID-19 were suggestive of a higher risk of developing metabolic disorders and possible cardiovascular complications. These findings might support the hypothesis of endothelial dysfunction as a primary driver of COVID-19 sequelae. Obesity, dyslipidaemia, and low physical activity are known risk factors for future cardiovascular complications, characterised by endothelial dysfunction. Cardiovascular risk factors can be modified through lifestyle changes and medications. More importantly, novel vascular and biochemical markers have been discovered over the last decade that can better predict cardiovascular risk(11).

In conclusion, although no accurate prediction models exist for who will develop severe COVID-19 or sequelae, risk factors of vascular damage have emerged as important predictors. Large and high-quality studies are needed utilising multidisciplinary teams not only from different medical specialties but also from computational scientists that could suggest novel predictive models for the development of COVID-19 sequelae.
