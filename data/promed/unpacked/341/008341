MERS-COV (18): SAUDI ARABIA, ANIMAL RESERVOIR, CAMEL, VACCINATION, COMMENT

Transmission from dromedaries to humans has been documented but it is rare. The low incidence of transmission from camels to humans has several reasons. Only young dromedaries with no or low maternal antibodies to MERS-CoV are susceptible to an infection and the virus is excreted only for 8 days. Additionally, as mentioned in ProMED-mail, these young dromedaries are reared with their mothers for a year and have no or very little contact with their care-takers. Also, only less than 1 percent of the infected calves display nasal discharge.

Yes, vaccination age is crucial for protection and, as in all animal species, depends on the level of maternal antibodies and development of the calf's own immune system. Some calves have maternal antibodies against camelpox up to 8 months and any vaccination during this time would be useless. Consequently, all camel calves should be either serologically tested or repeated vaccinations must be given.

[Prof Wernery kindly submitted to ProMED-mail a comment on 26 Jan 2016, which said: "95 percent or even more adult dromedaries have antibodies against MERS-CoV and are immune against the disease, and no virus is found in this age-group. Only a very small number of dromedary calves, after the maternal antibodies against MERS-CoV have disappeared, may be infectious. This is the age group which should be vaccinated."

ProMED-mail's commentary in the said posting (see 20160126.3966528) included the question: "What is the age group (of the dromedary calves) which should be vaccinated?" This has been followed by Prof Wernery's current observations, which are gratefully acknowledged.

In the meantime, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health Command Control Center (CCC) has published, in its weekly monitor report of 26 Jan 2016 on MERS-CoV, its warning that there is public health risk associated with contact with camels, especially juvenile camels less than 2 years of age (available via http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/Pages/Weekly-Monitor.aspx), and the Ministry of Agriculture notified the OIE officially about the diagnosis of MERS-CoV in camels (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=19654)

The camel vaccination issue remains to be followed when new data become available. - Mod.AS
