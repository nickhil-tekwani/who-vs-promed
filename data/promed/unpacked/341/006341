Infected bull bison is from Ted Turner's ranch

BUTTE - A spokesman for media mogul Ted Turner confirmed Wednesday
that a bull bison on the Snowcrest Ranch in the Upper Ruby Valley, in
southwestern Montana, tested positive for brucellosis last month.

Russ Miller, general manager for Turner's western ranches said the
bull bison was the only animal from the herd that tested positive for
the disease. He said the animal was destroyed.

Miller said the ranches were open about the infection and encouraged
the Montana Department of Livestock to release the information about
the ranch. "We had one positive animal on the ranch and we tested the
entire herd," Miller said. "It's not unexpected when you're in the
designated surveillance area (for brucellosis), which was created for
a reason."

Last month state veterinarian Marty Zaluski announced that a bull
animal on a Madison County ranch had tested positive for the disease,
which can cause females [bison, cattle, elk] to abort their young.
Zaluski would not release the species of animal or the location of the
ranch other than to say it was in Madison County. He was complying
with a law passed by the 2011 Legislature that requires the state to
keep information confidential [that would] reveal specific ranchers
found to have an animal with the disease .

The Montana Standard challenged Zaluski to release the information,
but had not received a reply as of Wednesday.

Miller said the Snowcrest performed 1,698 tests for brucellosis on the
ranch and the bull was the only one that came back positive. He said
they are confident the disease was transmitted by elk. They are
testing to confirm that using modern methods that can help identify
the source.

"It's not unanticipated; the state would confirm that is an area with
a higher expectation because of elk," he said. "I don't think we or
any of our neighbors are immune to further incidents of brucellosis."

Last year the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks began a
study of brucellosis in Ruby Valley elk. Biologists found that 12 of
100 cow elk captured tested positive for exposure to the disease.

The lone bull bison that tested positive does not trigger a loss of
Montana's brucellosis-free status by the federal government, said Eric
Liska, brucellosis program veterinarian with the Montana Department of
Livestock. Under the rules of the designated surveillance area (for
brucellosis), the Snowcrest Ranch is under quarantine.

That means any livestock taken off the ranch must be hauled in a
sealed trailer and taken directly to slaughter, Liska said. The ranch
is barred from selling livestock to other ranches.

Liska said the new rules for ranchers within the surveillance area
give them options to manage their herd and prevent further infections
without causing the entire state to lose its brucellosis-free status.
He said the adjoining properties will be required to test all their
animals.

The Snowcrest Ranch will need 3 negative tests of all its animals to
have the quarantine lifted, Liska said. "They'll be under quarantine
until we're confident a release of quarantine is safe for the industry
of our state and the industry of the United States as well," he said.

[Indeed Montana confirmed the animal positive in mid-November 2011
[ProMed-mail post 20111118.3396]. However, since the state released
little information, it was speculated to be a beef herd, not a bison
herd.

One has to wonder if this bull was hanging out near cow elk, or if
predators, coyotes, foxes, or wolves have managed to drag a placenta,
or perhaps an aborted calf, through the area and thus infect different
pastures or provide the bull with opportunity to investigate the
placenta.
