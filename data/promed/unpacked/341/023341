High take-all infections found in cereal trials
-----------------------------------------------
Root evaluations at HGCA [Home Grown Cereals Association] Recommended
List second cereal trial sites across the country have highlighted a
major build-up of take-all infections for the 2nd year in a row.

Averaging 61 on a 1-100 scale, the take-all index this summer [2008]
was the highest since routine assessments began in 2005. Severe
infections (indexing more than 60) were recorded on 63 percent of the
sites compared to 40 percent in last year's [2007] high take-all
season. "These results confirm that take-all has built up
substantially over the past season from the high levels of infection
recorded in our 2007 monitoring," said Monsanto agronomist, Rob
Plaice who co-coordinated the monitoring.

"While the wet summer once again enabled many crops with quite badly
compromised root systems to survive without excessive yield loss, it
also allowed the fungus to continue proliferating widely. What's
more, soils damaged by one of the most difficult harvests on record
and very wet seedbeds provide the ideal conditions for early take-all
development this autumn [2008]. So 2009 looks set to present a
particular disease challenge for second cereal growers."

Mr Plaice advises growers drilling wheat or barley as a second cereal
this autumn [2008] to use a seed treatment effective against take-all
as a matter of course unless the risk from the disease has
historically been very low -- regardless of variety or drilling date.
Delayed drilling alone is most unlikely to prevent serious damage
this season, he said.

[2] Phoma, light leaf spot, sclerotinia - oilseed rape
Date: Thu 25 Sep 2008

Increased phoma risk in oilseed rape
------------------------------------
Late drilling, small plants, unsprayed rape stubbles with lots of
volunteers [self-sown plants], and perfect conditions for spore
spread: It all adds up to a high-risk season for phoma in oilseed
rape. And light leaf spot is also likely to be a problem.

Phoma infections have already been found in emerged crops in Norfolk,
says Chris Cooksley of Bayer CropScience. Virtually everywhere will
have had more than 20 days with rain, which primes phoma spores for
release. Alternative dry and wet days after that trigger spore
release from stem cankers.

"Don't ignore the issue because plants are small and you can't see
lesions," says Patrick Stephenson, an independent agronomist from
North Yorkshire. "The risk is big." An early infection period will
probably need a split fungicide treatment to achieve control, says Mr
Cooksley.

Mr Stephenson says in his region, light leaf spot is also an issue,
particularly because in the Vale of York oilseed rape has increased.
Light leaf spot also needs 2 sprays, he adds.

Sclerotinia threat
------------------
Two more fungicide sprays are likely to be applied for sclerotinia
control. Last year [2007] was even worse, with the highest-recorded
incidence of sclerotinia since records have been kept, says Mr
Cooksley. "Even rape grown on virgin land was decimated by the
disease."

That means more growers are likely to go down the 2-spray route, says
Mr Stephenson. Timing is important for sclerotinia control, says
Nigel Godley of Bayer CropScience. "Ideally, you need to get on
within a few days of the infection period."

[Take-all is considered the most serious root disease of cereal crops
worldwide causing severe yield loss of up to 50 percent.
_Gaeumannomyces graminis_ var. _tritici_ causes the disease in wheat
and barley, different fungal strains affect oats, maize, and grass
species. Take-all symptoms may include rotting of roots and lower
stems, stunting, whitened seed heads, reduced tillering, and sterile
spikes. The fungus persists on crop debris in the soil, and volunteer
cereal plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management
includes fungicides and cultural practices. No wheat or barley
varieties exist with specific take-all resistance. Disease severity
is expressed as a take-all index (TAI), which is calculated as the
proportion of nodal root systems with symptoms.

The fungal diseases of oilseed rape mentioned are:

1. Blackleg, also called phoma stem canker, caused by _Leptosphaeria
maculans_. It is the most serious disease of oilseed rape and can also
affect other _Brassica_ hosts such as cabbages and turnip. Symptoms on
rape may include greyish lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, with stem
cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the crop. The
fungus is seed-borne and is also spread by wind and infected crop
litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often sprayed
with fungicides. Disease management includes
use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum,
fungicides, and planting of resistant cultivars. The pathogen is
extremely diverse with new strains evolving frequently.

2. Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the
fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In the UK, it has been reported to
cause considerable yield losses of oilseed rape of up to 1.5 t/ha.
Leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless
until lesions appear on older leaves. Developing pods are often
infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. LLS
is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer
oilseed rape, and vegetable brassicas. Disease management includes
varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, disease
monitoring, and timely fungicide applications.

3. Sclerotinia of oilseed rape is caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum_. This is a soil-borne pathogen with an extremely wide host
range. On oilseed rape, infected leaves collapse around the stem and
then stem lesions showing a typical bleached appearance develop.
Infections high on the stems result in contamination of the seed with
sclerotia (hard survival structures). The fungus can survive in soil
as sclerotia and is also spread by infected plant material,
mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. Risk of crop infection
depends on the previous disease history of a field as well as weather
conditions. Disease management includes cultural practices and
fungicide applications.
