Influenza update number 338
(based on data up to 17 Mar 2019)
----------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns. For more information on influenza transmission zones, see the link below:

Summary
----------
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity decreased overall.
- In North America, influenza activity appeared to decrease, with influenza A(H3N2) being the dominant virus followed by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
- In Europe, influenza activity decreased across the continent. Both influenza A viruses co-circulated.
- In North Africa, influenza activity was still reported in some countries.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with exception of some countries where activity remained elevated.
- In East Asia, although decreased influenza activity continued to be reported, increased detections of influenza A(H3N2) and B (Victoria-lineage) viruses were reported in the recent weeks.
- In Southern Asia, influenza appeared to decrease with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia, where influenza activity remained above inter-seasonal levels.

Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 115 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 4 Mar 2019 to 17 Mar 2019 (data as of 29 Mar 2019 03:30:56 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 176 726 specimens during that period. 43 084 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 39 652 (92 percent) were typed as influenza A and 3432 (8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 8769 (49.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 8795 (50.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 119 (5.1 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 2193 (94.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 18-21 Feb 2019 in Beijing, China. It was recommended that egg based quadrivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A(H3N2) virus to be announced on 21 Mar 2019*; a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). It was also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.

*In light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component has been postponed.

Source of data
-------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[The update above highlights the decrease in influenza activity in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with nearly equal percentages for influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 Pdm09 being reported. No novel influenza viruses were detected in the reporting period. - Mod.UBA]
