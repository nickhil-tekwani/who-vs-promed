Note from the editors: MERS-CoV -- the quest for the reservoir continues
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two papers in this last Eurosurveillance issue of 2013, one by Reusken et al. [see item 2] and one by Hemida et al. [see item 3], look into the potential animal reservoir for the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV). This virus, which emerged in 2012 and was reported for the 1st time in September 2013, has caused 163 cases and 71 deaths as of 2 Dec 2013. However, many questions remain on its origin, reservoir and transmission patterns.

The 2 papers investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against MERS-CoV and MERS-like CoV in a similar set of domestic livestock, namely camels, cattle, goats, sheep and chicken, in 2 different geographic hotspots in Jordan and Saudi Arabia, respectively, where the largest described clusters of MERS have occurred to date. The papers complement each other and support the authors' earlier findings that dromedary camels could be a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. The results presented now are compelling evidence that in the studied regions high proportions of dromedary camels are exposed to a MERS-CoV or MERS-like CoV already in their 1st year of life. Hemida at al. conclude that camels could be infected early in life, and Reusken et al. additionally raise the possibility that the serological reactivity early in life could be due to maternal antibodies.

While the presented studies confirm the potential role of dromedary camels as MERS-CoV reservoir, they do not support a similar role of other common domestic livestock in the affected regions in the Middle East. Neither of the 2 studies detected antibodies in chicken, cattle or goats. Although most tests in sheep were negative, one particular assay gave positive results in a few animals, and the authors stress that this needs further investigation.

While the papers in today's issue provide further insight into the possible animal reservoir, the primary source of MERS-CoV infections remains unclear and the link to humans needs to be elucidated further as exposure to animals has only been documented for a limited number of human MERS cases. We look forward to seeing more studies in the near future that will shed light on the as yet unknown characteristics of this disease that raised much attention among infectious disease experts in 2013.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) serology in major livestock species in an affected region in Jordan, June to September 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:

Between June and September 2013, sera from 11 dromedary camels, 150 goats, 126 sheep and 91 cows were collected in Jordan, where the 1st human Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cluster appeared in 2012. All sera were tested for MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) specific antibodies by protein microarray with confirmation by virus neutralisation. Neutralising antibodies were found in all camel sera, while sera from goats and cattle tested negative. Although 6 sheep sera reacted with MERS-CoV antigen, neutralising antibodies were not detected.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus seroprevalence in domestic livestock in Saudi Arabia, 2010 to 2013
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:

In Saudi Arabia, including regions of Riyadh and Al Ahsa, pseudoparticle neutralisation (ppNT) and microneutralisation (MNT) tests detected no antibodies to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in sheep (n=100), goats (n=45), cattle (n=50) and chickens (n=240). Dromedary camels however, had a high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies.

Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infected sera from cattle had no cross-reactivity in MERS-CoV ppNT or MNT, while many dromedary camels' sera reacted to both BCoV and MERS-CoV. Some nevertheless displayed specific serologic reaction profiles to MERS-CoV.

[As rightly indicated in the editorial note above, more studies are needed to elucidate animal-human links, as exposure to animals has only been documented for a limited number of human MERS cases.

In the meantime, the veterinary authorities remain with uncertainties in relation to precautionary measures to be applied. Saudi Arabia reported in its OIE notification of 28 Nov 2013 that "all animals [in the holding involved] were kept under observation and quarantine and all were apparently healthy." It will be interesting to note what was done there since.

The following extract from a Bahrain media report, dated 3 Dec 2013, may illustrate the dilemma of public and animal health authorities (thanks to ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall):

"The Prime Minister issued directives to the Ministry of Municipalities Affairs and Urban Planning to tighten control procedures on livestock and camels imported and to ensure they are free of diseases prior to allowing them into the country for the purpose of safeguarding the citizens' safety and protecting domestic livestock. He ordered the aforementioned Ministry to investigate 30 camels imported by a livestock trader from a Gulf State. In light of the information that Bahrain's Health Ministry received from a Gulf State's Health Ministry that stated that the camels were suspected to have been infected with coronavirus that they were immediately executed by the Municipalities Affairs Ministry. HRH Premier directed the Municipalities Affairs Ministry to take necessary legal action to suspend the said merchant's license until the investigation is completed" (see at http://www.bna.bh/portal/en/news/591367).

It may be assumed that similar dilemmas prevail in other countries in the region, prescribing the need for some advice from international authorities on possible elementary precautionary measures even at the current early stage of investigations, and underlining the urgent need for further studies. - Mod.AS
