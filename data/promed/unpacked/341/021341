The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has confirmed the country's 7th
case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. It is
the 1st case to be confirmed in humans in Cambodia in 2007.
The patient, a 13-year-old girl from Ponhea Kreak district in Kampong
Cham province, developed symptoms on 2 Apr [2007] and was
hospitalized the following day. She died on 5 Apr [2007]. Samples
taken from the girl have tested positive for H5N1 at the Pasteur
Institute in Phnom Penh.
Initial investigations into the source of the girl's infection
indicate the presence of sick and dead poultry in the village in
recent weeks and that she had consumed a sick chicken prior to onset
of symptoms. A team from the Ministry of Health, World Health
Organization (WHO), and the Pasteur Institute are following up with
close contacts of the girl and are conducting awareness-raising
activities in the area.
Of the 7 cases confirmed to date in Cambodia, all have been fatal.
