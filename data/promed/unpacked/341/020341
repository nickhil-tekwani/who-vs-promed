Reported Russian Actions Violate International Health Regulations
and Possibly Human Rights Norms
In an earlier posting, David Sencer argued that the reported Russia
actions barring Chinese nationals from crossing the border as part
of a cholera quarantine violated the International Health
Regulations (IHR). Below is a detailed analysis of how the
*reported* Russia actions violate the IHR and may also violate
international human rights norms.
Under the IHR, which are binding international law on Russia as a
member state of WHO, the measures provided in the IHR to
respond to disease outbreaks in other WHO member states are
the maximum measures applicable to international trade and travel
that a state may require for the protection of its territory against
the diseases subject to the Regulations (IHR, art. 23). The IHR
specifically apply to cholera outbreaks (IHR, art. 1) and establish
maximum measures that a WHO member state may apply to goods
and travellers coming from another WHO member state suffering
from a cholera outbreak (IHR, arts. 61-64).
China is a member state of the WHO and is also bound under
international law by the IHR. The IHR do not authorize a WHO
member state to prohibit nationals of other WHO member states
from entering its territory, even when those nationals are coming
from an infected area. Nor do the IHR authorize "tighter medical
control" on foreigners living within its territory or nationals returning
home from the infected area, both as reported done in Russia. The
IHR authorize actions justified on public health grounds. WHO has
long maintained that travel restrictions do not prevent the spread of
cholera (WHO Guidelines for Cholera Control, paras. 7.3 and
7.3.3).
In addition, Russia was under an IHR obligation to report the
cholera cases to the WHO (IHR, art. 2) and to notify WHO of the
health measures it was taking in response to arrivals from an
infected area in another WHO member state (IHR, art. 8.1). It is
not clear that Russia fulfilled these international legal obligations
either. China may refer Russia's violations of the IHR to the
Director-General of WHO (IHR, art. 93.1).
Reports of "tighter medical control" over foreigners may also raise
human rights concerns under the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which both Russia and China are
states parties. Under ICCPR article 12.1, everyone lawfully within
the territory of a state party shall have the right to liberty of
movement. This right may be limited for public health reasons
(ICCPR, art. 12.2), but the public health measure must satisfy four
criteria:
(1) the measure must be prescribed by law;
(2) the measure must be applied in a non-discriminatory manner;
(3) the measure must relate to a compelling public interest, such as
a significant infectious disease risk to the general population; and
(4) the measure must be necessary to achieve the protection of
the public, meaning that the measure must be (a) based on
scientific and public health information and principles; (b)
proportional in its impact on individual rights to the infectious
disease threat posed; and (c) the least restrictive measure
possible to achieve protection against the infectious disease threat
(UN, Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation
Provisions in the ICCPR, UN Doc. E/CN.4/1984/4).
The reported "tighter medical control" against foreigners and
Russian national returning from China may not satisfy these human
rights criteria because they may not, among other things, be
based on scientific and public health information and principles but
on irrational fears and discriminatory motives against foreigners.
