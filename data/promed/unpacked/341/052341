The Melaka [Malacca? government has ordered the immediate closure of 79
pig farms in Alor Gajah and declared their surrounding areas as disease
control zones following the detection of [antibody to Nipah virus at four
farms. Chief Minister Datuk Seri Abu Zahar Isnin said the four farms
confirmed to be affected [sic by Nipah virus had been placed under
quarantine, and the 27,700 pigs there would be culled. The disease control
zones cover areas within a 5-km radius of the farms. The farms ordered to
be closed are in Bukit Beruang and Paya Mengkuang, and have about 100,000
pigs.
He said no farmers or residients in these places were infected by the
virus, but the Health Department would step up its monitoring of the
situation.
The Nipah [virus antibody-positive results for the four farms were
received yesterday, but tests on blood samples from pigs in other farms in
the affected areas and in Melaka Tengah and Jasin districts were negative.
Abu Zahar said fresh blood tests would be conducted following the discovery
of the virus, and other animals [such as cows, goats and dogs would be
included in the tests.
He said the virus was believed to have spread to Melaka after people
smuggled in infected pigs from other states. Bukit Pelandok in Negri
Sembilan, the area worst hit by the Japanese encephalitis and Nipah [virus
epidemic, is only about 30 km from the Melaka border.
