[Vesicular stomatitis (VS) gets the attention of veterinarians
because it is often hard to distinguish from foot and mouth disease
-- both maladies cause extensive oral vesicles. In this case, there
is no worry of a misdiagnosis, because both horses and cows have come
down with the disease. Horses are not susceptible to FMD, and a
presumptive diagnosis of VS is possible when clinical signs manifest
in both species.
Many thanks to a very conscientious subscriber who got this article
from the French version of OIE website, when the English version was
inaccessible. - Mod.PC]
