5 more bird flu outbreaks
----------------------------
5 more bird flu outbreaks had been confirmed in Cambodia, doubling
the number here to 10, but they had been brought under control, the
Department of Animal Health and Production said today.
Test results from the latest samples taken from poultry in Siem Reap,
Kandal, and Takeo provinces on 21 Feb 2004 were released in the first
week of March and confirmed the presence of the deadly H5N1 virus,
department head Kao Phal said.
"I can now confirm that we have found 10 cases of bird flu so far in
the entire country," he told AFP.
Kao Phal also said that tests from more than 500 kg of poultry that
was seized last week while being transported without appropriate
documentation had proved clear of the disease.
"From 21 Feb 2004 until today there have been no more reported cases,
but we have not stopped our surveillance and checking. On the
contrary, we have improved our investigative activities to monitor
any outbreaks," he said.
Experts have expressed fear the disease may be more widespread in
Cambodia than has so far been reported, due to the kingdom's location
between Vietnam and Thailand, where a total of 23 people have died
from avian influenza.
7 Cambodians have been tested for the disease but all have been cleared.
The latest outbreaks bring the total tally to 2 in the capital, 3 to
the famed Angkor complex, and 3 in Takeo, which borders Viet Nam.
Kao Phal said that 14 231 chickens had died from bird flu in the
kingdom, while more than 6000 birds had been culled.
Cambodian authorities have argued that they cannot undertake the mass
cullings that other countries have initiated to control the virus due
to most livestock being owned communally.

China urges other countries to lift poultry import ban
---------------------------------------------------
China called on other countries Wed, 17 Mar 2004, to lift import bans
on poultry and poultry products imposed out of fear of the bird flu.
"We hope that the relevant countries can respect the fact that China
has stamped out HPAI (high pathogenic avian influenza) and can lift
the ban on the import of poultry and poultry products from China,"
said Xia Hongmin, director of Department of Animal and Plant
Quarantine Supervision under the General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.
["Stamping out" is a clearly defined, severe measure required for the
effective eradication of animal diseases and the prevention of their
spread within countries and internationally. The following definition
is derived from chapter 1.1.1. "General definitions", of OIE's
Terrestrial Anima Health Code, 11th edition, 2003:
"Stamping-out policy means carrying out under the authority of the
Veterinary Administration, on confirmation of a disease, the killing
of the animals which are affected and those suspected of being
affected in the herd and, where appropriate, those in other herds
which have been exposed to infection by direct animal to animal
contact, or by indirect contact of a kind likely to cause the
transmission of the causal pathogen. All susceptible animals,
vaccinated or unvaccinated, on an infected premises should be killed
and their carcasses destroyed by burning or burial, or by any other
method which will eliminate the spread of infection through the
carcasses or products of the animals killed.
This policy should be accompanied by the cleansing and disinfection
procedures defined in the Terrestrial Code".

Xia made the remarks when briefing diplomats stationed in Beijing on
China's prevention of the HPAI.
China removed the last 2 quarantined areas -- Nanning in Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Lhasa in the Tibet Autonomous Region --
from isolation on Tue, 16 Mar 2004.
China confirmed its first HPAI case in Dingdang, South China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on 27 Jan 2004. By Tuesday, 48
countries and regions had taken measures to stop or restrict the
import of poultry and poultry products from Chinese mainland.
Noting the fact that China has effectively controlled HPAI, Xia said
his administration is willing to work with other countries and
regions to find avenues to resolve the problem.
He also said he hoped for co-operation with countries affected by the
epidemic to resume trade interrupted by HPAI. "The administration
will, as it has always done, seriously examine products to ensure the
safety and quality of poultry and poultry products exported from
China to protect the health of consumers in various countries," said
Xia.
Administration sources said that by Tue, 16 Mar 2004, 21 countries
and regions have gradually resumed or continued imports of some
poultry products, such as fresh eggs, cooked poultry products, and
tinned poultry meat.
Still, while declaring "an initial-stage success" in controlling the
HPAI, the officials and experts suggested that monitoring, preventive
measures, and caution against a relapse of the epidemic be continued.
According to Jia Youling, chief farming expert at the Ministry of
Agriculture, the migration of birds as the weather warms up, the fact
that the virus can be carried by some aquatic fowl, and the presence
of the epidemic in neighbouring countries and regions are all reasons
for continued watchfulness.
During a Tuesday conference, Vice-Premier Hui Liangyu echoed those
sentiments by saying that the public should still be on high alert.
Describing HPAI prevention as a long-term and arduous task, Hui said
that the success China has achieved does not mark an end to
prevention.
He called for continued epidemic monitoring and reporting, enhanced
animal quarantine supervision, and medical monitoring and prevention
to block the transmission of the disease to human beings.
Since the confirmation of the first HPAI case, China has slaughtered
nearly 9 million poultry, rendering a heavy blow to the industry.

Animal Health Special Report - Technical Consultations
------------------------------------------------------
a. Control Strategies for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in
Asia Incident Action Plan
The overall goal for response to HPAI is to detect, control, and
eradicate the agent as quickly as possible to return individual farms
to normal production and the Country to disease-free status. The
response target time to accomplish this goal should be 4 months or
less, as response efforts become more difficult to maintain after
such a period of time. Avian influenza may impact the abundance,
availability, cost, or safety of the Country's food supply, and the
ability to market agricultural products. Control and elimination of
avian influenza relies on 3 basic principles that make up the
operational components of a response:
1. Preventing contact between susceptible animals and HPAI agents is
accomplished by the following actions: quarantine and movement
controls, biosecurity measures, and epidemiologic investigations with
risk assessments, tracing, and surveillance.
2. Stopping the production of the agent by the infected animals. This
is accomplished using euthanasia and disposal of infected and exposed
animals.
3. Increasing the disease resistance of susceptible animals. This is
accomplished by strategic vaccination.
To accomplish the control of HPAI -- the following is a summary of
the specific recommendations discussed by the participating countries:
b. Organizational Approach to the Delivery of Control Strategies
Throughout the course of the presentations by both infected and
non-infected countries the need for cooperation across country
boundaries was a common theme. For any country's program -- be it to
eradicate the disease or remain free -- depends upon their
neighbours' success. For this reason it is imperative that the
following be implemented immediately:
1. A regional coordination group should be formed by FAO, OIE, WHO,
and the Central Governments of the countries in the region to allow
joint decision making and sharing of resources and information. This
group should establish goals and objectives of the regional plan in
sufficient detail to guide planning and operations.
2. Establish a Veterinary Task Force in charge of preparing emergency
control, contingency, and response plans [which] should include,
among others from other Agencies, individuals responsible for the
public health sector for consultation by these authorities.
3. Each Country will need to assess and further develop adequate
capacity within their veterinary infrastructure (human resources,
equipment, and laboratory supplies, to name a few) to accomplish the
recommendations contained in this report.
4. The development of emergency preparedness programs should be
completed to prevent the establishment of infection or reinfection.
5. A zoning approach to expand free areas while driving the disease
into smaller and smaller pockets is essential to control within the
region.
6. A regional laboratory network system needs to be established, as
the closest laboratory may be in a neighboring country. This would
also allow reagent production and sharing as needed.
7. Development of common educational materials for biosecurity and
public health should be completed and shared with [other countries
in] the region for translation and distribution across the region;
essential for biosecurity and containment.
c. Notification
1. International reporting standards of the OIE is essential to
establish confidence on the world stage of veterinary actions and
progress toward stated goals.
2. Additionally, the development and use of a format for common daily
situation reporting that can be used for internal planning purposes
is critical to continual evaluations of the program. This reporting
format should be simple but sufficient to demonstrate progress toward
goals.
c. Country Zoning/compartmentalization, Quarantine, Movement Controls
and Surveillance
The primary means of spread is by movement of infected birds,
materials, or means of transport. While each country has applied
quarantine and movement controls in known infected areas, adequate
surveillance may not have been conducted in what are thought to be
"free" areas. Participants also discussed the need for a coordinated
regional approach to eradication.
1. Poultry populations should be divided into 3 categories:
industrial commercial poultry, small commercial production, and
village poultry (subsistence farming and pet birds).
2. Countries should move to a system of zones based on populations of
poultry, geographic areas, or disease status with the aim of
developing free zones and recovery of export capacity.
d. Epidemiology
Given the unprecedented nature of the current disease outbreak, it is
inadequate on a global scale to allow a country-by-country
epidemiologic report. A regional epidemiologic study must be
conducted to assist in decision making and planning.
1. Resources should be made available to conduct an epidemiologic
assessment by international and local experts to develop a
descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the outbreak.
2. A molecular analysis of isolates should be conducted with the
assistance of the OIE/FAO/WHO reference laboratories to complement
the epidemiological analysis.
3. Support for research on disease transmission -- among other things
-- to help control the disease in the region.
e. Strategic Vaccination
A discussion of the use or non-use of vaccine followed a presentation
on the advantages and disadvantages of vaccines for avian influenza.
The generally acceptable summary of that discussion is that:
1. Vaccine is a valuable tool in the control and elimination of avian influenza
2. Vaccine alone is unlikely to lead to a successful eradication;
however, vaccination combined with stamping out and adequate
surveillance will likely lead to eradication in less time.
3. Strategic vaccination in birds, if accompanied by appropriate
surveillance, will reduce the amount of virus excreted and lead to
less viral exposure for humans.
4. Vaccine, if used, must be produced in accordance with OIE guidelines.
f. Stamping-out policy for infected poultry (including Valuation,
Disposal, Cleaning and Disinfection, Biosecurity, and Animal Welfare)
1. Infected and susceptible animals will be euthanized and disposed
of as soon as possible, but striving for the recommended time of
within 24 hours.
2. Susceptible animals and all suspect premises will be subject to
regular inspection and observation over 2 or more incubation periods
of the disease.
3. If resources are limited, premises will be prioritized so that
those with high potential for active spread of the agent are acted on
before those that do not have a high potential for active spread.
4. Depopulation should be accompanied by adequate and timely
compensation payment to owners of animals and materials requiring
destruction to prevent the spread of avian influenza.
5. A study should be conducted looking at alternatives to
compensation and analyzing the hazards, risks, and alternative
schemes for compensation.
6. Provide humane euthanasia methods for all animals to be euthanized.
7. Contaminated and potentially contaminated materials, including
animal carcasses, will be properly disposed of within 24 hours of the
destruction of the susceptible animals. Disposal will be done in a
manner that does not allow the avian influenza agent to spread, has
little to no effect on the environment, and conserves meat or animal
protein if logistically supportable from a biosecurity viewpoint.
8. All premises on which animals are euthanized and disposed of will
be required to be cleaned and disinfected.
9. Biosecurity procedures to prevent the spread of avian influenza
will be implemented within 24 hours of the identification of the
first presumptive positive premises
g. Wildlife Management
Massive killing of wild birds thought to be pests in the region lead
to massive famine and failed crops, since the wild birds in fact were
controlling crop pests more than being crop pests. Therefore wildlife
not only warrant protection due to aesthetic and cultural values, but
also because of the ecosystem "services" provided at very low costs
by animals and plants in the environment. As a result:
1. Wild birds should not be depopulated in an attempt to control
avian influenza but separation, as much as possible, should be
attempted.
2. Reducing contact rates between wild birds and large commercial
poultry operations to prevent wild waterfowl from direct or indirect
contact.
3. Village poultry health care programs, including possible
vaccination programs and certainly health/husbandry education, is the
best approach to 1) provide entree for surveillance operations, 2)
reduce disease incidence, 3) improve rural livelihoods, and 4) reduce
the threat or introduction of diseases into wild bird populations.
4. Ministries of Agriculture, as well as Ministries of Natural
Resources should limit the trafficking of wild birds, and ban the
mixing of domestic and wild animals in live markets.
5. Wildlife infectious disease surveillance programs, both in
semi-urban areas and in remote, rural areas may provide insights and
early warning about diseases circulating in the wild prior to
livestock outbreaks.
6. Investment in raising awareness and capacity building is needed to
allow more countries to begin integrating health monitoring programs
as they develop natural resource management efforts.
h. Rehabilitation
1. Plans to rebuild the poultry sector must be developed and
implemented to set the poultry industry in a more biosecure position
and protect livelihoods.
2. Establishment of educational programs for improved poultry
production should be started.

[This major HPAI epizootic seems to have peaked; its final
eradication, leading to resumed international trade in live avians
and poultry products, and the needed rehabilitation of the affected
countries, will require the support of the international community
and enhanced cooperation between all countries in the region. -
