A jump in Ross River virus cases in midwest Western Australia has prompted warnings from the WA [Western Australia] Country Health Service.

In April this year [2015], 16 cases were reported, compared to none during the same period last year [2014].

The disease is transmitted through mosquito bite.

Dr Marisa Gilles is urging locals and visitors to take precautions. She said mosquito numbers could be reduced by removing stagnant water around the home or campsites.

The health service said Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus could cause painful joints, aching muscles, tiredness, fever, headache, and skin rashes. These symptoms could last for several weeks and sometimes months.

The health service said people should try to avoid mosquito bites by:
- Avoiding outdoor exposure around dawn and dusk, especially the 1st few hours after dark.
- Wearing protective, long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing when outdoors.
- Applying a personal repellent containing diethyltoluamide [DEET] or picaridin to exposed skin or clothing. The most effective and long-lasting formulations are lotions or gels. Natural or organic repellents are generally not as effective as DEET or picaridin or need to be reapplied more frequently.
- Using mosquito coils and mosquito lanterns and applying barrier sprays containing bifenthrin in patio and outdoor areas around houses.
- Ensuring insect screens are installed and in good condition on houses and caravans.
- Using mosquito nets and mosquito-proof tents when camping.
- Ensuring infants and children are adequately protected against mosquito bites, preferably with suitable clothing, bed nets or other forms of insect screening.

Brisbane's freak storm has unleashed another wave of mosquitoes and prolonged the outbreak of Ross River virus. The onset of cooler weather has done little to stop mozzies spreading the disease [virus], which infects more than 80 people a week.

Brisbane City Council has carried out more mass insect spraying following the disastrous 1 May [2015] storm that caused widespread flooding in the southeast.

Nigel Beebe, a vector biologist from the University of Queensland and CSIRO, said saltmarsh mosquitoes, which transmit Ross River virus, had this year [2015] been blessed with perfect breeding conditions. "We've just had ideal rainfall," he said. "It's allowed mosquito populations to lift to a new level. It's been an unusual year for the Ross River virus [transmission]."

Dr Beebe said the mosquito explosion over summer and early autumn had coincided with high populations of other insects, such as butterflies and grasshoppers. "It's been a very good season for insects," he said.

Ross River virus has struck down more than 4645 people since 1 Jan [2015], which makes it the worst outbreak in almost 20 years.

A Queensland Health spokesman said the outbreak had been "cyclic" and had already peaked. "Due to the storm, some breeding sites in the Brisbane area have produced more mosquitoes," a spokesman said. "However, overall numbers of Ross River virus mosquitoes are reducing across the greater Brisbane area due to ongoing control measures and the onset of cooler weather."

The initial outbreak was triggered at the start of the year [2015] by torrential rain and kingtides, which flushed out saltmarshes along the Queensland coast.

Symptoms of Ross River virus include headaches, fevers, joint or muscle pain, rash and fatigue. The debilitating viral illness can cause patients to be bedridden for weeks. The effects of Ross River virus [infection], named after the river in northern Queensland where it was 1st identified, can continue to last for years.

[Ross River virus (RRV) infections occur sporadically across Australia. This has been a very active year for RRV transmission, with 6404 cases reported as of 25 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20150426.3322934). Especially hard hit has been Queensland state, where cases have been mounting, approaching 4000 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20150328.3262332) and now reaching 4645 cases reported above. Cases are occurring currently across the country in Western Australia, as indicated in the report above.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting these hot spots where transmission is occurring.
