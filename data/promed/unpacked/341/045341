Based on serotyping of the O antigen, _Vibrio cholerae_ is divided into 139
serotypes. _V. cholerae_ O1 and O139 are the serotypes that cause cholera.
_V. cholerae_ O1 is further subdivided into two biotypes: classical and El
Tor. Both cause cholera. The 5th and 6th pandemics were due to classical
O1. The seventh (current) pandemic is due to El Tor. At present it is a
rare event to recover a classical _V. cholerae_ from an individual with
cholera. Most have El Tor O1 or O139 (which is not biotyped). The two
biotypes have a number of differences. Clinically they both cause cholera.
El Tor strains definitely cause cholera gravis. To say that El Tor strains
due not cause classical cholera is a verbal end-run.

I'm writing regarding your question of whether on not El Tor cholera should
be considered "real" cholera or just another generic diarrhea. I'm
assuming that the term "classical" used in the posting refers to _V.
cholerae_ O1 classical, and that "El Tor" refers to _V. cholerae_ O1 El
Tor.
There have been 8 pandemics caused by _V. cholerae_. _V. cholerae_ O1
classical was the cause of the first 6. _V. cholerae_ O1 El Tor is
responsible for the 7th pandemic which continues today, and _V. cholerae_
O139 is responsible for the 8th pandemic, which also continues today.
To my knowledge, Bangladesh is the only place where _V. cholerae_ O1
classical is still regularly isolated, and even there it only accounts for
a small percentages of the cases.
Considering that _V. cholerae_ O1 El Tor, and _V. cholerae_ O139 have
almost completely displaced _V. cholerae O1 classical, and that _V.
cholerae_ O1 El Tor is responsible for pandemic cholera, it is difficult to
accept Thailand's position that _V. cholerae_ O1 El Tor is not "real"
cholera.
