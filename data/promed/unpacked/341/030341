I have been informed this morning (19 Aug 1999) that a community
in a remote part of Bolivia may have eaten meat from a rabid cow.
It was reported by a veterinarian that 3 cows had died or were killed
after showing clinical signs of rabies. The meat was salted and
dried in the sun and has been consumed; the meat was not
cooked. It is possible that at least 40 people may have eaten the
meat.
The veterinarian has reported today that in the area there are some
cows showing incoordination of the hindquarters. It is known that
there are vampire bats in this area and some cattle have bat bites.
The 3 cows that died had bite wounds on the neck. There have
been no samples submitted for laboratory diagnosis as yet due to
the remoteness of the area.
Myself and another veterinarian from UNIVEP will be travelling to
the area on Saturday to investigate the situation. A community
meeting has been arranged for Sunday evening as it has been
reported that many people in the area are "afraid".
If the cows had rabies and the meat was not cooked but salted and
dried in the sun and then consumed, is this population at risk?

I called the Meat Safety Assurance Agency, a division within the
Texas Dept of Health, for a correct answer. The response was, in
the United States the law says animals showing neurological
conditions are not to be consumed. In the event that a known rabid
animal (like a skunk) bites a cow and the cow is slaughtered in the
first 3-5 days before neurological signs appear then that is OK.
However, I inquired directly regarding the animals showing clinical
signs, and [people] needing the protein, food etc. The answer was:
*Thoroughly* [emphasis by Mod.JW] dried and salted meat should
present NO risk to the consumer since gastric acid should kill any
remaining virus that was not killed by salting and drying.
However, the real risk is to the processors -- those who cut up the
animal. Did they take off the head, did they cut out the spinal
cord? Those persons may be most at risk if the answer is yes.

I don't disagree significantly with the conclusions in the [previous]
reply. The meat (muscle) of an animal killed during clinical rabies
would not be expected to contain much rabies virus (although details of
the pantropism of the vampire bat variant of rabies virus in other
species are not thoroughly described). Consumption or other exposure
to CNS and salivary gland tissue would be another matter. The effect of
gastric acid is not so relevant, due to exposures that could occur in the
buccal cavity due to mucous membranes or existing lesions that could
be present in the mouth while ingesting the meat. *Thorough*
[emphasis - Mod.JW] cooking, or *thorough* salting and drying,
would certainly inactivate rabies virus, due to its labile character.
However, we would not recommend knowingly butchering or
consuming animals suspected of clinical rabies, or for that matter, those
that had demonstrated signs of any neurologic infection. I certainly
concur that the persons slaughtering and butchering these animals, and
particularly those that may have handled the CNS or salivary glands,
need careful evaluation for the need for postexposure management.
Our [NY State] recommendations for the use of tissues from an animal
known to be bitten by a rabid animal do permit slaughter and
consumption of the meat, providing the animal is killed within SEVEN
days of the EXPOSURE, and providing that liberal portions of the
exposed areas are discarded.
