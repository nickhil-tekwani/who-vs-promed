Neurodegenerative disease risk as new prion is discovered
---------------------------------------------------------
The 1st new human prion in almost 50 years has been discovered, a team of scientists report. The prion is called alpha-synuclein and it is believed to be the causative agent for a rare neurodegenerative disease in people.

Prions are types of protein that fold in unusual and complex ways. Some prions are, due to the way they are folded, able to replicate by instructing other proteins to misfold in the same way. The way that a prion replicates is similar to the way that a virus replicates and transmits. Despite the ability to replicate, prions are not classed as living entities. The term prion, which was coined in 1982, is an abbreviation for "proteinaceous infectious particle."

The 1st prion to be reported was termed "major prion protein" (abbreviated to PrP). This prion causes a range of diseases: transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), what is called "mad cow disease" by many in the media; scrapie in sheep; and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a type of human dementia along with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). To add to these there are other rare conditions that can affect people like Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia and kuru. All of these infectious diseases, which affect the brain, are untreatable and fatal.

To add to the knowledge of prions, a new type has been discovered. The discovery further supports the evidence that prions can cause neurodegenerative diseases.

The discovery came about after researchers were investigating a rare and fatal brain disorder called multiple system atrophy (MSA). Here sections of protein were taken from people with the disease and transferred into mice; the mice went on, after several months, to develop the disease. MSA is associated with the degeneration of nerve cells in specific areas of the brain.

The prion believed to cause MSA is termed alpha-synuclein. It is the 1st new prion to be discovered in half a century. In a research note, lead scientist Kurt Giles, from UC [University of California] San Francisco, stated, "Now we've conclusively shown that a new type of prion causes MSA."

The research has been published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [PNAS], in a paper entitled "Evidence for alpha-synuclein prions causing multiple system atrophy in humans with parkinsonism."

The good news is that the findings raise the possibility for developing treatments for MSA, which currently has no cure.

Expanding the prion disease repertoire
--------------------------------------
In 1982, Stanley Prusiner proposed that the infectious agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), a group of relatively rare neurodegenerative disorders that includes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and scrapie, lacks replicating nucleic acids and instead is composed primarily of a misfolded conformation of the prion protein, which he termed PrPSc. Originally, the "prion" hypothesis was met with considerable skepticism because it was difficult to envision how an infectious agent could replicate without a nucleic acid genome. However, a variety of biochemical and genetic experiments subsequently demonstrated the existence of infectious prions, eventually fulfilling Koch's postulates (3). It is now generally accepted that infectious prions replicate through the autocatalytic misfolding of a normal host protein (PrPC) into the PrPSc conformation.

In PNAS, Prusiner et al. (4) report findings suggesting that another molecule, alpha-synuclein, might also act as a prion in a human disease. [See companion article 10.1073/pnas.1514475112.]

[From the PNAS paper "Evidence for alpha-synuclein prions causing multiple system atrophy in humans with parkinsonism":

"Significance
-------------
Prions are proteins that assume alternate shapes that become self-propagating, and while some prions perform normal physiological functions, others cause disease. Prions were discovered while studying the cause of rare neurodegenerative diseases of animals and humans called scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, respectively. We report here the discovery of alpha-synuclein prions that cause a more common neurodegenerative disease in humans called multiple system atrophy (MSA). In contrast to MSA, brain extracts from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients were not transmissible to genetically engineered cells or mice, although much evidence argues that PD is also caused by alpha-synuclein, suggesting that this strain (or variant) is different from those that cause MSA.

Abstract
--------
Prions are proteins that adopt alternative conformations that become self-propagating the PrPSc prion causes the rare human disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). We report here that multiple system atrophy (MSA) is caused by a different human prion composed of the alpha-synuclein protein. MSA is a slowly evolving disorder characterized by progressive loss of autonomic nervous system function and often signs of parkinsonism; the neuropathological hallmark of MSA is glial cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of filaments of alpha-synuclein. To determine whether human alpha-synuclein forms prions, we examined 14 human brain homogenates for transmission to cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing full-length, mutant human alpha-synuclein fused to yellow fluorescent protein (alpha-syn140*A53T-YFP) and TgM83+/- mice expressing alpha-synuclein (A53T). The TgM83+/- mice that were hemizygous for the mutant transgene did not develop spontaneous illness; in contrast, the TgM83+/+ mice that were homozygous developed neurological dysfunction. Brain extracts from 14 MSA cases all transmitted neurodegeneration to TgM83+/- mice after incubation periods of approx. 120 d, which was accompanied by deposition of alpha-synuclein within neuronal cell bodies and axons. All of the MSA extracts also induced aggregation of alpha-syn*A53T-YFP in cultured cells, whereas none of 6 Parkinson's disease (PD) extracts or a control sample did so. Our findings argue that MSA is caused by a unique strain of alpha-synuclein prions, which is different from the putative prions causing PD and from those causing spontaneous neurodegeneration in TgM83+/+ mice. Remarkably, alpha-synuclein is the 1st new human prion to be identified, to our knowledge, since the discovery a half century ago that CJD was transmissible" [summ. & edited]. - Mod.CP]
