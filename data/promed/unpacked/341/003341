EU agrees on tough BSE measures
----------------------------------
European Union farm ministers have agreed to impose tough new measures to
fight mad cow disease, (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) including
tightening controls on animal feed and excluding older cattle from the food
chain.
EU officials said the measures, agreed during emergency talks aimed at
halting the spread of BSE, would boost faith in Europe's beef supply.
"[These establish a very important set of measures to regain and retain
consumer confidence in beef," EU food safety Commissioner David Byrne said
following 9 hours of negotiations in Brussels.
Ministers approved a 6-month suspension on using meat and bone meal (MBM) -
the products believed to be at the heart of the BSE food scare sweeping
Europe - in all livestock feed.
The EU produces some 3 million tons of MBM every year and the Commission
has said it would cost 3 billion euros to destroy the animal waste by
incineration.
"It will involve huge financial costs. But it is the price that must be
paid to restore public confidence in our commitment to protect public
health," Mr Byrne said.
The EU outlawed meat-based feeds, also known as MBM, from cattle feed in
the wake of Britain's mad cow crisis in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The
feed ban will take effect from 1 Jan 2001 and will initially last for 6 months.
In a separate move designed to prevent the deadly, brain-wasting illness
from spreading to humans, the ministers approved a plan calling for the EU
to buy and destroy cattle aged over 30 months destined for the food chain
having not been tested for BSE.
The plan, described by British Agriculture Minister Nick Brown as a public
protection measure intended to "extinguish" BSE, would be 70 percent funded
from the budget of the 15-nation EU. Britain has already banned the sale of
any beef from cattle aged above 30 months in the wake of its BSE crisis,
and EU farm ministers agreed 2 weeks ago to begin testing all cattle over
that age for BSE beginning next July.
EU officials have said there could be as many as 2 million cattle across
the EU involved in the scheme until member states are in a position to test
their animals.
More than 80 people have died in Britain and 2 in France from BSE's fatal
human equivalent, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), and
scientists fear the toll may rise sharply.
Ministers agreed member states should lift the import restrictions they
recently placed on French beef and cattle by 1 Jan 2001.
At least 5 EU member states imposed full or partial bans on French beef and
cattle after French supermarkets disclosed in October they had unknowingly
sold beef from a herd of cattle contaminated by BSE.
The ministers also agreed to ask the EU's Scientific Steering Committee to
decide whether to remove from the food chain other cattle organs and
by-products, such as the spleen, thymus, spinal column and T-bone.

Sweden, Norway Act to Prevent BSE Contamination
------------------------------------------------
STOCKHOLM, -- Fearful the brain-wasting bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) or mad cow disease would spread from the European Union (EU)
countries to their lands, the governments of Sweden and Norway have
announced new steps to prevent contamination with the disease.
According to a new release from the Swedish Administrative Bureau of
Agriculture on Sunday, Sweden's latest preventive measures are to ban, from
1 Jan 2001, the meat and bone meal (MBM) from being mixed into cattle feed.
To make sure cattle feed will be absolutely free of the MBM, made of
carcasses and entrails of animals thought to cause BSE, the bureau ordered
the production of cattle feed to be separated from pig and fowl feed.
Currently, only 40 percent of the cattle feed is produced separately from
pig and fowl feed. In Norway, the country's broadcasting station reported
the consumers administrative bureau urged all grocers nationwide to label
beef with detailed information such as the places of production, slaughter
and packaging. The bureau also called on the quarantine authorities to step
up the quarantine of beef products in a bid to prevent contaminated beef
from entering the Norwegian market.
The customs warned the Norwegians not to buy any beef without the
information of production and slaughter places labeled. As of now, no cases
of BSE have been reported in Norway and Sweden.
Recriminations over the safety of beef appeared to be spreading beyond the
borders of the European Union, but the EU members are still brawling over a
6-month EU-wide ban on MBM.

MOSCOW -- Russia's veterinary service has not yet banned the import of beef
from Poland, according to the Russian Agriculture Ministry. A case of "mad
cow disease", or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can be contracted
by humans as vCJD, has recently been registered at a farm in Poland.
International experts together with Polish ones thoroughly study the
veterinary situation in Poland and have not yet come out with any
statements. Meanwhile, Poland decided on 28 Nov 2000 to ban the import of
beef from Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Denmark and Spain as more cases of
BSE occur there. Poland had earlier banned the import of British, Irish,
Swiss and French beef.
It was stated in the Russian Agriculture Ministry Russia's veterinary
service guarantees that beef imported from countries of the European Union
is safe. There are Russian veterinaries in each of the countries where
Russia buys meat. They thoroughly check every consignment shipped to Russia.

LONDON: UK scientists warned Europe on Tuesday over "high-risk" measures to
combat BSE, saying politicians had unwittingly given the green light for
the creation of mountains of lethal waste.
The scientists, who advised and criticized the UK government at the height
of Britain's Mad Cow crisis, said the latest moves in Brussels would leave
Europe struggling to transport, store and destroy thousands of tons of
ground-up cattle carcasses. At each stage of the process, infected waste
could leak into the water supply, disperse into the air or be eaten by
other animals -- BSE more of a chance to spread to the public.
"This could be a knee-jerk reaction which causes more damage," Iain Mcgill,
who worked for the UK agriculture ministry at the height of Britain's
crisis, said. "While they are alive, these cattle will not give anyone BSE,
but as soon as you start culling millions of cattle with nowhere to put
them, you're running a risk for the people in those areas. Particularly
where the dumps are."
European Union farm ministers agreed during emergency talks to ban the use
of meat-based feed for 6 months and to buy and destroy cattle aged over 30
months having not been tested for BSE. The scientists said Europe now had
to deal with unwanted animal feed, those ground-up cattle parts were most
prone to transmitting the disease plus maybe hundreds of thousands of
animal carcasses.

The European Commission has admitted the BSE test it hopes to introduce
throughout Europe cannot be used to reassure the public over the safety of
continental beef. The admission follows yesterday's report in The
Independent the testing for "Mad Cow" disease has never been properly
validated.
A spokeswoman for David Byrne, the European commissioner for health and
consumer protection, said a negative test result on its own did not mean
beef from cattle older than 30 months was safe to eat. "We've never sold it
[the test as a safety measure," Bette Gwinder said. "We sell it as a
measure to enhance consumer confidence. A negative result does not mean
beef is negative."
The Commission has proposed the BSE test is used on all animals older than
30 months, and only those testing negative should enter the food chain. Mr
Byrne said last week: "If animals aged over 30 months are not tested, they
would have to be destroyed. By testing all animals over 30 months we are
taking an ultra-precautionary approach."
But none of the 3 tests approved by the Commission has been validated on
animals appearing healthy but incubating the disease, so scientists have no
idea how reliable a negative result is. Andrea Dahmen, a Commission
spokeswoman, said although the validation of the BSE tests was incomplete,
the Commission would still introduce them rather than take the even more
precautionary approach of the UK and ban all beef from cattle older than 30
months.
"According to member states the tests are now good enough to reassure the
public," Ms Dahmen said.
However, Richard Kimberlin, an authority on BSE-like diseases and former
member of the UK's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC),
said the tests had limited value in excluding infected animals from the
food chain. "To use a test for which you don't really know the sensitivity
in order to reassure the public is downright dishonest," he said. "There
isn't a problem using tests provided you know what they are capable of."
Professor Peter Smith, the acting chairman of SEAC, said the present BSE
tests were only capable of confirming a case in the very late stages of the
incubation period. "On the basis of these tests I think I would not take a
negative result as reassurance the animal is negative," he said.
Robert Sturdy, the Conservative agriculture spokesman in the European
Parliament, said he was asking Mr Byrne to clarify the Commission's
position on how the tests are to be used. "The tests haven't proved to be
accurate and there's considerable confusion as to how they are going to be
introduced. The only to guarantee safety is to have a slaughter policy for
cattle over 30 months similar to in Britain," he said.
