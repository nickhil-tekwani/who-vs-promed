[1] Liberia, Sierra Leone: Nigerian Ebola medical volunteers fly in

Nigerian Ebola medical volunteers fly into Liberia, Sierra Leone
----------------------------------------------------------------
More than 175 Nigerian medics arrived in Liberia and Sierra Leone on Friday [5 Dec 2014] to join the fight against Ebola, the 1st of 600 volunteers promised by the regional giant, which had contained its own outbreak earlier this year. Months into the Ebola response, experts say they are still short of medical personnel to staff treatment centers. "This is the African spirit you are showing, this is the Nigerian spirit," Nigeria's ambassador to Liberia, Chigozie Obi-Nnadozie, told 76 Nigerian medics who landed there. Another 100 medical volunteers landed in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

The medics will boost weak local health systems that are also struggling to contain other preventable diseases, as Ebola discourages people from going to clinics for fear of becoming Ebola infected. UN child agency UNICEF on Friday began a campaign to provide 2.4 million people in Sierra Leone with anti-malarial drugs to ease the strain on the healthcare system and allow Ebola cases to be identified more easily. The 2 diseases have similar symptoms, including headaches, fever and aching joints.... -- more

[2] Liberia: new cases among health workers
Date: Wed 3 Dec 2014

Liberia: 4 new Ebola cases among health workers
-----------------------------------------------
4 health workers in Montserrado County have been infected with the Ebola virus, the head of the Incident Management System (IMS), Tolbert Nyenswah, has disclosed. This brings to over 300 the number of Ebola infections in healthcare givers nationwide with more than 170 deaths, since the Ebola outbreak [was 1st reported] in March 2014, according to the Health Ministry Situational Report.

According to Nyenswah, the 4 health workers did not get infected at an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU), but at private facilities or homes where they cared for suspected patients without proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE). "The new infections of these health workers should constitute a somber reminder to Liberians that ... people should stop playing doctor, but rather report all forms of illnesses to the hospital," he said. Nyenswah said the 4 are being treated at the US Army-run Monrovia Medical Unit (MMU) in Charlesville, Margibi County, set up specifically for health workers and foreign volunteers. The MMU, dedicated 5 Nov 2014, was financed by the American Government and built jointly by the United States Military and the Armed Forces of Liberia.

[3] Sierra Leone: no touching is new edict

No more touching is new religious edict in Ebola hot zone
---------------------------------------------------------
Sheik Ahmed Sesay grew up convinced that touching and washing was essential to grant the dead a peaceful passage into the next life. But lately, Sesay has been meeting with other religious leaders here in Sierra Leone's mountainous Koinadugu district to explain why they should reconsider ancestral funeral rites. The imam travels potholed roads on his motorcycle to share one of the crucial lessons Ebola has taught him: to stay alive, his community must change the way they treat their dead.

Ebola 1st reached Koinadugu, a lush mountainous district near Sierra Leone's border with Guinea where Islam is the dominant religion, in late October [2014]. Traditionally, Muslim community elders have performed funeral rites that involved washing the corpse with lukewarm water and a cloth, tying both thumbs together as well as the big toes, wrapping the body in a white cotton shroud, and perfuming it. During the night vigil, the family would sit around the body, and some would touch it as they sang songs and recited portions of the Koran, according to Sesay. In some parts of the country, if the deceased was an Islamic scholar, the water used to wash the body was collected and young boys were told to wash their faces with it.

Christians also wash the body, dress it in a suit or clothing picked by the family, and place it in a coffin, said Sesay, who attended Catholic school and heads Koinadugu's interreligious council. "This disease is attacking the very best of their culture -- the loving and caring aspects," said Patricia Omidian, a medical anthropologist who advised the WHO's Ebola response effort.

Aid groups such as the Red Cross seeking to stem the transmission -- at the height of the epidemic, almost 2/3rds of infections could be traced back to funerals -- are struggling to change centuries-old customs. Ebola sufferers are highly contagious at the time of death, when the body risks releasing infected bodily secretions. A single funeral in May [2014], where crowds gathered to bid farewell to a respected traditional healer, was linked to as many as 365 deaths. At least 20 percent of infections could still be traced to unsafe burials in the 3 West African countries battling the outbreak last month [November 2014], compared with an estimated 60 percent in August [2014].

After some early attempts to enforce safe burials backfired, the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders [MSF] enlisted anthropologists and religious groups to help devise guidelines that retain the spiritual message of local traditions while rooting out physical contact. "This disease is attacking the very best of their culture -- the loving and caring aspects," said Patricia Omidian, a medical anthropologist who advised the WHO's Ebola response effort. The WHO contacted Omidian in May [2014], asking for her help to better understand how local practices might help or hinder the spread of disease as well as cultural attitudes toward Ebola. Assisted by 2 local graduate students, she spent more than 2 weeks in August [2014] interviewing communities in Montserrado, Margibi and Bong Counties in Liberia [counties around the capital, Monrovia -- see map at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/figures/m63e1114a3f.gif - Mod.JW].

Preserving the devotional aspect was key for Sesay. "Burying people without prayers is like dumping the remains of a dog in a hole," the 62-year-old imam, sporting a traditional green tunic with swirling motifs and a knitted hat, said in an interview inside a cavernous mosque in Kabala, Koinadugu's capital. "It is important that Ebola corpses are buried safely and in dignity. We are impressed with the training Red Cross is offering its volunteers." Radio Bintumani on FM 93.7 is the major source of information on the lethal virus and its progression. Both Muslim and Christian leaders have started making regular appearances on the radio to press for change, but not everyone is as receptive as Sesay.... -- more

[4] Liberia: orphans find a home

For Ebola orphans in Liberia, it's a bittersweet new beginning
--------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola has "orphaned" about 2000 children in Liberia, health authorities say. Some children are being looked after in 2 shelters in the country's capital, Monrovia. Reuniting the kids with their relatives, or finding them foster homes, can take time. These are kids who have come into contact with sick people but aren't showing signs of Ebola themselves. The children must be monitored for 21 days -- the cycle of the Ebola virus -- in a care center to ensure they are also not infected, says Anthony Klay Sie of ChildFund Liberia, the nonprofit running the shelters. "Children are placed in a group of 3. If a child starts to show signs and symptoms of Ebola, that child is immediately isolated," he says. "The entire essence of this center is to help break transmission of the virus within family settings.

So far, the shelter has recorded 5 cases of Ebola among the children, Klay Sie says; 3 died and 2 have survived. Those who are healthy have to go through a 2-stage process before they can be reunited with family. Once they've completed the 1st observation period, the children move to a 2nd shelter. After at least 21 days there, they are eligible to go to their new home or to extended family.

Each child is given clothes, toiletries and a blanket, along with about 55 pounds of rice and cooking oil. They're also given colorful mattresses, Klay Sie says. All of the items are part of the reunification packages provided by the government and other nonprofits. "Normally, children who come from a family that had an infected person, their belongings are all burned," Klay Sie says. "So upon their return, they may find it difficult to start life over.

It's a bittersweet moment, says Hawa Sherman, the supervisor of the children's shelters. "I'm very happy, and I'm [also] sad because over the months we have got so used to them," she says. "We are happy because they are going to be reunited with their families, and we will also miss them, too. They need more love, definitely. Losing your parents is hard. It's very hard to take, so we need to give them more love."

More than 800 children have been resettled in Liberia to date, UNICEF says. The children have to be reintegrated into the community. "So many times, you notice that the communities are afraid of the children," says Sienna Wisseh of the Family Welfare Division. "So many communities don't even want to associate themselves with the children." Ebola survivor WK, who lost 6 family members, has just been reunited with her 3-month-old son, SD. She starts to cry as she thanks those who have looked after her baby boy. "Thank you for taking care of my children," she says between sobs. "So many of my people passed away." She breaks down as she talks, but she gets her message across.... -- more
