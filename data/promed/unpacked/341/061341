Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is one of the 3 rabbit diseases included in the
OIE (Office International des Epizooties) list. In the OIE Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (available online at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00117.htm)> it is possible to find
exhaustive data on clinical aspects, epidemiology, diagnosis, and control
of this viral disease.

In addition a review on RHDV and correlated viruses has been recently
published in: PC Alves, N Ferrand, K Hacklander (editors) Lagomorph
Biology: evolution ecology and conservation. Berlin Heidelberg:
Springer-Verlag, 2008 (ISBN 978-3-54072445-2)

In this review (written by Lavazza A and Capucci L) the general aspects of
the disease are reported and the characteristics of RHDV and related
viruses are described. Indeed, it has to be noted that some resistance to
the disease in the wild population it is probably due to the existence and
natural circulation of non-pathogenic related viruses which can interfere
with virulent RHD infection by inducing cross reacting antibodies. Such
situation has been repeatedly evidence both in Oceania (Australia and New
Zealand) and in Europe (UK, France and Italy) and at least one non
pathogenic calicivirus, named RCV, has been identified and characterized
(Capucci L, Fusi P, Lavazza A, Pacciarini ML, Rossi C, 1996). Detection and
preliminary characterization of a new rabbit calicivirus related to rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus but nonpathogenic (J Virol vol 70: 8614-23).

Nevertheless the hypothesis of a genetic resistance in some wild rabbits as
well as in domestic and commercial hybrids can not be totally excluded.
