Cholera case reported among Korean tourists returning from abroad
------------------------------------------
For the first time since 1997, when the number of travelers oversees dropped
sharply, a returnee from a trip abroad was discovered to have contracted
cholera, health officials said yesterday.
The National Institute of Health (NIH), an affiliate of the Health and
Welfare Ministry, said that a 24-year-old man residing in the southern city
of Naju was found to have been infected with the disease after he visited
Bangkok, Thailand, 5-10 Aug 1999, on business. The man is currently
undergoing medical treatment in isolation.
According to the NIH, Kim was suffering from diarrhea when he arrived at
Kimpo International Airport in Seoul 10 Aug from his trip to Bangkok and
received a medical checkup at the Seoul National Quarantine office in the
airport.
The quarantine officials detected cholera [bacteria in his stool samples.
The NIH yesterday [13 Aug 1999 confirmed that Kim had been infected with
the disease.
The institute said that it is now tracing all 258 passengers, who returned
home from Bangkok on the same flight as Kim, through medical institutions
across the country to find out whether others were afflicted.
The number of Koreans who got the disease during overseas trips peaked in
1994 at 34. But the figure dropped to one in 1997 and to none last year,
partly due to the sharp decline in the number of outbound Korean travelers
since the economic crisis hit the
nation.
NIH officials, however, feared that more cholera patients may be found among
overseas travelers in the coming months, as many Koreans are expected to go
abroad to spend their summer vacations and Chusok (traditional Korean full
moon celebration) holidays, which will come in September.
The officials advised overseas travelers to pay attention to their personal
hygiene by washing their hands after returning to their hotels after
sightseeing, drinking only boiled water, and avoiding raw fish in coastal
areas.
Travelers were also told to get medical treatment right away when they show
symptoms such as diarrhea, fever and stomach ache.
