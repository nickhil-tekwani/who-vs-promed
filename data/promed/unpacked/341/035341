In Assam, 3 more persons lost their lives due to Japanese encephalitis [JE], taking the toll to 19 in the state, an official release said on Thursday [14 Jul 2022].

The National Health Mission, Assam said one person each died of the infection in Darrang, Sonitpur, and Udalguri in the last 24 hours.

Besides, 23 fresh cases of Japanese encephalitis were detected in Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Kamrup Metropolitan, Kamrup, Karbi Anglong, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Nagaon, and Udalguri, the statement said.

Altogether 144 cases of JE have been reported in the northeastern state since 1 Jul 2022, it said.

[The cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase rapidly. In just the past 7 days, the number of deaths has increased from 6 to 19, and the number of JE cases from 48 to 144. There were 23 new JE cases in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, none of these 144 cases was classified as acute encephalitis syndrome, as was the situation for those 48 cases in a previous ProMED post (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (06): (AS) 20220707.8704289). The previous report indicated that the state District Rapid Response team on acute encephalitis syndrome and JE that will be constituted soon will be dealing with any non-JE AES cases that are diagnosed in the area. Given the rapid rise in cases, a response is urgent.

No mention is made in the report above if any of the affected individuals reported above had been vaccinated against JE or if a vaccination campaign is planned. Flooding may have increased the area of breeding of JE virus vector mosquitoes. This is the season of active JE virus transmission, so more cases are likely to occur over the next 3 months. A vaccine against JE is available and is often used in northeastern India where the virus is endemic. - Mod.TY
