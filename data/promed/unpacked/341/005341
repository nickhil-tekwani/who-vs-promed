The National Center of Disease Control says the 1st case of the
lethal virus -- Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) -- has been
confirmed in Georgia. The health condition of the 31-year-old man
infected by the virus is very poor. He has been connected to a
breathing apparatus in the resuscitation department of the Hospital
of Tbilisi infectious diseases hospital. Initial symptoms of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever are instant shock, internal bleeding,
also hemorrhages on the body. The infected man was taken to hospital
with the mentioned symptoms.

CCHF is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. The disease was 1st
characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the name Crimean
hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the cause
of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the
disease. This is the 1st case of CCHF virus infection in Georgia.
Until now, the virus was present in the Krasnodar Oblast of Russia,
Iran and Turkey. [In fact CCHFV is widespread in Africa, the Middle
East and Asia. It has also been found in many parts of Europe,
including southern portions of the former USSR (Crimea, Astrakhan,
Rostov, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan), Turkey, Bulgaria,
Greece, Albania and Kosovo province of the former Yugoslavia. Limited
serological evidence suggests that CCHFV might also occur in parts of
Hungary, France and Portugal. - Mod.CP]

In case of infection, the probability of the patient's death is 60
percent. Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus,
_Hyalomma_, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus.
Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and
hares, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to
humans occurs through contact with infected animal blood or ticks.
CCHF virus can be transmitted from one infected human to another by
contact with infectious blood or body fluids

The head of the national center, Paata Imnadze, says the infected
person is a young man who is undergoing intensive treatment in
hospital. He said the Health Care Ministry would completely cover the
treatment expenditures. The man has been presumably infected by an
ixodid tick. Blood tests will be conducted on his family members as well.
