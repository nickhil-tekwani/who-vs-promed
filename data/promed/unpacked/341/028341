Japan: 1st Japanese Case of Human Variant of Mad Cow Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare stated on Fri 4 Feb 2004 that it
has confirmed Japan's first case of the human variant of mad cow disease
[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD
in ProMED-mail]. The patient, who is already dead, was in Britain for about
a month around 1990, the Ministry stated. About 150 people have died due to
the disease in Britain.

Japan: 1st Death from Human Mad Cow Disease
---------------------------------------------
Japan confirmed on Fri 4 Feb 2005 its 1st case of the human variant of mad
cow disease [variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease(vCJD)], a fatal brain
disease thought to be contracted by eating infected beef. The Health
Ministry said that a Japanese man had died last December [2004] from vCJD,
adding that he probably contracted the fatal illness during a month-long
stay in Britain in 1989.
"I know that this will make many people worry, but we must take note of the
fact that his stay was only one month," Tetsuyuki Kitamoto, a Tohoku
University professor and Head of the Ministry panel on the disease, told a
news conference.
More than 160 people, most of them in Britain, have died worldwide from
definitive or probable vCJD after eating meat contaminated with mad cow
disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Britain
has been the worst hit by BSE, which is thought to be transmitted among
animals via feed containing bovine brains or spinal cord. Around 7 million
animals had been slaughtered in Britain by the end of June 2004 under a
scheme aimed at preventing the spread of the infection.
Japan has reported 14 cases of BSE and began testing all its cattle for the
disease after the first case in September 2001. It also banned imports of
Canadian beef in May 2003 and of U.S. beef in December 2003 after cases of
BSE were found in those countries, and is in drawn-out talks on when to
lift the ban.
Cases of vCJD have also been reported in France, Canada, Ireland, Italy,
the United States and China [Hong Kong S.A.R.], Health Ministry officials
said. In all cases outside of Europe, victims are believed to have
contracted the disease during stays in Britain, but a one month period
would be the shortest stay reported so far, the experts on the health
ministry panel said.
The Japanese man, who was in his 40s when he first showed symptoms of the
disease in December 2001, had no record of blood transfusions or brain
surgery -- other ways in which the disease could be transmitted. The Health
Ministry sought to calm any fears among the Japanese public, issuing a
statement saying that the disease is not transmitted among humans under
regular living conditions. Doctors on the panel said people could consult
physicians, but added that at present, there was no way to determine
whether a person would show symptoms or to stop the progress of the disease.
Scientists estimate the incubation period for vCJD as 10 to 20 years.

[Some aspects of this first case of vCJD in Japan are intriguing. The age
of the patient, who is older than the majority of cases of vCJD. The
brevity of the period of exposure to infection, if infection is assumed to
have occurred during the one month sojourn in Britain. The improbability of
infection having occurred in Japan where only a very few cases of BSE have
been recognised. As an atypical prion has been associated with some cases
of BSE investigated in Japan, it may be possible to establish conclusively
where the exposure to infection occurred. - Mod.CP]
