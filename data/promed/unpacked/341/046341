TRYPANOSOMIASIS (SLEEPING SICKNESS) - ZAIRE (3): UPDATE
=======================================================
We now have final figures for sleeping sickness cases
for the Vanga Health Zone for 1995 and past years.

1992 - 16 new cases
1993 - 61 new cases
1994 - 98 new cases
1995 - 165 new cases: = a ten-fold increase in 4 years.

The WHO Feature No. 188, December 1995 has an article by Dr.
Cattand of WHO on sleeping sickness in Zaire. He states that in
Zaire over 19,000 cases were reported in 1994, twice the number
from one year earlier. It is clear to us that this represents
only a small tip of a very big iceberg.

We have figures from five rural health zones near us, plus
our own, all in the Bandundu Region. In 1994, 5,760 new cases
were reported from a total population of 934,263. Zaire has a
population of over forty million. These 5,760 cases would be 30%
of the reported cases, but they occurred in only about 2% of the
population. And even our figures represent case-finding in less
than 20% of the 934,263 population of our zones. Several other
regions beside the Bandundu Region are heavily infected.

Therefore, the true figure for 1994 must be many times
higher. There is, of course, no way to find out the true figure.
However, in stating a figure like 19,000, there should be mention
of the fact that probably the real figure is many times higher.
Otherwise, the gravity of the problem is not made clear.

We are getting good support from the National Trypanosiasis
Program in Kinshasa which is linked to FOMETRO in Brussels. We
are getting much information from TEAR Fund in England about the
situation regarding the production of Melarsoprol. Apparently
production is continuing, although quantities are insufficient to
meet the rapidly rising incidence of disease. There is pressure
from environmentalists, especially in Germany, to stop production
but so far no firm measures have been taken.

Thanks again for your encouragement. We will keep you
informed of events here and what we learn from elsewhere.
