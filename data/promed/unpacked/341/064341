On [22 Jun 2020], the International Health Regulations (IHR) Focal Point (FP) of Brazil shared a preliminary report with the Pan American Health Organization, the WHO Regional Office for the Americas of a human infection with influenza A(H1N2) variant virus (A(H1N2)v). According to the report, the patient, a 22 year old female, with no comorbidities, worked in a swine slaughterhouse in Ibipora Municipality, Parana State, and developed an influenza-like illness on [12 Apr 2020]. The patient initially sought medical care on [14 Apr 2020] and a respiratory specimen was obtained on [16 Apr 2020] as part of routine surveillance activities. The patient was treated with oseltamivir, was not hospitalized, and has recovered.

A real-time RT-PCR test conducted at the public health laboratory identified a non-subtypable influenza A virus. In May 2020, the specimen was forwarded to the Laboratory of Respiratory Virus and Measles, Oswaldo Cruz Institute (FIOCRUZ per its acronym in Portuguese), a national influenza reference laboratory, in Rio de Janeiro. On [22 Jun 2020], genetic sequencing characterized this virus as an influenza A(H1N2)v virus.

Public health response
----------------------
Further genetic and phenotypic characterization of the virus from the patient is ongoing.

On [26 Jun 2020], local authorities started a retrospective and prospective investigation in the slaughterhouse in Ibipora Municipality and other municipalities where the slaughterhouse workers live. According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, a second individual who also worked at the slaughterhouse developed respiratory symptoms during the same timeframe as the confirmed case, but no sample was collected from this person. No other suspected cases amongst contacts of the confirmed case have been identified.

Information from the virological characterization and epidemiological investigation, especially on the patient's likely source of exposure to the virus and the identification any additional human cases will inform the risk assessment on the likelihood of any person-to-person transmission.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
To date, 26 cases of influenza A(H1N2)v have been reported to WHO since 2005, including 2 from Brazil. Most of the cases have presented with mild illness and there has been no evidence of person-to-person transmission.

Swine influenza viruses circulate in swine populations in many regions of the world. Depending on geographic location, the genetic characteristics of these viruses differ. Most human cases are the result of exposure to swine influenza viruses through contact with infected swine or contaminated environments. Because these viruses continue to be detected in swine populations around the world, further human cases can be expected.

WHO advice
----------
Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health with timely sharing of such changes for risk assessment.

All human infections caused by a novel influenza subtype are notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR) and State Parties to the IHR (2005) are required to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory-confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.

In the case of a confirmed or suspected human infection caused by a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, including a variant virus, a thorough epidemiological investigation (even while awaiting the confirmatory laboratory results) of history of exposure to animals, travel, and contact tracing should be conducted. The epidemiological investigation should include early identification of unusual respiratory events that could signal person-to-person transmission of the novel virus and clinical samples collected from the time and place that the case occurred should be tested and sent to a WHO Collaboration Center for further characterization.

General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. WHO does not recommend any specific different measures for travellers. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

Brazil has reported a variant H1N2 (H1N2v) influenza infection in a 22-year-old woman from Parana state who worked in a swine slaughterhouse, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [9 Jul 2020].

The woman's flulike symptoms began on [12 Apr 2020], and after seeking medical care a few days later, health workers obtained a respiratory specimen as part of routine surveillance. She was treated with oseltamivir, wasn't hospitalized, and has since recovered. After the public health lab identified an unsubtypable influenza A virus, genetic sequencing at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute on [22 Jun 2020] identified an H1N2v flu virus. Further characterization of the virus is still under way.

On [26 Jun 2020], local health officials launched an investigation at the slaughterhouse and in the communities where its workers live, which found that another slaughterhouse worker had respiratory symptoms when the woman did, but no samples had been collected. The WHO said further investigation will yield information to assess the likelihood of human-to-human transmission.

The WHO said 26 H1N2v cases have been reported to the WHO since 2005, including 2 from Brazil. Most patients had mild infections, and no evidence of person-to-person spread was observed. The agency added that most infections are related to swine exposure, and because the viruses continue to be detected in swine populations globally, more human cases are expected.

[Brazil has one of the largest swine populations in the world, however influenza was not thought to be endemic in Brazil's swine until the major outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009. Through phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences of influenza viruses of the H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes collected in swine in Brazil during 2009-2012, Nelson et al identified multiple previously uncharacterized influenza viruses of human seasonal H1N2 and H3N2 virus origin that have circulated undetected in swine for many years (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517702/).

In 2017, Resende and colleagues reported on characterization of a swine-variant H1N2 virus isolated from a Brazilian teenage pig farmer that turned out to be a triple reassortant with genetic contributions from H1N2 (hemagglutinin), H3N2 (neuraminidase), and pandemic H1N1 (remaining genes) (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/1/16-1122_article).

The WHO report mentions a 2nd H1N2v human infection from same region in Brazil, also in a young woman working in the pig industry. This report highlights the need for influenza surveillance in humans and animals, as well as in their interface, especially during the influenza season when transmission is high. To ensure early detection, surveillance should focus on geographic areas where influenza A viruses subtypes co-circulate and where human-animal contact is frequent. - Mod.UBA
