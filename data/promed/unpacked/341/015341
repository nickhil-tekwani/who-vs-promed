Ashanti records 179 malaria deaths
----------------------------------
A total of 179 people died of the malaria disease in the Ashanti
Region last year, Dr Aaron Offei, the Regional Director of Health
Services, has said. This showed a significant rise in the number of
deaths, compared with the 2009 figure of 169.

He said available records also indicated that hospital admissions
caused by the disease went up from 33 694 to 34 560 during the period
and attributed this to the inability of the people to take prevention
measures.

Dr Offei was speaking at the launch of the Affordable Medicine
Facility for Malaria (AMFM) Campaign in Kumasi. The programme is aimed
at sensitizing the public to use only the recommended drugs for the
treatment of malaria.

Ghana is one of the 8 countries in Africa selected to pilot the AMFM
initiative. Malaria continues to be the leading cause of morbidity in
Ghana, accounting for more than 30 percent of all
Out-Patient-Department (OPD) attendance in health facilities.

The Regional Health Director said early recognition of the disease
and its prompt treatment, using effective anti-malaria drugs could
help to roll back the disease. He said the AMFM would go a long way to
aid the country to achieve the goal of reducing malaria deaths by
2015.

Mr James Frimpong, National Malaria Control Officer in-charge of the
Middle Belt of Ghana, said artesunate amodiaquine and arthemether
lumefantrine were the 2 anti-malaria drugs recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO).

Dr Joseph Oduro, Deputy Regional Director, Public Health, appealed to
the media to educate the public on the need to rely on only the
recommended drugs to treat malaria.

[A difference in deaths attributed to malaria of 10 cannot be
regarded as a significant increase. It demonstrates, however, that it
has not been possible to reduce the number of fatal malaria cases in
the region, and that the malaria prevalence remains stable. Ghana
reported over 1.1 million blood film positive malaria cases in 2009
with 3378 deaths (WHO World Malaria Report 2010
http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html).
