A laboratory test has confirmed that African swine fever (ASF) was the main cause of death of nearly 700 pigs in 3 Mizoram districts, an official of the state's animal husbandry and veterinary department said on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021]. However, a formal declaration from a concerned authority is awaited, he said.

Joint director (livestock health) Dr Lalhmingthanga said that samples were sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal on 8 Apr [2021] for a confirmatory test.

A confirmation is required from NIHSAD, and the government of India will eventually notify the swine fever (if it is ASF) as per World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) norms, because it affects the international trade, he said.

According to him, at least 694 pigs have died of the virus since 21 Mar [2021], when the 1st death was reported at Lungsen village in south Mizoram's Lunglei district near the Bangladesh border.

He said that the state government has already declared 2 villages, Lungsen and Zawlnuam in Mamit district, which shares a border with Tripura; one locality in Lunglei town, Electrict Veng; and 2 localities in Aizaw, Edenthar Veng and Arm Veng, as "infected areas" to prevent the further spread of the virus to the neighbouring villages.

The entire Lunglei district, which is the worst hit, has also been declared as a "surveillance zone" in order to contain and prevent the spread of the present outbreak. So far, at least 451 pigs have died in Lunglei district, 124 in Mamit, and 119 in Aizawl district, he said.

Lalhmingthanga said that a complaint has been lodged as the prevailing swine fever is believed to be transmitted through pigs or processed meat illegally imported from neighbouring states or countries. He added that the state government is making efforts to prevent the virus from spreading further to other areas and to contain the outbreak.

Meanwhile, a meeting of veterinary officials convened by state animal husbandry and veterinary minister K Beichhua on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021] over the prevailing swine fever stressed the need for concerted efforts from the general public to contain the virus.

[African swine fever [ASF] was first (unofficially) reported in India in late February 2020. The 1st report to the OIE took place in May 2020. The outbreaks were located in the northeastern states, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. Since then, several additional outbreaks have been reported, spreading and entering another northeastern state, Meghalaya. Mizoram became, in August 2020, the 4th state to be affected [ProMED-mail archive no. 20200820.7698561].

Mizoram borders, on its south, Bangladesh and the ASF-affected Myanmar.

Large parts of Asia have already been affected by ASF, including China, the world's leading pork producer, which shares the borders of India.
