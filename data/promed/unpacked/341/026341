This is reminiscent of an outbreak in 1996, in which 21 cases of
coccidioidomycosis were confirmed among a 126-member church group who
returned to Washington State (United States) from Tecate.
Coccidioidomycosis is most common in the northern part of Mexico, Pacific
coast, Guerrero (skin test-positivity 10%) and tropical Colima and
Michoacan (skin test-positivity 30%). In the northern zone (Baja California
Norte, Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Neovo Leon and Tamaulipas),
prevalence decreases from west to east. Overall skin test-positivity in
this region approaches 50%. 150 cases were reported from Nuevo Leon during
1978 to 1988 (39 of these were acquired in neighboring states). Ten percent
of Tijuana residents are skin-test positive. In the Pacific littoral zone,
prevalence is highest (50% skin test-positivity) in the north. Skin
test-positivity rates are somewhat lower in the central zone than in the
northern and Pacific zones.
Legionellosis and adenovirus infections -- each with a maximum incubation
period of 12 days -- are unlikely, given the fact that exposure ended in
"early March" and disease began "during the last week of March."

[The outbreak referred to by Dr. Berger was reported by Cairns L, Blythe D,
Kao A, Pappagianis D, Kaufman L, Kobayashi J, and R Hajjeh. Outbreak of
coccidioidomycosis in Washington state residents returning from Mexico.
Clin Infect Dis 2000;30:61-4. This report described travelers returning
from Tecate, Mexico, a town in the Sonoran Desert adjacent to the border of
the United States and Mexico. In this report there was a high rate (62
percent) of a papular rash that progressed to a confluent maculopapular
rash. In 4 patients there were rashes that were consistent with erythema
nodosum. It would be interesting to know if the patients in the current
outbreak have cutaneous findings.
Another report of an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis in a church group, this
one returning from Hermosillo, Mexico to Pennsylvania, was reported in
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2000:49(44);1004-6 which can be found
