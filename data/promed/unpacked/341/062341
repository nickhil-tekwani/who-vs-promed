A white supremacist today [8 Mar 2010] admitted producing deadly
ricin while preparing for acts of terrorism.

The home of the alleged terrorist in Myrtle Grove, Burnopfield,
County Durham, was raided by anti-terror officers who found the
killer substance in a jam jar in his kitchen.

At Newcastle Crown Court he admitted producing a chemical weapon --
ricin -- and preparing for acts of terrorism. He also admitted to 3
charges of possessing a record containing information likely to be
useful to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism.

The charge related to copies of 3 texts including The Anarchist's
Handbook, which detailed instructions on making explosives. This
probable terrorist, flanked by 4 prison officers, also admitted to
possession of a prohibited weapon, which related to a spray canister
found during the raid on his home.

He will be sentenced after the trial of his 19-year-old son, who
denies 2 charges of possessing material containing information likely
to be useful to a person committing or preparing acts of terrorism.
The case will be heard on [12 Apr 2010].

The father, a truck driver and ex-DJ, was remanded in custody and
Judge John Milford warned him: "Doubtless you have been told only
custody can follow."

The son was granted bail until his trial.

[Ricin, a toxalbumin, is the toxic principle of the castor bean plant
_Ricinus communis_. This plant has an almost world wide distribution.
Although castor oil is made from the plant, the oil is not toxic.
Ricin can be made from the waste or the white mash from the oil
production. Also, if the seeds are chewed, in other words, the seed
coat is broken, they become toxic. Aside from ingestion of the seeds,
it would take a deliberate act to make ricin toxin. As a purified
material, it could be inhaled, ingested, or injected.

In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist who was
living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an
umbrella. The umbrella had been rigged to inject a poison ricin
pellet under Markov's skin.

In the 1940s the US military experimented with using ricin as a
possible warfare agent. In some reports ricin has possibly been used
as a warfare agent in the 1980s in Iraq and more recently by
terrorist organizations.

The dose as well as the method of exposure will play a role in the
clinical signs and symptoms. However, as ricin is a toxalbumin, it
may affect initially the body system where it entered the body, but
multiple organs may be affected. If ricin is inhaled, it would be
expected that symptoms would be those associated with respiratory
disease, such as coughing, wheezing, or difficulty breathing. As a
protein based toxin, fever would be expected. If ricin is ingested,
signs relative to the gastrointestinal system would be expected. If
injected, as in the Markov case, then multiple organ systems may be
affected simultaneously. Ricin powder or liquid could be absorbed
through the mucus membranes of the eyes or nose.

Regardless of the route of exposure, death may be as rapid as 36-72
hours. Prevention of intoxication is the best available treatment.
Supportive care is the always appropriate.

For all the negative aspects of ricin, it is under investigation and
experimental trials for treatment of certain types of cancer. Other
harmful agents have been found to have medical uses. Botulism is a
deadly toxin, but as Botox it has been shown to cause some wrinkle
reduction, however temporary, and has been influential in the
treatment of some stroke victims. So ricin, may be the next medically
beneficial toxin.

Lutwick LI, Gradon J, Zellen J: Category B Biotoxins. In Lutwick LI,
Lutwick SM (eds), Beyond Anthrax: Bioterror -- The Weaponization of
Infectious Diseases. Springer-Humana, New York (2008):

Secondary aerosols
------------------
"No clear data are available regarding the potential of secondary
aerosols of ricin in the environment. The molecule, however, is
inactivated on surfaces by hypochlorite solutions such as 0.5 percent
sodium hypochlorite that can be used on skin after extensive washing
with soap and water. The toxin is, however, not inactivated by low
chlorine levels or by iodine. Although stable at ambient
temperatures, it is detoxified by heat either 80 deg C [176 deg F]
for 10 minutes or 50 deg C [122 deg F] at pH 7.8 for an hour. There
should be little concern regarding a toxic dermal exposure per se
since, unless enhanced by solvents such as DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide],
absorption is insignificant."

Diagnosis
---------
"Specific confirmation of the diagnosis requires the detection of
ricin in or on the victim or, in survivors since the toxin is quite
immunogenic, rising anti-ricin antibodies developing by 2 weeks after
the illness. Ricin is quickly metabolized. In rats, only 11 percent
of an intravenously administered dose remains after 24 hours with
most of the toxin excreted in the urine as low molecular weight
metabolites. Additionally, regardless of the route of exposure, the
toxin is rapidly tissue bound so that direct tissue
immunohistological analysis may be preferable to body fluid testing.
Franz and Jaax state that, after a ricin inhalation, the castor bean
poison could be detectable from a nasal mucosal swab for at least 24
hours after exposure. ELISA using either polyclonal or monoclonal
antibody can detect ricin. If assays could be developed to detect the
low molecular weight metabolites of ricin, urine ricin testing could
be valuable even after several days. Among the methods to detect
ricin antibody is a biological system assaying the ability of a
sample to protect a tissue culture line against ricin toxicity."

Passive and active protection
-----------------------------
"Recently, a recombinant ricin A chain containing mutations at known
toxic sites has been shown to be nontoxic and immunogenic in humans.
In rodents, immunization was protective against either gastric or
aerosol ricin challenge.

Passive immunization against an aerosolized ricin exposure has also
been studied. Aerosol administered polyclonal goat anti-ricin IgG was
protective in a mouse model when ricin aerosol was administered 1
hour later but some lung pathology occurred in survivors. Polyclonal
antibody was also protective when given intravenously. Monoclonal
antibody was also protective against ricin toxicity in vitro and in
vivo when given before and after challenge. Pretreatment alone
delayed the onset of toxicity and death."
