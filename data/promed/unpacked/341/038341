Birds are dropping dead along a Northern Michigan shoreline near the
Sleeping Bear Dunes, worrying local biologists. Biologists say they've also
found hundreds of dead goby fish, which are believed to carry the botulism
toxin.

Over the years, hundreds of birds have died along the Michigan shoreline
after contracting avian botulism. Just last July [2009], 40 dead seagulls
were found near the dunes. Biologists say this year [2010] the combination
of dead birds, dead fish, and a warm spring creates a cause for concern.

Biologists want people to know it's still safe to be on the beaches and in
the water. But people should be aware of this bird die-off and the
possibility of an avian botulism outbreak. The test results from the dead
birds should be back from the lab by next week.

Biologists at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Shoreline are looking for
volunteers to help monitor the beaches.

[The sporulating anaerobic Gram positive bacillus _Clostridium botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect
humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F toxin. Types A and B toxins are
highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI (gastrointestinal)
enzymes. About half of the foodborne outbreaks in the United States are
caused by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.

Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in
an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in
waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been
reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the
Great Lakes region, it was 1st identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay of
Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type C
is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.

Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in
gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,
and shorebirds. It now appears any birds or mammals susceptible to
botulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.
Evidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald
eagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.

Typically a bird dies of some cause, and the carcass is an incubator for
the anaerobes. The maggots move into the decomposing carcass, accumulating
the toxin. Other birds come to eat the maggots on the carcass and infect
themselves, dying from the very disease they consumed, and so the circle
gets larger and requires that carcasses be picked up, or the cycle
continues. - Mod.TG
