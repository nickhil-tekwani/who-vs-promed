Biologists with the Department of Game and Fish Department have a new mystery on their hands: what killed dozens of catfish at Ute Lake [Quay County, New Mexico]?

The fish were found floating in the eastern New Mexico lake about a week after underwater blasting for a construction project. But officials say there's no conclusive link between the blasting and the fish kill. [Blasting normally kills instantly. - Mod.JW]

They say other causes could be toxins in the water, natural causes, or even lightning.

This comes less than a week after a massive die-off of elk in northern New Mexico, a case that still hasn't been solved. More than 100 elk suddenly collapsed on a ranch north of Las Vegas [San Miguel County, New Mexico] [see ref. below].

Game and Fish initially suspected EHD -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease -- an often fatal disease spread through insect bites but now say that it's unusual with EHD for so many animals to die all at once.

Biologists are also considering the animals' food source as a possible cause.

Tissue samples from the dead elk are being tested to nail down a cause. Test results could take a few weeks.
