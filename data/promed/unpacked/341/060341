Alberta Health Services is warning Alberta residents to take precautions, after a case of a serious illness was confirmed in a person living in an area north of Edmonton.

AHS officials said a case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome has been confirmed in a resident of a rural community located north of Edmonton, although officials would not release a specific location.

The confirmation has prompted health officials to issue a warning not only to residents of the immediate area, but to all Albertans, to carefully handle cleaning up rodent infestations and protect themselves.

"Because humans can be exposed to Hantavirus when the urine or feces of an infected rodent – such as a mouse – become airborne, anyone who disturbs areas of mice or mice droppings can be at risk," Dr. Marcia Johnson, Medical Officer of Health – Edmonton Zone, said in a press release. "It is essential that Albertans take precautions to protect themselves, and greatly reduce their risk of illness."

While Hantavirus infection is rare, AHS officials warn it can be fatal.

Symptoms typically show one to two weeks after exposure, but in some cases symptoms started to show up to 5 weeks after exposure.

Symptoms resemble a severe flu, including:

Fever
Body aches
Chills
Abdominal problems
Severe Breathing problems
Precautions to prevent possibly coming in contact with the virus include properly cleaning up mouse droppings, nests, or dead mice – in the following way:
- Ventilate the area by opening doors and windows – then stay out of the room or area for at least 30 minutes
- While wearing rubber gloves, soak droppings, nests and dead mice with a bleach-water solution (one part bleach, nine parts water) or a household disinfectant
- Let the bleach water solution or disinfectant soak for five minutes
- Mop up, or pick up with paper towels the bleach-soaked droppings, nests or dead mice and place them in a plastic bag. Ensure the bag is sealed, and place in a garbage container with a tightly sealed lid
- Wash the gloves, before removing them, and then wash your hands

Officials warn anyone cleaning up after mice should follow the above instructions, and never disturb droppings, nests or dead mice without soaking them in the solution first, and to not vacuum or sweep up after a mouse infestation.

Dr. Johnson said anyone who has recently been in an area contaminated by mice, and later developed severe flu-like symptoms or difficulty breathing should seek medical attention immediately.

[Since 1989, 29 hantavrus infections in humans cases have been reported throughout Alberta. Hantavirus infections have been reported also in Saskatchewan, the neighboring province to the east, as recently as October, 2011 (see proMED-mail archive no. 20111023.3152). There is no indication in this report of which hantavirus is involved in this case. Both Sin Nombre and New York hantaviruses have deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) as reservoir hosts. The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at
