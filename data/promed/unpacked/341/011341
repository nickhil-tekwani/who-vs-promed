1st report of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ in Mexico
-------------------------------------------------------
At the beginning of 2008, tomato plants near Mexico City showed
general stunting, leaf chlorosis, which later turned bronze or purple,
and fruit size reduction. The disease was initially confined to a 5 ha
[12.4 acres] glasshouse but it quickly spread. By the end of 2008,
approximately 5 percent of tomato plants in 35 ha [86.5 acres] of
glasshouses were infected.

Samples tested negative for common tomato viruses but gave positive
results when tested for pospiviroids. In 2 samples, sequence analysis
indicated a mixed infection with 2 pospiviroids: _Tomato chlorotic
dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd) and a viroid closely related to _Mexican papita
viroid_ (first identified in Mexico in 1996).

The Mexican isolate of TCDVd was 99 percent identical to an isolate
identified in Arizona, USA in 2008. The close relationships between
the isolates suggest that TCDVd in these 2 countries may share a
common origin, and it is hypothetized that they might have been
introduced with infected tomato seeds.

This is the 1st time that _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ is reported
from Mexico.

1st report of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ in France
-------------------------------------------------------
At the end of 2007, unusual symptoms were observed on glasshouse
tomato plants in Bretagne region. Within a group of glasshouses, 20 to
25 percent of the plants were showing bunchy top, leaf curling, and
epinasty (downward curling of leaves). Molecular analysis confirmed
the presence of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_,
TCDVd). The French TCVDd isolate was closely related to the isolate
reported from Canada.

Further studies were carried out to trace back this infection. 2500
seeds of the original seed lot (from which the infected plants had
been grown) were sown and the resulting plants were tested (in batches
of 10 plants) for TCDVd. The viroid was detected in 2 out of the 250
batches of plants and the same nucleotide sequence was obtained,
indicating a low level of seed transmission.

These results suggested that the source of this outbreak was probably
infected seeds. This is the 1st report of TCDVd in France.

[3] Petunia - Slovenia

1st detection of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ in Petunia in
Slovenia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the framework of a survey on host plants of _Potato spindle
tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd), 30 leaf samples of _Petunia_
spp. were collected from 22 production sites. At the time of sampling
(April 2010), no disease symptoms were observed on petunia plants.

These samples were tested for the presence of PSTVd according to the
EPPO diagnostic protocol. One sample of cv. Surfinia Purple (collected
from the coastal region) and one sample of cv. Surfinia Hot Pink 05
(collected near Ljubljana) gave positive results indicating the
presence of PSTVd or _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd).

Further analysis confirmed the occurrence of TCDVd in these 2 petunia
samples. Although TCDVd remains symptomless in _Petunia_ spp.,
infected plants could be a source of infection for potato and tomato
crops, which can be damaged by TCDVd. Therefore, the infected petunia
stocks were destroyed.

This is the 1st time that TCDVd is detected in Slovenia.

[_Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd) has recently been placed in
the genus _Pospiviroid_ (86-88 percent sequence homology with type
member _Potato spindle tuber viroid_, PSTVd). It has been reported to
cause serious yield losses in tomatoes for example in Europe, in both
field and glasshouse grown crops. Symptoms on tomato vary depending on
TCDVd strain, tomato variety, age of the plant, and plant vigour. They
resemble PSTVd symptoms and may include distortion, yellowing or
bronzing of leaves and shoots, necrotic leaf lesions, stunting of
plants, reduced number of leaves and fruit, and even death of plants.
Other solanaceous crops are likely to also be hosts, including
capsicum and potato. Symptomless infection may occur in ornamentals
such as petunia and verbena. Disease development and spread are
favoured by warmer temperatures.

Little is known about epidemiology, host specificity and
host-pathogen interactions of TCDVd, but it is expected that these are
similar to PSTVd. Asymptomatic ornamentals and possibly solanaceous
weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. TCDVd, like most pospiviroids,
can easily be transmitted mechanically, for example by contaminated
pruning tools and equipment, human and insect activities and
plant-to-plant contact, as well as by grafting. Seed transmission of
TCDVd is strongly suspected; spread by pollen or specific insect
vectors needs further investigation. Disease management may include
use of certified clean tomato seeds or explants, removal of pathogen
reservoirs and phytosanitary measures. For glasshouse crops, reduction
of insect numbers may also be helpful.
