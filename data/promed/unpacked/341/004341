Bird flu scare in Siliguri
--------------------------
The death of more than 2500 chickens in the last 4 days [4-7 May 2007] at a
Siliguri poultry farm has created a bird flu scare in the town. The
officials are also not taking the death of the chickens lightly, especially
because a bird flu alert has been sounded at the Indo-Bangla border areas
in the region.
The Raj Aziz Poultry Farm at Patharghata village in Matigara on the
outskirts of Siliguri town has been witnessing death of chickens in bulk
since last Thursday [3 May 2007]. The matter came to light this afternoon
when exhausted with the stinking smell emanating out of the carcasses,
locals brought the matter to the notice of the local administration. After
getting information, the Matigara BDO [block development officer] and
officials of the animal husbandry department, Siliguri, reached the spot.
"A large number of dead chickens have been kept at the farm and although we
are yet to figure out the exact number, it should be over 2500," the BDO,
Mr Sushanta Mondal, said.
He said that immediately after the outbreak of the "epidemic", the owner of
the poultry farm left it abandoned, posting a lone chowkidar [caretaker;
watchman] behind. Administrative sources confirmed that the chicks were
supplied to the farm from Malda and thus run the suspicion that those might
had been imported from Bangladesh, where confirmed cases of bird flu were
reported recently. [An administrative map of India, showing West Bengal
bordering Bangladesh, is available at:

The animal husbandry officials, however, have refused to comment on the
nature of the disease that led to the death of a large number of chickens.
"We have collected samples from the dead chickens and the same is being
sent to Kolkata for laboratory tests," said Mr Bidyut Baran Roy, deputy
director in-charge, animal husbandry department, Siliguri.
With the help of local administration, officials of the animal husbandry
department are now busy in burying the carcasses. However, they have not
yet decided about what to do with a few fowls which are still alive.

[India recorded its first outbreak of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian
influenza) H5N1, in Maharashtra Province, on 20 Feb 2006, after
confirmation was made by the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, IVRI
(ICAR), Bhopal. The infection was also reported from Gujarat and Madhya
Pradesh Provinces both in backyard and commercial poultry. The latest case
was found on 18 Apr 2006, in Maharashtra Province, where more than 1 000
000 birds have been culled. The control measures taken included stamping
out, disinfection within a 10 km radius of infected premises, movement
control of goods, and compensation.
On 11 Aug 2006, an official notification to the OIE stated that India
regained its status as notifiable avian influenza free country. (See report
at: <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_05.HTM#Sec5>).
Unfortunately, there is currently a suspicion that the disease might have
recurred; official information, confirming the suspicion or otherwise, is
expected the soonest.
