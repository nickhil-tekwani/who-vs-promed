Evolution of H5N1 avian influenza virus does not increase risk to
public health
--------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization closely monitors the evolution of
influenza viruses and is aware of recent reports of an H5N1 virus
(described as H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1) circulating in poultry in parts of
Asia. Based on available information, this evolution of the H5N1 virus
poses no increased risk to public health. It is not considered unusual
because influenza viruses are constantly evolving, especially in areas
where they circulate regularly in poultry. The WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance and Response System, the group of experts that studies
animal and human influenza viruses that may impact human health,
recognized this new clade in February 2011.

WHO also routinely assesses the public health risk from all animal
influenza viruses. Based on available information, the identification
of this newly reported H5N1 virus clade does not change the current
public health implications of the H5N1 avian influenza viruses for
humans. Human cases of H5N1 infection remain rare and sporadic events,
occurring mostly in areas where H5N1 viruses circulate regularly in
poultry. Human cases could occur wherever the viruses are present in
poultry and when humans might be exposed to infected birds or
contaminated environments.

WHO, OIE downplay importance of new H5N1 variant
------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for
Animal Health (OIE) took pains today [31 Aug 2011] to downplay the
significance of a new H5N1 avian influenza variant that another major
international organisation warned about this week.

In a 29 Aug 2011 statement, the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) said a new H5N1 strain called clade 2.3.2.1 had
emerged recently in Viet Nam and China and that existing poultry
vaccines were ineffective against it. The statement also cited recent
increases in H5N1 bird outbreaks and warned about a possible major
resurgence of the virus.

WHO said today that its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response
System recognized the H5N1 variant in February [2011]. "Based on
available information, this evolution of the H5N1 virus poses no
increased risk to public health," the WHO statement said. "It is not
considered unusual because influenza viruses are constantly evolving,
especially in areas where they circulate regularly in poultry."

The agency further said clade 2.3.2.1 does not change the public
health implications of H5N1 viruses, given the available information.
"Human cases of H5N1 infection remain rare and sporadic events,
occurring mostly in areas where H5N1 viruses circulate regularly in
poultry," the statement said.

The OIE made similar points in a statement today [31 Aug 2011; see
ProMED-mail Avian influenza (56): mutation, vaccine efficacy, OIE 20110901.2678]. It said the emergence of clade 2.3.2.1 is a result of
minor genetic changes that typify the natural evolution of the virus.
"This is not immediate cause for alert but, as with the emergence of
any new strain, reinforces the need for sustained monitoring of
viruses in animal populations so that changes in viruses circulating
in the field are detected at an earliest stage and that most
appropriate disease control strategies are chosen to best protect
animal and public health", the OIE said.

The agency also commented that avian flu vaccines, like human flu
vaccines, need to be tested regularly to see if they are effective
against the viruses in circulation. The OIE reference laboratory in
Harbin, China, has developed a vaccine that, in trials, has protected
poultry from clade 2.3.2.1, the statement said. Once available for
field use, the vaccine will be employed in countries where the new
variant has been identified.

"Registration and manufacturing of a poultry vaccine with the new seed
strain is in progress," the OIE said.

Meanwhile, a clade 2.3.2.1 virus caused the illness of a 59 year old
Hong Kong woman who contracted an H5N1 infection last November (2010)
[see ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (60): China (Hong Kong) 20101122.4228], probably while traveling in Mainland China, according
to a report today [31 Aug 2011] by The Standard, a Hong Kong
newspaper. The story cited Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection
(CHP) as the source of the information. Hong Kong health officials
said at the time that the virus in the woman's case belonged to clade
2.3.2. She recovered from her illness, according to online information
from the CHP.
