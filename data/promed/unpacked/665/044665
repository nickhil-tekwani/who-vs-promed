A 19-year-old man in Bolivia has died from dengue fever, marking the
1st death from the disease since massive floods began ravaging the
country in November [2008]. The teenager who died was from the
northwest part of Bolivia, among the areas hardest hit by the
torrential rains that have killed 53 people nationwide. [The floods
occurred in the northeastern Bolivian tropical lowlands, not the
northwest. - Mods.TY/JW]

With more than 100 cases of dengue fever recorded around the country,
authorities have issued health warnings, fearing epidemics due to
persistent flooding.

[With flooding concentrating the rodent host of Machupo virus,
_Calomys callosus_, the etiologic agent of Bolivian Hemorrhagic
fever, into higher ground where human settlements are found, one
suspects that the risk of this serious disease will also increase. -

This season will be known as the summer of dengue. The number of
cases of the disease has grown frighteningly: the number of
notifications of [cases occurring in] the month of January [2008] has
reached 4290, an increase of 1110 cases since Thursday [14 Feb 2008].
Already, there 4 times more victims of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_
in the city than were registered in January of last year [2007]. In
February [2008], there have already been 205 patients recorded,
totaling 4495 victims since the beginning of the year, more than
January and February 2007 together (2935).

The situation is worrying. If the dengue [cases] continue growing at
this pace, there is the risk of an epidemic, says Victor Berbara,
superintendent of Public Health of the state. According to Victor,
one of the reasons for the great concern is not just the number of
cases but the severity of them. The disease has affected more
children, susceptible to dengue virus 2, which is again circulating.
Half of the dengue hospitalizations are people up to 14 years, said Victor.

According to the superintendent, the summer is propitious for the
proliferation of mosquitoes. The recent rains have fostered the
emergence of outbreaks. This week, the [vector mosquito] eggs will
hatch. We will have more mosquitoes in circulation. The situation is
more critical in Curicica, where 578 cases of the disease have been
recorded this year [2008].

At least 37 people died of dengue fever in Central Java province
during January 2008, a local official said.

According to the record of the Central Java provincial
administration, there were 2347 cases of dengue fever in January
2008, a decrease from 2518 cases, with 62 fatalities in January 2007,
Hartanto, the head of the Central Java Health Service, said here on
Saturday [16 Feb 2008].

During the 1st 2 weeks of February 2008, at least 57 local people
were infected with the dengue fever virus.

[Rapporteur Barrett also sent a similar article in Antara News
(<http://www.antara.co.id/en/arc/2008/2/17/news-focus-dengue-breaks-out-in-java-again/>)
reporting dengue in Central Java that also contained information
about dengue having also broken out in another area outside Java. In
Manado, North Sulawesi, for example, the disease has affected almost
all subdistricts in the town. Head of Manado's Health Service, Dr
Alex Turangan, said in the 1st 6 weeks of 2008, the _Aedes
aegepti_-transmitted virus had infected 154 people, one of whom died.

The cities of Toledo and Talisay are recording the highest number of
dengue fever cases so far this year [2008], with 35 and 28 cases,
respectively, as the fever continues to haunt Cebu Province. Drs.
Cristina Giango of the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) and
Catherine Marie Buscato of the Provincial Epidemiology and
Surveillance Unit (Pesu) are not surprised by the increase. Buscato
said the cases are still a continuation from last year's dengue eruption.

Since the start of the year [2008] until 8 Feb 2008, the province has
seen 304 dengue cases, 7 of which resulted in deaths. January [2008]
alone recorded a total of 232 cases, with 5 deaths; last year's
[2007] figures for the same month were only 83 cases and 2 deaths.
There were only 75 reported cases with no fatalities in February last
year [2007].

Buscato also explained that December 2007 still saw an increase of
dengue cases, and it continued until January. There were a total of
4583 dengue cases recorded last year [2007], which is 368 percent
higher than in 2006. The case fatality rate was 1.7 percent.

In addition to insecticide fogging, residents are urged to empty the
water from flower vases, used tires, tin cans and other possible
breeding sites of dengue [virus]-carrying mosquitoes.

Public health offices throughout Thailand were on alert for dengue
fever after the disease so far killed 4 people this year [2008], with
the accumulated number of patients soaring to 2824 in just over a
month, said Dr. Praj Boonyawongvirot, permanent secretary for Public Health.

The alarming figures were recorded from 1 Jan - 9 Feb this year
[2008], Dr. Praj said. As many as 70 percent of patients were in
provinces in the Central region, he added.

In the same period of 2007, there were 1702 patients and no deaths
reported, Dr. Praj noted. During calendar 2007, 29 people died of
dengue fever, while the number of patients stood at about 60 000.

Dr. Praj said there were signs the number of dengue fever patients
would rise this year [2008] due to the effects of global warming and
striped mosquitoes, which carry the disease and are now able to
reproduce faster and better withstand drought.

Re: The ProMED post on dengue in Cambodia (archive no.
20080120.0255), in 2007, 407 Cambodian people died out of some [40
000] dengue fever cases, or 38 000 cases and 389 deaths, which gives
a CFR of approximately one percent, not 10 percent.

Three deaths attributed to dengue have been reported during the 1st
45 days of the year [2008] in Trincomalee. According to the
Trincomalee Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Sathiskumar, 34 persons
have contracted dengue this year [2008]. The 3 deaths attributed to
dengue have caused panic among the people and public health staff in
the Trincomalee district.

Preventive measures such as spraying pesticide along roads in town
are among the measures taken to stop the spread of this disease.
Sanitary employees too have been employed to inspect every house and
to collect discarded empty coconut shells, bottles, and tires, which
are considered breeding grounds for the dengue mosquito, public
health officials said. There were no deaths due to dengue in the year
2007, although 47 persons contracted the fever. In the year 2006,
only 3 out of 36 patients died due to the disease.
