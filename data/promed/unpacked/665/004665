Cholera Outbreak Strikes Kampala City
-------------------------------------
The Kampala City Council (KCC) yesterday issued a cholera alert. One
person has died of suspected cholera and 7 suspects were admitted to
Mulago Hospital on Wed, 4 Dec 2002.
KCC officials said the outbreak was the first in the city since
1997/98. The Kampala District Health Services chief, Dr. Mishack
Mubiru, denied that 12 other suspects had been admitted to Mulago.
Initial reports said 12 people had been admitted and that a special
unit had been created in the hospital to handle the victims.
Mubiru said the dead person and the 7 suspects were from
Nateete-Kitaka zone in Rubaga Division. "We have alerted our staff
in all division health units and NGO hospitals to report any cases of
diarrhea. We are mobilizing the public on hygiene," Mubiru said.
The first case of suspected cholera in the area was reported on Sun,
1 Dec 2002. City officials attributed the outbreak to poor
sanitation. Mubiru said the cases were manageable and did not
necessitate a special unit. "At the moment, we don't need a special
unit, though with cholera cases you have to isolate the patients. If
the cases increase, we will move to the Mulago hospital football
field like in the 1997/98 outbreak, to avoid cross-infection," he
said.
He said the district had the ability to contain the outbreak but
advised the public and visitors to ensure proper hygiene and to boil
drinking water, avoid pre-packed water and juices sold in polythene
bags, use only tap water, and avoid water from spring wells until
further notice. He warned against eating food prepared in markets
and urged the public to call to report suspected cases of cholera.

Cholera Likely At Gaba Landing Site
-----------------------------------
There is likely to be a cholera outbreak at Gaba landing site in
Makindye division, officials from the department of Public Health in
Kampala district have warned.
The poor disposal of garbage, stagnant water, and the selling of fish
and cooked food in a filthy environment at the site almost forced
Kampala City Council officials to close it recently. The place is
full of flies with the smell of fish drifting in the air.
The KCC officials were touring the landing site, which employs over
500 people. The officials included Francis Lubowa, the city
secretary for health, hygiene and environment protection. "The
situation is very bad. Hygiene is poor," Mubiru said.

Cholera Spreads to Wakiso
-------------------------
Health officials yesterday said the cholera outbreak in the city had
reached worrying proportions with the disease spreading to Wakiso
district and claiming 2 more lives. This brings the death toll to 3.
The Kampala district director of health services, Dr. Mishack Mubiru,
on Sat, 7 Dec 2002, said the epidemic had also spread to Bugolobi, a
city suburb in Mutungo Parish, Nakawa division, bringing the
geographical spread of the epidemic in the city to 2 divisions.
On that day, a person from Banda in Nakawa division died of cholera
in Mulago Hospital while a resident of Nansana, Wakiso district, died
on Fri, 6 Dec 2002 night of the same disease in Mulago Hospital.
Health officials on Thur, 5 Dec 2002, said a child from Nateete
Central zone had died of cholera.
Mubiru announced that plans were underway to establish a cholera
treatment center in Mulago hospital to cater to the increasing number
of patients and to avoid cross-infection.
"We expect that this center will be fully functional by Tue, 10 Dec
2002. It will be isolated like we did in 1997/98. We cannot take
chances because other patients may get infected," Mubiru said. "So
far there have been 14 cumulative cases of victims admitted and
discharged."
Kampala Mayor John Ssebaana Kizito and district health officials
toured Kitaka zone in Rubaga division where the out break was first
reported.
