News of the response
---------------------
- The Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, held a press conference in Kinshasa this Thu [6 Dec 2018] to inform the national and international opinion on the evolution of the Ebola epidemic. His presentation focused mainly on the main points of attention for coordinating the response:
- Situation concern in Butembo and Katwa: In the past 3 weeks, a significant increase in Ebola cases has been observed in Butembo and Katwa. The main challenges in these areas are related to the high density and mobility of the population in this major trading city of North Kivu. Moreover, the expression of reluctance by the community is more violent than the reluctance usually observed during previous Ebola outbreaks. A minority of the population in these areas express their reluctance through the regular destruction of medical equipment and health centers, as well as the physical attacks of health workers.
- Prevention and control of infections: Another unusual aspect of this epidemic is the role played by centers of traditional health practitioners in the nosocomial transmission of the virus. A parallel consequence of these nosocomial infections is the contamination of a large number of healthcare providers. To date, 44 health workers have been infected (9% of the total number of cases), of whom 12 have died. Strengthening infection prevention and control measures in public, private and traditional health facilities is one of the priorities of the teams today.
- Vaccination: With more than 40 000 vaccinated people, vaccination teams have prevented tens of thousands of cases and deaths. Without the intervention of the agents of the response, the country would probably have already reached more than 10 000 Ebola cases in 4 months, or nearly half of the balance sheet of the epidemic in West Africa that lasted 2 years.
- Conclusion: The Minister of Health concluded his presentation by acknowledging the remarkable work of the response teams in preventing the spread of the epidemic to Goma, Bunia and neighboring countries. However, he said the epidemic will last for several months and that the risk of spread will remain high until the epidemic is completely extinguished.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continuation of vaccination of frontline providers in Lubero as a preventive measure in the context of the preparation of the health zone.
- Expanded belt vaccination (or ring plus) started in Otomaber (Komanda health zone) and Aloya (Mabalako health zone).
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 41 226 people have been vaccinated, including 18 270 in Beni [North Kivu], 6272 in Katwa [North Kivu], 4578 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3556 in Butembo [North Kivu], 2092 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 769 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 521 in Oicha [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 409 in Komanda [Ituri], 392 in Lubero [North Kivu], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 274 in Musienene [North Kivu], 241 in Kyondo [Uganda], and 51 in Alimbongo [North Kivu].

1. Bad day on the #Ebola front. +13 cases today. This is only the 2nd time in this outbreak that the increase has been that large. Also, 2 deaths. The totals are now 471 cases & 273 deaths.
2. But for the #Ebola vaccine, however, the case count would be much, much higher, DRC's health minister @OlyIlunga said today. He estimates there might have been 10 000 cases by now without vaccine. To date 41 226 people have been vaccinated.
3. The #Ebola vaccination teams are going to be breaking from the ring vaccine approach (contacts + contacts of contacts) in a couple of places. "Ring plus" means vaccinating more broadly, generally because the security situation precludes multiple trips.
4. @OlyIlunga expressed concern today about the southward movement of the outbreak. Increased cases in Butembo & Katwa (described as twin cities) is complicating containment efforts: e.g., community resistance has resulted in violence aimed at the response teams.]

[2] Summary
- Fri 7 Dec 2018. Rebels strike again near Beni as DRC Ebola total hits 477
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/rebels-strike-again-near-beni-drc-ebola-total-hits-477
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

A pair of violent attacks that resulted in civilian deaths were reported yesterday [6 Dec 2018] in Beni, one of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) main Ebola hot spots, as 6 more cases were reported in the ongoing outbreak. In other developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) revealed new details about its investigation into a spurt of new cases in Komanda, a part of Ituri province that had not reported cases for several weeks.

Beni has been the setting for several attacks in recent months, some of which led to temporary pauses in Ebola response operations. In the latest incidents, Ugandan rebels with the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) killed 18 civilians in 2 separate attacks, according to a report from Radio Okapi, a news network run by the United Nations mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and the Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss nongovernmental organization.

According to the report, the 1st incident occurred yesterday morning [6 Dec 2018] in Mangolikene, about 9 miles [14.5 km] northeast of Beni, where the ADF attacked farmers in their fields, killing 13. The 2nd attack occurred yesterday evening [6 Dec 2018] in Paida district in the eastern outskirts of Beni, killing 5 people and wounding 2 more.

The fresh violence comes about 3 weeks after a joint mission between MONUSCO and DRC government fighters targeted an ADF stronghold near Beni, which resulted in the deaths of 7 UN peacekeepers.

In its daily update today [7 Dec 2018], the DRC's health ministry reported 6 more confirmed Ebola cases, including 4 in Katwa, located east of Butembo, and 2 in Beni. Also, 2 more deaths were reported, one from Beni and the other from Butembo.

The developments lift the overall outbreak total to 477 cases, 429 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. The fatality count has risen to 275. Health officials are still investigating 94 suspected Ebola cases.

In vaccination developments, the health ministry said wide-belt immunization, presumably broader than the standard ring vaccination strategy, is underway in reemerging hot spots, the Komanda and Mabalako health zones. Overall, 41 817 people have received Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine since the campaign began in August [2018].

In a weekly snapshot of the DRC's Ebola outbreak, the WHO said the event continues to be a "multifaceted challenge," but it is still confident the outbreak can be contained with proven steps and new tools, such as vaccines and therapies. The agency said new cases in Komanda and Mabalako emerged after more than 2 Ebola incubation periods had passed with no new cases, underscoring the risk of reintroduction and the need to keep up enhanced surveillance. Komanda's cases are linked to an infection of a mother and her children in Beni.

"While insecurity in Komanda will challenge the response activities, control measures including contact tracing and vaccination were initiated soon after the detection of cases," the WHO added.

Another factor fueling some of the latest cases is inadequate infection prevention and control practices at public and private health centers, a situation known to amplify Ebola outbreaks. So far, 44 health workers have been infected in the outbreak -- 12 fatally -- and at least one of the newly reported patients likely contracted Ebola from an infected health worker during a routine medical visit, the WHO said.

Also, the WHO addressed concerns about the disproportionate number of women and children infected in the outbreak. So far, females account for 62% of cases, and of that group 18 were pregnant and 7 were breastfeeding or had recently delivered.

The virus has infected 27 babies younger than 1 year old, and killed 21 of them. A total of 9 infections have been recorded in newborns, and children younger than 15 years make up 24% of all of the outbreak cases.

Several factors are probably contributing to the higher burden in women and children, the WHO said, including exposure in health settings, participation in traditional burial practices, transmission within families, and differences in health-seeking behavior. A spike in malaria cases and inadequate infection control practices in healthcare settings are also probably playing a role in high Ebola rates in children, according to the report.

[4] Grave situation continues
- Fri 7 Dec 2018. Congo's deadly Ebola outbreak spreads as vaccine shortages loom
[Time, abridged, edited]
http://time.com/5473608/congo-ebola-outbrea-spread-butembo/
[Byline: Carley Petesch and Cara Anna]

The 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history has spread to a major city in eastern Congo, as health experts worry whether the stock of an experimental vaccine will stand up to the demands of an epidemic with no end in sight. Butembo, with more than one million residents, is now reporting cases of the deadly hemorrhagic fever. That complicates Ebola containment work already challenged by rebel attacks elsewhere that have made tracking the virus almost impossible in some isolated villages.

"We are very concerned by the epidemiological situation in the Butembo area," said John Johnson, project coordinator with Medecins Sans Frontieres in the city. New cases are increasing quickly in the eastern suburbs and outlying isolated districts, the medical charity said.

Without the teams that have vaccinated more than 41 000 people so far, this outbreak could have already seen more than 10 000 Ebola cases, the health ministry said. This is by far the largest deployment of the promising but still experimental Ebola vaccine, which is owned by Merck. The company keeps a stockpile of 300 000 doses, and preparing them takes months.

"We are extremely concerned about the size of the vaccine stockpile," WHO's emergencies director, Dr. Peter Salama, told the STAT media outlet in an interview this week, saying 300 000 doses is not sufficient as urban Ebola outbreaks become more common.

Health workers, contacts of Ebola victims and their contacts have received the vaccine in a "ring vaccination" approach, but in some cases all residents of hard-to-reach communities have been offered it. The prospect of a mass vaccination in a major city like Butembo has raised concerns. Salama called the approach "extremely impractical."

A WHO spokesman said shipments of doses arrive almost every week to ensure a sufficient supply for the ring vaccination. "No interruptions of vaccine supply have occurred to date," Tarik Jasarevic said in an e-mail to The Associated Press (AP). "Merck is actively working to ensure sufficient number of doses continue to be available to meet the potential demand."

This Ebola outbreak is like no other, with deadly attacks by rebel groups forcing containment work to pause for days at a time. Some wary locals have resisted vaccinations or safe burials of Ebola victims as health workers battle misinformation in a region that has never encountered the virus before. A "fringe population" has regularly destroyed medical equipment and attacked workers, Health Minister Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga told reporters on Wed [5 Nov 2018].

The outbreak "remains serious and unpredictable," the WHO said in an assessment released Wed [5 Nov 2018]. A total of 9 health zones have reported new cases in the past week, and some have been unrelated to known victims, meaning that gaps in tracking remain in a region with a dense, highly mobile population. Thousands of people have been organized by Red Cross societies and others to go house-to-house dispelling rumors and checking on possible contacts of victims.

Dr. Fatoumata Nafo-Traore, Africa regional director for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, joined one awareness campaign in the outbreak's epicenter, Beni, this week. The head of one family thanked her for the face-to-face contact, saying he did not even have a radio and did not understand what was happening. "Ignorance is the enemy," another resident said.

Given the years of conflict in eastern Congo, it is essential that households trust why the health workers are there, Nafo-Traore told the AP. While she called the insecurity "very worrying," she said that with new tools at hand, including vaccines, "there is great hope."

- Fri 7 Dec 2018. "Like a horror film": the efforts to contain Ebola in a war zone
[Washington Post, abridged, edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/like-a-horror-film-the-efforts-to-contain-ebola-in-a-war-zone/2018/12/06/435ee0f4-f738-11e8-8642-c9718a256cbd_story.html?utm_term=.325fead71537
[Byline: Max Bearak]

Julienne Anoko, a medical anthropologist, was in the shower when she heard the 1st pops of gunfire. Initially, she thought it might be the action movie she had left playing on high volume. Then the wall shook.

The violence in eastern Congo, which has stymied the international response to a growing Ebola outbreak in the region, had arrived at the guesthouse used by many of those working to prevent the disease's spread. Attacks by armed groups happen on a daily basis across Congo's North Kivu province, where the Ebola virus has been spreading since August [2018], infecting almost 500 people and killing more than 270.

The constant insecurity in North Kivu has proved an enormous obstacle, thwarting attempts to the contain the virus. By WHO's estimate, the outbreak will go on for at least another 6 months.

"The fear we feel, and that the community feels, makes our job 10 times harder," said Abdourahmane Diallo, a Guinean doctor who coordinates the administration of an experimental Ebola vaccine. He was at a different compound in Beni that was attacked the same day as Anoko's.

"We know that violence is a constant risk. But that's why I was ready to go to work the very next day," Diallo said. "We simply cannot stop our response if we hope to overcome this outbreak."

This is the 1st Ebola outbreak during which health workers have had to regularly don bulletproof helmets and vests. To reach at least 20% percent of Ebola-affected areas, health workers need armed police or UN escorts, said Michel Yao, WHO's response coordinator in Beni.

The US government withdrew its only personnel in the region in late August [2018] and has no plans to redeploy them. The WHO has 300 specialists from around the world in North Kivu. Those on the ground describe a chaotic effort to either negotiate with or simply avoid the region's various militias.

"It turns into a cat-and-mouse game -- we are the mouse trying to evade the armed groups," said Anoko, who is from Cameroon. But Anoko, whose job entails conducting extensive interviews with locals, cautioned against the assumption that health workers are being targeted for their work. "There's been decades of war, it cannot be so simply understood," she said.

A quarter-century of vicious conflict, triggered by spillover from the Rwandan genocide in 1994, has been accompanied by deprivations of food, medicine and shelter that have shattered North Kivu's society. Amid the widespread trauma and desperation, foreign companies have continued to extract the region's extensive mineral wealth, often paying protection money to armed groups, stoking the conflict. The UN peacekeeping mission -- established in 1999 and now the most expensive in the world -- has been the target of violent protests because of its perceived ineffectiveness. Suspicion of outsiders is common and rooted in history.

To protect themselves, many communities have taken up arms. The resulting militias, which vary greatly in size, are collectively known as Mai-Mai. Other groups, such as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan-origin extremist group infamous for its child soldiers, routinely skirmish with Congolese government forces and attack anyone they perceive to be collaborating with them. The brunt of their vengeance falls on civilians.

An effective Ebola response relies on persuading people in the affected area to cooperate with health workers, but the distrust sown by years of conflict makes that much more difficult. Yao, the WHO coordinator in Beni, said not a week goes by in which his teams are not attacked by skeptical locals. "Even yesterday, one of our investigations team's car was destroyed and a team member's house was burned," said Yao, who is Ivorian Canadian.

Generating trust is the task of medical anthropologists like Anoko, as well as local politicians and traditional leaders. On top of the conflict, they are contending with Ebola's newness in North Kivu. Although this is Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak, there has never been one in this region, and knowledge of the virus is low.

Marie Roseline Belizaire, a Haitian doctor managing the WHO's response in Butembo, a city of 1.3 million south of Beni where the disease is also spreading, has tried to infuse money into the local economy as a way of buying trust. Recently, for instance, she purchased 30 motorbikes for her team locally, even though she had clearance to have them imported.

But Belizaire also takes a more hands-on approach. Ebola is being transmitted in worryingly large numbers in Mai-Mai-controlled suburbs of Butembo. She spends days negotiating with the militias for access.

"New Mai-Mai groups keep calling us and making their demands; it's like a new one every day," she said. "But they are very hostile to outsiders coming in. In some cases, we've agreed to have them send community members to us so we can train them instead of the other way around."

While many Mai-Mai groups are open to such arrangements, the ADF won't engage. Local workers have taken to calling an ADF-controlled area between the towns of Mbau, Eringite and Kamango "le triangle de la mort" -- the triangle of death. That's where many are worried Ebola transmission is happening out of sight of the responders.

Congo's health minister, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said in an interview that he deeply appreciated the international community's help and that with the help of Congolese health workers, "thousands of cases and deaths have been avoided so far."

But with every attack comes a pause in the health workers' response, and with each pause a jump in the number of cases. "We can't abandon these people in North Kivu," Anoko said. "They have suffered so much. We have great sympathy for them."

- Fri 7 Dec 2018. Ebola detectives race to identify hidden sources of infection as outbreak spreads
[Nature, abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07618-0?utm_source=twt_nnc&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=naturenews& sf203840675=1

Efforts to trace contacts of people with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been hampered by mistrust in conflict-ridden outbreak zone. As the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak in the DRC shifts into the war-weary city of Butembo, public health workers are trying to stamp out new infections from an inadvertent source: unregulated health centres.

Decades of political instability in the northeastern DRC, the site of the epidemic, have fostered the growth of informal clinics that offer traditional and modern medicine. These centres treat people for malaria and other common illnesses, filling the vacuum left by the lack of a functional health system. But they are not designed to prevent the spread of a virus as dangerous as Ebola -- which has put their patrons at high risk, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Health officials have begun trying to lessen the centres' load by pre-emptively giving out malaria medication in communities.

The push highlights a central challenge to ending the epidemic, which is now the 2nd-largest on record: Although experimental drugs and a vaccine have helped to limit Ebola's reach, two-thirds of new infections cannot be linked to existing cases. That has left epidemiologists racing to identify overlooked routes of infection. And conventional prevention measures have been thwarted by conditions in the northeastern DRC, where decades of severe conflict have left millions of people dead, and millions more traumatized and homeless.

"I have lived through many outbreaks, but this is the worst one," says Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director-general of the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa. Widespread mistrust of health workers and the risk that the DRC's upcoming presidential election will spark violent protests could make the Ebola response even more difficult in the weeks to come, he says.

In the city of Beni in North Kivu province, health workers have been struggling to identify and monitor people who might have been touched by someone in the throes of an infection. This work is crucial to containing the epidemic, but many people with Ebola will not name those they might have infected, says Annick Antierens, a strategic adviser at the humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (also known as Doctors Without Borders).

"People are afraid and mistrust the system, so the contact lists are not very good," Antierens says. And some people with Ebola die without seeking medical help, or receive care only after they are too ill to communicate.

As a result, 66% of Ebola cases are springing up outside known chains of transmission. "When you look at a proportion like that, this outbreak should really be out of control," says Salama. But on average, each person with Ebola in Beni is infecting just one other person, which means the outbreak there is continuing -- but not exploding. "We believe this is because of extensive vaccination," says Salama. More than 40 000 people have received the experimental rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine since 8 Aug [2018].

Analyses of patient data exposed the unregulated health centres as one unexpected source of cases, the WHO says. During some weeks in September and October [2018], more than half of new Ebola infections were in children under the age of 16 years. Epidemiologists deduced that parents were taking their feverish children to the health centres for treatment, unwittingly exposing them to Ebola.

For years, the informal clinics have served communities that lack reliable, regulated healthcare facilities. Caretakers rarely have sterile equipment or even enough beds for patients, who must share, says Ibrahima Soce-Fall, director of the WHO's emergency operations for Africa, in Brazzaville in the neighbouring Republic of Congo. "Someone who has malaria will go to these facilities, and drink from the same cup as the patient before them, or get an injection with the same needle," he says. "But you cannot tell people not to go there, since there is no alternative."

Instead, the WHO, the DRC government and aid organizations are attempting to support the clinics. They offer anyone who treats people -- including traditional healers -- the Ebola vaccine and training on basic measures to prevent the spread of infection, such as isolating people who are vomiting blood or showing other signs of Ebola. The task is enormous. There are an estimated 300 unregistered clinics in Beni alone, and outreach takes time, Antierens says: "We aren't just dropping off soap."

Ebola responders are also distributing antimalaria drugs broadly across Beni. The DRC saw rising rates of malaria in 2017, with 435 000 deaths from the disease.

But greater challenges lie ahead as the centre of the outbreak moves from Beni to Butembo, an even more dangerous part of North Kivu. After years of arson, rape, murder and hunger, some communities in the area question the intentions of outsiders who are there to fight Ebola, Salama says; the disease can seem less frightening than these other, long-standing threats. And some people distrust Ebola treatment centres because roughly half of their patients die in the first couple of days -- in part because many arrive too late for help, Antierens says.

[5] Women and children
- Fri 7 Dec 2018. Ebola cases surge in Congo, with women and children disproportionately sick
[CNN, edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/06/health/ebola-women-children-africa-bn/index.html
[Byline: Susan Scutti]

There have been 18 more cases of illness and 5 more deaths reported in just 2 days in the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the Ministry of Health. Since the outbreak began, the total number of probable cases is now 471, including 273 deaths, the ministry reported Thu [6 Dec 2018]. Public health authorities are investigating an additional 106 suspected cases, the ministry indicated.

This is the 10th outbreak since 1976 in Congo, where the virus is endemic, and the 2nd this year [2018]. It is also now the 2nd-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history, topped only by one in West Africa in 2014, when the disease killed more than 11 000 people.

On average, Ebola -- which causes fever, severe headache and in some cases hemorrhaging -- kills about half of those infected, but fatality rates in individual outbreaks have varied. The latest outbreak in Congo, which began in August [2018], has a case fatality rate of 57%.

The ministry also reported that 149 people have recovered. However, 44 health workers have been infected with the virus, of whom 12 have died.

North Kivu province, which includes the cities of Beni, Kalunguta and Mabalako, remains the epicenter of the outbreak, although cases have been reported in neighboring Ituri province, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The 2 provinces are among the most populated in the nation and border Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.

Not only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO. "Responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in northeastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be a multifaceted challenge," WHO said in a report Thu [6 Dec 2018].

WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola. Another complication: a high number of malaria cases in the region.

Women and children are disproportionately sick in the Ebola outbreak, WHO reported Thu [6 Dec 2018]. To date, females accounted for 62% of overall cases in which a patient's sex was recorded, while children younger than 15 accounted for 24% of cases.

The "multitude of factors" that probably contributes to those imbalanced numbers include greater involvement in traditional burial practices, transmission within family groups (including between mothers caring for sick family members) and the impact of ongoing conflict in affected areas, according to WHO. "Of note, 46% of female cases (84 of 181) reported having attended funerals, in contrast to 31% of male cases (37 of 118)," WHO noted. The health ministry is working with UNICEF and other partners to reduce the numbers of women and children infected.

The ministry also reported that more than 41 000 people have been given an experimental vaccine since early August [2018]. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major clinical trial conducted during an outbreak in Guinea, according to WHO.

Fresh guidance issued Thu [6 Dec 2018] by the Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies Working Group, an international team of 17 experts, seeks to ensure that pregnant women are no longer excluded from receiving vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The public health preparedness report, which offers concrete steps for equitably addressing the needs of pregnant women, includes 22 total recommendations. One is that during an epidemic, such as the current one, the default setting should be to offer vaccines to pregnant women, not the reverse. Another suggestion is that decisions about whether to offer pregnant women vaccines should consider the risks faced by pregnant women and their babies if vaccine is denied and not just the potential risks of the vaccine.

[Original report: Pregnant women and vaccines against emerging epidemic threats. Ethics Guidance for Preparedness, Research, and Response. The PREVENT working group. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/574503059f72665be88193e9/t/5c082429c2241ba2553ee1f5/1544037418944/PREVENT-Web.pdf]

Zika virus, H1N1, and Ebola have called attention to the ways in which infectious disease outbreaks can severely -- and at times uniquely -- affect the health interests of pregnant women and their offspring. These serious and often disproportionate risks underscore the critical need to proactively consider the interests of pregnant women and their offspring in efforts to combat epidemic threats. This is especially true for vaccines -- essential tools in the public health response to infectious diseases.

Historically, the needs of pregnant women have not been adequately represented in the
development of biomedical interventions, including vaccines. Despite increasing support of maternal immunization strategies and efforts to develop certain vaccines specifically targeted to pregnant women, the vast majority of new vaccine products are rarely designed with pregnant women in mind. Moreover, widespread failure to appropriately include pregnant women in vaccine research means that evidence about safety and efficacy in pregnancy has been limited and late in coming. As a result, in numerous outbreaks and epidemics, pregnant women have been denied opportunities to receive vaccines that would have protected them and their offspring from the ravages of these diseases.

There are many causes for this widespread exclusion, including misinterpretations or overly cautious interpretations of what is allowed under research regulations and international norms, as well as concerns about legal liability. Moreover, biomedical research with pregnant women is ethically complicated. These challenges can become even more complex when vaccine research and vaccine campaigns are conducted in response to emerging pathogens, with additional layers of urgency and uncertainty.

But developing the evidence base for vaccine use in pregnancy is important. This is because:

- Pregnancy alters metabolism and immune response, which can impact vaccine effectiveness
- There may be significant benefits of vaccinating during pregnancy
- Pregnant women are likely to have unintentional vaccine exposures in any immunization campaign targeting reproductive-aged women
- Vaccines can present safety risks that are unique to pregnancy, including fetal risks
- Understanding actual risks and benefits of candidate vaccines can critically inform care and the broader public health response

Guidance is needed to ensure that the needs of pregnant women and their offspring are fairly addressed, in new approaches to public health preparedness, in vaccine research and development (R&D), and in vaccine delivery.

Increasingly, efforts are underway to prospectively invest in vaccine development in order to be better equipped to handle emerging epidemic threats in the future. There is an opportunity, now, to forge a path for a more inclusive vaccine R&D agenda and have epidemic responses that ensure pregnant women and their offspring fairly benefit from investments and scientific advancements that generate new effective vaccines.

Pregnancy Research Ethics for Vaccines, Epidemics, and New Technologies (PREVENT) is committed to developing concrete, actionable, consensus-driven ethics guidance on how to equitably include the interests of pregnant women and their offspring in vaccine R&D for priority pathogens and emerging epidemic threats. Our approach is multidisciplinary, bringing together a team of scholars and scientists with expertise in bioethics, maternal immunization, maternal-fetal medicine, obstetrics, pediatrics, philosophy, public health, and vaccine research.

In our 1st year, we developed guidance specific to the Zika crisis: Pregnant Women & the Zika Virus Vaccine Research Agenda: Ethics Guidance on Priorities, Inclusion, and Evidence Generation. This Guidance is the product of The Ethics Working Group on ZIKV Research & Pregnancy, an interdisciplinary group of international experts in vaccinology, maternal and child health, public health, and ethics.

In our 2nd year, we expanded upon our initial recommendations to address the broader context of emerging and re-emerging pathogens, with 22 concrete recommendations, organized around 3 key areas: public health preparedness, R&D, and vaccine delivery. This Guidance -- Pregnant Women & Vaccines Against Emerging Epidemic Threats: Ethics Guidance on Preparedness, Research & Response -- provides a roadmap for the ethically responsible, socially just, and respectful inclusion of the interests of pregnant women in the development and deployment of vaccines against emerging pathogens.
