MANAMA: An outbreak of diarrhoea, stomach pain and fever in Bahrain may be
linked to certain foods kept too long in the fridge, says a medical
technologist. This 'mini-epidemic' has sparked a warning to the public.
They are being especially urged to monitor their consumption of eggs,
chicken and long-life milk. There may also be a risk from the consumption
of dried baby's milk and baby food that has been kept too long, warned BDF
Hospital acting chief medical laboratory technologist Younis Ali Mohammed.
Mr. Mohammed said "[W]e tested the stool samples of 300 hospital patients,
aged four months and above, who had these symptoms. We found that 37 of
them had _Campylobacter_. The unusually high prevalence of this organism
was unnatural, because it is very rare. Others surveyed had other more
common organisms. "
"Among the questions we asked in the survey were inquiries about diets. We
asked patients what foods they ate before these symptoms appeared. The
study found that all their diets included eggs, chicken and imported
long-life milk." Mr. Mohammed said those surveyed came from all over Bahrain.

[According to Benenson's "Control of Communicable Diseases in Man,"
_Campylobacter_ is responsible for 5-14% of diarrhea worldwide, therefore
not exactly rare. Long-life milk is irradiated and does not contain living
pathogens, but may become contaminated if left open in contact with other
foods - Mod.JW]
