Scores of people suffering with the crippling fever chikungunya have
been reported from West Bengal's North 24 Pargana District.
Of the 36 samples that were earlier sent to the Indian Council for
Medical Research (ICMR), 21 have tested positive.
Chikungunya virus spreads through mosquito bite and causes a
[usually] non-fatal self-limiting illness marked by high fever,
headache, severe joint pain, rashes and nausea.
Health officials are working overtime in the region to provide
assistance and curb the spread of disease.
Medical camps have been set up, and health workers are taking
precautionary measures like spraying disinfectants [insecticides? -
Mod.TY] in villages. Health workers are also carrying out
door-to-door visits to keep a check on patients. "Our health staff
and doctors are visiting houses and identifying the cases, and,
accordingly, we are giving priority in treating the patients," said
Kusum Kumar Adhikari, Health Officer.
The outbreak has caused an alarm in the region. "We are really
terrified," said Padma Sarkar, a villager. Like dengue, another
mosquito borne disease, there is no vaccine for chikungunya [virus],
and at best, symptoms can be countered through painkillers, intake of
plenty of fluids and lots of rest.
Chikungunya, 1st reported in India in Kerala in 2000, has taken a
toll of several hundred lives. Thousands were admitted to hospitals
across the State since May this year [2007] following the
southwestern monsoon.

[It appears that this is an extension of the chikungunya virus
epidemic reported previously in Calcutta and vicinity (ProMED archive
no. 20070807.2568). ProMED would appreciate further information
concerning the number of confirmed chikungunya virus infection cases
in this area and the results of the mosquito vector control campaign.
