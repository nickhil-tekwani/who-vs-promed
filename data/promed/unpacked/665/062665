[This is a correction of "Avian influenza: Indonesia (02): (KT)
20100106.0054". The following newswire, derived from the above
source, erroneously indicated "South Kalimantan" province as the
location of the described outbreaks. However, the outbreaks are in
fact located in the Central Kalimantan province (in Indonesian
Kalimantan Tengah, often abbreviated to Kalteng); map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/012n>. The investigating laboratory is in
South Kalimantan. We are grateful to Hon Ip, USGS National Wildlife
Health Center, Madison, WI, USA for drawing our attention to the
inaccuracy. The following text is the corrected one. - Mod.AS]

Kapuas, central Kalimantan: Mass chicken deaths confirmed H5N1 positive
--------------------------------------------
Thousands of chickens are confirmed to have died of bird flu H5N1
virus in Kabupaten (District or Regency) Kapuas. A confirmation test
on dead bird specimens, such as organ, serum and swab, was done by
the Veterinary Investigation and Diagnostic Center (BPPV) Regional V,
Banjarbaru, South Kalimantan.

A total of 82 specimens were collected from dead chickens in several
sub-districts (kecamatan), i.e. Pulau Petak, Selat, Kapuas Timur and
Basarang [all located within the district Kapuas, province Central Kalimantan].

For Desa Batu Nidan, Kecamatan Basarang, 3 backyard chicken samples
tested positive for bird flu infection.

For Kuala Kapuas, one broiler chicken sample tested positive for bird
flu infection.

Sudden deaths in chickens in Kuala Kapuas were seen at the beginning
of December 2009 until 3 Jan 2010. Total chicken deaths in 7
sub-districts are 6615 chickens. Numbers in detail according to
sub-districts are: Kecamatan Basarang 3909, Selat 360, Petak 953,
Kapuas Hilir 422, Kapuas timur 255, Kapuas Murung 500 and Kapuas
Kuala 16 chickens.

So far, bird flu H5N1 virus [has] attacked only chickens in Central
Kalimantan. No bird to human virus transmission is reported.

[According to FAO information, HPAI has become endemic on Indonesian
main islands Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi and probably Bali, with sporadic
outbreaks reported elsewhere. Village prevalence varies widely. Only
2 of its 33 provinces have not reported the occurrence of H5N1 HPAI.
The detailed epidemiological information is available due to the
implementation of the "participatory disease surveillance and
response" (PDSR) programme that targets village-type poultry
production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of virus
circulation in the village environment. The programme is financially
supported by FAO with USAID and AusAID, and is operating in 331/448
(74 percent) districts through 31 Local Disease Control Centres
(LDCCs) in 27 out of 33 provinces in Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi
and Kalimantan, including all known endemically infected areas.
Larger and less densely populated provinces report HPAI outbreaks
less often than more densely populated provinces.
