[There was an apparent error in the initial WHO outbreak report which
reported 100 deaths. The revised report states that there were only
19 deaths and 100 cases. ProMED thanks J. Sasse for alerting us to
this. - Mod.LL]
"As of 13 Jun 2006, WHO has received reports of 100 cases of
suspected pneumonic plague, including 19 deaths in Ituri district,
Oriental province." (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_06_14/en/index.html> for full report).
