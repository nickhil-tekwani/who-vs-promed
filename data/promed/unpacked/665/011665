The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, commonly called _E. coli_, with a possible link to leafy greens. A specific product has not been identified yet, and the investigation is ongoing. At this time, the risk to Canadians is low. However, Canadians are reminded to follow safe food handling practices to avoid illness.

_E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry and other animals. Most _E. coli_ are harmless to humans, but some varieties carry genes that allow them to cause illness. While most people made ill by _E. coli_experience a few days of upset stomach and then recover fully, infections can sometimes be life threatening.

Ongoing Investigation
--------
There have been 12 cases of _E. coli_ with a matching genetic fingerprint reported in Alberta (9), Saskatchewan (1), Ontario (1), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1). The illness onset dates range from 13 to 31 Mar 2015.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to leafy greens has emerged as a possible source of illness. Leafy greens can include all varieties of lettuces and other green leaf vegetables such as kale, spinach, arugula, or chard. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's investigation into the food source is ongoing. If products are identified, the Agency will inform the public and ensure that they are promptly removed from the marketplace.

The Public Health Agency routinely investigates multi-provincial gastro-intestinal illness outbreaks, including _E. coli_, in an effort to determine if illnesses are linked to the same source. The Agency will update Canadians when new information becomes available.

Who is most at risk?
------
Although anyone can get an _E. coli_ infection, pregnant women, those with compromised immune systems, young children and older adults are most at risk for developing serious complications.

What you should do
------
The following tips will help you reduce your risk of infection with _E. coli_ or other food-borne illnesses:
- Wash fresh fruits and vegetables before eating them, clean counters and cutting boards and wash your hands regularly.
- Bacteria can grow in the danger zone between 4 and 60 degrees C (40-140 degrees F). Keep cold foods cold at or below 4 degrees C (40 F) and keep hot foods hot at or above 60 degrees C (140 F).
- Keep refrigerators clean and at a temperature below 4 C (40 F). Install a thermometer in your fridge to be sure.
- Place raw meat, poultry and seafood in containers on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Use containers that are large enough to prevent raw juices from dripping onto other food or touching other food.
- Keep raw food away from other food while shopping, storing, preparing and serving foods.
- Read labels and follow cooking and storage instructions for all food. When buying food, make sure to check the "best before" date, and if the product has expired, let the store know.
- Use warm soapy water to clean knives, cutting boards, utensils, your hands and any surfaces that have come in contact with food, especially meat and fish.
- Refrigerate or freeze perishable food within 2 hours of cooking.
- Freeze or consume leftovers within four days of cooking. Always reheat leftovers until steaming hot before eating.

What the Public Health Agency of Canada is doing
----------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada in collaboration with federal and provincial/territorial partners, will continue to monitor for and investigate any new cases of _E. coli_ that may be related to this outbreak as part of its routine surveillance activities.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope and source of this outbreak. Although classically associated with uncooked ground beef, a number of other sources including a variety of fresh produce, contaminated with the organism anywhere from the farm to the table, can be the source.

The following is derived from Lutwick LI: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli infections. In: Confronting Emerging Zoonoses: The One Health Paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds) Springer, Tokyo, Japan, 2014, pp 77-112.

"_E. coli_ is by far the most common facultative (can grow both aerobically or anaerobically) Gram negative bacillus in the human intestinal tract. Within its niche in the intestinal tract, the organism is part of the normal bacterial flora with many functions to help its human host including preventing pathogen colonization, degrading dietary and in situ-produced compounds and producing nutrients. Although the pathogenicity of these normal flora strains of the organism occurs when the commensal is allowed to enter sterile parts of the body including the peritoneum, urinary tract and blood stream, some E. coli strains have acquired virulence factors to become enteropathogenic for man. There are currently 6 enteropaths of the bacterium described (enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, diffuse adhering, enteroaggregative and enterohemorrhagic). The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is the potentially the most dangerous and is the one which is zoonotic in origin (primarily from cattle) and the one generally just called _E. coli_ in the lay press." - Mod.LL
