DR Congo confirmed bubonic plague (more than 200 cases)
-------------------------------------------------------
Between 15 Nov 2020 and 13 Dec 2020, the Biringi health zone, located in the territory of Aru, Ituri province, DR Congo, reported 151 suspected cases of bubonic plague with 5 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 3.3%).

On 22 Nov 2020, the head nurse of the Kumbuku health center (trained in plague outbreak investigation while working in Aru health zone) diagnosed plague in an 11 year old boy brought in as an emergency to the health center by his family in an altered general status (coma, high fever, and bilateral swelling of axillary lymph nodes). The boy passed away a couple of minutes later. Alerted by this event, the head nurse visited the household of the deceased patient in the Onuoyia village (N 02 deg 48'13.1", E 030 deg 29'33.2'') to investigate further. He found that the 6 year old brother of the patient had similar symptoms without complication (consistent with the case definition for suspected bubonic plague - see further) and recovered after a 10-day treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. However, a member of the network of volunteer community relay (RECO, or relais communautaire) notified the head nurse that on 15 Nov 2020 an 11 year old girl from the same family living in a neighboring household also died in a clinical picture of chills, headache, and painful lymph node swelling behind the ear. The parents treated the child for malaria, with no improvement. The girl identified as the index case died in the community on 15 Nov 2020.

On 27 Nov 2020, a 3 year old girl of the mother's family, who attended the funeral wake of the index case, presented with fever, painful swelling of the left axillary lymph node, and abdominal pain. She was treated at home for malaria, again, by the parent, with no improvement. The girl died on the 29 Nov 2020. The experienced head nurse of Kumbuku health area then organized an active case-tracing and surveillance in the community with the help of the RECOs. However, the information did not reach the central bureau of the health zone before 14 Dec 2020.

Suspected plague is defined -- according to WHO -- in any person with a rapid onset of fever, chills, severe malaise, and prostration accompanied by the following: 1. for bubonic plague, very painful swelling of the lymph nodes (bubo); 2. for pneumonic plague, coughing with blood-stained sputum, chest pain, and breathing difficulties. In view of the increased number of people affected through active surveillance, the health center nurse issued an alert to the health zone central bureau for further investigation.

As soon as they were able to investigate, on 21 Dec 2020, the Biringi and Aru health zone medical team, consisting of the Biringi zone chief medical officer, the nurse supervisor of the Aru health zone, and the laboratory technician from Aru General Hospital, investigated 58 cases and 5 community deaths reported at the Azumba and Kumbuku health centers. They took 9 samples of bubo aspirate, which were sent to the national reference laboratory (Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale, INRB), 6 of which tested positive with a rapid diagnostic test for plague. The team visited the villages of Azumba and Onu Oyia (Biringi health zone), where 41 additional cases were identified among the population with the help of the RECO. In addition, rat epizootics were reported in the immediate vicinity of the outbreak areas around the beginning of November 2020 in the Onu Ayia, Odhu, Linya, and Ayaya villages. Moreover, according to the zone chief medical officer, access to drinking water for the entire health zone is only 2%, which is an additional public health problem for ensuring sound hygiene. With the degrading situation, the Biringi health zone medical team called on Malteser International NGO for support. The financial and logistical intervention of Malteser International allowed to implement chemoprophylaxis and treat about 86 suspected cases and 2129 contacts with doxycycline (100 mg), while 152 sick patient's homes were dusted with deltamethrin.

Due to the high number of cases (more than 200) and the proximity of refugee camps and internally displaced people, a 2nd mission was carried out by the Ituri Provincial Division of Health (DPS) team with the financial support of UNICEF and WHO. Between 18 and 26 Dec 2020, they conducted an in-depth rapid outbreak investigation mission (semi-structured interviews, flea collection, and dead rodent sampling, following an original protocol developed in collaboration with international colleagues) in the Biringi health zone and brought 9 tons of UNICEF equipment to the Biringi, Aru, and Aungba health zones, which regularly notify plague (PPE [personal protective equipment], WASH [water, sanitation and hygiene], sanitation material).

Flea traps (light traps) were also placed for 3 consecutive nights in 10 houses (21-24 Dec 2020) in the affected villages (Onu Ayia, Odhu, Linya, and Ayaya), and 7 houses had been dusted (insecticide) between 8 and 10 Dec 2020 by the Biringi health zone team. A total of 27 fleas were collected, namely _Ctenocephalides felis strongylus_ (26) and _Ctenocephalides canis_ (1). It is worth noting that DNA of _Yersinia pestis_ had been detected in the former species further south within the Ituri endemic plague focus in 2007 (Leulmi, et al., PLOS NTD, 2014; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003152).

Six RDT [rapid diagnostic test] for plague were also tested on dead rats (_Rattus rattus_) found in the house and vicinity of patients' households; one was positive for plague.

As of 31 Dec 2020, the Biringi health zone has reported 256 cases of bubonic plague with 7 deaths. Overall, women (51.2%) and men (48.7%) are equally affected; however, adolescents (under 17 years old) seem the most at risk, representing 78.9% of the sick people. The behavioral risk factors of exposure for this observation have not been solved.

In this region, where there are nearly 47 000 internally displaced refugees from South Sudan, with some moving freely between the 2 countries, the risk of a regional flare-up is to be considered if the epidemic also reaches this camp. The NGO ADES, which manages the closest camp (7000 people), has been asked to reinforce hygiene and sanitation measures. The medical staff of the affected health zones, the RECO, the DPS, WHO, and UNICEF are monitoring the situation.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death.
