[This past week has seen confirmation of wild poliovirus (WPV1) in environmental samples and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV1 and cVDPV2), which continue to be identified in multiple countries. As stated previously, while Afghanistan hasn't reported any AFP cases associated with WPV1 infection, the positive ESs confirm that the virus is circulating in the country. In the past week cVDPV1 associated cases have been confirmed in DR Congo and cVDPV2 cases have been confirmed in Indonesia and Yemen, and positive ES samples identified in Nigeria.

Looking at total global case counts, 2022 has more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than identified in all of 2021, and more cases of cVDPV associated AFP than to date in 2021.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022] it will expand wastewater testing for poliovirus in areas with low vaccination coverage or counties that are linked to a case in New York reported in July [2022]. Detection of poliovirus in sewage or wastewater indicates someone in the community is shedding the virus.

The strategic use of testing, which is expected to last at least 4 months once initiated, can help determine if poliovirus is present in other parts of the country. The CDC said this can be used to target vaccination efforts and rapidly improve local polio vaccination coverage if needed.

In July [2022], the 1st confirmed case of polio in the United States in nearly a decade turned up in an adult in Rockland County in New York.

Polio can cause irreversible paralysis in some cases, but it can be prevented by a vaccine. While there is no known cure, 3 doses of the vaccine provide at least 99% protection.

The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Philadelphia Department of Public Health are among the 1st locations to explore plans to start collecting wastewater samples in specific communities for analysis at CDC's polio laboratory, the health agency said.

[3] Pakistan: violence

A suicide bomber blew himself up near a truck carrying police officers on their way to protect polio workers near Quetta, Pakistan, on Wednesday [30 Dec 2022], killing a police officer and 3 family members traveling in a car nearby. The bombing wounded 23 others, mostly police, officials said.

Ghulam Azfer Mehser, a senior police officer, said the attack happened as the police were heading to the polio workers as part of a nationwide vaccination drive launched Monday [28 Nov 2022]. The blast was so powerful that it toppled the truck carrying police officers into a ravine, he said, adding that the bombing also damaged a nearby car carrying members of a family.

He said that the anti-polio campaign will continue even after the bombing. Pakistani President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and other officials in separate statements condemned the attack. It came a day after [29 Nov 2022] Pakistani Deputy Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khan traveled to Kabul to discuss a range of issues with the Afghan Taliban, including the latest threat from the local Taliban.

Pakistan wants Afghanistan's Taliban not to allow the Pakistani militants to use their soil to launch attacks inside this Islamic nation, which has witnessed scores of attacks. Most have been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban, who in a statement claimed responsibility for the bombing in Baluchistan on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022].

The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan group, or TTP, said the attack in Baluchistan targeted police to avenge the killing of their former spokesperson, Abdul Wali. He was widely known as Omar Khalid Khurasani and was killed in a bombing in Afghanistan's Paktika province in August [2022]. His death was a heavy blow to the group.

The attack on police came amid a spike in new polio cases among children. The latest vaccination campaign is the 6th such drive this year [2022] and will last for 5 days, aiming to inoculate children under the age of 5 in high-risk areas. The drive is aimed at Islamabad and in the high-risk districts in eastern Punjab and southwestern Baluchistan province. A similar campaign will be launched in the northwest in the 1st week of December [2022].

Pakistani authorities have been launching such campaigns regularly despite attacks on workers and police assigned to inoculation drives.

Militants falsely claim that vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children. Since April [2022], Pakistan has registered 20 new polio cases, which can cause severe paralysis in children. Pakistan came close to eradicating polio last year [2021], when only 1 case was reported.

Currently, Pakistan and Afghanistan are the last 2 countries in which polio has not been eliminated.
