The National Center for Microbiology confirmed this Friday [9 Sep 2022] the positive result in the 2nd analysis of the case of infant botulism in a 4-month-old baby, who was hospitalized in the Maternal and Child University Hospital of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and who was already discharged on 25 Aug [2022]. As reported by the Ministry of Health of the Canarian Government in a statement, the case was under investigation by the general directorate of Public Health of the SCS since last 8 Aug [2022], and the 2nd analysis in feces has confirmed the diagnosis of botulism, for which the corresponding notification will be made to the Ministry of Health, given that it is a mandatory declaration.

The patient underwent the pertinent study, and the samples were sent to the National Center for Microbiology in Madrid for analysis. She improved favorably with the specific treatment for botulism.

Infant botulism is a neurological disorder caused by release of toxins in vivo from germination of spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ with multiplication of the bacterium in the intestine. Although it almost exclusively affects children under one year of age, a similar illness can also appear in older children and adults with alterations in intestinal anatomy and microflora.

The case under investigation will be notified to the Ministry of Health and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), as indicated in the protocols.

[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breastfed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City as found in the ProMED post Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144:

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. [This form has also been referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL] Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG-IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below. - Mod.LL
