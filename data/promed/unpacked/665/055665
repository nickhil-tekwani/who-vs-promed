One resident is dead and another 11 infected with what appears to be anthrax in Pappa subdistrict, Patalassang district, in Takalar regency, South Sulawesi. The numbers are correct as of Thursday [30 May 2013].

The victims were infected after coming into contact with and consuming horse meat. A housewife, 25 years of age, died on Tuesday [28 May 2013] after 2 days of treatment at Pajonga Daeng Ngalle Hospital in Takalar. The woman, who was 7 months pregnant, was rushed to hospital on Sunday [26 May 2013] after complaining of stomach aches and breathing difficulties. On Sunday evening, she gave birth to her child, who later died. "2 hours later, her stomach gradually got bigger. Doctors thought her uterus had ruptured, so they decided to perform surgery and discovered her intestines had turned red. She also had a wound on her left arm that resembled an ulcer, very similar to the symptoms of anthrax," head of Takalar Health Agency's disease control section, Insyaf, said on Thursday [30 May 2013].

The dead woman's husband said that before complaining of stomach aches, she had eaten the meat of a recently slaughtered horse. She had also handled the raw meat.

Another resident, aged 40, was rushed to the Wahidin Sudirohusodo General Hospital in Makassar last week as her condition deteriorated. She has an acute ulcer on her neck.

Based on The Jakarta Post's observations at the location on Thursday [30 May 2013], the residents' symptoms were indeed similar; all displayed discolored black swellings surrounding ulcer-like wounds.

A number of residents said they initially felt itchy but the wounds became red and painful. They also suffered from high fever. "The swellings turned into blisters and then ulcers," said a 54 year old man, who had an ulcer on his left leg. He had butchered the horse and his left leg was accidentally cut by its teeth. He then sold the meat to residents at IDR 50 000 (USD 5.09) per kilogram.

A few days later, one by one residents showed similar signs of ill health. The local health agency only learned about the case on Wednesday [29 May 2013], after the death of the 25 year old woman.

Takalar Health Agency's head of Environmental Health and Disease Control division, Nasir Bunga, said his office had deployed medical workers to investigate the case. The incident was declared an extraordinary occurrence and reported to the South Sulawesi Health Agency.

Anthrax is endemic in Takalar. Each year, the disease recurs and kills livestock. 3 years ago [2010] 3 residents in Mangarabombang and Polongbangkeng Utara districts were infected by the disease.

[This is an unusual version of a common event, such as the slaughter and butchering of an animal sick with anthrax. Usually it is from a cow, or a sheep or goat. To be frank I don't think I have heard of an equine source before but this is not to say that horses don't get sick from anthrax. It is common enough. And with the preference for eating horse meat in Central Asia it must be seen there now and again.

Although this has yet to be laboratory confirmed as an anthrax outbreak, I think we can assume from the events and symptoms that it is anthrax. In Indonesia the last recorded outbreak of equine anthrax was in 1996 when 31 horses were affected. Anthrax is common in South Sulawesi with bovine outbreaks in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010, and 2012. The most recent human cases there were in 2009 with 11 cases and in 2010 when there were 5 cases with 3 deaths.

Characteristically horses get infected via fly bites and suffer a cutaneous form of the disease as a result. If I am correct there will have been some coincident livestock deaths in the village. Our 2012 posting [see archive no. 20120608.1161664] had 100 cattle in 2 Takalar villages so the disease is a serious livestock problem in this regency in South Sulawesi.
