[The ongoing KFD situation can be better assessed by establishing surveillance at major health care facilities to facilitate early detection of suspected cases and plan response strategies. With the annual KFD burden in this region, epidemiological studies may be planned to understand the key risk behaviors and factors that lead to transmission. Use of personal protective measures against tick bites and vaccination of high-risk groups remain the key interventions to prevent KFD. - Mod.UBA
