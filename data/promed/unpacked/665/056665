Summary
----------
Three new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 18 Oct 2015, all of which were reported in Guinea.

The country had reported 0 cases for the previous 2 weeks. Of the 3 new cases, 1 was reported from the capital, Conakry, and 2 were reported from the subprefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah. Of note, 2 cases were not registered contacts, 1 of whom was identified after post-mortem testing of a community death. There are currently 246 contacts under follow-up in Guinea (70 of whom are high risk), and an additional 253 contacts identified during the past 42 days remain untraced. Therefore, there remains a near-term risk of further cases among both registered and untraced contacts. Sierra Leone reported 0 cases for a 5th consecutive week.

Case incidence has remained at 5 confirmed cases or fewer per week for 12 consecutive weeks. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. The phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola builds on existing measures to drive case incidence to zero and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir) or re-emergence of virus from a survivor and capacity for testing and counselling as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors are central to the phase-3 response framework.

The case from Conakry, a 21-year-old male, was reported from the Ratoma area of the city. However, he is not a known contact of a previous case, and genomic analyses suggest he was not infected with the strain of Ebola virus responsible for the most recent cases in Conakry and Forecariah. Investigations to identify the origin of infection are ongoing. The 1st case identified from Forecariah, a 35-year-old woman, was not a registered contact and was identified after post-mortem testing of a community death. However, genomic analyses suggest she is part of the same chain of transmission -- the Ratoma chain -- as the 4 cases that were reported from the same subprefecture in Forecariah during the week ending 27 Sep [2015]. The 2nd case identified from Forecariah is her 3-month-old child and was a registered contact. Of 246 contacts under follow-up in Guinea on 18 Oct 2015, 43 were located in Conakry with the remainder located in Forecariah.

In Sierra Leone, all contacts linked to the country's 2 most recently active chains of transmission, Bombali and Kambia, have completed 21-day follow-up. In addition, the last case to receive treatment was confirmed free of EVD after a 2nd consecutive negative test on 25 Sep [2015]. The country will be declared free of EVD transmission on 7 Nov [2015] if no further cases are reported. However, 2 high-risk contacts -- one from Bombali and one from Kambia -- remain untraced. Efforts to trace these contacts will continue until 42 days have elapsed since the last reported case in each district.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. Nine operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 654 new and repeat samples in the week to 18 Oct [2015]. In Liberia, 1278 new and repeat samples were tested over the same period in the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1592 new samples were collected in Sierra Leone and tested by 8 operational laboratories.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
----------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak, there have been a total of 28 476 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 18 Oct [2015], with 11 298 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). Three new cases were reported in the week to 18 Oct [2015], all of which were from Guinea.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 years of age are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone. Adults aged 45 years and above are approximately 5 times more likely to be affected in Guinea, and approximately 4 times more likely in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 18 Oct [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

19 Oct 2015 Guinea: 5 new Ebola cases in Guinea
http://www.healthaim.com/5-new-ebola-cases-guinea/30242
[After 2 new cases came to light through WHO news on Fri 16 Oct 2015, the 1st after 2 weeks of no new cases, TVC news has now confirmed the number to be 5. The cases found on 16 Oct 2015 are from the capital Conakry and the 2nd from Forecariah, a city in Western Guinea. The Conakry case is reported as being a new infection, and the Forecariah case is linked to an old chain of infection.]

[Note that the number reported in the WHO update from 21 Oct 2015 with data as of 18 Oct 2015 is 3 new cases in Guinea, not 5. The reason for the discrepancy is not clear. - Mod.LK]

16 Oct 2015 Liberia: CSO plans memorial home for Ebola survivors, dead in Nimba
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510192023.html
[An organization in Nimba County, in partnership with Search for Common Ground and IREX, plans to build an Ebola memorial home in Sehyikimpa Town, (Sanniquellie Mah District) as a memorial to Ebola survivors and the dead. The project is part of a post-Ebola recovery program targeting the reintegration of survivors and remembering the dead.]

19 Oct 2015 Liberia: Liberia: Ebola relapse - could a Liberian woman have survived Ebola twice?
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510201436.html
[A woman from Zengo in Lofa county, Liberia, where the Ebola virus disease (EVD) claimed many victims, including 11 of her family members, contracted EVD, was admitted to an Ebola treatment unit (ETU), and was discharged after 21 days with a certificate declaring her free from EVD. Five days after she returned home, she again became very ill, with vomiting and a high fever. She was again admitted to the ETU where she was previously admitted, again spent 21 days in the ETU, and again was issued a certificate declaring her free from EVD. However, she did not immediately leave from the ETU after 21 days because of fears of another relapse. After another 20 days, she was discharged. Explanations were not given for her "relapse," nor was there any comment about a false-negative Ebola virus test from her 1st stay in the ETU.]

20 Oct 2015: Nigeria to set up Ebola survivor clinic
http://thenationonlineng.net/nigeria-to-set-up-ebola-survivor-clinic/
[According to Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, Linus Awute: "The Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has finalized arrangements to establish a Ebola survivor clinic, in Nigeria." The clinic will concentrate on Ebola relapse in survivors.]

18 Oct 2015: Sierra Leone claims 21 days Ebola free
http://famagusta-gazette.com/sierra-leone-claims-days-ebola-free-p30286-69.htm
[According to Sierra Leone's (SL) president Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone has SL's 1st 21-day Ebola virus disease (EBV)-free marker. The last case of EVD in the country was recorded on 13 Sep 2015. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), "A country can only be declared Ebola free after 42 days of the last confirmed case." Sierra Leone will reach the "Ebola-free" 42-day mark on 8 Nov 2015.]

21 Oct 2015 Sierra Leone: Mystery deaths in Sierra Leone spread fear of Ebola relapses
http://allafrica.com/stories/201510211759.html
[According to doctors and health officials in Sierra Leone, a handful of mysterious deaths of discharged patients may also be types of Ebola virus disease (EVD) relapses. News of live Ebola virus being found in the immune-privileged difficult-to-reach organs of the body (such as in the vitreous of the eye experienced by Dr. IC) or in the spinal central nervous system, (as is the case with UK nurse PC, who has suffered an apparent relapse of EVD in her brain and spinal fluid) has raised fears the virus may survive far longer in the body than previously thought, causing other potentially lethal complications.

In Sierra Leone, diagnoses have not yet been made of relapse cases, partly due to lack of relevant medical training and insufficient equipment for detecting a virus in the inaccessible immune-privileged organs of the body.

According to Dr. Dan Kelly, founder of the non-profit organization Wellbody Alliance, who has worked on Ebola in Sierra Leone, an estimated 10 percent of all recovered EVD patients may suffer relapses of EVD.]

A number of reports on the Scottish nurse who relapsed with Ebola virus disease follow:
19 Oct 2015 UK: Condition of British Ebola nurse improves: hospital
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-10-condition-british-ebola-nurse-hospital.html
[Nurse PK's condition has improved from "critical" to "serious but stable." She was readmitted to the Royal Free Hospital in London on 6 Oct 2015 with what was said to be a "relapse" or "reactivation" of the Ebola virus disease (EVD), for which she was 1st hospitalized at Royal Free Hospital from late-December 2014 to late-January 2015. She was declared "critically ill" on Wed 14 Oct 2015.]

21 Oct 2015 UK: UK Ebola nurse has meningitis caused by persisting virus, doctors say
http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/10/21/uk-ebola-nurse-has-meningitis-caused-by-persisting-virus-doctors-say/
[According to doctors treating Scottish nurse ("PC"), who contracted and initially recovered from Ebola virus disease (EVD) but then suffered relapsing illness, she has meningitis caused by the virus persisting in her brain. PC was not reinfected with the Ebola virus, but it had remained in her body since her initial recovery and re-emerged to cause life-threatening complications.

"The virus re-emerged around the brain and around the spinal column to cause meningitis," said Michael Jacobs, an infectious diseases consultant who has been treating PC in London.]

21 Oct 2015 UK: Ebola nurse makes "significant improvement" against virus
http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/613667/Ebola-nurse-Pauline-Cafferkey-significant-improvement-ebola-virus
[According to infectious disease consultant, Dr. Mark Jacobs," [the nurse] developed meningitis caused by the Ebola virus. Dr. Jacobs also said that, while staff were pleased with [her] progress, she would remain hospitalized for some time. Dr Jacobs described the situation as "unprecedented," and it was a "completely different" type of Ebola virus disease (EVD) than had been seen previously.

According to Dr. Jacobs: "I think she has a long recovery ahead of her and will be with us for quite a while still. It's really important to understand we don't use the term critically ill lightly. It means someone is at imminent risk of dying." He said it was still unclear whether people who were in contact with PC's bodily fluids had been exposed to EVD.]

[Additional information on the Scottish nurse's relapse and very welcome improvement is anticipated. It is still not clear whether it is only viral nucleic acid that has been detected or whether infectious virus was isolated as well. Since she is reported to have had meningitis, one assumes infectious virus was present and replicating. - Mod.LK]

20 Oct 2015 USA (Connecticut): Vial marked "Ebola" brought to Connecticut business
http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/State-FBI-Respond-After-Man-Brings-Vial-Marked-Ebola-to-Danbury-Business-334712201.html
[Crews from the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are investigating after someone dropped off a vial marked "Ebola" at International Communications in Danbury, claiming it was a cure for Ebola virus disease (EVD). The person thought the company International Communications was a medical facility. The building was secured, and people have been allowed back inside after local health officials determined it could reopen. According to DEEP, as a precaution, they would secure the vial and transport it to the state laboratory for more tests.]

Non-government organization

19 Oct 2015: Scientist: testing for volunteers returning from Ebola-stricken countries is inadequate
http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/health/13878050.Scientist__testing_for_volunteers_returning_from_ebola_stricken_countries_is_inadequate/?
[According to Professor Tom Solomon, health-care workers returning from countries afflicted with Ebola virus disease (EVD) should always be tested for the virus if they ever become unwell, and he said the problems UK nurse "PC" experienced indicated there was inadequate testing for volunteers who had worked in countries afflicted with EVD.]

20 Oct 2015: Ebola crisis spurs new WHO reform program
http://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-crisis-spurs-new-who-reform-program/3015141.html
[According to World Health Organization (WHO) Director General Margaret Chan, the many lessons learned from the Ebola epidemic in West Africa will be incorporated in the reform process underway. Dr. Chan said: "In the past, when we talk about a health system, the tendency is to talk about clinical care, curative care. And now we should integrate, public health disease surveillance and laboratory testing as part of the health system capability."

As part of the reform program, WHO is building a global emergency health work force, with trained foreign medical teams who will be on standby, ready to respond rapidly to a disease outbreak or natural disaster in any country. Dr. Chan said building trust between communities and health workers is a vital part of the process.]

Research
-------------
21 Oct 2015: Gilead developing Ebola drug
http://www.nasdaq.com/article/gilead-developing-ebola-drug-20151021-00999
[Gilead Sciences Inc. confirmed Wed [21 Oct 2015] it was developing an experimental drug for treating Ebola virus disease (EVD) after a London hospital revealed that the treatment had been given to a nurse who had been readmitted for a relapse of EVD. According to a hospital consultant, [the nurse] is being treated with the experimental drug known as GS-5734.

While Gilead didn't specify [the patient] in its statement, they did say the compound was being provided to a female UK patient after GS-5734 was requested by the Royal Free Hospital in London last week.]
