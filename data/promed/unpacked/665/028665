Dengue fever on Oahu
--------------------
[Dengue fever has been confirmed in a Kaneohe resident as the statewide
toll hits 48 The Kaneohe resident with no history of recent travel is the
first person on Oahu to be confirmed to have dengue fever, the state
Department of Health said yesterday. The Oahu case was among 8 new cases
confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, bringing the total
confirmed cases to 48, with 6 new cases on Maui; 5 in the Hana area and 1
in Kihei, and 1 new case in Anahola on Kauai.
State Health Director Bruce Anderson said he is concerned that dengue fever
has shown up on Oahu, the state's most populous island. But, he added,
unlike Maui, where the virus is "clearly established in the mosquito
population," the Oahu case may be isolated. "The fact that we have only one
case here suggests that it's not a widespread problem, particularly given
the extensive surveillance we've had in place," he said.
While the number of confirmed cases continued to rise, Anderson said the
latest batch of samples tested by the CDC was reassuring. Out of 178 samples
tested, 8 were positive for dengue fever and 47 were ruled out completely,
he said. That shows "we have a very sensitive system and indeed a few cases
are dengue," he said. "That's really the good news."
Dr. Paul Effler, the state epidemiologist, said the new cases on Maui and
Kauai have links to existing hot spots in the state or to a person who has
traveled to Tahiti, which has experienced dengue epidemics. But Anderson
said it is not known where on Oahu the Kaneohe individual got the virus.
"We're going to know more about that case in the near future, but clearly
having a case here with no travel history suggests that individual was
infected by a mosquito carrying the virus here on Oahu," he said. Meanwhile,
the number of reported illnesses being investigated rose to 222 from 165. A
total of 20 cases throughout the islands tested positive on preliminary
screenings.
Dengue fever is transmitted via the bite of an infected mosquito and can not
move directly from person to person. Dengue experts say the only way to
effectively control the spread of the disease is by targeting the mosquito
population. The mosquito-control effort has been "very effective, very
aggressive," Anderson said, adding that the Health Department and counties
have sprayed insecticides and larvicides at more than 600 locations
statewide. Efforts continue to focus on Maui, he said, where 45 of 48
confirmed cases occurred. "We have to be sure that we continue to
aggressively control mosquitoes," Anderson said. "This isn't a problem
that's likely to go away. In fact, every day there are mosquitoes around we
have the risk of introduction of disease."
Maui County officials are temporarily waiving all residential tipping fees
at county landfills and trash transfer stations to encourage residents to
aid in dengue fever cleanup efforts. The county will coordinate a cleanup in
Haiku today as part of Community Work Day. State health officials plan to
conduct informational meetings about dengue fever in 4 communities on
Maui next week.
