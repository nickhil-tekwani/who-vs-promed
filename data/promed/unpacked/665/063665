Cow in Pohang tests negative for foot-and-mouth disease
-------------------------------------------------------
A cow that was previously suspected of having foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] has tested negative.

This is according to the agriculture ministry, which said that the
case reported on Monday [31 Oct 2011] turned out not to be FMD despite
the suspicious symptoms shown by one of 14 cows at a farm in Pohang,
North Gyeongsang Province.

Since the last outbreak of the illness in April [2011], a total of 13
suspected cases have been reported nationwide, but none of them were
positive for FMD.
