Tests conducted by the New York (NY) State Department of Health have
confirmed the presence of _Salmonella_ bacteria in a sample of the
snack food product Veggie Booty purchased in NY, tying the sample to
a national outbreak.
More than 60 persons, mostly toddlers, in 19 states, including 15 New
Yorkers, have become infected with the _S._ Wandsworth bacterial
strain linked to the snack food of puffed rice and corn with a
vegetable coating.
The Department's Wadsworth Center laboratory identified _S._
Wandsworth in an opened bag of Veggie Booty obtained from a New York
State resident infected with the outbreak strain. The Department also
confirmed _S._ Wandsworth in a sample from an unopened bag of Veggie
Booty obtained from the NY State Department of Agriculture and
Markets. The testing in NY supports similar recent findings by the
State of Minnesota and the FDA (US Food & Drug Administration).
On 28 Jun 2007, Robert's American Gourmet Food Inc. of Sea Cliff, NY,
stopped distributing Veggie Booty and initiated a voluntary
nationwide recall after the snacks were associated with illness but
before confirmed positive test results were available.

[More "smoking" packages are being found, now in NY. A map of the
distribution of 65 cases of _S._ Wandsworth can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/images/map_071807.jpg>. The number
does not, I believe, reflect the 8 cases linked to _S._ Typhimurium,
also linked to the snack (see ProMED-mail "Salmonellosis, serotype
Wandsworth - N America (05): 2nd serotype 20070721.2336). The
location of those cases was not stated. - Mod.LL]

A more reasonable approach to "independent testing" of spices and
other ingredients would be irradiation. Irradiation of spices and
certain other food items has been permissible in the USA for decades;
see <http://www.gao.gov/new.items/rc00217.pdf>, page 30.
In some, but not all, instances a warning label must notify the
consumer, but this is not the case for irradiated spices and dried vegetables.
Ionizing irradiation of food components would eliminate virtually all
pathogens, obviating the need to perform "tests" for multiple
potential foodborne pathogens, including viral, bacterial, and parasitic.

[As pointed out by Dr. Harry F. Hull (ProMED-mail "E. coli O157,
ground beef - USA (Multistate) (02) 20070426.1361"), the FDA has
proposed new rules on the labeling of irradiated food, permitting
such foods to be labeled as pasteurized. While these regulations
would not cover all food, such as ground beef, which is regulated by
the USDA (US Department of Agriculture), they will be an important
step forward in the use of irradiation to promote food safety. The
rules (Document FDA-2007-0189-0001) were open for public comment
through 3 Jul 2007, at
