Deadly Fungus Detected in Southeast Asia's Amphibian Trade
-------------------------------------------------------
A team of scientists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the National University of Singapore (NUS), revealed in a new study, for the 1st time, the presence of the pathogenic chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_) in amphibians sampled in Singapore. And the American bullfrog may be a central player in the spread of the disease.

The study appears in the current issue of the journal EcoHealth, and is the 1st to consider the role that Southeast Asia's commercial trade plays in the spread of amphibian pathogens. Demand for amphibians through local and international trade is high and fueled by use of frogs as pets, food, bait, and as a source of traditional 'medicine.' More than 40 percent of amphibian species are in decline globally due, not only to chytrid fungus, but also overharvesting, competition from invasive species, habitat loss, pollution, and climate change.

In the study, scientists collected samples from 2389 individual animals in Lao PDR, Cambodia, Viet Nam, and Singapore at 51 different sites including farms, locally supplied markets, pet stores, and from the wild.

The molecular testing of samples was led by Dr. Tracie Seimon at WCS's Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory at the Bronx Zoo. Results showed that frogs from Lao PDR and Viet Nam tested negative for chytrid. In Cambodia, one frog intended for food tested positive. In addition, 74 animals in Cambodia and Viet Nam were screened for ranavirus and tested negative, suggesting that these specific pathogens are not yet a conservation threat in species tested from these countries. In Singapore, however, 13 samples tested positive for chytrid and represent the 1st report of chytrid in the territory. Of those samples, 11 were collected from 4 pet stores and the remaining 2 were taken from amphibians in the wild.

The scientists noted that the chytrid detections were most prevalent in the American bullfrog (_Lithobates (=Rana) catesbeiana_), a common species in the trade and one that is tolerant of chytrid infections.

"Finding chytrid in 4 of the 7 Singaporean pet stores we sampled is cause for concern," said lead author and WCS Scientist Martin Gilbert. "Since the American bullfrog is able to tolerate this pathogen, it may act as a carrier for spreading chytrid to the region when it is imported through commercial trade."

In another alarming discovery, the scientists found that all 497 frogs sampled from 23 frog farms in Viet Nam had skin lesions ranging from swelling and inflammation to ulcers and deformed or missing digits in the most severe cases. Disease examination revealed 4 of the animals had bacteria associated with the lesions that in 2 cases appeared to have spread to other organs.

While the bacteria and its role as primary or secondary pathogen could not be positively identified, the scientists noted that frog farms could serve as a source of infection for the wider environment.

The study noted that lesions among frogs raised at commercial facilities in Viet Nam are of particular concern, in light of the low level of bio-security that exists. All of the farms in the study disposed of untreated wastewater directly into natural watercourses, which becomes an avenue to spread infection to other places and other species.

According to the authors, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) requires its 174 member countries, which include the 4 countries in this study, to conduct surveillance for chytrid fungus, report confirmed cases, and implement measures to control its spread.

Co-author of the study, Assistant Professor David Bickford from the Department of Biological Sciences at the NUS [National University of Singapore] Faculty of Science, said, "In light of the fact that this emerging infectious disease is now known to be spread by commercial trade, it is in everyone's best interest to eliminate it from the trade in live animals before both the native amphibian populations of Southeast Asia are affected and before it completely decimates the commercial trade and people are unable to make a living. This is not just about the frogs."

The paper concludes, "There is an urgent need to conduct wider surveys of wild amphibians in Southeast Asia to determine the extent and severity of chytrid fungus and other infectious diseases among a range of species, and whether and how these change over time. Studies should focus on differentiating _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ strains that may be endemic to the region from exotic strains that may be introduced through routes including international trade."

Authors of the study include Martin Gilbert of WCS; David Bickford of NUS; Leanne Clark, Arlyne Johnson, Priscilla H. Joyner, Lucy Ogg Keatts, Kongsy Khammavong, Long Nguyen Van, Alisa Newton of WCS; Tiffany P. W. Seow of NUS; Scott Roberton, Soubanh Silithammavong of WCS; Sinpakhone Singhalath of the National University of Laos; Angela Yang, and Tracie A. Seimon of WCS.

[This discovery highlights the potential importance of wildlife trade in the global spread of a pathogen.

_B. dendrobatidis_ (chytrid fungus) is a singular fungal pathogen. It has a swimming zoospore as the infectious stage. It colonizes skin cells of adult amphibians and the mouthparts of tadpoles. Infection occurs when zoospores land on the skin or the mouthparts and encyst. Through mechanisms that are not understood, the pathogen moves from the surface of the skin to the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and matures in the stratum corneum. There, it enters healthy cells, grows in size, and develops into an urn-shaped zoosporangium in which the zoospores develop. As infected skin cells move toward the surface, the zoosporangium matures, the discharge papilla opens, and mature zoospores swim out. The mechanism by which this pathogen causes disease seems to be by interference with the ion transport functions of the skin, leading eventually to cardiac failure.

Worldwide amphibian decline has been related to epidemics caused by the chytrid fungus. The finding reported here becomes really relevant, as one of the hypotheses to explain the global amphibian decline is that the chytrid fungus acts as a propagating pathogen that was taken out of Africa by wildlife trade of _Xenopus_ spp. However, evidence indicates that this fungus is not the single cause of the worldwide amphibian decline (it is not necessary nor sufficient to cause population declines). Prevalences of various pathogens (other than chytrid fungus) were greater in declining amphibian populations than in non-declining ones (an indication that pathogens are affecting amphibian populations), as it is also reported here.

It has been shown that global warming can degrade toads' condition and that frog declines caused by the chytrid fungus were preceded by periods of increasing stress (an indication that poor condition is implicated in population declines). In addition, it was found that the severity of the infection by chytrid depends on the vigour of the individual infected. Moreover, amphibians also decline in areas where the fungus is absent, and the fungus is sometimes present for long periods of time without causing disease. Thus, an impoverished condition resulting from environmental changes may be triggering vicious cycles (in which the chytrid fungus may be implicated) that are decimating amphibian populations. - Mod.PMB
