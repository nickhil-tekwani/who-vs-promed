FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE: CONTROL - BOTSWANA
==========================================
Date: Fri, 28 Mar 1997

In an effort to control the spread of foot and mouth disease, the Botswana
Wildlife and National Parks Department has begun driving buffalo back into
the Okavango delta from which they each year migrate into the Ngamiland
cattle restocking area in the north of the country. Although fences already
exist to prevent migration, an electrified double fence is being erected
along a 500 km section of the country's border with Zimbabwe.
The department said that 12 percent (300 thousand head) of cattle were
destroyed in last year's epidemic of hoof and mouth disease. According to
the department, wild buffalo are being targeted because they harbor the
disease. An estimated 5314 buffalo have already been driven back into the
delta area; 1000 more are slated for relocation by the end of April.
Buffalo are not the only wild animals who migrate during the wet season in
search of pasture. Zebra, wildebeest and other animals also cross into the
cattle region.
