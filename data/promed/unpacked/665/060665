[1] Brain changes following infection
Date: Mon 7 Mar 2022
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/07/health/covid-brain-changes.html


COVID-19 may cause greater loss of gray matter and tissue damage in the brain than naturally occurs in people who have not been infected with the virus, a large new study found (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04569-5).

The study, published Monday [7 Mar 2022] in the journal Nature, is believed to be the first involving people who underwent brain scans both before they contracted COVID and months after. Neurological experts who were not involved in the research said it was valuable and unique, but they cautioned that the implications of the changes were unclear and did not necessarily suggest that people might have lasting damage or that the changes might profoundly affect thinking, memory or other functions.

The study, involving people aged 51-81, found shrinkage and tissue damage primarily in brain areas related to sense of smell; some of those areas are also involved in other brain functions, the researchers said. "To me, this is pretty convincing evidence that something changes in brains of this overall group of people with COVID," said Dr. Serena Spudich, chief of neurological infections and global neurology at the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.

But, she cautioned: "To make a conclusion that this has some long-term clinical implications for the patients I think is a stretch. We don't want to scare the public and have them think, 'Oh, this is proof that everyone's going to have brain damage and not be able to function.'"

The study involved 785 participants in UK Biobank, a repository of medical and other data from about half a million people in Britain. The participants each underwent 2 brain scans roughly 3 years apart, plus some basic cognitive testing. In between their 2 scans, 401 participants tested positive for the coronavirus, all infected between March 2020 and April 2021. The other 384 participants formed a control group because they had not been infected with the coronavirus and had similar characteristics to the infected patients in areas like age, sex, medical history and socioeconomic status.

With normal aging, people lose a tiny fraction of gray matter each year. For example, in regions related to memory, the typical annual loss is between 0.2% and 0.3%, the researchers said.

But COVID patients in the study -- who underwent their 2nd brain scan an average of 4.5 months after their infection -- lost more than noninfected participants, experiencing between 0.2% and 2% additional gray matter loss in different brain regions over the 3 years between scans. They also lost more overall brain volume and showed more tissue damage in certain areas.

"I find it surprising in the sense of how much more was lost and how generalized it is," said Dr. Spudich, who has studied the neurological effects of COVID. She added, "I wouldn't have expected to see quite so much percentage change."

The effects may be particularly notable because the study involved mostly people who -- like the majority of COVID patients in the general population -- were mildly affected by their initial COVID infection, not becoming sick enough to need hospitalization.

The study's lead author, GwenaÃ«lle Douaud, a professor in the department of clinical neurosciences at the University of Oxford, said that although the number of hospitalized patients in the study, 15, was too small to yield conclusive data, results suggested that their brain atrophy was worse than the mildly afflicted patients.

People who had COVID also showed greater decline than uninfected people on a cognitive test related to attention and efficiency in performing a complex task. But outside experts and Dr. Douaud noted that the cognitive testing was rudimentary, so the study is very limited in what it can say about whether the gray matter loss and tissue damage the COVID patients experienced affected their cognitive skills.

"None of them got thorough enough cognitive testing to know if they had significant deficits in these many regions where they found these changes in volume," said Dr. Benedict Michael, an associate professor of neurological infections at the University of Liverpool, who is researching the neuropsychiatric effects of COVID and was not involved in the study. "We don't know that it actually means anything for the patient's quality of life or function."

For example, although some of the largest gray matter loss was in areas related to smell, including the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, those areas are also involved in memory and other functions. But the COVID patients did not perform worse than noninfected participants on memory tests, Dr. Douaud said, although she added that the memory tests they took were brief and basic.

Outside experts and the study's authors said the range of brain areas where COVID patients experience more gray matter loss raised intriguing questions. "There's no one part of the brain that does one thing," Dr. Douaud said. "There are parts of the brain in the infected participants with additional gray matter loss that have nothing to do with the smell, and the ones that are related to smell also are involved in other brain functions."

The cause of the brain changes is unclear. The authors mentioned theories including inflammation, evidence of which has been found in other studies, and "sensory deprivation" from disrupted sense of smell.

Dr. Avindra Nath, chief of the section on infections of the nervous system at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, who was not involved in the study, said another "critical question" was whether the brain changes could make COVID patients more prone to dementia or other deficits in the future.

And while the researchers did not find the same brain changes in patients with non-COVID pneumonia, Dr. Nath recommended studying patients with other coronaviruses or the flu "to see if these findings are distinct for COVID-19 or more generalizable."

Dr. Spudich said the study's greatest value may be its indication that "there's been something that's happened in the brain in these people," adding that "I think people have felt that it's so vague, so hard to measure."

Other scientists can now build on these findings, she and others said. "It's an important study, they've done good work," Dr. Michael said, adding, "now we need to do the studies to look at cognition and psychiatric symptoms and behavioral stuff and neurological stuff and find out what does this mean for patients."

[2] Booster doses
Date: Wed 2 Mar 2022
Source: Medical News Today [edited]
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/4th-shots-and-covid-19-boosters-why-and-when-best-to-get-it


The emergence of the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has confirmed the need for vaccine boosters -- to combat waning immunity and provide more robust protection against severe disease and death. Several studies have shown that 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine do not provide enough protection against infection or severe disease from omicron. More and more evidence supports a 3-step approach, which might involve infection-plus-vaccination hybrid immunity or triple immunization [e.g., https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01715-4].

Meanwhile, a growing number of countries are now exploring 2nd boosters -- or 4th doses -- as a way of effectively neutralizing omicron. Following in the footsteps of Israel, countries including Chile, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden are offering 4th doses to certain at-risk groups. In the United Kingdom, groups deemed most at risk are advised to have a 2nd booster shot this spring. Depending on the person, this could be a 4th or 5th dose.

Variations in guidance have raised questions about who needs a 4th dose and what the most effective approach to immunity might be. Data about the need for a 4th dose, so far, [are] lacking, but recently published research indicates that it can restore waning immunity.

A trial with the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines found that a 4th dose provided a modest boost in protection against omicron and restored antibodies to levels seen right after the 3rd dose. However, this did not translate into significantly increased effectiveness and did not prevent infection with omicron (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.15.22270948).

Four doses of the Pfizer vaccine were 30% more protective against infection than 3 doses. This extra protection was 11% for Moderna's vaccine.

Dr. William Haseltine, a scientist, public health expert, and president of ACCESS Health International, said initial studies showed that the 4th dose provided an additional boost in antibody levels. While not huge, this boost was "measurable."

The additional dose could also reignite antibody production in the body when this begins to wane. According to a report by the UK Health Security Agency, the booster dose's capacity to protect against symptomatic infection drops to 45%-50% from 10 weeks onward (https://bit.ly/36aeQQs). Another UK analysis estimated that protection would drop to around 40% by the 4th month after the 3rd shot (https://bit.ly/3hRwfzV).

There is no hard evidence that a 4th dose is crucial, which means that it will likely be reserved for certain groups. Data suggest that it could benefit people with a high risk of severe illness and restore long-term protection.

An observational study from Israel showed that a 4th dose conferred slightly higher levels of protection against both infection and severe disease for those aged 60 or over and considered at risk. The additional dose was administered at least 4 months after the 3rd dose (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.01.22270232).

Although the increase in protection may seem minimal, experts believe that it could make a large difference for high-risk groups. Dr. Haseltine said that traditional risk groups, such as people with asthma, obesity, or immune suppression, could benefit from a 4th dose.

The biggest argument against boosters is that COVID-19 vaccines offer less protection against omicron than they did against variants such as delta or alpha. While the effectiveness against infection is reduced, recent evidence shows that 3 doses are 99% effective at preventing hospitalization and severe disease across all populations.

"With omicron, it's clear that 2 doses aren't enough, and 3 doses are needed if you are going to have any protection at all," Dr. Haseltine told Medical News Today (MNT). There is also growing evidence that unvaccinated individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infections are vulnerable to reinfection by both current and future variants. This is especially true for the delta and omicron variants.

Research shows that a past omicron infection does not protect against infections with other SARS-CoV-2 variants in people who have not been vaccinated (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.10.22270789). In the study, people who had been vaccinated then developed breakthrough infections not only had better humoral immune responses but also had cross-protective immunity to the delta and beta variants.

Furthermore, having COVID-19, then receiving 3 doses of the vaccine increased protection to 71% from 44% for the unvaccinated with prior infections, according to the SIREN study (https://bit.ly/3hRLitt).

Having a booster too soon or too late after the primary series is another point of contention. A study conducted in Japan found that having a breakthrough infection shortly after vaccination did not boost antibodies by much. However, having an infection months after the last dose significantly increased protection, particularly against omicron (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.28.21268481).

"We do see that antibodies begin to wane after 3 months," said Dr. Alexander Rodgers, an associate program director at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science. Most countries offering the additional booster have adopted this time frame.

"If you're a person that is at higher risk, mostly because of your age or other factors, I'd recommend the 4th after 3 or 4 months. The reason for that is we know that the protective antibodies tend to wane pretty rapidly after 3-4 months," said Dr. Haseltine. He said that for those at higher risk who may not have produced sufficient antibodies, he would recommend "a shorter rather than longer interval: 3-4 months rather than 6 months or longer."

Dr. Rodgers pointed out that optimizing the interval for antibody efficiency may be a more viable strategy for most countries. "If you're in a country that has not yet approved the 4th dose, then it would be reasonable to try and push that 3rd dose to the point of maximum efficiency of that 2nd dose," he told MNT. "That's why I think there's that variability -- because countries are just trying to pick an arbitrary line in the sand with the best research and evidence that they have and be mindful of the resources that they have," he added.

"Right now, 3 vs 4 vs 5 or even 6 [doses] more speaks to a country's vaccine allocation and resources than it does to any hard evidence," said Dr. Rodgers. He pointed out that more studies were needed to determine the optimal interval and number of doses.

With the prospect of multiple boosters, peak immunity or an immunity threshold may also be possible. Research from China, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggested that immune response to COVID-19 could not be endlessly boosted, and there would be a "turning point" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.19.22271215).

There is also the issue of resource utilization and vaccine inequity. "When we're thinking about the vaccine program, we're really trying to reach maximum efficiency. I think that there are 2 types of efficiency, for the individual and from a global public health standpoint. From a global standpoint, the most important risk factors are preventing hospitalization and death," said Dr. Rodgers.

He pointed to 2 strategies: having some countries begin to administer 4th doses or acknowledging that this is a pandemic and focusing on getting 1st and 2nd doses to large swaths of populations that have not yet had them. "Although the 3rd and 4th doses do decrease the risk of hospitalization and death, the most dramatic improvement is after completing the initial 2 doses. The current vaccines are still effective in protecting against hospitalization and death -- the 2 major points of concern."

The need for annual boosters will depend on how future variants differ from the initial strain, said Dr. Rodgers. "In the United States, the coronavirus is demonstrating this type of seasonality where our biggest waves are in the winter, similar to other cold and flu seasons. I wouldn't be surprised if annual boosting or annual vaccine programs like for the flu become a common practice," he said.

The World Health Organization (WHO) technical advisory group on COVID-19 vaccines today [8 Mar 2022] weighed in on potential updates to COVID-19 vaccines in light of emerging variants such as omicron, outlining different options and what data are needed to guide new strategies.

In other developments, countries experiencing later omicron surges -- especially in Asia -- continue to report cases at or near record daily highs. And, in the United States, weekly pediatric COVID-19 cases dropped below 100 000, part of a 6-week decline from the omicron peak in children.

In a statement, the WHO expert group said it strongly recommends the current vaccines and boosters because they continue to provide high levels of protection against severe disease and death, even against the backdrop of omicron spread. However, they said to optimize protection in the future, different approaches may be needed, such as monovalent versions that target a specific variant or a polyvalent vaccine that protects against multiple ones.

Earlier this year [2022], Moderna and Pfizer announced the start of clinical trials to test omicron-specific vaccines. Also, testing is underway in Israel to assess the effectiveness of a 4th dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the omicron variant.

Ideally, future vaccines would limit transmission as well as cut infections and deaths, the group said. And though pansarbecovirus vaccines and vaccines that prompt mucosal immunity might be useful, they added that timeframes for development and production are uncertain.

They urged vaccine makers to keep tracking vaccine performance of current vaccines and those being developed against specific variants and to share the data with WHO technical advisors so that the group can consider whether any vaccine strain adjustments are needed.

The group's statement on COVID-19 vaccine composition is its second and follows its initial recommendations in January of this year [2022].

Hong Kong reported more than 43 000 new cases today [8 Mar 2022], as mainland officials pushed for leaders to maintain a "dynamic zero" strategy, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-hong-kongs-priority-is-cut-covid-infections-deaths-2022-03-08/). Also, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection launched a new online system for members of the public to report their rapid COVID-19 test results, a step aimed at more accurately tracking illness patterns.

Meanwhile, the mainland's spike in activity continues at its highest level in 2 years, with 175 more symptomatic local cases reported today [8 Mar 2022], along with 330 more local asymptomatic infections, according to the country's National Health Commission.

In South Korea, another area experiencing a later omicron surge, daily cases are down a bit from a record high on 6 Mar 2022 but still remain above 200 000 per day (http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220307000206).

Elsewhere, New Zealand today [8 Mar 2022] reported a daily record of nearly 24 000 cases, and illness in healthcare workers is becoming a staffing issue, according to ABC News. Health officials are now allowing health workers to work if they are mildly ill (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/virus-cases-24000-zealand-tack-83312295).

In US developments, for the 1st time since August 2021, the weekly number of pediatric COVID-19 cases in the United States dropped below 100 000, to 69 000 for the week ending on 3 Mar 2022, according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).

"Reported COVID-19 cases among children spiked dramatically in 2022 during the omicron variant surge, over 4.8 million child cases were reported since the beginning of January," the AAP said. "Over 12.7 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic; almost 670 000 of these cases have been added in the past 4 weeks." For 6 weeks, however, cases have been declining.

In related news, Florida's surgeon general said yesterday [7 Mar 2022] that the state will formally recommend against COVID-19 vaccinations for healthy children, the Associated Press reports. Florida is the 1st state to disregard COVID-19 vaccination guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which encourage vaccination among all children ages 5 and older (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-florida-ron-desantis-florida-department-of-health-a935793abc368ffc9aa5c2a2dda23e4b).

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 65.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

The United States reported 67 516 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [7 Mar 2022] and 1686 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 43 250, with 1473 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://nyti.ms/35DmbYU).
