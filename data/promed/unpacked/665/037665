[2] Virus shedding by larvae
Date: Thu 17 Mar 2022

https://doi.org/10.1089/vbz.2021.0044


ref: Torres-Montoya EH, Ulloa-Urquidy L, Torres-Avendaño JI, et al. Evidence of horizontal transmission by fecal shedding of dengue virus 4 among _Aedes aegypti _ larvae (Diptera: Culicidae) under laboratory conditions. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2022; 22(3): 205-208
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The transmission pathways of dengue virus (DENV) among mosquitoes are a topic that has gained relevance in recent years because they could explain the maintenance of the virus in the wild independently of the human-mosquito horizontal transmission cycle. In this regard, _Aedes aegypti_ larvae exposed to supernatants of C6/36 cells infected with DENV-4 were evaluated for virus excretion in feces and viability of infection in immature stages (larvae). The results demonstrate that larvae excrete DENV-4 in their feces with the potential to at least infect immature individuals of the same species. A horizontal transmission pathway of larvae-larvae DENV-4 under laboratory conditions is suggested.

[If dengue viruses can be horizontally transmitted efficiently among larvae sharing a container, that could be a virus maintenance mechanism overlooked until now.

Several critical questions remain. How would the virus be introduced into the larval habitat? What quantity of virus is required to infect larvae? Does the virus persist into the pupal stage and then into adults? Are the adults able to transmit the virus? One hopes that experiments are underway to answer these questions. - Mod.TY]
