Teso leaders call for help over hunger
--------------------------------------
A poor harvest in Teso has the region worried that famine will soon
strike. Almost all crops have failed due to delayed rains,
authorities say.

While cassava has been the only hope for Teso every time famine has
struck, the Kumi District Agricultural Officer, Mr Valdo Odeke, says
the situation has been worsened following an outbreak of cassava
brown streak, a disease that affects tubers. Whereas the cassava
plantations appear to be doing well, Mr Odeke said the tubers are not
bearing fruit.

He said up to 5000 households were likely to starve if the government
doesn't intervene, adding that most families currently take one meal
a day.

[_Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus
_Ipomovirus_) is considered the causal agent of cassava brown streak
(or root rot) disease. It is a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan
Africa. Symptoms are leaf chlorosis and, in severe infection, stem
necrosis. Symptoms may be found also on the roots, as a yellow/brown,
corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue. Leaves may appear
healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of
20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual root
weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible
cultivars. CBSV is thought to be transmitted by the whitefly vector
_Bemisia tabaci_ and is spread to new areas by infected cassava
cuttings. Disease management includes removal of infected plants,
phytosanitary measures within farms, quarantine restrictions on
movement of cassava material, vector control, and planting of
resistant varieties.

Teso sub-region consists of the districts of Soroti, Kumi, Katakwi,
Amuria, Kaberamaido, and Bukedea.
