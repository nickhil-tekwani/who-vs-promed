The CDC Issues Interim Recommendations
--------------------------------------
2008-09 Influenza Season:
Although influenza activity is low in the United States to date,
preliminary data from a limited number of states indicate that the
prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) virus strains resistant to the
antiviral medication oseltamivir is high. Therefore, the CDC is
issuing interim recommendations for antiviral treatment and
chemoprophylaxis of influenza during the 2008-09 influenza season.
When influenza A (H1N1) virus infection or exposure is suspected,
zanamivir or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine are more
appropriate options than oseltamivir alone. Local influenza
surveillance data and laboratory testing can help with physician
decision-making regarding the choice of antiviral agents for their
patients. The 2008-09 influenza vaccine is expected to be effective
in preventing or reducing the severity of illness with currently
circulating influenza viruses, including oseltamivir-resistant
influenza A (H1N1) virus strains. Since influenza activity remains
low and is expected to increase in the weeks and months to come, the
CDC recommends that influenza vaccination efforts continue.

Background:
-----------
Influenza A viruses, including 2 subtypes (H1N1) and (H3N2), and
influenza B viruses, currently circulate worldwide, but the
prevalence of each can vary among communities and within a single
community over the course of an influenza season. In the United
States, 4 prescription antiviral medications (oseltamivir, zanamivir,
amantadine and rimantadine) are approved for treatment and
chemoprophylaxis of influenza. Since January 2006, the neuraminidase
inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir) have been the only recommended
influenza antiviral drugs because of widespread resistance to the
adamantanes (amantadine, rimantadine) among influenza A (H3N2) virus
strains. The neuraminidase inhibitors have activity against influenza
A and B viruses while the adamantanes have activity only against
influenza A viruses. In 2007-08, a significant increase in the
prevalence of oseltamivir resistance was reported among influenza A
(H1N1) viruses worldwide. During the 2007-08 influenza season, 10.9
percent of H1N1 viruses tested in the U.S. were resistant to
oseltamivir.

Influenza activity has been low thus far this season in the United
States. As of 19 Dec 2008, a limited number of influenza viruses
isolated in the U.S. since 1 Oct 2008 have been available for
antiviral resistance testing at the CDC. Of the 50 H1N1 viruses
tested to date from 12 states, 98 percent were resistant to
oseltamivir, and all were susceptible to zanamivir, amantadine and
rimantadine. Preliminary data indicate that oseltamivir-resistant
influenza A (H1N1) viruses do not cause different or more severe
symptoms compared to oseltamivir sensitive influenza A (H1N1)
viruses. Influenza A (H3N2) and B viruses remain susceptible to
oseltamivir. The proportion of influenza A (H1N1) viruses among all
influenza A and B viruses that will circulate during the 2008-09
season cannot be predicted, and will likely vary over the course of
the season and among communities. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza A
(H1N1) viruses are antigenically similar to the influenza A (H1N1)
virus strain represented in 2008-09 influenza vaccine, and CDC
recommends that influenza vaccination efforts continue as the primary
method to prevent influenza.

Oseltamivir resistance among circulating influenza A (H1N1) virus
strains presents challenges for the selection of antiviral
medications for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza, and
provides additional reasons for clinicians to test patients for
influenza virus infection and to consult surveillance data when
evaluating persons with acute respiratory illnesses during influenza
season. These interim guidelines provide options for treatment or
chemoprophylaxis of influenza in the United States if
oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses are circulating widely in a
community or if the prevalence of oseltamivir resistant H1N1 viruses
is uncertain.

Interim Recommendations:
------------------------
Persons providing medical care for patients with suspected influenza
or persons who are candidates for chemoprophylaxis against influenza
should consider the following guidance for assessing and treating
patients during the 2008-09 influenza season.

1) Review local or state influenza virus surveillance data weekly
during influenza season, to determine which types (A or B) and
subtypes of influenza A virus (H3N2 or H1N1) are currently
circulating in the area. For some communities, surveillance data
might not be available or timely enough to provide information useful
to clinicians.

2) Consider use of influenza tests that can distinguish influenza A
from influenza B.

a. Patients testing positive for influenza B may be given either
oseltamivir or zanamivir (no preference) if treatment is indicated.

b. At this time, if a patient tests positive for influenza A, use of
zanamivir should be considered if treatment is indicated. Oseltamivir
should be used alone only if recent local surveillance data indicate
that circulating viruses are likely to be influenza A (H3N2) or
influenza B viruses. Combination treatment with oseltamivir and
rimantadine is an acceptable alternative, and might be necessary for
patients that cannot receive zanamivir, (e.g., patient is less than 7
years old, has chronic underlying airways disease, or cannot use the
zanamivir inhalation device), or zanamivir is unavailable. Amantadine
can be substituted for rimantadine if rimantadine is unavailable.

c. If a patient tests negative for influenza, consider treatment
options based on local influenza activity and clinical impression of
the likelihood of influenza. Because rapid antigen tests may have low
sensitivity, treatment should still be considered during periods of
high influenza activity for persons with respiratory symptoms
consistent with influenza who test negative and have no alternative
diagnosis. Use of zanamivir should be considered if treatment is
indicated. Combination treatment with oseltamivir and rimantadine
(substitute amantadine if rimantadine unavailable) is an acceptable
alternative. Oseltamivir should be used alone only if recent local
surveillance data indicates that circulating viruses are likely to be
influenza A(H3N2) or influenza B viruses.

d. If available, confirmatory testing with a diagnostic test capable
of distinguishing influenza caused by influenza A (H1N1) virus from
influenza caused by influenza A (H3N2) or influenza B virus can also
be used to guide treatment. When treatment is indicated, influenza A
(H3N2) and influenza B virus infections should be treated with
oseltamivir or zanamivir (no preference). Influenza A (H1N1) virus
infections should be treated with zanamivir or combination treatment
with oseltamivir and rimantadine is an acceptable alternative.

3) Persons who are candidates for chemoprophylaxis (e.g., residents
in an assisted living facility during an influenza outbreak, or
persons who are at higher risk for influenza-related complications
and have had recent household or other close contact with a person
with laboratory confirmed influenza) should be provided with
medications most likely to be effective against the influenza virus
that is the cause of the outbreak, if known. Respiratory specimens
from ill persons during institutional outbreaks should be obtained
and sent for testing to determine the type and subtype of influenza A
viruses associated with the outbreak and to guide antiviral therapy
decisions. Persons whose need for chemoprophylaxis is due to
potential exposure to a person with laboratory-confirmed influenza A
(H3N2) or influenza B should receive oseltamivir or zanamivir (no
preference). Zanamivir should be used when persons require
chemoprophylaxis due to exposure to influenza A (H1N1) virus.
Rimantadine can be used if zanamivir use is contraindicated. Enhanced
surveillance for influenza antiviral resistance is ongoing at the CDC
in collaboration with local and state health departments. Clinicians
should remain alert for additional changes in recommendations that
might occur as the 2008-09 influenza season progresses. Oseltamivir
resistant influenza A (H1N1) viruses are antigenically similar to the
influenza A(H1N1) viruses represented in the vaccine, and vaccination
should continue to be considered the primary prevention strategy
regardless of oseltamivir sensitivity. Information on antiviral
resistance will be updated in weekly surveillance reports (available
at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm>).
