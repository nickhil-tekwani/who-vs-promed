400 cows die in 7 days in Rajgunge, Siliguri, West Bengal, India
---------------------------------------------------
In the last 7 days, in Santinagar, Chayanpara, Baribhasa and in 15
adjoining villages of Rajgunge, panic has spread as 400 cows died.
According to local people, about 1000 cows have died in the area
within the last month. Although postmortem examinations of a few cows
revealed large numbers of helminths, most experts believed these
deaths to be due to anthrax, as many anthrax cases have previously
been recorded in the area.
Government officials have begun vaccinating the remaining cattle for anthrax.
Illness in the affected animals begins with watery diarrhoea, and
within a few hours they die, with bleeding from the mouth and anus.

Mystery disease kills over 300 cows in W.Bengal
---------------------
A mysterious disease has killed over 300 bovines in the past 2 weeks
in 3 areas of this district, prompting veterinary officials and some
NGOs to administer anti-anthrax injections to cattle, official
sources here said. More than 300 cows have died in Shantinagar,
Baribhasha, Rajgange, and Hatibhanga areas in the past 15 days.
Veterinary officials from the towns of Rajgange and Jalpaiguri
yesterday visited the affected areas to take stock of the situation.
As a preventive measure, 110 cows were administered anti-anthrax
injection, according to a veterinarian from the Rajgange area, Atanu
Saha, said yesterday. "60 percent had symptoms of a particular worm
known as 'amphistom' [_Paramphistomum cervi_ - Mod.MHJ] in their
stools." According to preliminary investigations, the affected cows
had initially failed to discharge stool, then became restless.
However, the veterinary officials said tests were being performed to
ascertain what actually caused the deaths of the cattle.

[Watery diarrhea is not a normal sign of clinical anthrax, which is
normally characterised by peracute death in cattle; in epidemics it
takes weeks to work up to the kind of numbers quoted here. Bloody
exudates from the various orifices post-mortem, though common in
textbooks, in reality is not a consistent feature of livestock
anthrax. I know of many epidemics from which it was completely
absent, as well as in sporadic cases. And thirdly, anthrax can be
readily diagnosed on the basis of fixed and stained blood smears and
can be easily cultured on blood agar. Neither account refers to
completed laboratory examinations. I know Dr. Das, and he has an
excellent laboratory, albeit in a medical hospital and therefore not
likely to be receiving any bovine bloody swabs or other samples for
examination. Livestock and human anthrax are unfortunately common in
West Bengal, but I am not convinced of anthrax being involved in this
severe epidemic of bovine deaths.
In India the trematode mentioned is relatively common, e.g., in
Himachal Pradesh it can be found in some 15 percent of dairy cattle,
11 percent of buffalo, and 3-4 percent of small ruminants. Though
normally a mild pathogen, it was blamed for bovine and ovine losses
in Himachal Pradesh (Siroli and Hamirpur) in 1986 (IVRI Annual
Reports 1986-7).
I have referred this report to Dr. Das and others in the expectation
of clarification. - Mod.MHJ]
