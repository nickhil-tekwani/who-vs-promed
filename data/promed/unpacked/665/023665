[1] Cholera - Nepal (Kathmandu)
Date: Thu 24 Jul 2014
From: Sher Bahadur Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serotype Ogawa has been detected in patients with acute gastroenteritis after an interval of 2 years in Kathmandu. From 10 to 20 Jul 2014, a total of 5 stool samples were culture-confirmed cholera. These patients (age range from 20 to 25 years and one over 70 years) were admitted to Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) for the management of acute gastroenteritis.

_V. cholerae_ was last reported in patients with acute gastroenteritis in 2012 in Kathmandu. Classical-like phenotype _V. cholerae_ was identified as a cause of acute gastroenteritis during the 2012 outbreak (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24843853).

_V. cholerae_ O1 classical biotype was also reported in a patient (a resident of Afghanistan) with gastroenteritis during the same year, 2012, in Iran (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24117836). The continuing spread of classical biotype of _V. cholerae_ cannot be ruled out in south Asia, although comprehensive molecular surveillance studies are warranted to monitor phenotypic and biotypic diversity within _V. cholerae_ populations.

[The _Vibrio cholerae_ cell surface lipopolysaccharide O (somatic) antigen distinguishes strains of _V. cholerae_ into more than 200 serogroups, of which only 2, O1 and O139, possess the potential to cause widespread outbreaks of cholera. Other serogroups may be associated with severe diarrhea, but do not possess epidemic potential. _V. cholerae_ O1 has 2 biotypes, classical and El Tor, and each biotype has 3 distinct serotypes, Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima. - Mod.ML

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Accra)
Date: Wed 23 Jul 2014

An outbreak of cholera has left 2 people dead and 350 more visiting hospitals in Accra. The figures, according to deputy director of health for the Greater Accra Region, Dr John Eleaza, has been recorded in the last 3 weeks in 4 out of Greater Accra's 16 districts. He mentioned that Accra Metro has recorded 274, Ga West, 14, La Dade-Kotopon Municipal Assembly 58, and Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District 4 cases.

The outbreak confirms fears expressed by the Ghana Health Service (GHS) in May [2014] that said a breakdown in waste management and increasingly dirty capital could spark an epidemic as the rainy season began. "It is the filth everywhere and the lack of hygiene among our people," the deputy director said, noting that some patients have been victims of the disease despite using pipe-borne water. "Unfortunately we have some of our pipelines going through some of these drains...some of them are broken," he said.

He is advising Ghanaians to be careful and practise proper hygiene to prevent a deterioration of the outbreak. He also advised taxi drivers to disinfect their cars after conveying victims to the hospital.

After reporting a total of 10 628 cases by the close of 2011 and a total of 105 deaths, Ghana was ranked 5th most cholera-endemic country in Africa after Democratic Republic of Congo.

Cholera is an acute diarrhoea illness caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ that could result in a profound and rapidly progressive dehydration and death. An untreated person with cholera may produce 10-20 litres of faecal matter a day with fatal results.
