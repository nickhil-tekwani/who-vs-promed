Reported Ugandan Smallpox Is Likely Chickenpox
----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organisation WHO) said on Thursday [25 Mar 2010] it
was investigating reports of suspected cases of the previously
eradicated disease smallpox in eastern Uganda. Smallpox is an acute
contagious disease and was one of the world's most feared sicknesses
until it was officially declared eradicated worldwide in 1979.

"WHO takes any report of smallpox seriously," Gregory Hartl, a
spokesman for the Geneva-based United Nations health agency, told
Reuters via email. "WHO is aware of the reports coming out of Uganda
and is taking all the necessary measures to investigate and verify."
He added that the WHO had received reports before of smallpox cases,
but they had turned out to be false alarms. "In the past, these cases
have always turned out not to be smallpox and were, usually, either
chickenpox or monkeypox cases," he said, stressing that these reports
were of suspected cases of the disease.

Smallpox was eradicated by a collaborative global vaccination
programme led by the World Health Organisation. The last known
natural case was in Somalia in 1977. Since then, the only known cases
were caused by a laboratory accident in 1978 in Birmingham, England,
which killed one person and caused a limited outbreak.

Reported Ugandan smallpox is likely chickenpox
----------------------------------------------
Suspected cases of the previously eradicated disease smallpox in
eastern Uganda appear to be chickenpox and not the acute contagious
disease, the World Health Organisation said on Thursday [25 Mar 2010].

"It appears that the supposed cases of smallpox are actually cases of
chickenpox, and that they have occurred over the past 3 weeks -- this
is not an acute event," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a
statement. "WHO has communicated this latest information to its member states."

The WHO said earlier on Thursday [25 Mar 2010] it was investigating
reports of suspected cases of smallpox in eastern Uganda. Smallpox
can sometimes be confused with chickenpox, a worldwide infection of
children that is very rarely dangerous.

Smallpox kills around 30 percent of its victims and was one of the
world's most feared sicknesses until it was officially declared
eradicated worldwide in 1979. Chickenpox produces much more
superficial lesions which tend to appear more on the trunk than the
face or hands.

[Chickenpox is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by
varicella-zoster virus (human herpesvirus 3). It usually affects
children, is spread by direct contact or respiratory route via
droplet nuclei, and is characterized by the appearance on the skin
and mucous membranes of successive crops of typical pruritic
vesicular lesions that are easily broken and become scabbed.
Chickenpox is relatively benign in children, but may be complicated
by pneumonia and encephalitis in adults. - Mod.CP]
