A golden retriever was recently diagnosed with the potentially fatal rat lungworm disease after eating a common garden slug. The parasite is mostly found in rodents, but its larvae can infect slugs and snails, which are then eaten by dogs and humans.

The couple took ownership of the canine 2 weeks before the incident and they started noticing her acting lethargic and extremely weak. They took the dog straight to the Turramurra Veterinary Hospital [in Sydney].

"[She's] got the most gorgeous nature. She actually belongs to our grandchildren," the owner said. "We saw her playing with a slug and thought nothing of it. It was scary because we didn't know if she was going to make it or what the problem was. We had 2 golden retrievers and, dare I say ... the only time they went to the vet was for their vaccinations."

Dr Angus Donald said the larvae in the slug migrated the dog's intestinal tract to her brain and spinal cord, causing severe inflammation of her nervous system tissue. The disease affects dogs of all types. "Most cases in dogs, in Sydney, occur between March and June and, we tend to have 2 to 3 suspected cases at our clinic each year," Dr Donald said.

The golden retriever was referred to North Ryde's Small Animal Specialist Hospital, where she improved after a dose of anti-inflammatories.

The same disease left a Turramurra resident severely disabled after eating a common garden slug as a lighthearted prank at a friend's place in 2010.

Dr Donald said pet bowls should not be left out with food in them where they can attract snails or slugs.

The most common signs [of the disease] are hind limb weakness and pain, bladder weakness, vomiting, and seizures. It can also be contracted by eating unwashed fruit and vegetables from gardens.

[Rat lungworm disease (RLWD) is an emerging tropical disease caused by a nematode, _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_, first discovered in China in 1935 (1), but now reported from other parts of Asia, Australia, the Caribbean, Pacific islands, Brazil, and Ecuador (2).

Since the 1st case of eosinophilic meningitis putatively caused by _A. cantonensis_ was reported in 1945, more than 2800 cases of RLWD have been reported in approximately 30 countries (2). Snails and slugs are the intermediate hosts. Recent qPCR techniques (3) have shown infection levels to be as high as almost 7000 parasites in a single semi-slug (4).

Garden slugs pose a risk when they are ingested and the article above reporting a serious disability should make everyone consider the risk, even if for a prank.
