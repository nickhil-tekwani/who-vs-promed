Citation: Latham RL, Beal EJ, Clarkson JP, et al. First report of _Pucciniastrum minimum_ (syn. _Thekopsora minima_) causing leaf rust on _Vaccinium corymbosum_ (blueberry) in the United Kingdom and pathogenicity on _Vaccinium myrtillus_ (bilberry). New Disease Reports. 2022; 45(1): e12057; doi: 10.1002/ndr2.12057.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two of 5 locally grown northern highbush blueberry plants (_Vaccinium corymbosum_) in Scotland showed, on less than 10 leaves each, rust-like symptoms of characteristic yellow-orange uredinia. While defoliation was observed, it is unknown if this was associated with the infection.

Morphology and DNA sequencing confirmed blueberry rust. Sequence analysis showed a 99.8% identity to a _Thekopsora minima_ (synonym _P. minimum_) isolate from Germany in the GenBank database.

Infectivity was confirmed and Koch's postulates fulfilled by detached leaf assays of both cultivated _V. corymbosum_ and wild _V. myrtillus_ (bilberry). The ability of the pathogen to cause disease in _V. myrtillus_ under laboratory conditions is particularly noteworthy due to the current significant threat of _Phytophthora_ species [see comment below] on bilberry populations in the UK.

This is the 1st report of _P. minimum_ in the UK and the 1st time _V. myrtillus_ has been identified as a host.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_ or _Naohidemyces vaccinii_, depending on the region; a 3rd species, _N. fujisanensis_, is restricted to Japan. The disease affects a range of plants in the Ericaceae family, including _Vaccinium_ species with crops like blueberry, bilberry, and cranberry, as well as ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides that release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely, resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and locally by splashing rain or mechanical means. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Commercial highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation, and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

Several species of fungus-like _Phytophthora_ oomycetes are considered serious pathogens threatening native trees and shrubs in Europe, North America, and Australasia (for example, ProMED post 20200929.7821049). The pathogens are soil borne. They are spread with soil and plant material, by water and mechanical means (often by contaminated equipment and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements) and removal or burning of affected plants. Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective in some tree species. Eradication or control of phytophthora diseases of trees in Australia and North America have been largely unsuccessful.
