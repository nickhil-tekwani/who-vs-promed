A deadly pesticide banned for use in the United States likely killed 4 pets and a possum in recent weeks in Kissimmee, according to the Osceola County Animal Services.

Three cats and the possum were found dead 2 weeks ago on Locust Berry Drive and a dog died the following weekend in the same neighborhood, Animal Services Director Kim Staton said [Mon 12 Oct 2015].

"It's kind of unusual to have that many deaths," said Staton "None of them showed external injuries."

The bodies of the cats and the possum were found within feet of a bowl filled with rice and beans outside an undisclosed home on the street. Tests conducted last week [week of 5 Oct 2015] at Michigan State University showed the bowl's contents had deadly levels of aldicarb, a pesticide banned for sale in the US, said Staton.

[bAldicarb may be illegal to use in Florida but that is not the case in the majority of the US. Sadly malicious poisonings with this agent are more rampant than has been publicized. While this is a restricted use pesticide, it apparently it is more easily acquired than most regulatory agencies admit.

Aldicarb is a multi-use pesticide that controls populations of agriculturally-harmful insects and nematodes. Belonging to the carbamate family of pesticides, aldicarb inhibits the production of cholinesterase in these various organisms. Primarily an insecticide, aldicarb was first synthetically produced by Union Carbide under the trade name Temik. Since then, because of the chemical's high toxicity, aldicarb has become highly regulated, being marked as a "Restricted Use Pesticide" in the United States. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, aldicarb is "one of the most acutely toxic pesticides registered in the United States" (Cox C, 1992). Only certified applicators are allowed use of the pesticide, and, regardless, all products containing aldicarb must be labeled "poison."

Carbamate insecticide poisoning has signs and symptoms similar to organophosphate poisoning, although the signs and symptoms of the former are not as prolonged. These signs and symptoms generally subside within a 6 hour period, unless the victim has been exposed to an extremely large amount of the chemical (Risher JF et al, 1987). Unfortunately for most of our pets and small animals as mentioned in the article, almost any dose is lethal to those animals.

This pesticide can harm humans through dermal and oral routes, and through inhalation of granules. However, the primary route of human exposure to aldicarb comes from the consumption of contaminated food and drinking water. In terms of the former, most cases stem from poor product handling, while in the latter, instances of aldicarb poisoning are due to contaminated wells (ExtoxnetPip, 2001). When aldicarb was still a commonly available insecticide, it routinely manifested itself in food crops, and in July of 1985 nearly 2000 people in Oregon and California became ill from eating contaminated watermelons. Similar fates fell upon consumers in Nebraska, British Columbia, and California in the subsequent years (Cox C, 1992). And as with other pesticides, many of the health effects associated from aldicarb use also stem from improper handling of the product itself.

Cholinesterase inhibition is the primary cause of aldicarb's range of signs and symptoms. If the production of the specific cholinesterase enzyme decreases by 30 percent, acute effects begin to present. These signs and symptoms can be organized into 2 groups:

Muscarinic signs are those that result from the stimulation of muscarinic receptors found in smooth muscles, especially around the heart and glands. Symptoms include
- tightness in chest and difficulty breathing due to bronchoconstriction
- increased bronchial secretions, sweating, and salivation
- nausea
- vomiting
- diarrhea
- abdominal cramps
- involuntary urination
- miosis (pupil constriction)

In contrast, nicotinic signs result from the accumulation of acetylcholine at the endings of motor nerves that communicate with skeletal muscles and ganglia. They include
- muscular effects: fatigue, weakness, and cramps.
- high blood pressure and hyperglycemia

Most animals who are capable of vomiting often vomit, but die any way. The vomit is an excellent substance for labs to test. The vomit is especially important because the act of vomition may empty the stomach, such that there are no contents for testing. Sadly, death is relatively rapid, thus providing little ability for veterinary help to treat the animal.

Throughout this article the terms "signs" and "symptoms" have been used. They are not the same thing. Signs are observed, such as in animals or children, while symptoms are spoken and may be a subjective assessment of the how the patient feels. Both terms have been used as this particular toxic agent affects both animals (signs) and human beings (symptoms).
