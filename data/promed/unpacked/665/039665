Norwalk-like virus infection reported on 10 cruises since May
-------------------------------------------------------------
The persistent [viral gastroenteritis] that marred 3 straight [consecutive?
- Mod.SH] cruises of the Holland America Amsterdam also has plagued 7 other
voyages on 5 other ships since May, federal health officials said on Tue 12
Nov 2002.
Although 10 cruises is a small number, the virus [a Norwalk-like virus] has
affected at least 1400 passengers and crew members on those trips and might
be the biggest single health concern for vacationers heading to sea, said
the top federal official overseeing cruise ship health. "Unfortunately,
it's been very common," said David Forney, chief of the Vessel Sanitation
Program of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
"It's a problem when you have thousands of people from all over the world
congregating in a relatively small environment. [Norwalk-like virus
infection] is not considered serious. It generally inflicts people with one
to two days of diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain. But for the elderly
and for those with chronic illness, the virus can lead to complications,
such as dehydration.
The [virus] spreads through food and water, through close contact with
infected people or things they have touched, and through raw shellfish.
About 181 000 Americans [are affected by the virus] each year.
"[Norwalk-like viruses are] extremely infectious and fairly easily
transmitted. We feel strongly the virus is spreading person to person,"
Forney said. "We've had no indications on any of the ships that it was due
to anything on the ships." Passengers, however, said they were skeptical,
noting that several ships had outbreaks on back-to-back cruises, with all
new passengers. Passengers also said the official counts of sick passengers
are too low because many never report it to the ship's overflowing infirmary.
Forney said the bug has struck the following ships:
- Amsterdam; 215 people on the Seattle cruise, 26 on the next cruise in the
Caribbean, and 183 on a cruise that ended on Monday. The ship left on the
night of 11 Nov 2002 for a 10-day Caribbean trip.
- Constellation (Celebrity line); 134 people on a cruise that arrived at
Port Everglades on Friday from Barcelona, Spain.
- Norwegian Sun; 93 people on a cruise into Miami on 5 Oct 2002.
- Norwegian Dream; 169 people on a cruise from Great Britain into Boston on
25 Sep 2002.
- Ryndam (Holland America); in Alaska over the summer, this ship had
outbreaks on 2 cruises affecting 218 and 176 people.
- Ocean Princess (Princess line) had outbreaks of 52 and 127 people.
CDC requires the ships to scrub every surface with a bleach solution during
the outbreak and on layover in port, Forney said. Ships with repeat
outbreaks may choose to cancel a trip and stay in port for a week of
intense cleaning. The Ryndam did so. The CDC can ground [!!!] a ship, but
has not done so recently, Forney said.
