A comment on 'Measles - Australia: (VI) 20090204.0495'
------------------------------------------------------
The Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Unit of the Victorian
Government Department of Human Services is continuing to investigate
the sudden and large increase in measles cases in Victoria. As of 5
Feb 2009, a total of 12 confirmed cases had been notified to the
department. There are 2 cases aged one year, 4 aged between 5 and 18
years, and the remainder are aged from 27 to 37 years. Eight cases
were reported to be not vaccinated and one case had previously
received one dose of measles vaccine. Three cases are of unknown
vaccination status.

Epidemiological investigations undertaken by the department and
genotyping by the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory
has established the presence of at least 3 distinct chains of
transmission, and possibly a 4th pending further investigations. The
index case in each of the 3 confirmed chains of transmission acquired
their infection overseas (Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast
Asia). One of the index cases has not resulted in further cases at
this stage, while the other 2 have resulted in 2 and 3 generations of
cases respectively. Situations in which transmission has occurred
include household contacts, health facilities, and dining establishments.

The department has undertaken a number of measures to control the
spread of disease including the follow up of contacts of cases for
measles vaccine or normal human immunoglobulin where indicated and
health alerts to general practitioners, hospital emergency
departments and the general public via the media.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr Fielding's prompt response. It is clear
that the sporadic nature of the cases is a consequence of separate
introductions from elsewhere, fortunately with only limited spread in
the local population.
