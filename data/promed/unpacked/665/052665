[The following information was obtained from a publication entitled "The emergence and spread of rabbit hemorrhagic disease type 2 virus (RHDV2) in Europe: a threat to wild rabbit populations" by Dolores Gavier-Widén and Aleksija Neimanis; published in the IUCN SSC Wildlife Health Specialist Group website:

"A new pathogenic _Lagovirus_, designated RHDV2 (also named RHDVb), emerged in France in 2010 (Le Gall-Recule et al, 2011; Le Gall-Recule et al, 2013). This new virus differs phylogenetically from other lagoviruses, including classic RHDV [Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus], and also presents a unique antigenic profile. RVHD2 partially escapes immunity conferred by previous exposure to classic RHDV resulting in re-emergence of disease, mortality and epidemics in wild and domestic rabbits. RHDV2 has rapidly spread throughout Europe and to date, has been reported in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Azores islands, and the UK, and most recently in Sweden. In large parts of Europe the new lagovirus has largely replaced the classic RHDV. [Note: in 2015 Australia reported RVHD2. See report below. - Mod.CRD]

"The emergent new lagovirus, RVHD2, has different epidemiological characteristics than classic RHDV, namely, i) its host range is broader causing disease not only in rabbits but also in Cape hares (_Lepus capensis_ subsp. _mediterraneus_) (Puggioni et al, 2013) and Italian hares (_L. corsicanus_) (Camarda et al, 2015); ii) it causes mortality in young rabbits (under 30 days of age) and iii) it has lower and more variable mortality rates.

'The origin of lagoviruses, including the recently emerged RHDV2, is not yet clear and the emergence of this new lagovirus, together with its impact on wild rabbit populations, are of concern. Moreover, the rapid spread of RHDV2 and its potential to affect other lagomorph species in sympatry [within the same geographical area] with populations of wild rabbits in Europe constitutes a threat not only to lagomorphs, but also to species that feed on them."
