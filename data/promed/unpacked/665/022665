die-off, this particular post is from the diagnostic laboratory
having done the work and is a useful confirmation of the diagnosis. - Mod.TG]

Subject: cause of death, steers in a Wisconsin feedlot from mycotoxin
in moldy sweet potato

This post is a response to a request for information regarding the
cause of death of approximately 200 steers in a Portage County,
Wisconsin feedlot.

In mid-January 2011, approximately 200 steers died in a Portage
County feedlot. Specimens from 2 animals were submitted to the
Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (WVDL) for testing.

Results from testing at a referral laboratory identified the presence
of ipomeanol in the feed. This compound is a mycotoxin present in
moldy sweet potato. Sweet potato waste, not intended for human
consumption, was a significant component of the diet of the steers at
the time of the disease event.

The major viral bovine pathogens of cattle (BHV1, BVDV, BRSV, Corona
virus) were not identified by PCR in the samples provided to the
WVDL. (When the deaths of the steers were 1st reported, there was
speculation that IBR/BVD was the cause of death.)

Based on history, clinical signs, macroscopic and microscopic changes
in tissue, and test results from the WVDL and the referral
laboratory, it is very likely that mycotoxin from moldy sweet potato
was a major factor in the disease and death loss observed in the these steers.
