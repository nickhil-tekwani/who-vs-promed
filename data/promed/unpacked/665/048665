More than 200 students fell ill after taking deworming tablets on [Sat 1 Apr 2017] in Kushtia Sadar [Khulna division] in Bangladesh.

Teachers and relatives said as soon as the students were given the deworming medicines by the District Health Department as part of National Deworming Week, they started feeling dizzy and their stomachs ached.

From 1 pm to 6 pm at least 200 students were admitted in the Kushtia Sadar Hospital.

An inquiry team of 5 members was formed with Civil Surgeon Nazmul Islam heading the investigation into the incident.

The surgeon said there is nothing to worry about. The students fell ill due to having the medicine on empty stomachs, but no one is in danger.

With proper treatment and rest, the students will recover quickly, said Dr Tapas Kumar Paul, a residence doctor of the hospital.

However, some of the students have already returned home after treatment, he said.

According to the WHO, albendazole and mebendazole tablets are the most commonly used drugs in school deworming programs (http://www.who.int/intestinal_worms/resources/en/at_a_glance.pdf).

Albendazole and mebendazole should always be taken on a full stomach, or certainly with a meal. Providing it without a meal is likely to cause stomach upset. Severe vomiting and/or prolonged vomiting can lead to dehydration and this may be what the children were treated for, in addition to stopping the vomiting. - Mod.TG
