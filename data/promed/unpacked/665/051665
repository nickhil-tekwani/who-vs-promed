Livestock officials have asked dairy farmers not to panic after lumpy skin disease [LSD], which is characterised by nodules on the skin, has spread in cattle farms in Chattogram [formerly Chittagong]. The disease was detected for the 1st time in Bangladesh at a farm in Karnaphuli Upazila's Shikalbaha in July [2019], according to Mohammad Reazul Haque, Chattogram district livestock officer. Experts believe the disease spread in Bangladesh from India, he told bdnews24.com [see comment].

There are 1655 cattle farms in Chattogram. The disease has spread among around 20% of the cows in these farms, according to the government. Cattle raised at homes have also been affected.

[An immediate notification to the OIE reporting the 1st occurrence of lumpy skin disease [LSD], an OIE-listed cattle disease, in Bangladesh was submitted by the authorities on 15 Sep 2019. According to the report, the date of start of the event, located in the Anwara upazila (district) of the Chittagong division (province) was 14 Jul 2019. Its confirmation was obtained by the national laboratory (Central Diseases Investigation Laboratory, Dhaka), applying real-time PCR, on 27 Aug 2019. The immediate report with an interactive map is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=31742.

A 2nd outbreak, starting 28 Jul 2019, was reported in follow-up report No 1, dated 13 Oct 2019. This outbreak was located in the district Narayanganj, within the division Dhaka. The distance between the Anwara and Narayanganj Districts exceeds 200 km or 124 mi. It may be assumed that the disease is not restricted to the said 2 outbreaks.

Media reports about suspected LSD in the state of Orissa (Odisha), eastern India, started to appear late in August 2019, continuing until the 1st event (3 outbreaks) became, eventually, officially confirmed on 16 Nov 2019. An immediate notification was submitted to the OIE on 18 Nov 2019 (20190822.6635505, 20191119.6787416). Additional Details from India, in particular the (suspected) route of introduction, are expected to become available in the due follow-up reports.

Lumpy skin disease is primarily a disease of cattle, but clinical cases have been reported in Asian water buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_) as well. India's cattle population - the world largest - is about 330 million cows, followed by Brazil (210 million) and China (about 100 million). India's water-buffalo population is, according to OIE's figures for 2017, 108.7 million - exceeding 50% of the world population.

OIE's interactive map of LSD outbreaks reported globally since 1 Jan 2018 is available at https://tinyurl.com/usloaar (click on the Indian cluster and zoom in to view the outbreaks in Bangladesh and India). - Mod.AS
