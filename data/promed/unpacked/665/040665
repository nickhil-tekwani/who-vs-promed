INFLUENZA VIRUS, VACCINE RESPONSE: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

[Dr. Michael Sauri has asked ProMED mail to post this 'Request for
information.' Responses should be addressed directly to Dr. Sauri and
not to ProMED-mail. ProMED-mail is pleased to assist Dr. Sauri, but
cannot enter into discussion of the performance or relative merits of
particular vaccines. - Mod.CP]

Several Internal Medicine Clinics in the Washington metropolitan area
are seeing a number of patients who previously received the 2007-2008
influenza vaccine but are presenting with flu-like symptoms with a
documented influenza A or B infection by the QuickVue Test. Although
I realize that no vaccine offers 100 percent protection, I have not
seen in my 30 years of practice such a relatively large number of
patients presenting with documented influenza vaccine "failure." I
would like to query other PROMED forum members if they are noticing
similar cases of influenza vaccine "failures." To date, we have noted
no cases in patients who received FluMist.

Obviously, these cases may simply reflect that the vaccine is waning
due to a "late" presentation of influenza in this area and need to
give a booster dose to our high risk population. On the other hand,
these cases may suggest a true vaccine failure due to the
preponderance of a circulating H3N2 strain (that emerged near the end
of the Australia's flu season), as well as a novel B/Yamagata lineage
virus (see CDC Influenza Weekly Report dated 1-26-08). The experience
of ProMED-mail readers would be appreciated.

[It might be relevant to consider the age spectrum of the 'vaccine
failures' since the elderly respond relatively poorly to vaccination
with inactivated influenza virus vaccines. - Mod.CP]
