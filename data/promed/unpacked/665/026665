Vietnamese child dies from bird flu [106th case/52nd death]
-----------------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute said the country's
latest human case of bird flu infection was an 11 year old boy from
northern Ha Nam province, who died on 14 Mar 2008 after 4 days of treatment
in Hanoi capital, the Viet Nam News Agency reported Monday [17 Mar 2008].

The institute's tests showed that the boy from Thanh Liem district was
infected with bird flu virus strain H5N1, the news agency quoted Nguyen Lap
Quyet, director of the Ha Nam Health Department, as saying. The boy became
ill on 5 Mar 2008, and was admitted to the Ha Nam General Hospital in the
province on 8 Mar 2008, and the National Hospital of Pediatrics in Hanoi on
11 Mar 2008.

In late February [2008], 10 [birds] out of a chicken flock raised by the
boy's family fell ill and died gradually. Then, his family slaughtered some
healthy chickens of the flock for meals. Relevant provincial agencies have
disinfected and detoxified the affected area, and selected samples from
fowls in the area for bird flu testing.

In June 2007, a 28 year old woman from the [same] district died from bird flu.

To date, Viet Nam has reported a total of 106 human cases of bird flu
infections, including 52 fatalities, in 35 cities and provinces since bird
flu started to hit the country in December 2003 [These figures include the
current case/fatality. - Mod.CP]. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
yet to confirm the latest case.

According to the country's Department of Animal Health, Viet Nam currently
has 11 localities [with poultry affected by bird flu]: Ninh Binh, Phu Tho,
Ha Nam, Tuyen Quang, Hanoi, and Lao Cai in the northern region; Quang Tri,
Quang Binh, and Quang Nam in the central region; and Soc Trang and Vinh
Long in the southern region. Bird flu outbreaks in Viet Nam, starting in
December 2003, have killed and led to the forced culling of dozens of
millions of fowls in the country.

human cases of H5N1 avian influenza to 373 and the number of deaths to 236.
