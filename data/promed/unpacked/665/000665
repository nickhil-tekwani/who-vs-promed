[Re: ProMED post 20070620.1989 -- see ref. below:
"An _Eschericha coli_ [O157] outbreak at a St. Catharines, ON,
restaurant that made several people seriously ill was likely caused by
improperly handled food, say public health officials... Traces of _E.
coli_ O157 were found in samples of chicken shawarma and a carving
knife from the restaurant, Sider said."]

We would also support that view, in that it has been shown that
poultry (layer hens in particular) are almost certainly potential
transmission vectors of VTEC [verotoxin-producing _E. coli_] on
farms.

living layer hens. Lett Appl Microbiol 2006; 43: 293-5.

[ProMED-mail thanks the authors for the above information. Indeed,
although cattle, sheep, and goats are the 1st animals thought of
having an association with _E. coli_ O157, many others may carry or
experimentally support carriage of the organism. Among these are
other ground animals (or products from them) such as deer (1),
reindeer (2), pigs (3), horses (4), dogs and cats (5), and rats (6).
Additionally, not only can the organism be found in domesticated
birds as mentioned in the posting above, semi-domesticated birds such
as pigeons (7) and wild birds (8) may also be linked. These
statistics are not meant, however, to imply that many of these other
animals are major sources of human infection with verotoxin-producing
_E. coli_.
Finally, as submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett, it has
recently been reported that the metamorph (the in-between stage that
still has a tail but where the legs have started coming through) of
the American bullfrog can support growth of the organism (9).
