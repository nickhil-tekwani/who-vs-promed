Two Tangerang residents test negative for bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
Tangerang health agency on Thursday [26 Feb 2009] said 2 residents of
Kampung Geruduk, Tangerang, who were suspected of having contracted
the avian influenza virus had tested negative for the deadly disease.
"Both tests came back negative," health agency official Yully Soenar
said, as quoted by 'tempointeraktif.com' on Thursday [26 Feb 2009].

A 15-year-old boy and a 2-year-old child were being treated in the
bird flu isolation unit at Tangerang General Hospital for almost a
week. The pair was admitted to the unit when the hospital found they
had high fever and difficulty breathing, and local authorities
reported that there was dead poultry near their places of residence.

Yully said the symptoms found were indicative of acute respiratory
infection disease and bronchitis.
