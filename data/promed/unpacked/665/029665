A third person ill with cholera after visiting China was identified in
Russia's Maritime Territory on Friday. Private entrepreneur B. went to
China last week on a business visit and returned with a cholera vibrio in
his blood. Earlier, two long-haul truckers had been found to be ill with
this dangerous disease. They had visited a supposed infection focus in
China -- the border town of Duning, an official at the Territorial centre
for civil defence and emergencies has told Itar-Tass.
The official said the efforts of all special services of the Territory have
been enlisted to check penetration of cholera into Russian territory. Tens
of Russian tourists who return from China are being examined at two field
infection hospitals set up in the border city of Ussuriisk.
Doctors pay special attention to people who had contacts with Russian
cholera patients. Seventy-nine relatives, friends and acquaintances of the
first identified cholera patient have already been examined thoroughly and
have been pronounced above suspicion.
Similar work is under way among the contacts of the other two cholera
patients. As of now, another several people with suspicious symptoms, such
as intestinal disorder and elevated temperature, have been identified.
However, only after all analyses are completed, it will be possible to say
exactly whether they are ill with cholera.
Immediately after a cholera diagnosis was made, a quarantine was instituted
on the Sino-Russian border. Pending the normalisation of the
epidemiological situation, Chinese nationals are not allowed to enter the
Territory while Russian tourists and businessmen may not leave for China.
Meanwhile, if the number of cholera cases mounts up to 5, the Territory may
be declared an epidemic-stricken zone and closed for a 40-day quarantine,
not only for China but the whole of Russia as well.

[It's curious that they've established "five" as the threshold for
"epidemic" declaration of the Maritime Territory. It's also curious that
they will then quarantine the zone as quarantine has not been demonstrated
to be an effective epidemic control measure, especially for cholera. - MPP
