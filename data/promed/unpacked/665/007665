Cattle Disease Breaks Out in Western Province
---------------------------------------------
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) has broken out in Western
Province, chief veterinary officer in the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries (MAFF) Dominic Minyoi confirmed.
The government has advised all cattle dealers to get permits for any
livestock movement in the area. Dr. Minyoi said new cases of CBPP have been
recorded in Yuka village, 5 km from Kalabo district. He said there were
traces of the disease in Sikongo prior to the partial lift of the ban last
May which spread to Yuka.
Dr. Minyoi attributed the outbreak to possible illegal livestock movements.
He said the partial lift of the ban by the ministry was in response to
cries from the people in Western Province that there were beef shortages
due to high prices.
The ministry advised farmers and cattle dealers in the area to cooperate
with veterinary staff, who will advise them on other options to reduce
further spread.

[This highly contagious pneumonia is generally accompanied by pleurisy. The
causal organism is _Mycoplasma mycoides mycoides_ small colony type.
Susceptible cattle become infected by inhaling droplets disseminated by
coughing of affected cattle.
Goats and sheep are not important in the epidemiology.
Septicemia produces lesions in the kidneys and placenta, which can be
sources of infection. Transplacental infection of the fetus is known to
occur. In the environment, survival of the organism is poor. However, the
incubation period varies from 3-8 weeks.
In susceptible herds there may be 100 percent morbidity, while mortality is
likely to approach 50 percent. In recovered animals, 25 percent may be
carriers. - Mod.TG
