A new BSE case in Denmark - fallen stock
----------------------------------------
The new case was found in a herd of Danish White & Black cattle in
North Jylland. The cow died on the premises and was sent to the
rendering plant. According to routine, a sample was sent to a
[commercial bio-analytical laboratory in Denmark]. The sample was
found positive on 4 Oct 2002 and subsequently forwarded to the Danish
Veterinary Institute. Because of the sample's quality it was sent on
to England for confirmation. Today the positive result for BSE was
received from England.
The cow was 7.5 years old. It never left the herd it was born into,
consisting of 132 milkers and 96 young animals.
The herd had sold 68 animals to 12 different farms in Denmark and 27
calves to Holland. Since the initial positive result, the herd has
been quarantined.
The following steps will be taken:
1. The whole herd, as well as the sold animals, will be destroyed and burnt.
2. On the buying farms, all animals older then 24 month will be tested for BSE.
3. The Danish Plant Directorate will investigate the feed that could
have been a source of transmission; reports are to be submitted at a
later date.
4. Information to other countries will be made through Danish
representatives abroad.
The current BSE situation in Denmark is the following:
With this last case, there have been 9 Danish-born cases of BSE: 1 in
2000, 6 in 2001, 2 in 2002. Except these ones, there was a single
case imported from Scotland in 1992 and one case exported to Portugal.
The incidence of BSE in Denmark is still low and the total number of
cases during 2002 do not deviate from the latest forecasts.

[The previous (eighth) BSE case in Denmark was reported in "BSE -
update (06) May, 2002". The Danish investigations into the possible
source of infection have been reported by the Danish Veterinary and
Food Administration in ProMED-mail posting "BSE - Denmark: source" of
24 Dec 2001, concluding:
"The following possibilities for infection with BSE cannot be ruled
out with regard to the first 7 cases of BSE in Denmark:
1. Contamination with MBM -- for example, by legally used
swine-and-poultry feed on the farms or feed mixing systems as well as
cross contamination due to the use of feed transport vehicles not
properly cleaned.
2. Animal fat in feed for cattle -- for example, in milk replacements
for calves."
No additional data on the continuing investigations have been available since.
The following summary of the 8 previous Danish cases of BSE has been
derived from the website of the Danish Veterinary and Food
Administration
