Confirmed cases of salmonellosis linked to a South Australian bakery have climbed to 35 with more expected as tests continue. SA Health says 9 people, including 2 children, have been hospitalized after eating products from the Gawler South bakery, which has 2 outlets in Gawler, about 40 km north of central Adelaide. The link to the bakery was 1st revealed late in December 2017.

"We've now seen cases in people aged 2 years to 70 years old, and we are anticipating more cases as further test results come through," SA Health's director of public health Kevin Buckett said. The source of the contamination had been linked to sandwiches, wraps, rolls and focaccias with chicken and other fillings. "While salmonellae weren't detected in the food and environmental samples taken from the bakery last week, this isn't unusual, as the source of the contamination has often passed by the time we identify a common link between cases," Buckett said. He added that the bakery's management was cooperating with authorities and had made improvements to food safety practices.

In a statement posted on social media, the bakery's management said it was no longer cooking chicken on the premises and that SA Health officials were happy with its food handling processes. Management also apologised to anyone who had become sick. "We hope this apology is received to be genuine and in good faith," the statement said.

According to the ABC, the bakery was also struck by a salmonellosis outbreak in October 2016 which affected 8 people.

The symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, vomiting, headaches, stomach cramps and loss of appetite. Symptoms typically appear 12 to 36 hours after exposure but can appear as soon as 6 hours and up to 72 hours afterwards. Infection is usually the result of ingesting bacteria from contaminated food, water, or hands. High-risk foods include poultry, meat, eggs, and milk.

[As more cases are reported from the exposure period, it appears that this growing outbreak is related to undercooked chicken in some of the products sold at the bakery. The combination of adequate cooking of the poultry along with appropriate kitchen hygiene to prevent cross-contamination should minimize the risk of transmission. - Mod.LL
