On 10 Apr 2014, Mozambique health authorities confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever centered in Pemba, the capital city of Cabo Delgado province in the north of Mozambique.

On 11 Mar [2014], local health authorities in Cabo Delgado reported an increased number of acute febrile patients who tested negative for Plasmodium, but presented with mild signs of hemorrhage in the skin or gums. With support of Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), the Ministry of Health initiated an outbreak investigation.

From 22 reported suspected cases, 16 were laboratory confirmed as recent dengue virus infection using a battery of testing which included rapid tests in the field, IgM and NS1 antigen detection ELISA at Virus Isolation Laboratory, National Institute of Health in Maputo.

For further characterization and confirmation, blood samples were submitted to the Centre for Emerging and Zoonotic Diseases, National Institute for Communicable Diseases, National Health Laboratory Service in South Africa. Serological and molecular tests confirmed the findings from Mozambique. Further typing through molecular sequencing of PCR products and typing RT-PCR confirmed dengue 2 virus as the causative agent of the outbreak.

The Ministry of Health and local authorities are co-coordinating efforts to respond to and control the outbreak, including active case management, vector control measures, public health awareness and education. Most confirmed cases presented mildly and no deaths have been reported to date.

This is the 1st confirmed report of dengue fever in Mozambique since 1984 when an outbreak of dengue 3 [virus] was confirmed.

[The 21 Apr 2014 edition of All Africa (http://allafrica.com/stories/201404220522.html) reports that there are 30 confirmed dengue cases in Cabo Delgado province.

ProMED thanks Dr. Gudo for this 1st hand report of a dengue outbreak in Mozambique. These kinds of 1st hand reports are very valuable, especially those from Africa, which do not come in frequently.

Sri Lanka. 24 Apr 2014. Dengue viruses circulating, types 1, 2, 3, and 4; New genetic variants of DENV1 and new clades of DENV3 are the reasons for epidemics in the last decade, according to the review in the January 2014 International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Malaysia
- National. 21 Apr 2014. Dengue 28 814 cases; Deaths 66 [CFR less than 1 per cent] ; Dengue virus circulating type 2; Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam said the public should realise that the measure taken by the ministry was only temporary as fogging could only kill adult _Aedes_ mosquitoes. [Fogging does not kill larvae in breeding places, leaving them to produce more adult mosquitoes. - Mod.JW]

"The public should not depend too much on fogging as the most effective measure is their active involvement in destroying all _Aedes_ mosquito breeding grounds [containers] in their homes and surrounding areas," he said.
