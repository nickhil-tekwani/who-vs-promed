The biggest ever marine algal bloom has hit coastal waters off China's
booming southern port of Shenzhen, state media reported on Thursday. The
report comes days after green algae in China's 3rd largest lake cut off
water supplies to millions of residents in Wuxi, in eastern Jiangsu province.
Commonly known as "red tide," toxic algal blooms can devastate marine plant
and animal life and are exacerbated by coastal run-off from fertilizers and
untreated human waste. "This is the biggest red tide that has ever appeared
off the city's coast," the China Daily quoted Zhou Kai, an expert with the
local marine environment monitoring station, as saying.
Zhou said the 50 sq km (19 sq mi) slick off the west coast of Shenzhen, a
major industrial centre bordering Hong Kong in Guangdong province, was the
3rd outbreak this year [2007] and was likely to persist without rain. "The
weather remains sunny and hot, which means the red tide is here to stay for
now," Zhou said. "We strongly urge the public to stay away from the
polluted sea areas and not eat sea products from there," he added.
Provincial and local governments have poured billions of yuan into cleaning
up coastal waters off Guangdong, but discharges from human waste and
heavy-polluting industries continue to take their toll. The bloom would not
cause major economic losses, Zhou said, but "the foul smell of the dying
algae will be unpleasant for the people living in affected areas, and the
tide's annoying red color will also mar the pleasant view."
China has slowed, but not reversed, a rising tide of pollution from
frenetic industrialization, the national environment agency said on Tuesday
[5 Jun 2007], in the face of increasing public anger over foul air and water.

[Numerous algal organisms can produce the toxic phenomenon known as red
tide. The algae most often affect seafood that is consumed by people, and
its effects are reported as paralytic shellfish poisoning. Red tides may
produce respiratory irritation in swimmers and beach goers. - Mod.TG
