Following 2 weeks of USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) Situation Reports with no new confirmed vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) cases and all previously positive premises released from quarantine, APHIS confirmed one new positive equine premises, in Texas County, Missouri, in its 8 Oct 2020 report.

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Once APHIS confirms a county as VSV-positive, new equine premises in the county showing clinical signs of VSV aren't required to be tested. Instead, the premises is quarantined and classified as suspect. Also classified as suspect are premises where animals don't meet the definition of a confirmed case but where diagnostic evidence of a recent VSV infection exists.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks.... Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[We hope this outbreak will begin to tail off or stop altogether soon. Usually a frost is helpful in eliminating the insects capable of transmitting the disease.

VSV is spread by insects, such as black flies, sand flies and midges, and by direct contact with infected animals. Other insects may also be capable of spreading the virus.

Infected animals develop blisters, especially on the nose and lips, and virus is shed from these lesions (blisters). Direct contact with infected animals or water, feed, buckets, and other fomites such as halters contaminated with saliva from infected animals can also transmit the disease.

This particular outbreak started as 2 separate serotypes, but the USDA dropped the designations shortly. It would be nice to know what serotypes were found and where. It's hoped such a report will be released by the USDA. - Mod.TG
