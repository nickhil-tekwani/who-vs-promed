Colonial War Memorial Hospital in Suva reports having admitted 31
clinically-suspected cases of dengue fever since December 18, with 3 to 4
new cases admitted per day in the last week. An undetermined number of
these cases have been suspected as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever [DHF]. There
have been 3 deaths so far, suspected as due to DHF. All three died within
three to five days of the onset of illness, and two days of admission, and
all three were adults between 25 and 40 years of age. One death was due to
intracranial hemorrhage, one to generalised profuse bleeding, and one still
hasn't been ruled out as septicaemia. Overall, cases admitted so far have
ranged in age from 14 to 55 years, with an average age of 28 years. Many
less serious cases of unclassified viral illness suspected as dengue have
been reported as being seen in the general outpatient and accident and
emergency departments. There has been a distinct rise in overall numbers
of patients seen in both departments. CWM Hospital is the major referral
hospital in Fiji, serving the capital and surrounding areas with a
population of roughly 250,000.
To date, none of the admitted cases have been confirmed serologically as
dengue, and the dengue virus serotypes for these cases obviously are still
unknown. Cases have been identified by low blood platelet counts, and
platelet infusions have been given to patients to prevent haemorrhagic
complications. The Consultant Physician in the medical wards reported
highly variable results with platelet infusions - some patients with very
high platelet counts were reported as bleeding, and others with very low
platelet counts had no bleeding at all.
At least 11 admitted cases reside in Suva city, with the remainder admitted
from suburban and rural areas around Suva. These cases were officially
reported to the Ministry yesterday (Monday), though increased dengue cases
had been seen since late November. Further, Lautoka Hospital on the
opposite side of the main island reported seeing at least 7 suspected cases
in November based on fevers combined with low platelet counts. None were
serologically confirmed as dengue according to the Welcome Virus Lab in
Suva. It is presumed that the samples from this recent outbreak report
have been sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre in Brisbane, Australia for
confirmation.
There have been 12 serologically confirmed cases since July, with 5 in
November, and 1 reported in December. At least one of these samples was
identified as dengue 2 virus. However, confirmatory testing has not been
systematic throughout that time, with several of the dengue positives
discovered through testing samples that had been sent to the national virus
lab for influenza / respiratory virus studies. There may have been a far
greater number of asymptomatic and clinically presenting cases in that time
that went unreported and / or undiagnosed.
The public has been advised of the situation, and warned to take measures
to avoid mosquito bites including destroying breeding sites, wearing
protective clothing, using mosquito repellents and insecticides. However,
it is feared that the measures will be too little, too late, despite
increased efforts by the Ministry in the past year to mobilise breeding
source reduction campaigns, participation in a regional vector-borne
disease project. [There is concern] that the outbreak will accelerate
with more deaths and widespread morbidity in the coming weeks.
