The recent outbreak of sickness linked to a local farm ranks among Pennsylvania's 3 most severe outbreaks of disease linked to raw milk in the past 5 years. The Pennsylvania Department of Health reported on Mon 13 Feb 2012 that raw milk produced at the Family Cow farm near Scotland was linked to 65 cases of campylobacteriosis in 4 states: 56 in Pennsylvania, 4 in Maryland, 3 in West Virginia, and 2 in New Jersey.

Since 2006, Pennsylvania has had at least 7 disease outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption, according to Pennsylvania Department of Health spokeswoman Holli Senior. Campylobacter bacteria have caused most of the outbreaks, and salmonella caused the remainder. More than 250 people became ill. The 2 largest outbreaks were in 2008. An outbreak originating in Lancaster County sickened 72 people and another in Montgomery County made 68 people ill.

Raw milk bottled at the Family Cow around 16 Jan 2012 has been blamed for the recent outbreak. The Pennsylvania and Maryland health departments told consumers on 27 Jan 2012 to dispose of milk produced from 1 Jan 2012. The onset of sickness in individuals has been from 17 Jan 2012 to 1 Feb 2012.

The Family Cow voluntarily stopped selling raw milk for 11 days and resumed sales on 7 Feb 2012 after a Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture inspection re-approved the dairy's operations. Owner Edwin Shank said the farm is installing milk testing equipment to go beyond the Department of Agriculture's requirements. The wash water at the bottling shop also is hotter. He suspects water that was not hot enough may have played a role in the bacteria outbreak.

The Family Cow sells 130 000 servings of raw milk a month from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia and the Lehigh Valley. Many consumers drive from out of state to purchase the untreated milk, which cannot be sold legally in their state. Raw milk produced in Pennsylvania is labeled with a warning about possible health risks associated with its consumption. Farms selling raw milk also post the warning.

[A breakdown of the 56 cases of campylobacteriosis in Pennsylvania by county through Mon 13 Feb 2012:
Franklin 18, Lancaster 8, Delaware 5, York 5, Chester 4, Cumberland 4, Bucks 4, Montgomery 3, Adams 1, Wyoming 1, Allegheny 1, Dauphin 1, Northampton 1.

Although the number of cases linked to this outbreak, from a vehicle that is inherently unsafe, continues rise, it appears that the rise is a function of case reporting and not newly presenting ones, as the date of the onset of the newest cases is 13 days ago.
