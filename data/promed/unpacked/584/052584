Two children are in hospital after a suspected _E. coli_ outbreak at a nursery in Cheshire [county, England]. Public health officers said the children, who both go to the Chrysalis Day Nursery in Northwich, were being treated at Leighton Hospital due to "complications."

In total, 7 children and 3 family members had shown symptoms of the infection, the officers added. Children and staff at the nursery are being screened as a precaution.

[The serotype of this probable EHEC cluster is not stated.

Secondary spread of EHEC is quite common in day care centers. A Minnesota study (1) reported person-to-person EHEC transmission in all 9 daycare facilities examined with a median attack rate of 22 percent. The median age of the primary case was 26 months. Introduction of EHEC into the daycare center is often from an asymptomatic, household-acquired infant. After EHEC is introduced into this setting, screening policies should not be based solely upon reported symptoms, since it is clear that asymptomatic shedding occurs. Because of this, in the presence of EHEC, screening of all children in attendance at the daycare setting with at least one stool examination for EHEC is recommended (2).
