I refer to [the Karwacki, Jerome J COL USAMC-AFRIMS's posting of closure of
schools leading to possible spread of HFMD in Singapore, dated Wed, 20 Sep
2000 13:52:23 +0700.
I am speaking in an unofficial capacity as an interested academic.
Firstly, as far as I know, children of affected (closed) schools are NOT
"distributed" to other schools. Parents have been advised and were
strongly encouraged to keep their children at home and away from
crowds/parties. This is based on anecdotal evidence.
<http://www.env.gov.sg/info/press/pr99/rel-102-2000.html>
Secondly, only 1 school (Cutie Kids Playhouse) was closed because of a
death of a child involved.

<http://www.env.gov.sg/info/press/pr99/rel100-2000.html>
Thirdly, can anyone suggest how such a hypothesis (i.e. school closure
leading to further spread) be tested?

[Thank you Dr. Chia for sending on the webpage information. The webpages
given are the press releases from the Singapore Ministry of the Environment
which covers Public Health in Singapore. There is an excellent FAQ page on
HFMD http://www.env.gov.sg/info/press/qed/index.html for the general
public which provides the appropriate recommendations for case
identification and management at home as well as prevention of further
community spread. The webpage on the outbreak does mention the closure of
the one daycare center as mentioned by Dr. Chia with the statement "...will
remain closed for at least 10 days and the place cleaned and sterilized.
This is to cover the virus' incubation period of 3-5 days and ensure that
no viruses linger beyond the incubation period."
Dr. Chia's question on how one might address the question of whether the
closings did impact negatively on the epidemic is well placed. One way to
address this would be to compare school rosters of attendees during the
week prior to the onset of cases to see if there were duplicate names,
suggesting that there was a changing of schools due to the closures.
Additionally, a survey of what children did during the days their centers
were closed might also shed some light on this question to see if they did
remain at home or were out in the community. - Mod.MPP
