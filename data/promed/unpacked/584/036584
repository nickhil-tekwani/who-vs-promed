An epidemic of pneumonic plague has been raging for weeks in the
northern region of Madagascar, mainly around Ambilobe. There are
already 16 deaths attributed to this epidemic.

This statement of the "Chancellery detached from France" in Diego
Suarez is based on information from the referring doctor's office,
Dr. Anant Govinjee:
"An epidemic of pneumonic plague occurred in the region between Diana
and Ambilobe Ambanja, specifically east of Beramanja (65 km). The
first suspected case appeared 27 Jan 2011, followed by a first death
on 29 Jan 2011. The death toll stands at 16.

A team of the Ministry of Health of Diego Suarez and a team from the
Pasteur Institute are on site. Preventive measures have been taken and
mass chemoprophylaxis is being carried out.

[Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague
presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in
infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are
secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through
air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic
plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or
tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive
antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for
prophylaxis are tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial
resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et
al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a
transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997;337: 677-81). The strain was
resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline but
sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other
aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation, however, it is not
clear if this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. -

[The authorities are implementing rat control in the area, but unless
they carry out flea control first, that will just make matters worse,
because infectious fleas will jump from dying rats to humans. The
epidemic seems to be spreading remarkably slowly for an airborne
disease, with just 16 deaths in 3 weeks for a disease that is
"invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure" (actually within 48hrs).
