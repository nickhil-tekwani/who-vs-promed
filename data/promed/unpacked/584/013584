A marked increase in case fatality has been observed among reported
cases of invasive group B streptococcal infections (GBS) in infants
younger than 90 days old (thereafter referred to as infant) in Norway
since the beginning of 2006. 24 cases of GBS in infants were reported
to the Norwegian communicable disease notification system (MSIS)
between 1 Jan and 21 Jul 2006, and 8 cases (33 percent) have been fatal (1).
The 24 cases were reported from 9 hospitals: 13 of the cases were in
boys (54 percent). Four of the 8 deaths were in girls and 4 in boys
and occurred in 6 major hospitals in southern Norway. The
distribution of all reported cases of infant GBS infection does not
show any difference from previous years in relation to geographical
distribution. Clinical data were available for all cases: 3 cases
developed meningitis (13 percent), 14 had signs of sepsis (58
percent), and 2 cases had both (8 percent). One case had pneumonia (4
percent), and other clinical symptoms have been reported in 4 cases
(17 percent). 19 cases occurred in the 2nd quarter of 2006, between
the 15th and 29th week in 2006 (Figure 1, [for figure, see original
URL. - Mod.LL]).
The average incidence rate of invasive GBS infections was 0.7/ 1000
live births (range 0.45-1.0) in 2000-2005, comparable with recent
findings in other European countries (2). The estimated incidence
rate in the 1st 6 months of 2006 based of the number of cases
reported as of 21 Jul 2006 is 0.85/ 1000 live births. The
case-fatality (CF), however, is nearly 6 times higher than the
average case fatality (5.8 percent) reported in the years 2000-2005
(Figure 2 [for figure, see original URL, but no year since 1990 had a
CF more than 12 percent - Mod. LL]). Further investigation is pending
to establish what factors may have led to this increase in case
fatality. Six of the 8 deaths reported in this recent period were
associated with early onset disease (0-6 days; CF=46 percent), and 2
with late onset disease (7-90 days; CF=18 percent). Recently, an
overall case fatality of 4 percent has been reported in Germany (3)
and 10 percent in the United Kingdom and Ireland (4).
The Norwegian Institute of Public Health has contacted all maternity,
neonatal, pediatric and hospital microbiology departments in Norway
to raise awareness of the disease and to enhance the surveillance of
invasive GBS infection, which has been a notifiable disease in Norway
since 1986. Detailed characterization of isolates from all cases
reported in 2006 and referred to the national reference laboratory is
ongoing. An epidemiological study will be launched to identify
factors that may have contributed to the increase in case fatality.
An enquiry was sent via the European Union's Early Warning and
Response System (EWRS) on 21 Jul 2006 to find out whether other
countries have recently observed a similar increase in case fatality
among infants with diagnosed systemic GBS infection. So far, we have
not received such information.
Guidelines issued in 1998 by the Norwegian Society of Gynecologists
and Obstetrics specify the use of penicillin prophylaxis during
delivery for one or more of the following: previous newborn with GBS
infection, recurrent GBS urinary tract infection, preterm rupture of
the membranes, signs of infection or fever during delivery (5).
Norwegian guidelines for antenatal care from the Directorate for
Health and Social Affairs in 2005 do not recommend universal
antenatal microbiological screening for GBS carriage (6). Although
the reason for the increased case fatality has not yet been
identified, the Norwegian health authorities are considering a
revision of current policies.
Any relevant information about recent increase in case fatality in
infants with systemic and severe invasive GBS infection in other
countries would be appreciated, and should be sent to the corresponding author.

[The observed mortality rate recalls that seen in the 1970s when
group B streptococcal disease initially emerged as a neonatal
pathogen, before improved recognition and treatment lowered the
mortality. With intrapartum prophylaxis widely used in the US, the
burden of group B streptococcal disease has shifted to adults,
especially the elderly and those with co-morbidities, and the
mortality rate in this population is also quite high. The reasons
for the increase in neonatal mortality in Norway is unclear raising
questions of bacterial factors such as a more virulent or antibiotic
resistant strain or changes in neonatal care practices. The results
of the investigation now underway will be eagerly awaited. Other
countries should be vigilant for similar trends. Mod.LM]
[The cause of this observed increased mortality for GBS infections in
infants is as yet unclear. The most current guidelines in the USA for
the prevention of GBS disease in infants were published in 2002:
CDC: Prevention of Perinatal Group B Streptococcal Disease: Revised
Guidelines from CDC. Morbid Mortal Week Rep MMWR 2002; 51(RR11);1-22.
At that time, the recommendation for universal prenatal screening of
pregnant women late in pregnancy was made, which has not been the
case in Norway. It would seem that the absence of universal screening
might increase the number of cases but not the case fatality rate.
This is a summary of the pertinent recommendations:
1. Recommendation of universal prenatal culture-based screening for
vaginal and rectal GBS colonization of all pregnant women at 35-37
weeks' gestation.
2. Recommendation against routine intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis
for GBS-colonized women undergoing planned cesarean deliveries who
have not begun labor or had rupture of membranes.
3. Penicillin remains the 1st line agent for intrapartum antibiotic
prophylaxis, with ampicillin an acceptable alternative. For
penicillin-allergic women at high risk for anaphylaxis, testing of
GBS isolates from prenatal screening for susceptibility to
clindamycin and erythromycin is recommended, if feasible. One of
these agents should be employed for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis if
the screening isolate is susceptible to both agents. Vancomycin
should be reserved for penicillin-allergic women at high risk for
beta-lactam anaphylaxis when clindamycin or erythromycin are not
options because of in vitro resistance or unknown susceptibility of a
prenatal isolate.
4. Women whose culture results are unknown at the time of delivery
should be managed according to the risk-based approach; the obstetric
risk factors remain unchanged (i.e., delivery at <37 weeks'
gestation, duration of membrane rupture >18 hours, or
temperature >100.4 F [>38.0 C]).
5. Women with negative vaginal and rectal GBS screening cultures
within 5 weeks of delivery do not require intrapartum antimicrobial
prophylaxis for GBS even if obstetric risk factors develop (i.e.,
delivery at <37 weeks' gestation, duration of membrane rupture >18
hours, or temperature >100.4 F [>38.0 C]).
6. Women with GBS bacteriuria in any concentration during their
current pregnancy or who previously gave birth to an infant with GBS
disease should receive intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis.
7. In the absence of GBS urinary tract infection, antimicrobial
agents should not be used before the intrapartum period to treat
asymptomatic GBS colonization. - Mod.LL]
