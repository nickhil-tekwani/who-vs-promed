Re: [Penicillin is effective against cutaneous but not against
inhalation anthrax. - Mod.JW
How do you account for this statement? As far as I know, no strains
resistant to penicillin have been found in the cases discussed. In
their recommendations, the Working Group on Civilian Biodefence (USA)
clearly states penicillin as the optimal therapy for patients with
clinically evident inhalational anthrax infection.

[I wondered, in that case, why there is a run on Cipro in the USA, and
penicillin is barely mentioned there? The answer appears below. -

Penicillin is THE drug of choice against susceptible strains of
anthrax.
It is true that penicillin can often cure cutaneous anthrax, but by
the time a case of inhalation anthrax has become symptomatic,
penicillin is often not enough to save the patient. However, all
antibiotics will often fail at this point because the lethal factors
are toxins, not live bacteria.
For prophylaxis against inhalation disease -- which seems to be the
indication at Aga Khan [University & Hospital, Pakistan -- penicillin
is likely to be effective, and may even be more effective than
ciprofloxacin. It is certainly a rational choice. More reliable blood
levels will be achieved with amoxicillin, so that is preferred when
available.
The promotion of Cipro in the current outbreak of snail-mail anthrax
is due to our concern that anyone sophisticated enough to weaponize
anthrax spores is also sophisticated enough to make them penicillin
resistant. So far, though, the terrorists have not done that. There
may also be a lower overall rate of hypersensitivity with Cipro than
with penicillin, and Cipro is taken only 2x/day so that compliance is
easier. Lacking supplies of Cipro (which is very expensive), the use
of penicillin at Aga Khan is rational and appropriate.
All in all, a small point in an otherwise excellent ProMED-mail
service!

[Re: Anthrax, human - USA: antimicrobial susceptibility [ProMED:
>The likelihood of a beta-lactamase induction event that would
increase penicillin MICs is significantly higher in infections where
high concentrations of organisms are present. Thus, treatment of known
_B. anthracis_ infections with a penicillin-type drug alone (i.e.,
penicillin G, ampicillin, etc.) in the setting where high
concentrations of organisms are present is a concern.
>The likelihood of a beta-lactamase induction event that would
increase penicillin MICs is lower when only small numbers of
vegetative cells are present, such as during postexposure prophylaxis.
Thus, amoxicillin or penicillin VK may be an option for post-exposure
prophylaxis where ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated.
>Additional studies are in progress to assess the susceptibility of
the penicillinase activity observed in these strains to beta-lactamase
inhibitors.
>Clinical experience is limited, but combination therapy with 2 or
more antimicrobials may be appropriate in patients with severe
infection.

I sent my previous message before reading this. The only thing I would
add is that the emergence of _B. anthracis_ resistance to penicillin
on therapy via beta-lactamase production is (like so much of our
knowledge on this subject) a theoretical concern. However, the same
concern exists for Cipro, and now there will be greatly increased
selective pressure for Cipro resistance.
As for the comment about combination therapy, there is well-known
laboratory antagonism between quinolones (like cipro) and beta-lactams
(like penicillin). This may or may not be clinically relevant.
