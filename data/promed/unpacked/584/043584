Cow dies from anthrax on Victoria property
------------------------------------------
A property in Victoria's north-east has been quarantined after the
death of a cow from anthrax. The Department of Primary Industries says
the cow died on a farm in the Tatura-Stanhope area on Monday afternoon
[31 Aug 2009] and the carcass was destroyed.

The property was previously affected by anthrax and cattle on the farm
have been vaccinated. The DPI's acting senior vet, Dr John Ryan, says
it is an isolated case and they are confident the disease will be
contained. "The herd is being kept under surveillance and the owner
kept in contact with regularly," he said.

"All neighbouring properties are being vaccinated and we've developed
a ring block coverage around the infected property to give some
assurance we're containing it there."
