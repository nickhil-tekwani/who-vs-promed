More background information on leishmaniasis in Afghanistan
--------------------------------------------
I have a comment on Dan Michaeli's background information on cutaneous
leishmaniasis in Afghanistan. Although he is correct in pointing out that
the current leishmaniasis epidemic in Afghanistan is mostly due to
_Leishmania tropica_, the vector is not _Phlebotomus papatasi_ but
_Phlebotomus sergenti_. Also the transmission cycle of _Leishmania tropica_
is thought to be anthroponotic (i.e. humans are reservoir hosts) and not
zoonotic - although this needs to be confirmed by epidemiological studies
looking at candidate reservoir hosts (e.g. rodents). _Phlebotomus papatasi_
is the vector of _Leishmania major_, the etiological agent of zoonotic
cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is common in the Northern provinces of
Afghanistan.
The current epidemic in Kabul is not 'new', but started about 10-15 years
ago and is due to the political instability and lack of health
infrastructure. Also, because of (i) the mass-migration of
_L.tropica_-infected
Afghan refugees; (ii) the sporadic treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis
cases by the Ministry of Public Health, WHO and NGOs; and (iii) the absence
of vector control strategies, _L. tropica_ has now spread to areas that
previously were non-endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis (e.g., the
northwest frontier province of Pakistan).

[We thank Richard Reithinger very much for his comment, which places the
observed increase in the number of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis into
proper perspective. Â­- Mod.EP]
