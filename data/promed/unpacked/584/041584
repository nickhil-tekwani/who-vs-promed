In response to moderator JW, there has been at least one report of risk
reduction with the use of azithromycin to treat patients with previous MI
who had positive serologies for C. pneumoniae, in comparison to similar
patients receiving placebo. Note that this trial included a small number of
patients, and thus there was a wide variability in the confidence intervals
for relative risks (but the differences were statistically significant). I
don't yet know of data from the much larger, ongoing trials.

Re:
>[Does anyone have any hard data? - Mod.JW
In reply to a request for hard data on the subject of anti-chlamydial
antimicrobials on cardiovascular disease, there was a paper published by
Gurfinkel et al in the Lancet 1997; 350: 404-07 on a "Randomised trial of
roxithromycin in non-Q-wave coronary syndromes: ROXIS pilot study".
Basically they found that in a group of 202 patients with unstable angina or
non-Q wave myocardial infarction, those (n=102) randomised to receive
roxithromycin had a significantly reduced rate of severe recurrent
ischaemia, myocardial infarction or death (analysed collectively).
One further analysis I would have liked to have seen in this study was a
demonstration that the benefit was confined to the subset of patients who
were seropositive to _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ at enrollment. Although the
serology was done, the data is not analysed in this manner.
This is preliminary data, and no doubt larger, more definitive studies are
under way.
