A review of outbreaks of salmonellosis in restaurants in Minnesota found
that positive food workers were often found in outbreaks with positive
environmental samples (1). Infected food workers frequently serve as a
reservoir for contamination and contribute to recontamination of the
environment and continued transmission of _Salmonella_ to patrons, even
after a specific nidus, such as the contaminated meat slicer, is dealt with.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Medus for her remarks. The abstract of her
publication is as follows:
"The 23 restaurant-associated salmonellosis outbreaks that occurred in
Minnesota from 1995 through 2003 were reviewed to characterize the role of
infected food workers. The median duration of the outbreaks was 21 days
(range, one to 517 days). The median number of culture-confirmed patron
cases per outbreak was 7 (range, one to 36 cases). The median incubation
for patron cases ranged from 9 hours to 5.9 days. A specific food vehicle
was implicated in 4 outbreaks and suspected in 5.
"Salmonella of the same serotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
subtype as that found in patrons was recovered from food workers in 19
outbreaks. Overall, 12 per cent (129 of 1033) of food workers tested
positive for _Salmonella_. 64 (53 per cent) of 121 _Salmonella_-positive
food workers reported not having had a recent gastrointestinal illness.
Overall, the median duration of _Salmonella_ shedding was 16 days. Among
food workers who reported gastrointestinal illness, the median shedding
duration was 30 days, as compared with 3 days for asymptomatic food workers.
"Positive environmental samples were recovered in 4 (33 per cent) of 12
outbreaks. No specific food vehicle was identified in any outbreaks
associated with _Salmonella_-positive environmental samples. The median
duration of outbreaks with positive environmental samples (187 days) was
significantly longer than the median duration of outbreaks with negative
environmental results (26 days, P = 0.03). A higher proportion of
_Salmonella_-positive food workers (22 versus 8 per cent) was identified in
outbreaks with positive environmental samples.
"_Salmonella_ outbreaks in restaurants are frequently prolonged yet produce
a small number of confirmed patron cases. Prolonged outbreak durations
suggest a persistent reservoir of contamination. Infected food workers
likely serve as an important source for transmission. Therefore, assessment
of food worker infection is essential for controlling restaurant
outbreaks." - Mod.LL]
