Mexico - equine encephalomyelitis (eastern)
-------------------------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 24 Oct 2022
Confirmed: 18 Nov 2022
Reported: 22 Nov 2022
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Last occurrence: 29 Dec 1996
Causal agent: eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Aldama, Tamaulipas
Started: 24 Oct 2022
Epidemiological unit: backyard
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 9 / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Several working horses located in an ejido showed signs of neuropathy and were reported to the veterinary authority.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): vectors
Epidemiological comments: Following the report of equine neuropathy in an "ejido" (communal farming land) in the municipality of Aldama, it was informed that 3 working equines had recently died, and veterinarians from the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot and Mouth Disease and other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA) of Senasica went to take samples for the corresponding analysis at the National Reference Center for Exotic Animal Diseases of the DGSA. The presence of the disease has been confirmed by viral isolation. The finding has been reported to the secretary of health, and the population has been advised to take measures to control mosquitoes indoors and outdoors, use insect repellent, and wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. It should be clarified that in Mexico the vector _Culiseta melanura_ is not present, and it maintains the transmission cycle in the United States in the eastern states or the Gulf Coast and that approximately every 20-25 years in cyclical form is introduced to Mexico by viremic migratory birds. The last epizootic of this infectious agent in Mexico occurred in Tamaulipas in 1996.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied in domestic animals: control of vectors, quarantine

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name / Species / Test / Test date / Result

["Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses are mosquitoborne pathogens that can cause nonspecific illnesses and encephalitis in equids (horses, mules, burros, donkeys and zebras) and humans in the Americas. Some of these viruses also affect birds and occasionally other mammals. No specific treatment is available, and depending on the virus, host and form of the disease, the case fatality rate may be as high as 90%. Epidemic VEE viruses are also potential bioterrorist weapons.

"Eastern, western and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis result from infection by the respectively named viruses in the genus _Alphavirus_, family Togaviridae. In the human literature, the disease is usually called eastern, western or Venezuelan equine encephalitis.

"Until recently, eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus (EEEV) contained 4 genetic lineages. Lineage I was considered to be the North American variant of EEEV, while lineages II, III and IV were the South American variants. The latter 3 lineages have now become a new viral species, Madariaga virus. Unless otherwise specified, 'EEEV' in this factsheet refers to all viruses formerly classified under this name, rather than lineage I viruses alone. The North American EEEV seems to be more virulent than Madariaga virus in people, and under some conditions, it is also more pathogenic in experimentally infected nonhuman primates (e.g., marmosets), sparrows and rodents. Comparative studies in horses have not been published, but severe illness has been reported in this species in both North and South America....

"Human illnesses have been reported after infection with EEEV, Madariaga virus, WEEV, epidemic VEE viruses and most enzootic VEE viruses. EEEV in North America is generally thought to be more virulent for humans than Madariaga virus in South America; however, both viruses can cause severe illness. Highlands J virus and Fort Morgan virus do not appear to affect people. Humans infected with epidemic strains of VEEV can develop viremia sufficient to infect mosquitoes, but are not thought to be important in the epidemiology of this disease. People do not appear to transmit EEEV or WEEV to mosquitoes" (Source: Spickler AR.
