Two employees of a dairy farm in Rodionovo-Nesevetayskom district of Rostov region were hospitalized with a diagnosis of anthrax. The regional station for animal disease control reported that the victims were infected (with _Bacillus anthracis_) while butchering carcasses.

Farm workers turned to a local hospital complaining of sores that appeared on their hands. The victims said they were engaged in butchering cow carcasses at a summer camp in the village of Kuteynikova Rodionovo-Nesvetaiskaya district.

Veterinarians who visiting the scene found the skin of a cow. Investigation of samples taken showed that the animal was infected with anthrax.

The affected farm workers were hospitalized, and their lives are out of danger, it is reported today [1 Sep 2014] on the official website of the Rostov regional station to combat animal diseases. The date of the incident in the department was not specified.

To prevent the spread of infection, the hide was burned and the slaughter area disinfected. All 717 animals on the farm were examined by veterinarians and received the vaccine. Now, experts are vaccinating the cattle in the village of Kuteynikova, according to a statement.

"The situation regarding anthrax remains tense because of the presence of a soil foci of infection. Prevention is mainly through the use of vaccines," the head of the veterinary department of the Rostov Region, Sergey Kartashov, was quoted as saying by the official website of the department today [1 Sep 2014].

In the Rostov region, there are 794 infection loci and 1659 animal cases of anthrax officially registered. A previous case was registered in 2010 in the village of Hlebodarnoe, Tselinsky district.

[The Rostov Region is in the south of Russia at the mouth of the river Don: see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/61/. For Rodionovo-Nesvetayskaya, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/61/RodionovoNesvetayskaya.html.

Interestingly, this official-source report says nothing about the meat taken from the affected carcass and where it might have been distributed and sold. The 2 men said that they had been butchering "carcasses" on a dairy farm, which suggests that a number of cows had died and been butchered. That this dairy farm had "717" head, species not defined, might lead one to think it was a modern, high density dairy production with hundreds of penned animals being fed forage and feed. If this is so, it would explain why other livestock in the village are being vaccinated because of the risk of a contaminated feed source. On the other hand, as they quote soil foci, it might be just a dairy farm with many sheep.

Either way, I suspect that we have not heard the end of this. - Mod.MHJ
