The 1st official report of Asian soybean rust in Mexico reveals that the
disease was found at low incidence on soybeans in 2 east-central states in
late October 2005.
The report, "Detection of soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) in the states
of Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosi, Mexico," was posted yesterday on the North
American Plant Protection Organization's Phytosanitary Alert System Web site,
<http://www.pestalert.org>
As translated into English this afternoon on the site, the report read:
"Date posted: 16 Feb 2006
Contact: Dr. Jorge Hernandez Baeza. Director General, Plant Health. SAGARPA-
SENASICA <jbaeza@senasica.sagarpa.gob.mx>
At the end of October 2005, soybean leaves of the variety 'Huasteca 400' were
collected at harvest. The leaves had symptoms and signs of low-incidence
soybean rust in Tamuin, State of San Luis Potosi, and in Altamira, State of
Tamaulipas, both municipalities within the region called 'huasteca.'
Samples collected were processed at the molecular mycology and biology
laboratory of the National Phytosanitary Reference Centre, with positive
results for soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_).
The National Service for Agri-Food Health, Safety and Quality, through the
Plant Health Directorate, has applied a plan to decrease damage and risk of
spreading the soybean rust, through outreach activities aimed at monitoring,
identifying and controlling the disease."
Tamaulipas is the northern-most Mexican state that borders the Gulf of Mexico,
and San Luis Potosi borders Tamaulipas to the west.
In e-mail correspondence today among U.S. soybean rust specialists, University
of Kentucky plant pathologist Don Hershman said it's still unknown whether
soybean rust has overwintered and is still present in Mexico.
"Soybeans in that part of Mexico are harvested in November, and it is my
understanding that kudzu is not very common there," Hershman said. "It is best
to take a wait-and-see approach as efforts are made to get a better handle on
what the SBR situation is in Mexico at this time."

[This is the first report of soybean rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) in
Mexico. The pathogen was found on soybean (_Glycine max_) leaves at the end
of October 2005 in Tamuin, State of San Luis Potosi, and in Altamira, State of
Tamaulipas. In contrast to the USA, kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), an alternative
host for the pathogen, is not common there.
The Asian soybean rust has been known to drastically reduce yields in Asia. In
areas where the pathogen occurs commonly, yield losses up to 80 percent have
been reported. The pathogen had been limited to the Eastern hemisphere until
it was found in Hawaii in 1994. Currently, the distribution of _P. pachyrhizi_
includes Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, and the continental USA
(since November, 2004), and Hawaii. The rapid spread of _P. pachyrhizi_ and
potential for severe yield losses makes this the most destructive foliar
disease of soybean. The items in "see also" below are for non-USA reports of
soybean rust.
