From: Bruce Akey <BAkey@vdacs.state.va.us>

During the course of my involvement with attempts to develop a National
Animal Health Reporting System (NAHRS) in the US, a joint effort of the
U.S. Animal Health Association, the American Association of Veterinary
Laboratory Diagnosticians, animal industry and the USDA, I have picked up a
slightly different perspective on the view that the problem is government
officials that won't tell the whole truth or are trying to "cover up"
something. What I found instead were government officials that fully
embraced the tenets of the GATT and NAFTA agreements which require
transparent and scientifically-based animal disease reporting and who fully
supported the development of such a system (NAHRS). This is
counterbalanced by the justifiable concerns of the various animal industry
commodity groups that trading partners and competitors who are not so
committed to the principals of transparency will use the information
reported on animal disease occurrence in the US as non-tariff trade
barriers to prevent American agriculture from overwhelming their indigenous
animal industries. However, it appears that, as the commodity groups learn
more about the functioning of international trade under the World Trade
Organization (created to administer the GATT agreement), they are slowly
coming around to the realization that in this age of rapid information
dissemination (ProMED-mail being an excellent example), they are better off
having the information presented openly through official government
channels than having it leaked out in the popular press or in scientific
journals. They also are realizing that the collection of
scientifically-based data provides them leverage at the bargaining table,
both to question the claims of those who would raise trade barriers and to
support their own claims of disease-free status or requests for
regionalization of disease status. I for one am very optimistic that the
movement towards open and honest reporting of animal diseases unleashed by
the GATT and NAFTA agreements will gather momentum with trading partners
(e.g. the U. S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and etc..) and
eventually become the international standard upon which international trade
operates. However, it will be the industries themselves, not the
governments who represent them, that will determine whether or not this
comes to pass.

[Thanks for this insight and considered message. As I commented in a
previous message, non-reporting of diseases, human and otherwise, has a
complex etiology. I am a "bottom line" sort of guy and the bottom line
here is that not all diseases are being reported to the right places and in
a timely fashion. The rest of this is details, albeit critical details.
Non-reporting certainly cannot be the fault of W.H.O. or any other
international organization if that organization does not receive reports.
It is not the fault of someone who does not know that there is an
international understanding that the occurrence of a particular disease is
to be reported. It is not the fault of the terminally ignorant, or of
those who are directed to not report an outbreak, or of those who do not
understand the intricacies of national and international laws. Is it the
fault of those who calculatingly and cold-bloodedly make a conscious
decision to not tell the truth because there might be (will be)
repercussions? Of course it is. I know for a fact that not all reportable
disease occurrences are reported, with the given excuse that "it is our
problem and we are taking care of it". I do not have a solution to this
quandary, but I am fairly certain it is a huge problem and I am absolutely
certain that non reporting is illegal and, in my opinion, immoral. I am
not nearly as concerned about the faults of the well-meaning as I am with
those who have not moved forward with the rest of the world. For the time
being, I am willing to take the optimistic view of Dr. Akey and hope for
the best. Still, hope and action are entirely different approaches. -
