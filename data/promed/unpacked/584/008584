The patient came from Africa by Portuguese airways (TAP Air Portugal) flight
TP3149 from Abidjan, 6 Jan 2000, in transit through Lisbon airport.
Portuguese Health Authorities are calling all the 74 passengers of this
flight to be alert to symptoms of flu-like illness and immediately seek
medical assistance. But the influenza A crisis in Europe is a much more
probable cause of any symptoms in these travellers.
This event should be an alert to Portuguese Health Authorities to put in
place a strategic plan to deal with cases of probable hemorrhagic fevers.
Portuguese Hospitals are not prepared to safely treat these patients.

German student with Lassa fever critical, fellow-travellers come forward
--------------------------------------------------
A 23-year-old German woman was in critical state Thursday with Lassa fever
after a trip to West Africa, and 50 fellow-travellers have come forward to
contact the authorities.
The student, who returned to Germany on 7 Jan 2000 after visits to Ghana
and
Ivory Coast, fell ill 2 days later.
Fifty people who were in contact with the young woman while she was
travelling have come forward since a call from authorities in the region of
Wuerzburg in southern Germany, where she is hospitalized. They had flown
with her on January 7 on Air Portugal flight TP 5576 from Lisbon to
Frankfurt.
The young woman had also flown from Abidjan to Lisbon on January 6 on Air
Portugal flight TP 3149.
Doctor Karl Fleischer, chief of the tropical medicine department of the
Wuerzburg hospital where she is being treated, said she was unable to speak
and was being given artificial respiration. The disease usually culminates
in a crisis after nine or 10 days, Fleischer said. That stage had now been
reached and the prognosis would be resolved in the next day or two.
Lassa fever is a virus disease that is characterized by a high fever,
headaches, mouth ulcers, muscle aches, small hemorrhages under the skin,
heart and kidney failure and a 40% mortality rate.
