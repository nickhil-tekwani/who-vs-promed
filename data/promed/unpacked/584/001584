International groups invited over Ebola threat
----------------------------------------------
The Department of Agriculture (DA) has invited international health
organizations to conduct a risk assessment of the Ebola-Reston virus
recently discovered in the country. Agriculture secretary Arthur C Yap said
the assessment would determine the extent of the risk or threat of the
virus to animal and human health in the Philippines.

Last week [week of 8 Dec 2008], the DA and Department of Health announced
that 4 hog farms in Luzon had been infected with a low pathogenic strain of
the Ebola-Reston virus. This was the 1st case of Ebola in swine in the
country, and agriculture and health officials assured the public that it
was not a human health issue but an animal health problem. The officials
declared local pork safe for human consumption.

"While we are currently carrying out a similar effort, we are opening our
door to scrutiny by independent globally recognized health organizations to
show that the Philippines is a responsible member of the international
community," said Yap. He said the move was in line with the government
policy of transparency and the effort to engage global authorities in
containing the infection, which has so far been detected in only a few hogs
in certain parts of Luzon.

Davinio Catbagan, director of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), said the
risk assessment could be conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO),
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), or the Paris-based Office
International des Epizooties (World Animal Health Organization; OIE).

Recently, the DA announced a support program to assist the hog producers
whose livestock were found to have the Ebola-Reston virus. The DA said the
government would also provide incentives to unaffected hog growers to
encourage them to participate in the government program to stamp out the
disease. The DA will field quick-response government teams led by the BAI
to help the growers whose infected hogs will be culled or destroyed. Yap
said the government would provide quarantined farms with feeds and
replacement stocks once the farms had been cleared. Under the support
program, the DA will acquire additional laboratory kits to check the
presence of the virus in swine.

The Ebola-Reston strain is different from the 3 other Ebola subtypes, which
are all potentially fatal to humans. Unlike the Zaire, Ivory Coast, and
Sudan strains, the Reston strain has not caused illness in humans who come
in contact with infected animals. This particular strain was discovered in
the Philippines in 1989 among crab-eating monkeys being exported by the
Laguna-based Ferlite Farms to the Hazleton Laboratories in Reston,
Virginia, USA.

re: ProMED-mail Ebola-Reston, porcine - Philippines (02) 20081212.3910
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I wondered why Plum Island had tested pig samples for Ebola-Reston and
wondered if they found the results accidentally.

Normally, would pig samples be tested for Ebola if they were to be used in
vaccine research for PRRS [porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome]?
Perhaps, someone thought the blood samples had come from PRRS, that is,
Primate Resource Referral Service and tested for primate diseases thereby
finding Ebola-Reston in the 6 samples.

I would like to know why the pig samples were tested for a primate disease.
Is it also possible that the Ebola positive result was caused in the lab,
that is, Ebola-Reston in previous sample might have compromised the results
of the pig sample?

I would be very interested in opinions on this subject. It is a very
perplexing case.

[Responses to Dr Doyle's query will be welcomed. It will be also
interesting to note if similar tests, in Plum Island or elsewhere, have
been carried-out in samples of PRRS-suspected porcines in/from other
countries, such as China and Viet Nam. In case affirmative, results would
be appreciated.

Subscribers may wish to visit the webpage of OIE's Working Group (WG) on
Wildlife Diseases at <http://www.oie.int/wildlife/eng/en_wildlife.htm>.
Founded in 1994, the WG informs and advises the OIE on all health problems
relating to wild animals, whether in the wild or in captivity. It has
prepared recommendations and oversees numerous scientific publications on
the surveillance and control of the most important specific wildlife
diseases; member-countries are encouraged to appoint national wildlife
focal points. The WG comprises world-leading scientific experts in their
subject areas, and meets.

In 2006, the WG published a list of diseases in mammals, birds, reptiles,
and amphibians to be covered by the recommended surveillance. The list
comprises 2 sections: the 1st section includes 44 of "OIE listed diseases"
(officially notifiable diseases of domestic animals), which may involve
wildlife as well. The 2nd sector includes "wildlife listed diseases",
namely diseases which are regarded as specifically affecting wildlife, of
which there are 24 in mammals, 8 in birds, 4 in reptiles, and 2 in
amphibians. Outbreaks of such diseases, though not listed as notifiable,
are expected to be reported by means of questionnaires distributed annually
to the member countries. Ebola is included among the mammal diseases of
this 2nd-sector list, which can be downloaded at the webpage above.

See also OIE's DG editorial of October 2008 "Improving wildlife
surveillance for its protection while protecting us from the diseases it
transmits," at <http://www.oie.int:80/eng/edito/en_edito_juil08.htm>.

In order to evaluate the realistic animal- and public-health implications
of the recent findings in the 4 Luzon pig farms, a detailed scientific
report by the investigating laboratory, including results of the agent's
genotyping, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
