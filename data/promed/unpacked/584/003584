[1] WHO update 27 Jan 2015
Date: 27 Jan 2015
Source: WHO Latest available situation summary [as of 25 Jan 2015, edited]
http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en [Note: WHO retains this link from day to day, so if you click on this link after 27 Jan 2015, you will see a list of situation summaries including the one below. - Mod.JW]


Total cumulative cases: 22 057 [13 675 confirmed]

Total cumulative deaths: 8795 [confirmed deaths not available from Liberia]

[368 more cases and 179 more deaths in the week since the update as of 18 Jan 2015 (posted by WHO on 20 Jan 2015). These are both less than the week before. But the following footnotes have been dropped this year [2015]:

"- Data are based on official information reported by ministries of health, through WHO country offices. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.
"- Not reported due to the high proportion of probable and suspected cases that are reclassified" (indicated by the red superscript letter "i" last year). - Mod.JW]

On a separate web page http://apps.who.int/ebola, WHO has 3 graphs which appear to show that the epidemic is practically over in all 3 countries as measured by country patient databases and situation reports, and says:

Guinea reported its lowest weekly total of new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases since the week ending 17 Aug 2014. Case numbers remain low in Liberia, with no confirmed cases nationally for the final 2 days of the week ending 11 Jan 2015, and the lowest weekly total of confirmed cases since the 1st week of June 2014. Sierra Leone has now reported a decline in case incidence for the 2nd week running and recorded its lowest weekly total of new confirmed cases since the week ending 31 Aug 2014. [But note the footnotes referred to above. - Mod.JW]

[2] WHO: Chief unveils reforms after Ebola response criticized
Date: Sun 25 Jan, 2015

The head of the UN's global health agency has laid out a set of reforms to better and more quickly fight disease outbreaks in a frank acknowledgement that the organization struggled to confront the scale of the 2014 Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 8600 people.

"This was West Africa's 1st experience with the Ebola virus, and it delivered some horrific shocks and surprises," said World Health Organization (WHO) director General Margaret Chan in a speech on Sun 25 Jan 2014. "The world, including WHO, was too slow to see what was unfolding before us."

The needed changes, she said, include country-specific emergency workforces trained with "military precision," a strengthened team of epidemiologists for detecting disease, and a network of other providers to allow responders to reach "surge capacity. The Ebola outbreak revealed some inadequacies and shortcomings in this organization's administrative, managerial, and technical infrastructures," she said, calling for a "dedicated contingency fund to support rapid responses to outbreaks and emergencies."

The remarks came as the WHO's executive board prepared to meet in Geneva to discuss reform proposals that many in the international community consider to be overdue. The response to Ebola by the UN's health agency was seen by many as slow and ineffectual.

[3] Is Ebola immunizing West Africans without symptoms?
Date: 27 Jan 2015
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/27/us-health-ebola-asymptomatic-idUSKBN0L00R220150127


A recent sharp drop in new Ebola infections in West Africa is prompting scientists to wonder whether the virus may be silently immunizing some people at the same time as brutally killing their neighbors. So-called "asymptomatic" Ebola cases -- in which someone is exposed to the virus, develops antibodies, but doesn't get sick or suffer symptoms -- are hotly disputed among scientists, with some saying their existence is little more than a pipe dream.

Yet if, as some studies suggest, such cases do occur in epidemics of the deadly disease, they may be a key factor in ending outbreaks more swiftly by giving secret protection to those lucky enough to be able to bat the infection away...

With the largest Ebola epidemic on record raging through 3 of Africa's most under-resourced countries, scientists and medics have, understandably, focused all efforts on the sick and dying and not on testing people with no symptoms. If they do, however, and if they were to find what Steve Bellan of the University of Texas and some others suspect, it could prompt a reappraisal of what jolted a relatively sudden downturn in new cases... - more

[4] Guinea: Ebola numbers may be higher than reported
Date: Tue 27 Jan 2015
Source: VOA [edited]
http://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-irc-trust-cases-findings-lessons-government-radio-epidemic-who/2615225.html


Emmanuel d'Harcourt, the senior health director for the International Rescue Committee, warned that the story behind declining numbers of new Ebola cases is different for Guinea, for Sierra Leone and for Liberia. "Our information and our interpretation of the numbers, based both on field realities and what we hear from other sources, is that the declines are definitely real in Liberia. They're probably real in Sierra Leone, and they're very uncertain as to their meaning in Guinea," d'Harcourt said.

He attributed the reduction of new Ebola cases in Liberia to communities growing to understand the disease and how it was spreading and then taking preventative actions. "And we see that at every level, at the level of the government, but also at the level of local administration and even at the level of villages. We think that a similar dynamic is occurring in Sierra Leone," said the senior health director.

"In Guinea," d'Harcourt explained, "people still do not trust the government nor do they trust the international organizations, and because of this, there is less confidence in the numbers before we can believe there is actually a reduction of new Ebola cases."

D'Harcourt emphasized that one of the biggest lessons learned from the world's largest outbreak of the Ebola virus is that you cannot separate politics and public health. "It's very important for public health professionals to understand that issues such as trust in the system, trust in the government, trust in the public health services, are a vital element of our work."

D'Harcourt added that "by just focusing on technical fixes, for example, we also need to do more training so people can do more surveillance; a key element is missing, and that is: Do people believe what they are being told on the radio or by government officials? We really need to work on that, and, obviously, we can't work on it just when there's an epidemic. We have to be able to view that as part of our work and part of the thing that we are measuring, which is how much trust there is in the system, and then we have to go do things to strengthen that trust in the system," d'Harcourt said.
