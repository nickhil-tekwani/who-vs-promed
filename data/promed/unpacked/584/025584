Three quarantines for strangles have been reported in different counties in Florida after horses tested positive for the bacterial infection.

According to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the following counties are experiencing quarantines:

On 20 Dec 2018, one premises in Marion County was placed under quarantine after one horse presented with clinical signs of strangles with a positive PCR test result. Six of the 93 quarantined horses on the property are currently clinical for strangles.

On 20 Dec 2018, one premises in Pinellas County was placed under quarantine after one horse presented with clinical signs of strangles with a positive culture test result. Two of the 28 quarantined horses on the property are currently clinical for strangles.

On 19 Dec 2018, one premises in Palm Beach County was placed under quarantine after one horse presented with clinical signs of strangles with a positive PCR test result. One of the 29 quarantined horses on the property is currently clinical for strangles.

The highly contagious upper respiratory disease of equids, known as strangles, is caused by the gram-positive B-hemolytic bacterium _Streptococcus equi_ ssp. _equi_.

The organism, _Streptococcus equi_ ssp._ equi_, can be transmitted via direct contact with nasal or ocular secretions or lymph node discharge from infected horses or via indirect exposure to contaminated trailers, stalls, riding equipment, buckets, halters, lead ropes, brushes, clothing, etc.

The incubation period typically ranges between 2 and 6 days but may last up to 14 days.

Classic signs may include fever (103 F [39.4 C] or higher), mucopurulent nasal discharge, lymphadenopathy (with or without abscessation), general malaise, pharyngitis, dysphagia, upper airway stridor and respiratory distress.

Clinical signs are often age-related, with older horses exhibiting milder signs of shorter duration.

["_Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (_S. equi_ var. _equi_) is the bacterium which causes the highly contagious disease strangles (also known as "distemper"). Strangles commonly affects young horses (weanlings and yearlings), but horses of any age can be infected. Vaccination against _S. equi_ is recommended on premises where strangles is a persistent endemic problem or for horses that are expected to be at high risk of exposure. Following natural infection, a carrier state of variable duration may develop, and intermittent shedding may occur. The influence of vaccination on intermittent shedding of _S. equi_ has not been adequately studied.

Vaccination in the face of an outbreak should be carefully considered, as there is significantly increased risk of adverse reactions in exposed horses. Purpura hemmorrhagica can be associated with vaccine administration. In a recent retrospective study of 53 horses with purpura hemorrhagica, 5 cases were vaccinated with a _S. equi_ M protein vaccine. Outbreak mitigation and the prevention of spread of _S. equi_ infection are centered on management of horses, personnel, and facilities.

(View AAEP Infectious Disease Control Guidelines _S. equi_; view ACVIM (American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine _Strep equi_ consensus statement).

Killed vaccines:
Killed vaccines are an adjunct to the prevention of strangles. Vaccination with these products should not be expected to prevent disease. However, appropriate pre-exposure vaccination with these products appears to attenuate the severity of clinical signs in affected horses, should disease occur, and has been shown to reduce the incidence of disease by as much as 50% during outbreaks.

All injectable, inactivated _S. equi_ vaccines, can be associated with an increased rate of injection site reactions as compared to other equine vaccines. Due to the limited variability between commercially available vaccinal bacteria and field isolates, autogenous bacterins are not advocated.

Modified live vaccine:
An intranasal product has been shown to stimulate a high level of immunity against experimental challenge. The inductive sites are the pharyngeal and lingual tonsils. Vaccinal organisms must reach these sites in sufficient numbers to trigger protective responses; therefore, accurate vaccine delivery is critical to vaccine efficacy. In a small percentage of cases, residual vaccinal organism virulence may result in formation of slowly developing mandibular or retropharyngeal abscesses. The risk of vaccine-associated adverse events is increased when the product is administered to young foals.

Maternal antibody interference with respect to the development of mucosal immunity needs to be studied further.

In order to avoid inadvertent contamination of other vaccines, syringes and needles, it is advisable and considered a good practice to administer all parenteral vaccines or other injectables before the handling and administration of the intranasal vaccine against _S. equi_.

Vaccination Schedules:
Adult horses previously vaccinated: Vaccinate every 6 to 12 months based on risk assessment and manufacturers' recommendations.

Adult horses unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history:

Killed vaccine:
Manufacturers' recommendations are for primary vaccination with a series of 2 or 3 doses administered at intervals of 2 to 4 weeks, depending on the product used, followed by annual revaccination. Revaccinate at 6-month intervals, regardless of the injectable product used.

Modified live vaccine:
Administer intranasally a 2-dose primary series with a 3-week interval between doses. Semiannual (6-month intervals) or annual revaccination is recommended.

Broodmares previously vaccinated:

Killed vaccine:
Vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks pre-partum with approved products that contain inactivated M-protein. Maternal antibody interference is not known to occur when injectable, M-protein vaccines are administered.

Broodmares previously unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history:
Administer primary series of killed vaccine containing M-protein (see above, Adult horses unvaccinated) with final dose to be administered 4 to 6 weeks pre-partum.

Foals:

Killed vaccine:
For foals at high risk for exposure to strangles, administer a 3-dose primary series of an M-protein product beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. An interval of 4 to 6 weeks between doses is recommended.

Modified live vaccine:
Administer intranasally at 6 to 9 months of age a 2-dose primary series with a 3-week interval between doses. This vaccine has been safely administered to foals as young as 6 weeks of age when there is a high risk of infection, such as occurs during an outbreak, but the efficacy of its use in very young foals has not been adequately studied. If administered to young foals in this manner, a 3rd dose of the modified live vaccine should be administered 2 to 4 weeks before the foal is weaned to optimize protection during that time of high risk of infection. The risk of vaccine-associated adverse events is increased when the product is administered to young foals.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: Following recovery from strangles, most horses develop a durable immunity, persisting in over 75 percent of animals for 5 years or longer. This indicates that stimulation of a high level of immunity is biologically feasible given appropriate presentation of protective immunogens. Currently, a diagnostic test is available and may be used to assess the level of immunity conferred by natural exposure or vaccination. Since natural exposure or vaccination can provide variable levels of immunity, use of this test may provide a guideline in determining the need for current or future vaccination.
