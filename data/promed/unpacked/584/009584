USA (TX): Norovirus outbreak linked to oysters
----------------------------------------------
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating an
outbreak of norovirus-associated illness linked to eating raw oysters
harvested from San Antonio Bay, Texas. The FDA advises consumers to avoid
eating raw oysters harvested from this area after 1 Feb 2007, as a result
of reports of illnesses in people who attended a Maryland event where these
oysters were served. Symptoms of illness associated with norovirus include
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramping. Affected individuals
often experience low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a
general sense of tiredness. Most people show symptoms within 48 hours of
exposure to the virus. The illness typically lasts one to 2 days.
Consumers who ate oyster products served in restaurants after 1 Feb 2007
and experienced symptoms of norovirus are encouraged to contact their
health care provider and local health department. Consumers concerned about
oysters purchased during this period should contact their place of purchase
to determine if the oysters are from the affected lot of oysters.
To date, illnesses have been reported by 25 individuals who ate raw oysters
over the weekend of 9 to 11 Feb 2007 at a Bull & Oyster Event in Maryland.
The Maryland Department of Health & Mental Hygiene's test results from ill
patients are positive for norovirus.
The implicated oyster beds in the San Antonio Bay were closed by the Texas
Department of Health Services on 24 Feb 2007 and remain closed. Bayview
Seafood, a distributor in Seadrift, TX, issued a voluntary recall on 26 Feb
2007. Another distributor, Rose Bay Oyster Company of Swanquarter, NC,
issued a voluntary recall on 28 Feb 2007. The Rose Bay Oyster Company
mislabeled oysters subject to the recall, indicating Galveston Bay as the
harvest area; the implicated oysters were actually harvested from San
Antonio Bay. Oysters with tags that read: "Gal 1, 2/2/07" are subject to
the recall.
The FDA will continue working with health officials in Maryland to track
any additional cases of norovirus illness. The FDA will continue to provide
regular updates to the public as this investigation unfolds. Persons with
weakened immune systems, including those affected by AIDS, and persons with
chronic alcohol abuse, liver, stomach or blood disorders, cancer, diabetes
or kidney disease should avoid raw oyster consumption altogether,
regardless of where the oysters are harvested. Cooking destroys the virus,
eliminating the risk of illness for both healthy and immunocompromised
individuals. The FDA advises that it is always best to cook seafood
thoroughly to minimize the risk of foodborne illness. Consumers can
continue to enjoy oysters in many cooked preparations by following this advice:
1. at restaurants and other foodservice establishments: order oysters fully
cooked.
2. in the shell: purchase oysters with the shells closed. Throw away any
oysters with shells already opened.
3. to prepare oysters for eating, choose one of the following methods: boil
oysters until the shells open. Once open, boil for an additional 3-5 minutes.
4. steamer - add oysters to water that is already steaming and cook live
oysters until the shells open; once open steam for another 4-9 minutes.
5. use smaller pots to boil or steam oysters. Using larger pots, or cooking
too many oysters at one time, may cause uneven heat distribution, which may
cause the oysters in the middle to not get fully cooked.
6. discard any oysters that do not open during cooking.
7. shucked oysters: To prepare oysters for eating, choose one of the
following methods: boil or simmer shucked oysters for at least 3 minutes or
until the edges curl. Fry at 375 deg F (190 deg C) for at least 3 minutes.
Broil 3 inches from heat for 3 minutes. Bake at 450 deg F (230 deg C) for
10 minutes.

[Gastroenteritis associated with the consumption of raw oysters (and
similar filter-feeding shellfish) is a recurrent hazard that could be
eliminated totally by obligatory heat treatment of all such products prior
to their consumption. The recall of norovirus-contaminated products could
be avoided by instructions on their packaging emphasizing a requirement for
appropriate heat treatment (as outlined above) prior to consumption. - Mod.CP]
