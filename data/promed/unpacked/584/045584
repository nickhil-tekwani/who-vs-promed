Transmission of dermatophytes and tinea pedis in US airports
-----------------------------------------------
Having spent some time with mycotic infections, I am startled to see that
the Transportation Security Administration, who supposedly monitors
airports, "strongly" suggests that passengers remove their shoes while
passing through the lines in American airports. The penalty for not doing
so is an intimidating delay in which a total body scan for such contraband
as glasses frames and wrist watches is conducted, whereupon you still are
required to remove your shoes and to stand around on unkempt airport
carpets while your shoes are X-rayed! If you do as "suggested," you must
march 10 to 15 feet either barefoot or in stocking feet to a point where
one's shoes may be reclaimed. This is evidently because a demented
passenger attempted to ignite his shoes with either matches or a cigarette
lighter, already prohibited.
Unless I am terribly mistaken, one's flora are being mixed with that of
several hundreds of thousand of passengers who have passed through the same
lines. The floors are rarely cleaned (evidently) and never disinfected. Has
simple hygiene been forfeited in the US in the name of "security?" When the
TSA finally answered a query, they told me that OSHA had approved the cross
contamination of hundreds of thousands of feet. The CDC, NIH, WHO, or state
or local health departments were not consulted. National Security indeed.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Fox for alerting us to this previously unrecognized
danger stemming from the common security practice in US airports. Though a
disgusting and unaesthetic procedure, the people at highest risk must
obviously be airport security staff. Studies documenting increased risk of
dermatophytes and/or tinea pedis, and increased risk of respiratory tract
symptoms like asthma or allergic alveolitis, is clearly highly needed. -
