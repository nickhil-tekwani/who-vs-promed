Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) (see below) is running rampant this summer [2015].
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been a sharp rise in the number of patients infected with the viral disease, which causes a rash on infants' hands and feet and in their mouths, according to preliminary figures released by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) in early August [2015]. The NIID is calling for vigilance, as the epidemic is likely to continue until around September [2015].

Reports from about 3000 pediatric institutions across the country show there were an average of 10.26 HFMD patients per medical institution from 27 Jul to 2 Aug [2015]. This is the 2nd most in history, following the record of 10.98 patients per institution from 11-17 Jul 2011, according to the institute.

By prefecture, Miyazaki saw the highest number of HFMD patients per medical institution at 19.61, followed by 19.56 in Niigata, 18.73 in Miyagi and 18.67 in Yamagata. Most of the prefectures that had more patients than the national average were in the Kanto, Hokuriku and Tohoku regions, but Osaka Prefecture also had more at 11.26.

HFMD is caused by several types of viruses. The predominant virus this year [2015] is less likely to cause serious symptoms, but a virus that became more prevalent from July [2015] causes a rash in other areas as well as the hands and feet, according to the NIID.

Tsuguto Fujimoto, general manager of the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, urged everyone to take preventative measures against the disease until around autumn [2015]. "Wash your hands frequently with running water and soap," he said. "And don't touch any feces when you're changing diapers."

Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is an infectious disease caused by enteroviruses. The viruses are transmitted to humans through airborne droplets produced by coughing or sneezing and from feces through mucous membranes in the nose and mouth. There is no effective cure or vaccine. Most symptoms naturally subside in a few days, though meningitis and brain fever can result.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by different types of viruses called enteroviruses, and the most common ones are coxsackie virus types A16, A5, A9, A10, B1, and B3, human enterovirus 71 (HEV71), and herpes simplex viruses (HSV). The virus is spread from person to person through direct contact with nose and throat discharges, blister fluid, and faeces. Therefore, coughing and sneezing can spread the virus from the infected person to healthy persons. When the virus enters the body, it multiplies at the contact site such as in the throat, surrounding lymphatic nodes, stomach, and intestines. Then it gets into the blood and flows to other parts of the body such as mouth and the skin.

HFMD is a common worldwide disease that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old and is more widespread in summer and early spring. In tropical countries, it can be widespread in any season.

Symptoms of the disease start to show after an incubation period of 3 to 7 days and include low-grade fever, loss of appetite, stomachache, and pain in the mouth. Soon, blisters develop in the mouth and on the skin, commonly at the hands and feet, and sometimes at buttocks. The typical blisters are yellow with bright red borders. They usually appear in the mouth such as on the tongue, palate, velum, tonsils, or gums. Skin rashes also develop at the back of the hands and feet or the palms. They might or might not be itchy. These rashes start of as red rashes and quickly develop into raised red spots, some with blisters. Usually, the rashes will go away within a week.

There is no specific treatment for HFMD. The treatment available is just for symptom relief. Medication is prescribed according to the symptoms, such as fever, and oral anesthetic to help relieve the pain of mouth sores. It is very important to keep infected children hydrated. You can assess the hydration status by checking the pulse, skin elasticity, mouth and eye hydration, tears when they cry, and urination frequency.

According to the WHO (WPA): As of 2 Aug [2015], there were 216 971 cases of HFMD reported in Japan for 2015 since 12 Mar 2015 (week 11), [http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/hfmd-biweekly-20150811.pdf?ua=1].

Weekly case numbers of HFMD have surpassed the numbers seen in the previous year [2014]. For the period 27 Jul to 2 Aug 2015, there were 32 289 cases reported, a 9.4 percent increase compared with the previous week (n=29 504). The cumulative number of cases was as high as that of 2011 in the same reporting period (n=208 317). The most frequently identified viruses were Coxsackie virus A16 and A6. - Mod.CP
