As a follow-up to this initial posting, it is important to point out
the original source of the information. Alexander and colleagues in
the June 2002 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases report what is
said to be the first documentation of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in
free-ranging wildlife (mongooses and meerkats) in Southern Africa:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol08no6/01-0358.htm>
Domesticated cattle as well as the African buffalo, the European
badger, American bison, as well as a number of large felines
including the lion have been infected with a closely related
organism, _M. bovis_, another member of the _M. tuberculosis_
complex; but the identification of human tuberculosis per se in
free-ranging wildlife is a distinct and novel development. In the
Alexander study, bacteriologic and PCR amplification studies appear
to show that the isolates are _M. tuberculosis_.

The source of the animal infection is not entirely clear. The
authors imply that exposure to human excretions in the environment is
the source of the animal infection. Human tuberculosis is, however,
almost entirely transmitted by respiratory aerosol. - Mod.LL
