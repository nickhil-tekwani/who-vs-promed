[1] Leningrad Oblast: ASF-contaminated bacon

A consignment of bacon from a fair held in late September [2012] in Leningrad Oblast [Region] was found to be infected with the African swine fever (ASF) virus. This was stated by a specialist at the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor).

"During laboratory studies the genome of the ASF virus was detected in salted bacon produced by Lipetsk JSC Meat Master, traded by the individual entrepreneur Shchigrov at the Agricultural Fair held [28-29 Sep 2012] in Tosno, Leningrad region," reports Rosselkhoznadzor.

Rosselkhoznadzor asked consumers not to feed the products purchased from this vendor to animals without prior heat treatment, cautioning as well not to throw away wastes without disinfection.

In order to prevent the introduction of ASF virus, owners of the private pig farms in the region should invite experts of the State Veterinary Service to examine their animals. Farmers are also advised to avoid exposing their pigs to other animals including people, which may be sources of infection, and to disinfect the places where pigs are kept, as well as storage facilities, processing facilities, equipment, and working clothes.

It is the 1st officially confirmed case of ASF-contaminated pork slipping through to the shops for the whole period of reported spread of the disease in Russia. The case is quite unusual given that virus was officially confirmed registered in the Leningrad region a year ago [2011]. Most likely, the infected meat was imported to the fair from other regions of Russia, experts said.

Rosselkhoznadzor experts also pointed out that the virus is not dangerous to humans; even after eating infected meat there will be no negative effect on the health of people. But still, consumers who purchased the meat at the fair are strongly recommended not to consume it.

[2] Russia: new ASF control regulations

Russia adopts single set of regulations to fight ASF
----------------------------------------------------
Russia's Ministry of Agriculture has adopted a single set of guidelines to fight African swine fever (ASF). The guidelines are based on Soviet epidemic regulations for disease prevention approved in 1980.

A draft decree "On the approval of regulations to combat African swine fever" was developed by the Ministry of Agriculture at a recent meeting with deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Arkady Dvorkovich.

According to the new guidelines, pig owners must prevent production waste from polluting the environment, and that all waste destined for pig consumption should be heat treated (boiling for 3 hours).

If a farmer or pig owner suspects one of his animals to have caught ASF he must immediately report this to the appropriate veterinary service. Then he should isolate the pigs in the same room in which they were in when he saw the symptoms of the disease and stop all slaughter and sale of all animals (including poultry) and products of slaughter (meat, fat, skin, lint, etc). The farmer also cannot export crops such as feed and hay.

Veterinary experts should be notified of all cases of sudden death or simultaneous mass disease or deaths of pigs, as well as unusual behaviour, within 24 hours. Farmers will be held criminally liable if they do not comply with the new guidelines.

Of course, the regulations prohibit the import of animals into Russia from countries where cases of ASF have been reported.

The new regulations also provide a clear definition and methodology of diagnosis -- from the sampling method to the list of those indicators, according to which the diagnosis may be considered confirmed.

[The detection of ASF virus in the food chain reflects the intensification of ASF surveillance and control measures currently applied in the Russian Federation. It would be interesting to note if the authorities could trace back the farm(s) from where the raw material for the contaminated bacon was sourced.

ASF has been spreading in south and west Russia since November 2007: so far, 299 outbreaks have been officially reported to the OIE. A 1st case in Russia's western neighbour, Ukraine, was reported in July 2012.

FAO has reviewed the global ASF situation, with special reference to the Russian epizootic, in Vol 6 (Sep 2012) of EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System) "Focus on", available at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap372e/ap372e.pdf.

The review includes the following articles:
1. Current ASF dynamics (2011/12)
2. Disease impact
3. Epidemiological outlook
4. Response and action
5. Recommendations: prevention and control
6. Further reading

ASF is not regarded zoonotic; no ASF vaccine is (yet) available. - Mod.AS
