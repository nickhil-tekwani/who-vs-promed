Could the referred to 7-dose schedule be some modified Thai Red Cross
intradermal vaccination regimen (e.g. 2-2-2-0-1)? The intradermal
vaccination route is approved by WHO to be used in regions with poor
resources. A 7-dose schedule is not approved by WHO, however (see:
http://www.who.int/wer/2010/wer8532.pdf).

It would be good to know which vaccines are being used to immunise
people at risk.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Schel for the points and questions he raises. It
would be of interest to receive a response from the Ecuador Ministry
of Health concerning the type of rabies vaccine being used and the
route of administration. It would also be helpful to know the outcome
of the children currently hospitalized with suspected rabies.

The Taisha canton in Morona-Santiago is located in east-central
Ecuador, in the Amazon basin. A map showing its location can be
accessed at
