Taiwan reports 1st poultry market H5N2 case
-------------------------------------------
The Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed on [2 May 2014] a case of H5N2 avian influenza that was detected last month [April 2014] in a wholesale poultry market in Taipei, the 1st to be recorded at this type of market in the country.

Previously, cases had been confined to chicken farms in Changhua County, Tainan and outlying Penghu County.

The latest case was traced to a chicken farm in Yunlin County, although it could not be confirmed how many chickens were affected with the virus because the batch of chickens in which the infected one was detected were all slaughtered and might already have been eaten, according to the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

Disinfection procedures have been performed at the Yunlin chicken farm and it will only be allowed to resume to normal operations once it has been identified as virus-free.

The bureau has begun stepping up its checks on samples of the highly pathogenic virus at poultry markets. On [15 Apr 2014], the Taipei wholesale poultry market took 100 serum samples, 100 stool specimens and 6 chicken samples for examination. One of the samples tested positive [23 Apr 2014] for an H5N2 subtype virus, which was confirmed [2 May 2014] by the bureau as an H5N2 strain.

[Taiwan's authorities have notified the OIE today (2 May 2014) about the said event. The notification, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15191.

The notification includes the following epidemiological comments:

"An intensive active surveillance was conducted on a wholesale poultry market in Taipei City since April 2014. 100 sera, 100 fecal swabs and 6 dead chickens were collected for serological and virological tests. The H5N2 subtype of avian influenza virus was isolated from one dead native chicken body sample on 23 Apr 2014, but it was not in the other samples. By tracing back on 23 Apr 2014, the original chicken farm in Yunlin County had no chickens left, but movement control was immediately conducted on the farm. The pathogenicity of the virus was confirmed by the national laboratory as highly pathogenic (greater than 75 percent mortality of tested chickens) on 2 May 2014. Samples were taken from 8 poultry farms in a 1-km [about 0.6-mile] radius around the original farm and confirmed all negative by virus isolation. After thorough cleaning and disinfection of this index farm, sentinel poultry tests will be implemented to affirm absence of viral activity in the environment. The transaction activities at the wholesale poultry market were stopped for one day to conduct thorough cleaning and disinfection. There were no poultry farms located within the 3km [about 1.9-mile] radius area around the market." - Mod.AS
