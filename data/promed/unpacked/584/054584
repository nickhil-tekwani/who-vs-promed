Summary
------
Background: To date, few data on paediatric COVID-19 have been published, and most reports originate from China. This study aimed to capture key data on children and adolescents with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection across Europe to inform physicians and healthcare service planning during the ongoing pandemic.

Methods: This multicentre cohort study involved 82 participating healthcare institutions across 25 European countries, using a well-established research network -- the Paediatric Tuberculosis Network European Trials Group (ptbnet) -- that mainly comprises paediatric infectious diseases specialists and paediatric pulmonologists. We included all individuals aged 18 years or younger with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, detected at any anatomical site by RT-PCR, between 1 Apr and 24 Apr 2020, during the initial peak of the European COVID-19 pandemic. We explored factors associated with need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and initiation of drug treatment for COVID-19 using univariable analysis and applied multivariable logistic regression with backwards stepwise analysis to further explore those factors significantly associated with ICU admission.

Findings: 582 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included, with a median age of 5.0 years (IQR, 0.5-12.0) and a sex ratio of 1.15 males per female; 145 (25%) had pre-existing medical conditions. A total of 363 (62%) individuals were admitted to hospital, and 48 (8%) individuals required ICU admission, 25 (4%) mechanical ventilation (median duration, 7 days; IQR, 2-11; range, 1-34), 19 (3%) inotropic support, and 1 (less than 1%) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Significant risk factors for requiring ICU admission in multivariable analyses were being younger than 1 month (odds ratio, 5.06; 95% CI, 1.72-14.87; p = 0.0035), male sex (2.12; 1.06-4.21; p = 0.033), pre-existing medical conditions (3.27; 1.67-6.42; p = 0.0015), and presence of lower respiratory tract infection signs or symptoms at presentation (10.46; 5.16-21.23; p less than 0.0001). The most frequently used drug with antiviral activity was hydroxychloroquine (40 [7%] patients), followed by remdesivir (17 [3%] patients), lopinavir-ritonavir (6 [1%] patients), and oseltamivir (3 [1%] patients). Immunomodulatory medication used included corticosteroids (22 [4%] patients), intravenous immunoglobulin (7 [1%] patients), tocilizumab (4 [1%] patients), anakinra (3 [1%] patients), and siltuximab (1 [less than 1%] patient). Four children died (case-fatality rate, 0.69%; 95% CI, 0.20-1.82); at study end, the remaining 578 were alive and only 25 (4%) were still symptomatic or requiring respiratory support.

Interpretation: COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including infants. However, a small proportion develop severe disease requiring ICU admission and prolonged ventilation, although fatal outcome is overall rare. The data also reflect the current uncertainties regarding specific treatment options, highlighting that additional data on antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs are urgently needed.

[As the authors mention, there have not been many manuscripts describing the acute clinical disease and severe manifestations of COVID-19 in children and adolescents.

Of the study population, 75% had no pre-existing comorbidities. Those who did had chronic pulmonary disease, malignancies, neurologic disorders, congenital heart disease, chromosomal abnormalities and chronic kidney disease. There were only 4 deaths in the study group, consistent with the interpretation that children had milder disease in general than the adult population. The sample size was not sufficient to stratify by treatment modalities, so no conclusions were made based on treatments.

Keep in mind this study was conducted in April 2020, now 2 months ago, and we continue on the upward slope of the learning curve about disease and treatments for COVID-19. That being said, it is an interesting descriptive study of high-risk factors for severe disease in children. - Mod.MPP]

Six days after it recorded 4 lakh [400 000] infections, India's COVID-19 tally raced past 5 lakh [500 000] on Saturday [27 Jun 2020], with the highest single-day surge of 18 552 cases, while the death toll climbed to 15 685, according to Union health ministry data. The COVID-19 caseload zoomed to 508 953, while 384 fatalities were recorded in the past 24 hours, the updated figure at 8 am showed. It took 110 days for coronavirus infection in the country to reach 1 lakh [100 000] while just 39 days more to go past the 5-lakh mark on 27 Jun 2020.

This was the 4th consecutive day when coronavirus infection increased by more than 15 000, while there has been a surge of 318 418 infections from 1 Jun to 27 Jun 2020. The number of active cases stands at 197 387, while 295 880 people have recovered, and one patient has migrated. "Thus, around 58.13% patients have recovered so far," an official said.

The total number of confirmed cases include foreigners. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 7 996 707 samples have been tested up to 26 Jun 2020, with 220 479 samples being tested on Friday [26 Jun 2020], the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic.

[A glimpse of the status of the COVID-19 outbreak in India -- what is impressive is the rapid increase in terms of 100 000-case increments, growing by over 300 000 cases in less than 4 weeks. On the Worldometer website (see section [4] below), India had the 3rd largest 24-hour increase of newly confirmed cases globally just behind the USA and Brazil.

Maharashtra state capital Mumbai (the former Bombay), situated in the central western coastal part of the country, is one of the leading industrial and technology states and is the financial capital of the country. Maharashtra is the 2nd most populous state with an estimated population of over 128 million (http://www.indiaonlinepages.com/population/population-of-maharashtra.html) and appears to be the epicenter of the epidemic in India, analogous to northern Italy and New York City in terms of population and financial centers of their respective countries. Delhi, the capital of the country, is in 2nd place in terms of virus activity, and has an estimated population of 30.2 million, the largest metropolitan area in India (http://www.populationu.com/in/delhi-population).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 59.8% of the global newly reported cases and 67.7% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 40.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and the USA reported 35.5%, Mexico 5.1%, Chile 4.4%, Peru 3.7%, Colombia 3.3%, and Argentina 2.5%. The same 5 countries remained at the top; the USA and Brazil are usually numbers 1 and 2, although they vary for which of the 2 positions they hold, but Argentina is continuing to increase its proportional representation within the region.

The European region reported 10.8% of the global newly reported cases and 11.0% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 35.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Sweden 8.2%, Turkey 7.6%, Ukraine and the UK each at 5.8%, Armenia 4.0%, Azerbaijan 2.9%, Kazakhstan 2.4%, and Belarus 2.3%. Again, the same countries as yesterday (25 Jun 2020), with a minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day, although the proportion of cases represented by Russia has fallen. Note the appearance of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan joining Sweden, Ukraine, and Belarus as 6 of the 11 countries noted to have resurgence in Europe.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 10.1% of the global newly reported cases and 9.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 15.5%, Iran 14.5%, Iraq 13.6%, Egypt 8.8%, Oman 7.6%, Qatar 5.9%, and Kuwait 5.1%. Multiple countries are very active in the region.

The African region reported 5.8% of the global newly reported cases and 2.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 64.5% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 5.8%, Ghana 4.5%, Cameroon 3.2%, and Mauritania 2.2%. Other countries of prior prominence are less than 2%. While South Africa and Nigeria are usually numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.62% of the global newly reported cases and 0.22% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 70.4% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 10.3%, Japan 7.9%, South Korea 3.5%, Australia 3.4%, and China 2.6%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 12.9% of the global newly reported cases and 9.7% of global deaths. India reported 75.6% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 17.2%, Indonesia 5.1%, and Nepal 1.9%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, but basically on parity, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily case load of all of the regions.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 26 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above test. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 904 978, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. Unless there is a significant weekend artifact with reduced reporting, the global tally will probably pass the 10 million-case mark in the next 24 to 48 hours. The global case count rose by 2.0% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.55 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.8% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.28 million cases), represents 12.8% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, Russia, India and the UK), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (53.2%). A global total of 496 866 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5083 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: Actual numbers may be 10 to 20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is now number 22, as Colombia surpassed China in the past 24 hours. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Columbia, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, a decrease of 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region and an increase of 1 from the South East Asia region. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include 7 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 from the European region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, a decrease in 1 from the Americas region and 1 from the Eastern Mediterranean region and an increase in 2 from the European region in the past 24 hours. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
