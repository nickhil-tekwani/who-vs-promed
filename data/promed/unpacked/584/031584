The rapidly spreading encephalitis has claimed 131 lives in north India's
Uttar Pradesh by Sunday, Indo-Asian News Service reported. 10 children have
died of the killer virus across Uttar Pradeshsince Saturday.
Doctors are finding it hard to cope with the rising number of patients,
said the special encephalitis unit under the Gorakhpur Medical College,
adding that despite pumping in all available resources, they are unable to
curb the deaths.
At least 170-180 patients were in the hospital (the special encephalitis
unit) in the past few days, which onlyhas 128 beds earmarked for
encephalitis patients. The hospital said it had no choice but to place
patients 2 to a bed or even on the floor.
"The government has failed to declare encephalitis an epidemic,even though
it has been striking eastern Uttar Pradesh for 27 years," said K.P.
Kushwaha, in-charge of the unit, "There is a total absence of any kind of
preventive measures here."
There is no regular immunization against encephalitis even though its
vaccine is produced in India, he added.
However, according to sources from local health authority, India's only
manufacturer of the vaccine, located in northwest India's Himachal Pradesh,
has to reduce production due to poor demand.
"Right now we are grappling with the serious issue of deaths; we will look
into the immunization aspect later," said Uttar Pradesh Health Minister
Jaiveer Singh.

Encephalitis is slowly spreading in UP and causing more deaths especially
in children. 11 more deaths were reported from Gorakhpur. The toll caused
by the rapidly spreading killer virus in the state has gone up to 131.
While the disease was so far confined largely to Gorakhpur and neighboring
Maharajganj and Kushinagar districts, it has now spread to not only nearby
Bahraich, Barabanki and Lakhimpur-Kheri districts but also to Varanasi,
Sitapur and Rae Bareli located far away.
The special encephalitis unit created at the Gorakhpur Medical College is
finding it hard to cope with the needs of the rising number of patients.
Despite pumping in all available resources, medical experts are unable to
curb the deaths.
As against 128 beds earmarked for encephalitis patients in the medical
college at Gorakhpur, there were no less than 170-180 patients over the
past few days. The hospital said it had no choice but to place patients 2
to a bed or even on the floor.
K.P. Kushwaha, in-charge of the encephalitis unit at Gorakhpur, said: "It's
strange that the government has failed to declare encephalitis an epidemic,
even though it has been striking eastern Uttar Pradesh for 27 years."
Referring to the number of deaths, he said: "The mortality is not unusual
as even in countries like Japan, China, Thailand and Indonesia, where the
disease is prevalent, it takes a toll of about 20-40 percent." [the range
is from 0.3 to 60 percent, according to the fact sheet of USA's CDC. - Mod.RY]
He said, however, there was a difference: "unlike those countries, there is
a total absence of any kind of preventive measures here".
According to Kushwaha: "There is no system of immunisation against
encephalitis, even though its vaccine is manufactured in India."
However, according to sources in the state health headquarters here, poor
demand for the vaccine had forced India's only manufacturing unit at
Kasauli in Himachal Pradesh to reduce production.
The Indian vaccine is priced Rs.60 [USD $1.38] a vial, against the imported
vaccine's cost of Rs.150-200 [UDS $3.45 - 4.6].
Top government officials declined to comment on the issue.
"Right now we are grappling with the serious issue of deaths, we will look
into the immunisation aspect later," said Uttar Pradesh Health Minister
Jaiveer Singh.
"We have already taken punitive action against doctors and pharmacists who
failed to rise to the occasion in handling the disease."
