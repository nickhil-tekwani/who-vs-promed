Bluetongue has been suspected in several farms in the south Netherlands.
The farms have been put under quarantine; no animals are allowed to be
introduced or to exit them. The results of tests are expected at the end of
this week.
In anticipation of the results, additional measures are being prepared.
Bluetongue is a viral disease in ruminants; sheep are particularly
clinically susceptible with potentially serious disease course including
mortality, but recovery is not excluded. Other ruminants, such as cattle,
goats and wild ruminants, can be infected but in most cases with mild or no
clinical symptoms. The disease does not affect humans.
The disease is transmitted by biting midges (_Culicoides_), species of
which are prevalent in warmer regions; the disease is not transmitted by
direct contact.
Bluetongue is endemic in southern member-states of the EU such as Italy and
Greece. [The disease has been recorded, since 1998, in various south
European countries, such as Corsica -- a French territory, in Spain, in
Portugal as well as throughout the Balkans. - Mod.AS] If the suspicion in
the Netherlands is confirmed, this will be the 1st occurrence of the
disease that far north.

[The above press release also included a clinical description of the disease.
If confirmed, this is bad news for northern Europe, including the 2 leading
mutton producers of Europe, the UK and France, where breeds which might be
particularly vulnerable to BT are maintained.
Virological (serotype) and entomological data are anticipated soon; it will
be of particular importance to note if _Culicoides imicola_, the
traditional vector of BT, has been found to be the vector in south
Netherlands, probably introduced by wind, or that an endemic species is
involved. In the latter case, spread to other countries in northern Europe
will probably occur. Animal movement restrictions are not sufficient to
prevent spread of the BT virus by the wind-borne vector.
An opulent source of information on recent developments related to BT
research and epidemiology, including data about its spread into and within
Europe since 1998, can be found in the Proceedings of the 3rd International
Bluetongue Symposium, held in Taormina, Sicily, in October 2003. The
document has been published in Veterinaria Italiana, Volume 40 (3)
July-September 2004 and Volume 40 (4) October- December 2004, both
available online at <http://www.te.izs.it/vet_italiana/index.html>. - Mod.AS].
