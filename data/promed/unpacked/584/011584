["Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a persistent viral infection of equids. The causative agent, EIA virus (EIAV) is a lentivirus in the family _Retroviridae_, subfamily Orthoretrovirinae.

"Equine infectious anemia (EIA) occurs world-wide. The infection, formerly known as swamp fever, is limited to equids. Many cases remain clinically unapparent. The disease is characterised by recurrent febrile episodes, thrombocytopenia, anemia, rapid loss of weight and oedema of the lower parts of the body. If death does not result from one of the acute clinical attacks, a chronic stage develops and the infection tends to become inapparent. The incubation period is normally 1-3 weeks, but may be as long as 3 months.

"Once a horse is infected with EIAV, its blood remains infectious for the remainder of its life and the horse can potentially transmit the infection to other horses. Transmission occurs by transfer of blood or contaminated secretion from an infected horse. In nature, spread of the virus is most likely via interrupted feeding of bloodsucking horseflies (_Tabanidae_) on a clinically ill horse and then on susceptible horses. Transmission can also occur by the iatrogenic transfer of blood through the use of contaminated blood products, needles, syringes, IV administration sets or other equipment. In utero infection of the fetus may occur. The virus titre is higher in horses with clinical signs and the risk of transmission is higher from these animals than the carrier animals with a lower virus titre. However, studies in mules indicate infected animals with positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indeterminate agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test results can have viral loads at the same level as animals with strong antibody responses, and are therefore equally likely as a potential source of transmission.

"EIAV is not considered a risk for human health. Laboratory manipulations should be carried out at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis".
