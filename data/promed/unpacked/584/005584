Contagious children's disease hits areas of the Wasatch Front
---------------------------------------------------
Several areas in Utah are seeing one of the biggest outbreaks of a contagious children's disease some people have ever seen. It's called hand, foot, and mouth disease, and it can make your kids feel downright miserable. [The Wasatch Range is a mountain range that stretches approximately 160 miles (260 km) from the Utah-Idaho border, south through central Utah. - Mod.CP]

"This is the first year in many years that I've seen it like it is, the way it has shown up this year. I've never seen it in the numbers like I've seen this year," said Luann Nunez at Luann's Daycare. Doctor Huff at the Intermountain hospital in Riverton said it's the time of year this thing goes around. "If you have a child who has it, and they go to daycare or a baby sitter and they spread it, and then a lot of the kids are going to get it," said Glen Huff, Pediatric Hospitalist, Riverton Hospital.

Huff said it's not a severe disease, but your kids will hate it. "The sores hurt really bad, and the kids just don't want to eat with them," said Huff.

So what do you do to keep your kids from getting it? Doctors Huff said make sure your kids wash their hands, and stay away from other kids who have it for about a week.

Hand, foot and mouth pandemic in Mekong Delta
-----------------------------------------
Vo Huy Danh, director of the Preventive Medicine Center in the Mekong delta province of An Giang, said that despite all efforts to curb hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in the province, there continues to be a disease pandemic which is not abating.

Recently, HFMD has claimed the lives of seven children in An Giang Province and 1300 infectious cases have been reported so far, ten times higher than in the first three months of the year. Health authorities have expressed serious concerns over the development of the disease as patients continue to increase by almost 50 cases per day. The entire State machinery has been mobilised and drastic measures are underway to tackle the disease, said Danh.

Most affected cases are children under the age of five and who are usually staying at home these days because of summer vacations. With the ongoing holidays and more children playing in public parks and entertainment centers, the risk of infection is even higher. Accordingly, the health sector and province leaders have called for better awareness in parents of the disease, and for more distribution of soaps and chemicals to households who have children under the age of five.

HFMD cases on the increase this week
--------------------------------
KUCHING: The number of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) cases have been on an increasing trend this week. A total of 341 new cases were reported from Sunday to Thursday (June 24 to 28). The divisions with the highest number of new cases were Kuching, Samarahan, Miri, Sarikei and Mukah. During the week, an increasing number of cases were noted in Sarikei, Mukah, Bintulu, and Limbang. As of Thursday, the cumulative number of cases stood at 8611.

This week, 31 clusters were reported involving 25 family clusters, three preschools, two primary schools and one childcare centre. Nine closure orders were served to preschools in Serian, Limbang, Sarikei, Miri, Dalat and Kota Samarahan.

The state Health Department called on the public to continuously practise personal hygiene especially hand-washing, seek medical treatment if their children have signs and symptoms of HFMD, limit outdoor activities and time spent in public places. This would also help prevent complications from the [atmospheric] haze.
Parents have also been asked not to send children with HFMD to childcare centres or any institution.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common, mild disease usually caused by an enterovirus such as human coxsackievirus A , human coxsackievirus B or human enterovirus 71. Infection by human enterovirus 71 may have more serious outcomes, but other wise HFMD is a mild illness.

HFMD gets its name from the non-itchy rash that develops on the palms of your hands and soles of feet. It can also cause ulcers in the mouth although many individuals have no symptoms. It is generally believed that large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease do not occur in developed countries, but the above report from Utah contradicts this belief. Many countries in East and South-east Asia experience very large annual outbreaks affecting many thousands of children. A few children, and rarely adults, may have severe illnesses.

HFMD is spread from person to person through nose and throat secretions (such as saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus), blister fluid, or faeces of infected persons. The risk of being infected can be reduced by: washing hands often with soap and water, disinfecting dirty surfaces and soiled items, and avoiding close contact or sharing eating utensils with infected persons.

ProMED-mail receives very many reports of HFMD at this time of year and no more than a few can be posted. The above three are posted solely as examples. There are no specific treatments and unfortunately the infectious agent is rarely identified, consequently the prospects for development of preventive vaccines, except perhaps in the case of enterovirus 71, are poor. - Mod.CP.
