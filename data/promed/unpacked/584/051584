Anthrax was detected in one of the private farms of Khotyn district in
Chernivtsi [province]. "To confirm the disease, pathological samples
from the animal were examined in the regional state laboratory of
veterinary medicine and obtained a positive result for anthrax," the
press service of the Chernivtsi Regional State Administration
reported. Now this farm is under strict quarantine. To prevent the
spread of the pathogen in the environment, animal areas where
disinfected, the dead animal was burned, and all the village cattle
were vaccinated against anthrax.

Back in 2007, a cow was killed by this terrible disease. Doctors found
that 7 people were in contact with the sick cow and they were
vaccinated on the same day. The infected carcass was burned, and the
yard/farm was disinfected.

[Anthrax is sporadic in the Ukraine thanks to their extensive
vaccination of cattle, sheep, horses, and swine. My notes show that
they had probably 4 outbreaks in 2007. Two infected carcasses were
identified in Ivano-Frankovsk and Kharkov, and outbreaks in
Ivano-Frankovsk (1), Odessa (1), and Zakarpats'ka (1) were reported to
OIE. The 7 people vaccinated in 2007 apparently did not come down with
disease. There have been no livestock outbreaks reported in 2008 and
2009 but there was a single human case in 2008. I am awaiting a
follow-up from the Institute of Veterinary Medicine. - Mod.MHJ]
