The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment yesterday
announced the death, due to a hantavirus, of a 17 year-old male resident of
Teller County in central Colorado. The patient had been hospitalized for
less than a day when he died. This is the first known death from a
hantavirus infection in Colorado since 1995.

[There now have been 7 deaths among 11 Sin Nombre virus infections in
Colorado since 1993; an additional case and death in 1985 has been
determined from stored specimens. On-going longitudinal studies of
hantaviruses in Colorado should yield data useful in providing an early
warning of increased virus activity. - Mod.CHC]
