Initial tests indicated 27 of the 53 horses gathered Tuesday on federal land
likely had equine infectious anemia. Results of confirmation tests released
Thursday were identical. The 27 horses, seven of whom were newborn, will be
killed by injection and buried in a mass grave by Monday.
"No one wants to destroy these beautiful and proud horses," said state
veterinarian Michael Marshall. "But when they pose such a significant threat
to the lives of thousands of other horses, we must do what's medically
responsible no matter how much it may hurt."
The other 26 horses will be quarantined for 45 days and re tested.
The disease, colloquially called "Swamp fever" is spread by bloodsucking
insects. The normal incidence of infection is less than 1 percent. The
disease is spread by bloodsucking insects. Roughly a third of infected
animals die, and the others become carriers.
"My concern is that we don't see mass hysteria and (don't) eradicate large
numbers of horses," said Toni Moore, spokeswoman for the Colorado Wild Horse
and Burro Coalition.
