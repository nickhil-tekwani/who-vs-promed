A group of cows near Billings may have died from anthrax, according a
veterinarian in the state's Department of Livestock. Dr. Tom Linsfield said
further tests would be needed to say for sure if anthrax, a deadly
bacterial disease, killed the cows. The animals died suddenly last week.
"We're investigating a disease outbreak over there," Linsfield said.
He said he expected to know for certain what killed the cows by today, but
said anthrax turned up as the culprit in preliminary tests on the animals.
Until the investigation is over, however, Linsfield said he would not
confirm what killed the cows and would not say exactly where or how many
cows died. "We want to try to get as much info as we can," he said.
Anthrax is a bacteria that lives in alkaline soils, he said. It can become
buried in the soil and remain dormant for years. A heavy rain, which washes
the bacteria to the surface, can cause the bacteria to become infectious
again.
People who come into contact with the hair, feces or hides of an infected
animal can catch anthrax, according to the American Heritage Dictionary. In
humans, anthrax causes ulcers or lesions on the skin.
No people around the suspicious cattle deaths show any signs of the
disease, Linsfield said. So far, no other cows in the area have died.
"There appears to be no further problem," he said.

[This is unusual as it is some years since a case of anthrax has been
reported in Montana, as well as early in the 'anthrax season'. The rain may
wash out an old grave. What is more common is that the spores will float to
the surface from a buried carcass as the ground fills with water. Unless
the cowboys skinned and butchered the dead cattle and got infected blood
into a cut or insect bite, or rubbed their faces and/or eyes while working,
human cutaneous cases are most unlikely. Enteric anthrax is rare in North
America. It is very wise to vaccinate the herd immediately on suspecting
anthrax. Any animal under antibiotic treatment, e.g., a dairy cow with
mastitis, must be revaccinated a week or ten days after the treatment has
ceased as the Sterne vaccine is live and is killed promptly by antibiotics
leaving the animal susceptible. - MHJ]
