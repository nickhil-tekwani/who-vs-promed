Avian botulism is thought to be behind the deaths of up to 400 mainly mallard ducks at Waikanae beach's Pharazyn Reserve, Kapiti Coast District Council parks and recreation manager Alison Law said.

The council was working with animal welfare groups to collect sick and dead birds from the reserve and had posted signs warning pet owners to take care.

A bird carcass had been sent to Massey University's Wildbase Pathology unit for testing for the disease, Law said. "Although it is widely believed by all participating agencies that avian botulism is the cause of death.

"Avian botulism is tested for and detected in the body of an infected bird, not in a water source."

A Kapiti resident, who walked her dog at the on-leash reserve last week [week of 12 Feb 2018] said she was used to seeing hundreds of birds at the lagoon and was struck by how empty and quiet the area was.

In January [2018], 2 swans at Waimanu Lagoon, just south of Pharazyn Reserve, died due to suspected avian botulism.

Since then, animal welfare groups have cared for a number of birds struck down with the disease.

Last month [January 2018] Stuff reported on concerns from residents about flocks of geese overrunning the lagoons, with some describing them as a nuisance and a health hazard.

They said the lagoons were left reeking of poo after a handful of the illegally released domestic geese had grown in numbers.

An animal welfare group helped council rehome about 30 of the geese to private properties around the lower North Island.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas type E toxin is found in gulls, loons, and others. - Mod.PMB
