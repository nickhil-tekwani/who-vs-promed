MANATEE DEATHS - FLORIDA
========================
Manatee mortality is occurring in southwestern Florida from Fort
Myers to Marco Island and centered around the Caloosahatchee River
basin. Dead manatees were first reported to marine mammal
scientists by residents the first week of March.
A total of 83 manatees have been found dead in a period of 23 days.
Preliminary necropsy findings on 83 manatees show that nearly
all animals are adult and in very good body condition with ample
food content in their GI tract. Bilateral diffuse pneumonia is
seen with areas of hemorrhage and edema and some necrosis
of respiratory epithelium.
These signs with a lack of other gross lesions point to a peracute
death. Test results to date have not revealed a cause of
mortality. The diagnostic evaluation is ongoing. Dr. Scott
Wright, Director of the Marine Mammal Pathobiology Laboratory with
the Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, in St. Petersburg,
Florida is heading up the investigation.
I have posted this information with permission from Dr. Scott Wright
and will update the list as I receive additional information.

[Is this reminiscent of the seal deaths in northern Europe in the
1980's, due to phocid morbillivirus? - Mod.]
