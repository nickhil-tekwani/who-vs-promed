[3] France: retrospective case finding 27 Dec 2019, RFI
Date: Tue 5 May 2020

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france-retests/frances-early-covid-19-case-may-hold-clues-to-pandemics-start-idUSKBN22H15R


A study by French scientists which suggests a man was infected with COVID-19 as early as [27 Dec 2020], nearly a month before France confirmed its 1st cases, could be important in assessing when and where the new coronavirus emerged, experts said on Tuesday [5 May 2020]. A man identified as the patient told a French TV station that he was surprised to learn that he had contracted COVID-19 since he thought he had flu at the time.

French researchers led by Yves Cohen, head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals, retested samples from 24 patients treated in December [2019] and January [2020] who had tested negative for flu before COVID-19 developed into a pandemic. The results, published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, showed that one patient -- a 42 year old man born in Algeria, who had lived in France for many years and worked as a fishmonger -- was infected with COVID-19 "one month before the 1st reported cases in our country", they said.

The World Health Organization said the results were "not surprising". "It's also possible there are more early cases to be found," WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a UN briefing in Geneva. He encouraged other countries to check records for cases in late 2019, saying this would give the world a "new and clearer picture" of the outbreak.

French broadcaster BFM TV identified the man as a resident of Bobigny, a north eastern suburb of Paris. In an interview with the station, he said when he fell ill last year with a dry cough, fatigue, and a fever, he thought he had flu. Doctors at the time could not diagnose him. "I was surprised," he said, about being told much later by doctors that he had been suffering from COVID-19. He is fully recovered. He said he had not travelled abroad for months before falling ill, and did not know where he could have been infected. His wife said she works at a retailer near a Paris airport, and frequently comes into contact with travellers from overseas.

Independent experts said the findings of the French scientists needed more investigation. "It's not impossible that it was an early introduction, but the evidence isn't conclusive by any means," said Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at Britain's University of Nottingham.

Stephen Griffin, an expert at the University of Leeds' Institute of Medical Research, said it was "a potentially important finding" and added: "We must be cautious when interpreting these findings."

Cohen told French television on Monday [4 May 2020] it was too early to know if the patient, whose last trip abroad, to Algeria, had been in August 2019, was France's "patient zero". But "identifying the 1st infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding SARS-COV-2 (the new coronavirus) and its spreading in the country," he and his co-researchers wrote in the paper detailing their findings.

They said the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel "suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December 2019". France, where almost 25 000 people have died from COVID-19 since [1 Mar 2020], confirmed its 1st 3 cases on [24 Jan 2020], including 2 patients in Paris and another in the south western city of Bordeaux.

Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, said that even if it were confirmed, the identification of a positive COVID-19 in December [2019] "is not necessarily an indication that the spread of COVID-19 from France started this early. If confirmed, what this case does highlight is the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world can quickly seed infections elsewhere," he said.

[Unfortunately I have been unable to access the original article to read the original text. The link for the article can be found at https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920301643. One of the media reports in French mentioned that while the wife did not have any signs of illness, both children had a mild clinical presentation. Given that, one wonders if serology has been done on the family to support the presence of antibodies as 2nd confirmation of infection.

It is plausible that the virus travelled from China to France in December 2019, much travel related to the holiday season globally. The earliest confirmed case in Wuhan that has been published had a date of onset of illness on 1 Dec 2019. By late December 2019 there was evidence of early person to person transmission in households in Wuhan and it is highly likely that travellers from Wuhan to France may have been asymptomatically infected. It will be interesting to see if other locations have specimens that are well preserved to test for the SARS-CV-2 in compatible clinical cases. And interesting to learn about serology in this case and his family members. - Mod.MPP

[4] Tocilizumab: severe COVID-19 treatment

---------------------------
Significance
------------
In patients with coronavirus disease 2019, a large number of T lymphocytes and mononuclear macrophages are activated, producing cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), which bind to the IL-6 receptor on the target cells, causing the cytokine storm and severe inflammatory responses in lungs and other tissues and organs. Tocilizumab, as a recombinant humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, can bind to the IL-6 receptor with high affinity, thus preventing IL-6 itself from binding to its receptor, rendering it incapable of immune damage to target cells, and alleviating the inflammatory responses.

Abstract
--------
After analyzing the immune characteristics of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have identified that pathogenic T cells and inflammatory monocytes with large amount of interleukin 6 secreting may incite the inflammatory storm, which may potentially be curbed through monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 pathways. Here, we aimed to assess the efficacy of tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19 and seek a therapeutic strategy. The patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 in The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (Anhui Provincial Hospital) and Anhui Fuyang Second People's Hospital were given tocilizumab in addition to routine therapy between [5 and 14 Feb 2020]. The changes of clinical manifestations, computerized tomography (CT) scan image, and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Fever returned to normal on the 1st day, and other symptoms improved remarkably within a few days. Within 5 d after tocilizumab, 15 of the 20 patients (75%) had lowered their oxygen intake, and 1 patient needed no oxygen therapy. CT scans manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 19 patients (90.5%). The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which decreased in 85% of patients (17/20) before treatment (mean 15.52%, +/- 8.89%), returned to normal in 52.6% of patients (10/19) on the 5th day after treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased significantly in 84.2% of patients (16/19). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. All patients have been discharged on average 15.1 d after giving tocilizumab. Preliminary data show that tocilizumab, which improved the clinical outcome immediately in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, is an effective treatment to reduce mortality.

[In their discussion, the authors concluded that "tocilizumab can effectively treat severe patients of COVID-19, which might be explained by the blocking of IL-6-associated febrile and inflammatory storm response". They did note limitations based on size of sample and it was not a blinded study, but their data support the need to do a randomized case control study of the use of tocilizumab for treatment of severe disease in COVID-19. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- Every year on [5 May] we celebrate Hand Hygiene Day (https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2020/05/05/default-calendar/hand-hygiene-day) to mobilize people around the world to increase adherence to hand hygiene practices in healthcare facilities. In his media briefing (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---4-may-2020), the director-general reminded us that 'around the world, fewer than 2/3 of healthcare facilities are equipped with hand hygiene stations, and 3 billion people lack soap and water at home.' Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, WHO regional director for South East Asia, said that 'Effective infection prevention and control measures, including hand hygiene, are crucial to ensuring health facilities do not become hubs of COVID-19 transmission.' (https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/detail/04-05-2020-promote-hand-hygiene-to-save-lives-and-combat-covid-19)

- A WHO COVID-19 mission has arrived in Tajikistan to support the country's response to the pandemic (http://www.euro.who.int/en/media-centre/sections/press-releases/2020/whoeurope-covid-19-mission-arrives-in-tajikistan-international-experts-to-support-countrys-response-to-the-pandemic)

- Today also marks the International Day of the Midwife (https://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/news/events/international-day-midwife-5-may-2020/en/). Midwives provide life-saving services to pregnant women, ensuring healthy outcomes for women and their babies. As the director-general said in his media briefing, 'They're risking their lives to give life to others.' (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---4-may-2020) WHO Regional Office for Europe has released a news article of the experiences of a midwife in Italy (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/nursing-and-midwifery/news/news/2020/5/iliana-colonna-enabling-positive-birth-experiences-in-the-time-of-covid-19).

- Yesterday [4 May 2020] leaders from 40 countries around the world came together to support the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator (https://www.who.int/who-documents-detail/access-to-covid-19-tools-(act)-accelerator), a WHO initiative to support the development, production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics against COVID-19. Some Euro 7.4 billion [about USD 8 billion] were pledged, in what the director-general described as a 'powerful and inspiring demonstration of global solidarity' (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---4-may-2020)

- UN-led purchasing consortium procures diagnostic tests for delivery to 135 countries
Unprecedented global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, and other critical items for the COVID-19 response has resulted in acute supply shortages. WHO is working across several different sectors to enable countries with the most limited means to access markets for vital medical supplies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO -- together with other UN agencies, NGOs, and donor partners -- are negotiating collectively with manufacturers through a pooled procurement process, to address global market shortages in the 3 categories of vital supplies essential for the COVID-19 response: PPE; diagnostics; and biomedical equipment.

With support from the Solidarity Response Fund, the diagnostics consortium has secured 4 million manual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for USD 49 million, and initiated purchase orders for allocation and distribution to 135 countries for the month of May [2020]. These initial purchases will serve as a catalyst for securing supplies for additional procurement, as payments from countries receiving these deliveries will provide additional funding for procuring more supplies and equipment for allocation and delivery in the coming months.

WHO is engaged in discussions with suppliers to explore further channels of cooperation for sourcing pooled procurement of PPE, testing supplies and biomedical equipment. Through a purchasing consortium for PPE, contracts have been secured from Chinese and Malaysian manufacturers for substantial volumes of masks, gloves, and other critical supplies to protect frontline healthcare workers. WHO is currently in the process of placing purchase orders for these supplies, while the consortium continues efforts to secure additional quantities of PPE.

WHO continues to strongly advocate for the urgent need to increase production of these life-saving supplies to strengthen response capacity of member states confronting the COVID-19 pandemic.

- COVID-19 Supply Portal launch
WHO has launched a new COVID-19 Supply Portal. The COVID-19 Supply Portal is a purpose-built tool to facilitate and consolidate submission of supply requests from national authorities and all implementing partners supporting COVID-19 National Action Plans. Those requests will then be matched against purchasing agencies of the Consortia that can execute the order and process it, utilizing their existing ordering systems. A catalogue of items that can be requested is available online and is broadly divided into 3 categories: personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and clinical management [catalogue is available for download at https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/20200417-catalogue-v1.pdf]. The Portal is accessed via the COVID-19 Partners Platform, at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/strategies-plans-and-operations, and provides further information including a video and guide to requesting and receiving supplies and frequently asked questions.

Guidance on its roll-out and use has been provided to the UN Development Coordination Office, WHO Regional Directors, UN agencies and other key actors. WHO is preparing a circular to introduce the Portal to Member States and national authorities.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 43 691 new cases (53.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 1763 deaths (46.4%) were recorded for this 24 hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 67.0% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 10.5%, Peru at 7.8%, and Ecuador at 5.4%. Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 31.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 23.5%, and Ecuador at 16.2%, Mexico at 9.6%, and Chile at 6.8%.

The European region reported 22 539 new cases (27.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 1615 deaths (42.5%). Russia reported 44.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 17.7%, Turkey 7.2%, Italy 5.4%, and Spain and France 2.4% each.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7077 new cases (8.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 144 deaths (3.8%). Saudi Arabia reported 23.2% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 20.0%, Iran at 17.3%, Qatar 9.0%, and the United Arab Emirates at 8.0%.

The African region reported 2036 new cases (2.5% of the global newly reported cases) and 27 deaths (0.7%). Guinea reported 27.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 21.5%, Algeria at 8.5%, Sao Tome and Principe at 6.8%, and Guinea at 3.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1096 new cases (1.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 29 deaths (0.8%). Singapore reported 52.3% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 23.9%, Japan at 15.9%, and Malaysia at 5.0%.

The South East Asia region reported 5015 new cases (6.2% of the global newly reported cases) and 219 deaths (5.8%). India reported 77.8% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 13.7% and Indonesia at 7.9%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 61.7% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 35.4%, and the Maldives 1.6%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 5 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA, but other countries are following suit. The curve tends to drop over the weekends and rebounds following the weekend. Europe has not been rebounding as high at the end of the weekend, demonstrating decreasing newly confirmed cases. South East Asia has been gradually increasing as the cases continue increasing in India.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
