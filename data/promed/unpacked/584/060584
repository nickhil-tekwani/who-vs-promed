Case definitions for some infectious conditions not considered nationally
notifiable also are included in this report. Some of these conditions may
have been nationally reportable or may become so; definitions are included
here to facilitate interpretation of data for these diseases. State health
departments also provide CDC with information regarding certain conditions
of public health interest, whether nationally reportable, through
supplementary surveillance systems that collect more
detailed, condition-specific information.

The file types available are Adobe Acrobat (PDF), and ASCII (TXT).
The ASCII version of the journal does not contain figures.
The PDF files, contain graphics and figures and are true
representations of the hard copy of the MMWR. The
Adobe Acrobat format requires an Adobe Reader.
The Adobe Acrobat files will be e-mailed
in uuencoded format. If your e-mail system does not
automatically uudecode the file, you will need to
uudecode the file manually.

Accessing MMWR Using E-mail

If you have World-Wide Web (WWW) or File Transfer
Protocol (FTP) capabilities, we strongly recommend
that you access MMWR by using WWW or FTP rather
than through e-mail. This is due to the large size
of the PDF files and the complexity of sending
e-mail to different systems.
