The National Institute of Statistics [NIS reported 12 Nov. 1997 that a
total of 64,135 cases of malaria were reported in Bolivia in 1996.
The highest incidences of disease this year have been reported in the
departments of Pando, Tarija and Beni where a total of 45,309 cases have
been noted up to October of this year. The NIS indicated that this is an
alarming number if one considers the total number of carriers of the disease.
Oruro was the only department in the country that did not report a single
case. In the departments of Potosi 919 cases were reported, in Cochabamba
3,040; La Paz 3,182; in Chuquisaca 3,430 and in Santa Cruz 8,255.
Cases of malaria were increasing gradually in the country between 1990 and
1996. At the beginning of the decade, 19,680 cases were reported and then
the incidence tripled in 1996.
In the first quarter of the current year, statistics collected by the NIS
from the National Program for the Control of Malaria, indicated that the
number of cases of malaria is in decline in the departments of Chuquisaca,
Cochabamba, Tarija and Santa Cruz. In La Paz, cases have increased 4%
perhaps due to seasonal migrations; in Pando 0.6% and in Beni 42%. The NIS
attributed the increase of malaria in the country to a lack of eradication
nation-wide.

[ProMED-mail does not ordinarily post messages about diseases that are not
considered "emerging" or "reemerging"; malaria is one of those. However,
it is clear from this message that malaria is a reemerging disease in
Bolivia. What the ecologic parameters are, what the political
considerations are, and what the solution is, cannot be answered here. If
anyone has information that is less superficial than that provided above
regarding reasons for this remarkable increase in recognized cases, please
let us know. If you have an axe to grind, grind it somewhere else. - Mod.CHC
