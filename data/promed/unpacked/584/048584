SCABIES, CHIMPANZEES - TANZANIA (GOMBE NATIONAL PARK)
*****************************************************
A ProMED mail post
Date: Date: Thu, 18 Dec 1997 12:56:07 -0500
From: Anne Pusey, <pusey001@maroon.tc.umn.edu>

Between February 1997, and December 1997, at least 19 of the approximately
45 chimpanzees of the central community in Gombe National Park have shown
signs of a skin disease. The northern community has shown no signs of the
disease so far. A recent southward extension of the range of the
central>community, and a recent survey in the south suggests that the
southern>community may have recently decreased in number.
The disease starts with intense scratching of the body, often of the chest,
shoulders and thorax, but sometimes the crown of the head or the limbs. In
severe cases scratching extends over the whole body. Almost complete hair
loss in some adults occurred within one week, though in others little hair
is lost. During the intense stage of the disease, when the majority of hair
is gone, the individual appears ill, eats very little, scratches constantly
and loses weight. It shivers and tries to sit in the morning sun (unusual
behavior for chimps). The worst affected babies whimper almost constantly
and rely on their mothers to carry them. They become too weak to cling.
The first chimp of the central community to contract the disease (February
1997) was a peripheral, seldom sighted female who ranged in the south. Her
1.75 yr old infant became completely bald and died in April or May. The
mother became completely bald after her infant, but then gradually
recovered. Two other mothers with nursing infants had bad cases of the
disease and their infants died. Some lactating females and their infants
and females with older infants or no infants have escaped it altogether so
far.
Among the male adults, adolescents and juveniles, the disease has struck
5/6 males born 1964-75, 1/6 born 1976-80, and 0/6 born 1981-89. In summary,
it has affected lactating females, their young infants and older males the
worst. In several cases, the constant companions of diseased individuals
have been totally unaffected, although they engaged in frequent social grooming.
Skin samples and organ samples were collected in formalin from one infant
that died of the disease on July 29th. These have been examined in a
variety of labs including Sokoine University, Tanzania (Dr Mtambo),
Institute of Primate Research, Kenya (Dr. Farah), International Livestock
Research Institute, Kenya (Dr. Wells), and the University of Minnesota (Dr.
McKeever). All diagnose a mite of the genus _Sarcoptes_, but have not
identified this to species. Efforts are currently underway to extract DNA
from the mite (from skin preserved in lysis buffer and GT buffer) in order
to identify the species (In collaboration with Dr. Larry Arlian, Wright
State University, Ohio).
The infant showed signs of immuno-suppression including depletion of
lymphoid tissue, and lack of reaction to severe bacterial infection of skin.
The infant also had severe protozoan infection of the gut.
Several of the individuals have made a spontaneous recovery. Starting in
September, others, including lactating females with affected infants have
received two doses of oral Ivermectin at 0.2mg per kilo. These individuals
are recovering well. There are still some individuals with mild cases of
the disease.
We seek advice about further treatment, especially should we make an effort
to treat all chimps? What are the consequences of widespread use of
Ivermectin? We would also appreciate ideas about possible origin of the
disease and information about similar outbreaks in other places. So far, we
have heard that something similar occurred in the gorillas at Bwindi,
Uganda, a few years ago.
It has been suggested to us that the chimps may have been immunosuppressed
by another agent that then rendered them susceptible to the skin disease.
How can we investigate this possibility in a non-invasive manner?

[I probably don't need to remind our participants that the chimps affected
by this outbreak of scabies are extremely important because they form the
basis for Dr. Jane Goodall's ground breaking (30+ years running),
longitudinal studies of chimp behavior. While it is fortunate that
successful Ivermectin treatment or spontaneous recovery appears to occur in
most cases, there has been mortality of infants and a worrisome apparent
decrease in chimp numbers in some locations. I am sure they would appreciate
any input on management of the rest of the outbreak, it's origin and future
prevention. Please send suggestions directly to Dr. Pusey directly, her
email is included. ProMED-mail would appreciate a copy to see if there is
anything of general interest to the electronic conference.
We must develop rapid and effective methods for protecting these chimps and
other wildlife from emerging diseases as well as better known threats such
as deforestation, habitat destruction and poaching. Over the last few years,
the flamingos at Lake Nakuru and lions at the Serengetti have suffered
massive mortalities. While this situation doesn't appear to be so
destructive, systems to disseminate disease occurrence and collect disease
management information should be put in place now before disaster strikes.
ProMED's AHEAD field initiative in Southern Africa is in the planning
stages and intends to do just that. - Mod.PC]
