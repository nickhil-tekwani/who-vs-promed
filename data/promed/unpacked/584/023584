DR Congo: Humanitarian information note - Ebola virus disease epidemic in Equateur 29 Sep 2020, report 93

Key figures and facts
- A new health zone affected by Ebola

Statistics since the beginning of the epidemic

- 125 cases reported including 119 confirmed and 6 probable
- 41 health areas affected, spread over 13 health zones
- 67 healed
- 50 deaths including 44 confirmed and 6 probable
- 33 286 people vaccinated since the onset of the disease.

Overview of the situation
A new case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was confirmed on 28 Sep 2020 in the health zone of Makanza. The latter thus notifies its 1st case of Ebola, in the health area of Lusengo. This brings the number of health zones affected by the disease to 13, out of the 18 in the province.

Multidisciplinary response teams will be deployed in the area this Wed 30 Sep 2020 to support the efforts of local teams. The Makanza health zone borders that of Bomongo, which had already notified 2 cases of Ebola.

This new, confirmed case of EVD reveals several challenges to the current response. Samples from this case were collected on 19 Sep 2020, but test results came out 9 days later. The isolation and difficult communication with the village of Lusengo delayed the delivery of samples.

The Governor of the province of Equateur chaired a meeting of the Provincial Coordinating Committee Covid-19 / MVE (CPC) to discuss the challenges of the response. At the end of this meeting, in which the partners also took part, the CPC decided to set up a commission made up of the provincial authorities and partners in order to propose recommendations that could strengthen the payment process for providers in the province.

The interventions planned in the health zone of Makanza are facing many logistical challenges. The means of transport as well as the communication equipment available on site are not operational. Efforts are underway to cover this gap.

[The cases continue to increase and expand to new health zones, albeit slowly, but the remoteness of the region lends concern over cases that may go unrecognized, threatening the health of the region. Of major concern are the logistical problems, which are difficult to solve in this region.

Ebola panic: Deadly virus outbreak sparks panic after 50 deaths and 124 [now 125] new cases

Ebola is spreading across central Africa after 50 deaths and 125 new cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The country has been praised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic this year [2020], with cases in Africa lower than in Europe, the US, or Asia. But other deadly infectious diseases have not been as easy to contain over recent years, including Ebola, which killed more than 11 000 people in West Africa in 2013-16. Now the disease is becoming a growing threat in the Congo again, according to the International Rescue Committee.

They said: "We are alarmed that the new outbreak continues to take the lives of the people of DRC at a high rate, with more than 40 percent of the 125 people infected dying from the disease. The impact of this outbreak is compounded by the complex logistical challenges in the rural areas around Mbandaka, and a challenging situation in DRC as communities struggle to recover from years of poor health infrastructure, a previous Ebola outbreak in 2018 in the same area, and now the COVID pandemic, which has so far claimed the lives of more than 270 people in the country. With a recent Ebola case on the border with the Republic of Congo, this outbreak could spread across international borders."

Last month [August 2020], World Health Organization (WHO) director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called the outbreak a "worrying" development. He added that the WHO has around 100 staff in the Congo working with the Ministry of Health, nongovernmental agencies, and people in communities to tackle the outbreak. Dr Tedros added that USD 2.5 million has been issued in emergency response funds to support the growing crisis. He added that the outbreak was "one of the most difficult Ebola outbreaks the world has ever faced."

Dr Tedros said: "It is a matter of global health security. Whether it's COVID-19, Ebola or other high impact epidemics, we must be prepared; we need to be on high alert, and we need to respond quickly."

The WHO also warned earlier this year [2020] that Ebola could spread across borders in Africa. At the start of September 2020, Bomongo was the latest area affected by Ebola. This is located between the Ubangi and Congo rivers and was the 2nd region to be affected that borders the Republic of the Congo.

WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib warned that other countries were at risk too, especially Mbandaka, the capital of Equateur province. She said: "The population is also very highly mobile. Mbandaka, for example, is a strategic hub on the Congo River, and there is the fear and stigma surrounding the disease. As it is a trading hub, WHO is helping also to screen travellers."

Ms Chaib added that the disease could spread along the rivers in the region. She said: "This makes cross-border collaboration between the DRC and Congo more important than ever and will require coordination on disease surveillance and efforts to screen travellers,"

Back in May 2020, the WHO also warned that 190 000 people in Africa could die from coronavirus. The continent has so far recorded 1 210 251 cases, with the confirmed coronavirus death toll at 35 459.

Hospitals in many African countries say COVID-19 admission rates are falling. Rashida Ferrand, a professor working at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the Zimbabwean capital Harare, said: "Based on what we have seen so far, it is unlikely that we are going to see anything at the scale that we are seeing in Europe, both in terms of infections and mortality.

Ebola infects one more in DRC as WHO probes sexual abuse reports

In new Ebola developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), tests confirmed one more case in the Equateur province outbreak, and a media investigation says 51 women have reported incidents of sexual abuse by Ebola response workers in the country over the past 2 years.

The new case is the 1st reported since 19 Sep 2020 and involves a patient whose samples were collected at that time, but delivery of samples was delayed due to communication problems. The patient is from Lusengo health zone, marking the 1st case detected in that area. The infection raises the outbreak total to 125 cases. No new deaths were reported, keeping the total at 50.

Meanwhile, a joint investigation by The New Humanitarian and Reuters published yesterday [29 Sep 2020] and based on interviews with 51 women detailed reports of abuse by men who said they were working for international aid organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), from 2018-2020. Many of the women described a pattern of men propositioning or forcing them to have sex in exchange for jobs, which typically paid twice the region's normal wage. Others said they were terminated from their jobs when they refused.
n for Migration (IOM), which said there was a serious allegation a

In a statement, the WHO said its leadership and staff are outraged by the reports, and they said the actions of perpetrators who said they were working with the WHO are unacceptable and will be aggressively investigated.

"The betrayal of people in the communities we serve is reprehensible. We do not tolerate such behaviour in any of our staff, contractors or partners," the statement said. "Anyone identified as being involved will be held to account and face serious consequences, including immediate dismissal."

Other aid groups issued similar statements, such as the United Nations International Organization against one of its workers.

WHO to investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse in Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

The World Health Organization, leadership and staff, are outraged by recent reports of alleged sexual exploitation and abuse in the context of the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The actions allegedly perpetrated by individuals identifying themselves as working for WHO are unacceptable and will be robustly investigated.

The betrayal of people in the communities we serve is reprehensible. We do not tolerate such behaviour in any of our staff, contractors or partners.

Anyone identified as being involved will be held to account and face serious consequences, including immediate dismissal.
The Director-General has initiated a thorough review of the specific allegations, as well as broader protection issues in health emergency response settings.

WHO has a zero tolerance policy with regard to sexual exploitation and abuse.

IOM to Investigate Reports of Sexual Abuse and Exploitation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

The International Organization for Migration is gravely concerned by reports published in the media yesterday [29 Sep 2020] of sexual exploitation and abuse of women by aid workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Ebola crisis.

In light of these reports, IOM's Director General is ordering an immediate investigation by the Organization including an assessment of the serious allegation against an IOM worker.

"Such abuses by UN personnel and other humanitarian workers are an outrageous breach of trust with those we are mandated to support, often in very trying humanitarian circumstances.

IOM is determined to investigate and eradicate these shocking abuses wherever and whenever they occur, including in this particular instance. As an organization, we work constantly to improve our systems to tackle sexual exploitation and abuse, with strengthened reporting tools, staff trainings, and awareness raising across the organization. Because survivors of abuse are sometimes reluctant to come forward, we are committed to improving our reporting mechanisms to ensure confidence in the system and that survivors are fully aware that they can report such allegations without fear of retribution. IOM is fully committed to supporting the immediate and longer-term needs of survivors, including their access to legal, health and psychosocial support. The safety and protection of those whom we serve and our staff and partners are a critical priority for the organization."
