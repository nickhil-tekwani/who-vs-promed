Notes:
Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
1. A decrease in the number of cumulative cases and discrepancies in
the difference between cumulative number of cases of the last and the
current WHO update are attributed to the discarding of cases.
2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by
the national public health authorities.
3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in
which local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas
are provided on the list of Affected Areas.
4. The number of new cases reported from China includes reports
received on 28 and 29 April 2003. The report of 28 April was not
included in yesterday's update due to difficulties with information
technology.
5. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.
[B] The list of affected areas can be accessed at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_29/en/> and is unchanged
since yesterday's report.
[C] Update 42 - Travel advice for Toronto, situation in China 29 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_29/en/>
WHO Director-General Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland announced this evening
that the travel advisory for Toronto will be lifted, effective
tomorrow. Travel advisories for Beijing, Hong Kong SAR, and
Guangdong and Shanxi provinces, China, remain in effect. Travel
advisories are issued following consideration of several factors,
including the magnitude of probable SARS cases, the last dates of
cases of community transmission, and the last dates of export of
cases.
Dr Brundtland cited 3 changes in Toronto over the last week. The
magnitude of probable SARS cases has decreased. 20 days have passed
since the last cases of community transmission occurred. No new
confirmed exportation of cases has occurred. WHO has also been
assured by Canadian authorities that proactive screening measures at
airports will be implemented, as recommended by WHO.
There is no change in Toronto's status as an "affected area." Viet
Nam, which is the first country to have contained its SARS outbreak,
was removed from the list of affected areas yesterday. SARS is the
first major new infectious disease of the 21st century and is taking
full advantage of the opportunities for rapid international spread
afforded by a closely interconnected and highly mobile society. The
purpose of travel advisories is to reduce opportunities for further
international spread of what is a new, severe, and poorly understood
infectious disease.
Travel advisories are reviewed daily. Advice is issued on the basis
of a set of epidemiological criteria. The risk to international
public health, which is the principal concern for WHO, occurs when
the magnitude and dynamics of an outbreak allow an infected person to
slip past control measures and undertake international travel,
possibly seeding an outbreak elsewhere.
Situation in China
A total of 202 new probable SARS cases were reported across China
today, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 3303. 9
deaths were also reported today.
Probable SARS cases have now been reported from 21 of China's 31
provinces. An additional 4 provinces have reported suspected cases.
Beijing continues to report a high number of SARS cases, with 152 new
probable cases and 9 deaths reported today. China's capital city now
has a cumulative total of 1347 probable cases and 59 deaths.
China's largest number of cumulative cases remains concentrated in
Guangdong Province, where the SARS outbreak began in mid-November
[2002]. Only 10 percent of these cases are current. As 1201 patients
have been discharged and 51 have died, there are less than 150 SARS
cases remaining in Guangdong's health care system.
In contrast, the rapidly growing number of new cases in Beijing
imposes a heavy burden on the health care system and particularly its
hospital capacity. In Beijing, 86 percent of cases (1198 cases) are
current.
The situation in western China continues to be of concern. New
probable cases in Shanxi (23) and Inner Mongolia (7) increase the
cumulative totals to 266 and 120, respectively.
WHO is working with local health authorities in Beijing to review and
improve the data needed to better monitor the SARS situation and
assess the success of current control strategies. The WHO team of
experts also visited hospitals which will soon be opened as SARS
referral hospitals to assess their level of preparedness.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 5462 probable cases with 353
deaths have been reported from 27 countries. This represents an
increase of 226 new cases and 24 deaths when compared with yesterday.
Of the 226 new cases, 202 were reported today from China, of which
152 occurred in Beijing. Due to difficulties of information
technology, figures received from Chinese authorities yesterday were
not included in yesterday's cumulative update. The 24 deaths
occurred in Canada (2), China (9), Hong Kong SAR (12), and Singapore
(1).

breathlessness and collapsed at home. He was pronounced dead on 19
Apr 2003. A post mortem was conducted on 20 Apr 2003. Microscopic
examination of the tissues showed lung damage from a possible
infection. Tissues taken for further investigations have been
reported as being positive for coronavirus. Investigations are
underway to determine the source of his infection, and contact
tracing is in progress.

India's SARS count climbed to 10 on Tuesday [29 Apr 2003] and more
suspected cases came to light, even as the government warned against
panic and insisted the situation was under control. The government
has already declared a red alert throughout the country in view of
SARS.

[As of 29 Apr 2003 there is a cumulative total of 5462 probable cases
with 353 deaths reported to WHO. Since the last report, there have
been 429 new cases reported, of which 405 were from China and
represented 48 hours worth of reports.
In section [2] we have a breakdown of the reported cases of SARS from
China by province, probable vs suspected cases, number of cases in
health workers, number of deaths, and number of discharged cases,
current through 29 Apr 2003. The number of new probable cases
reported in the past 24 hours is 202. (to complement the report to
WHO in [1].) The provinces reporting new cases in the past 24 hours
include Beijing (152), Tianjin (1), Heibei (9) Shanxi (23), Inner
Mongolia (7), Anhui (1), Henan (1), Guangdong (4), Guangxi (1), and
Shaanxi (3). Provinces reporting 10 or more probable cases include
Beijing (1347), Tianjin (44), Hebei (39), Shanxi (266), Inner
Mongolia (120), Henan (12), Guangdong (1399), Guangxi (17), and
Sichuan (12). Other provinces with suspected cases but no probable
cases as yet include Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Chongqing, and
Xinjiang. We are grateful to Jack Soo for this information.
We await official word on the situation in India. The press has
daily reports of confirmed cases that have not as yet been reported
by the Ministry of Health to WHO. The most recent report to WHO from
India was on 21 Apr 2003. Perusing the newswire reports, one finds
more reported suspected cases in Karnataka and Kolkata that are
theoretically pending confirmation.
The newswire report [8] [B] mentions a first probable case reported
from South Korea. In ProMED-mail SARS - worldwide (73): cases
20030427.1038, there was a newswire report of a suspected case from
North Korea. The WHO reports for today include the confirmation of
the case in South Korea (Republic of Korea) and not from North Korea
(the Democratic People's Republic of Korea). Of note, there are many
newswire reports of suspected cases in countries that have not as yet
reported probable cases to WHO. On reviewing many of them, I note
that any fever in an individual with a history of travel to eastern
Asia in the month preceding their illness has been called a
"suspected" case. Some of the areas of known travel of these "cases"
have included Bangkok and Cambodia, the former with only imported
cases reported and the latter with no cases reported. We have chosen
to exercise restraint in not posting numerous newswires reporting
cases that would not meet the clinical/epidemiologic criteria for
suspected or probable cases. - Mod.MPP]
