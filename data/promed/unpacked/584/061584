An Australian research finding, reported in the current issue of New
Scientist, is that the outbreak of Newcastle disease near Sydney two months
ago resulted from the mutation of a seemingly benign strain of NDV into a
virulent strain. The report, edited, is as follows:
"An outbreak of Newcastle disease, which can devastate poultry farms, has
provided virologists in Australia with a rare glimpse of how a supposedly
benign virus can turn into a killer.
"Thanks to quarantine controls, Australia had been free of the disease for
more than sixty years. But two months ago, it broke out near Sydney.
"We had assumed it had been brought in from overseas," says Jeff
Fairbrother, executive director of the Australian Chicken Meat Federation in
Sydney. But virologists with the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL)
in Geelong, near Melbourne, have now shown that the outbreak occurred when a
supposedly benign local strain of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) mutated
into a virulent form.
"Allan Gould of the AAHL identified the virus as local by sequencing genes
from NDV taken from the dead chickens. The genes that code for two
glycoproteins carried on the surface of NDV included the code for a string
of nine amino acids found only in Australian strains of the virus.
"At the Fourth Asia Pacific Poultry Health Conference in Melbourne last
week, Gould told of when he realised a local virus had become a chicken
killer. Just as birds started dying on one farm, Gould was studying chickens
with throat lesions on a farm nearby. The sequence of the gene for one of
the glycoproteins, called the fusion protein, was identical to that in the
virulent form of NDV, except for two nucleotides.
"When the dead birds on the neighbouring farm were confirmed as victims of
Newcastle disease, Gould realised that this must have already happened.
Eventually around 10,000 chickens died, and another 100,000 were slaughtered
before the outbreak was brought under control.
"Research at AAHL has also implicated "benign" strains of NDV in a disease
that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands of chickens during the
1990s. Late respiratory syndrome had been blamed on "Escherichia coli" and
other bacteria. But in a report to appear in the "Australian Veterinary
Journal" next month, veterinary pathologist Peter Hooper shows that
bacterial infections can only get a foothold if NDV has already created
lesions in chickens' throats."

You will be aware that this information about the source of our outbreak
arising from an endemic strain was relayed to OIE in our official reports
from the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer. This was posted on PROMED as
official information and so has already been made available to all subscribers.
.... It would be unfortunate if ... people got the impression that mutated
virus was all over Australia. As per the last report to OIE, more than
27,000 swabs and sera were collected from over 100 farms, wild birds
sampled, comprehensive passive surveillance undertaken and no further
evidence has been detected. Studies (including gene sequencing) are continuing.

I have heard the same story recently via e-mail; before the conference in
Australia.
If Gould is right in his analysis, this is the first well documented case
of a low virulent NDV mutating to a high virulent form and causing an
outbreak. The previous outbreak viruses segregate in highly virulent and
lower virulent lineages.
I would like to see some more data or at least the publication before
accepting this concept. Even if this is true for the current Australian
outbreak, this may be the exception instead of the rule in NDV biology.

This is the official line from AAHL, that the virus mutated from low to high
virulence.
We have recently received the viruses and will hopefully confirm their
findings. This is not the first report of probable mutation from low to high
virulence; see:

Ireland in 1990. Veterinary Record 130, 65-68.

[During an epidemic one can pick up changes. During the 1970-72 ND epidemic
in the UK which was a virulent pneumo-encephalitic form, I remember Bill
Alan telling me in 1971 that he had reports of three neighbouring flocks in
East Anglia with severe enteric disease but subsequently it quickly reverted
back. As a caveat, there is a tendency in NDv genetics to sequence short
(e.g., 108bp). We have found that it is more revealing to sequence longer
(e.g. 389 bp) the F gene. By the way, AAHL is the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory -- their Pirbright / Plum Island / CVL. Amusingly it was
originally the Australian National Animal Health Laboratory, but ANAHL
phonetically is a bit embarrassing - Mod.MHJ
