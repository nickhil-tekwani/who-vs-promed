An unexpected increase in number of measles cases has been observed in
Poland in 2006. Between Jan and May 2006, 60 cases were reported, 43 of
which (72 per cent) were laboratory confirmed, 16 (27 per cent) clinically
diagnosed, and one case diagnosed based on an epidemiological link to a
laboratory-confirmed case. One of the 60 cases became ill in Dec 2005. In
2004, only 11 measles cases were reported (8 of which were
laboratory-confirmed) and in 2005, only 13 cases (one laboratory-confirmed).
[A figure in the text which cannot be reproduced here shows reported cases
with illness onset between 3 Oct 2005 and 28 May 2006.] During the 1st phase
of the 2006 outbreak (weeks 3-10), clusters of cases were reported in south
eastern provinces of Poland, adjacent to Ukraine and Slovakia (6 cases in
Malopolskie, 5 in Lubelskie and 4 in Podkarpackie).
Although a procedure was implemented to isolate measles virus in the late
phase of the outbreak, no strain has been isolated from incident cases in
Poland. As a consequence there is no microbiological link, and only indirect
evidence of an epidemiological link to the current Ukrainian outbreak [1].
The 1st case to be reported in Poland in 2006, in week 3, was in a 24 year
old male student who is reported to have stayed in Kyiv (Ukraine) for 11
days in January, and developed a measles rash 2 days after returning to
Krakow. This information could not be confirmed by field epidemiologists,
because the patient was lost to follow-up and was not interviewed. During
weeks 4 and 5 of 2006 (that is, within 14 days of from the 1st case's
illness onset) 2 more cases were reported in Krakow, in students aged 21-24
years. During week 7, 3 cases in people aged 14-36 years were reported.
Another presumably imported case was in a 30 year old Polish student at the
University of Lviv in western Ukraine, who returned to her home town in
Podkarpackie province on 3 Mar and became ill with measles on 11 Mar (week
10). No secondary cases were found, although 3 cases in 2 other towns in the
province were reported in weeks 11 and 12. During the 1st phase, 6 cases
were reported in the west of Poland (Wielkopolskie). The index case in the
city of Poznan, in a 19 year old student, had illness onset during week 7.
During weeks 9-10, 4 cases in people aged 26-34 years were reported.
A 2nd phase can be distinguished (weeks 11-19), during which more cases were
detected in central and western regions of Poland (8 cases in Wielkopolskie,
7 in Mazowieckie, and 4 in Dolnoslaskie). In Wielkopolskie province, the
temporal cluster in the city of Poznan continued during weeks 12-13, with
cases in 4 people aged between 11 and 29 years. In Mazowieckie province
there were 5 cases with illness onset on 5 May (week 18) in people aged
22-30 years who were living or studying in Warsaw. [In the original text 2
maps of Poland which cannot be reproduced here show the geographic
distribution of measles cases with illness onset between 16 Jan to 14 May
2006.]
Of the 60 measles cases, 29 (48 per cent) were male and 73 per cent were in
residents of urban areas. The most affected age groups were adults aged over
19 years (43 cases, 72 per cent). Only 8 of the patients had been vaccinated
with 2 doses of measles vaccine (full vaccination course in Poland). Fifteen
had been vaccinated with one dose, and the remaining 37 persons were either
unvaccinated or their vaccination status was unknown. [Vaccination status by
age group is presented as a table in the original text.] The diagnosis of
measles for all patients who had been fully vaccinated was based exclusively
on the clinical picture.
The 1st dose of monovalent measles vaccine for children aged 13-15 months
was introduced in Poland in 1975. In 2003, the monovalent vaccine was
replaced by measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. A 2nd dose of measles
vaccine at the age of 7 years was introduced in 1991. In 2005 MMR vaccine
replaced the 2nd dose of monovalent vaccine, and was given at 10 years of
age. No booster vaccination is routinely used. Immunisation coverage has
been improving since 1991.
The proportion of 3 year old children vaccinated with the 1st dose at
country level increased from 93.5 per cent in 1991 to 97.4 per cent in 2004.
The proportion of 8 year old children vaccinated with the 2nd dose at
country level increased from 46.9 per cent in 1991 to 95.6 per cent in 2003.
Immunisation coverage at regional level improved between 1991 and 2003, and
has been maintained at a consistently high level since 1998 [2]. Results
from a serologic survey in 1998 indicated that young people aged 15 to 19
years were the most susceptible to measles infection. The incidence during
an outbreak in 1998 (N=2255) confirmed these findings, and people aged 16-20
years were the group most affected by the disease [3].
As indicated previously, 2 cases were found that were presumed to have been
imported. A chain of transmission was established for 3 cases occurring in
members of the same household, but no other epidemiological links could be
found between the cases. Based on dates of illness onset, up to 3
generations of transmission within temporal clusters in Krakow and 6
generations within temporal clusters in Poznan may have occurred. Of the 60
reported cases, 37 patients (62 per cent) were admitted to hospital. As
expected, the rate of admission to hospital was higher in adults aged over
19 years (72 per cent), than in younger patients (35 per cent). Because a
high proportion of reported case patients were admitted to hospital, it is
suspected that there may be substantial underreporting of measles cases in
Poland.
Discussion
----------
The case clusters in this outbreak probably originated with 2 imported
cases, and transmission seems to be coming to an end without specific
intervention, a pattern which is typical in countries that are approaching
measles elimination. The definition of elimination of this highly
transmissible disease does not specify how many generations and how many
cases are acceptable during an import-related outbreak. Recent examples of
outbreaks in Europe indicate that pools of susceptible young adults may
maintain transmission for more than one generation of cases [4]. Many people
make frequent journeys between Ukraine and Poland for work or study, and so
importation of cases is not surprising. As measles cases were reported in 12
out of the 16 Polish provinces, the most probable scenario is that several
isolated clusters were caused by different primary cases that may or may not
have been related to the Ukrainian outbreak. It is also possible that Polish
physicians, alerted by the situation in Ukraine, were sending more samples
for diagnosis from local measles cases than usual. This hypothesis is
supported by a 3-fold increase of rubella incidence in 2006, compared to the
same period in the previous year.
However, without tracking of circulating virus genotypes, it is not possible
to confirm any of these scenarios. Based on World Health Organization
recommendations [5], an effort was made to isolate the virus from incident
cases and send strains for genotyping to Regional Reference Laboratory in
Berlin. With this system in place, effective monitoring of currently
circulating measles strains and thorough investigation of each cluster of
cases will be possible. An update will be provided when the results of
genotyping are available.

[It has been established (see reference 1 above) that measles cases from the
outbreak in Ukraine have been imported into Belarus (2 cases), the Russian
Federation (9 cases), Spain (1 case) and the United States (2 cases).
Therefore it is likely that these cases in Poland originated also from
importations from Ukraine. Measles virus of D6 genotype has been identified
from cases in Ukraine and from imported cases. These D6 viruses have 99.7
per cent sequence homology in the 450 nucleotides of the N gene based on
data received from 2 of the 3 WHO European regional measles and rubella
reference laboratories and one of the 3 WHO global specialised laboratories.
Unfortunately direct confirmation of the origin of the Polish outbreak by
genome sequence analysis will not be possible since it appears that no
viable virus was isolated from the Polish cases.
Detailed maps of the geographic distribution of the cases are available in
the text of the original article. - Mod.CP]
