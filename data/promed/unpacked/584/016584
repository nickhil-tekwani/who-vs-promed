FDA believes botched botox came from California
-----------------------------------------------
The investigation into 4 cases of botulism poisoning at a Fort Lauderdale,
Florida (FL) clinic has expanded to a 3rd state: California [2 are
hospitalized in FL, and 2 in New Jersey; all 4 acquired in FL - Mod.LL].
According to an affidavit filed in USA district court in northern
California, Food and Drug Administration investigators believe List
Biological Laboratories supplied the botulinum toxin that made 4 people
critically ill.
The company's web site
<http://www.listlabs.com/>
states that List has been manufacturing bacterial toxins for more than 25
years, including botulinum toxin. List Labs is the supplier for Toxin
Research International, an Arizona company also under investigation.
According to statements from Michael Toia, the son of the doctor who owns
Advanced Integrated Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, a vial of botulinum
toxin was ordered from List Labs and received on 23 Nov 2004, the day
before 4 people were injected with the anti-wrinkle treatment.
Toia and the injecting doctor, also a victim, disagreed about the amount of
saline solution needed to dilute the toxin, which is 200 times stronger
than actual Botox.
Allergan, the maker of FDA approved Botox, issued a statement on Mon 13 Dec
2004 saying the affidavit reveals its product played no role in the
botulism cases.

how a larger dose came to be administered. - Mod.LL]
