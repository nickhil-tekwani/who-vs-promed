Two new cases of hantavirus, a married couple, were reported yesterday in
Aisen. But the hospital in Puerto Montt discarded [discounted? the
hantavirus as a cause of 6 suspected cases recovering there; a man in
Llanda Grande (a community of Cochamo, some 100 Km to the east of Puerto
Montt) is still under observation. Meanwhile, pending are results of tests
of two men from Rio Puelo and Futaleufu who died this month. The regions
of Los Lagos and Aisen, the areas most affected, have reported a total of
20 cases of hantavirus and [including 9 fatalities since 1995.
Debate concerning control of hantavirus [infection in Chile centered on
the advisability of a massive rat control program that may have ecological
repercussions affecting predators of rats or mice as well as potentially
affecting other animals as well as children. Such campaigns have been
carried out in areas such as Aisen. Advice from the Chief of Surveillance
concerned maintaining urban areas (particularly homes) clean, and keeping
food away from rodents.
Yesterday, the Minister of Health, Alex Figueroa traveled to Washington for
a regular meeting of the executive body of the Pan-American Health
Organization where he asked formally that the PAHO formulate a regional
strategy for all of the Americas that addresses preventative measures
against hantavirus.
The minister reiterated his criticisms of fumigation of Chilean and
Argentinean transport vehicles that have been carried out in Peru and
Ecuador, indicating that "it is not possible that every country will want
to pursue such a program."
