Sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) plants with virus-like symptoms were observed
in many fields in Latina province (Lazio, Central Italy) during early spring,
2005. The percentage of diseased plants ranged from 30-60 percent, depending
on the inspected field. Initial symptoms consisted of vein clearing and leaf
chlorotic spots (Fig. 1), followed by general leaf yellowing, leaf area
reduction, plant stunting, with a significant reduction of tuber size.
Figure 1: Symptoms of vein clearing and chlorotic spots observed on the leaves
of SPFMV-infected sweet potato, grown in Central Italy [see link to article]
Observations of leaf-dip preparations by electron microscopy revealed
elongated virus particles with a modal length of about 840 nm; whereas in
ultrathin sections potyvirus type-IV cylindrical inclusions bodies (CIBs) were
observed (Fig. 2; Edwardson & Chrisitie, 1996). Extracts from symptomatic leaf
samples were tested by immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using a panel of antibodies to Sweet potato
feathery mottle virus, Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus, Sweet potato mild
mottle virus, Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus and Sweet potato chlorotic
stunt virus. A weak reaction was observed only with Sweet potato feathery
mottle virus (SPFMV) polyclonal antiserum (obtained from the International
Potato Center, Peru), in both tests. In ELISA, the mean optical density of
samples from symptomatic plants was between 2 and 3 times the values from
healthy controls.

preparation, made from a symptomatic sweet potato leaf (bar correspond to 200
nm). B. Type-4 cylindrical inclusions bodies observed in an ultrathin section
taken from the same material (48 600 times magnification). Labels: Bd=bundles;
La=short curved laminated aggregates; Pw=pinwheels; Sc=scrolls; Cw=cell wall;
N=nucleus; C=chloroplast [see link to article]
The presence of SPFMV was confirmed using RT-PCR amplification on total RNA
extracted from symptomatic leaves by using a universal Potyviridae forward
primer (5'-GG(G/C/T)AA(C/T)AA (C/T)AG(C/T)GG(A/G/T)CA(A/G)CC-3'; Gibbs &
Mackenzie, 1997) and a specific SPFMV reverse primer (5'-TTGCACACCCCTCATTCC
(C/T)AAG-3'). An amplification product of approximately 1570 bp was produced
only from samples with symptoms but not from healthy controls. The amplicon
was cloned and sequenced in both orientations (EMBL Acc. No. AM076411). BLAST
analysis of the sequenced amplicon revealed the highest percentage of identity
(94 percent) with the Sor isolate of SPFMV from Uganda (EMBL Acc. No.
AJ539129).
Further analysis of the Italian isolate (designated SPFMV-Ita1), based on both
the predicted size of the putative coat protein-encoding region (939
nucleotides) and the phylogenetic relationship between it and other SPFMV
isolates (Fig. 3), indicates that SPFMV-Ital belongs to SPFMV subgroup C
(Tairo et al., 2005).
Figure 3: Phylogenetic tree obtained from ClustalW alignments of the partial
nucleotide sequence of the coat protein genes of selected SPFMV with the
sequence of the Italian isolate (SPFMV-Ita1). Sweet potato mild mottle virus
(Acc. No. AJ783452) was used as sequence outgroup. The number at nodes
indicate bootstrap confidence values (1000 replicates); only values = 75
percent were reported. The position of SPFMV-Ita1, inside the cluster of
isolates belonging to subgroup C, is indicated by an arrow. [see link to
article]
SPFMV is the most widespread virus infecting sweet potato and possibly occurs
wherever sweet potato is grown (Brunt et al., 1996). However, to our knowledge
this is the first report of SPFMV from Italy. The percentage of diseased
plants was as high as 60 percent in some fields.

[Production of the crop plant sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) ranks 5th among
food crops in developing countries. China is the biggest producer in the world.
The most harmful diseases in sweet potatoes are caused by a complex of
viruses of which the most common is the aphid-transmitted potyvirus sweet
potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV). This is the 1st report of this pathogen
in Italy. When the whitefly-transmitted sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus
(SPCSV) is also present, it breaks down resistance to other viruses in sweet
potato cultivars, which results in the severe sweet potato virus disease
(SPVD) and high or complete yield loss. SPCSV was tested for but not found in
this Italian study, but it is known in Spain. SPFMV alone can cause severe
cracking and corking of sweet potatoes before and after harvest. When infected
roots are used to produce slips for new plantings, then plants derived from
the infected root will also be diseased. Therefore, it is extremely important
to use virus-free seed piece stock.
