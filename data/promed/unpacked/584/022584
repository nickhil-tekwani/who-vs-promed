Scrapie in Denmark
------------------
(disease never reported before in Denmark)
Information received on 10 and 11 Oct 2006 (dated 11 Oct 2006) from Dr
Preben Willeberg, chief veterinary officer, Danish Veterinary and Food
Administration, Soborg:
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country.
Date of start of the event: 20 Sep 2006.
Clinical disease: no.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Details of outbreak: In Viborg on a farm at Kjellerup a case of atypical
form of scrapie was identified on 20 Sep 2006. There were 17 susceptible
animals with only 1 case which was destroyed.
Location of the outbreak <http://www.oie.int/cartes/19_41_DNK.png>
Description of affected population: the affected animal was fallen stock
and older than 10 years.
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were performed:
1) Eurofins
Results: rapid test on 20 Sep 2006 was positive
2) Danish Institute for Food and Veterinary Research
Results: Western blot 22 Sep 2006 negative
3) VLA, Weybridge (United Kingdom)
Results: Western blot 29 Sep 2006 positive
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measure undertaken: quarantine.
Other details/comments: the positive case of scrapie has been categorized
as a case of the atypical form of scrapie. Atypical scrapie is -- in
contrast to classical scrapie -- considered to be non-infectious or at
least less infectious than classical scrapie for sheep. It is believed that
atypical scrapie is a spontaneous, age-related disease. Scrapie is not
infectious to humans. As a consequence of the finding, the index herd has
been placed under official restrictions.

[It should be noted that this case is of the atypical scrapie type which
has been identified relatively recently in several other places -- see
references below.
The results of the different tests for scrapie in different locations
highlights the importance of having multiple tests in different
laboratories when making a diagnosis. Having the complete record to review
is very valuable and should be viewed by all as example of transparency in
reporting. - Mod.PC]
