About 1000 more cases of dengue fever were reported in Cambodia during the 1st 3 months of this year [2012] than in the same period in 2011, a Ministry of Health spokesperson said yesterday [19 Apr 2012].

Chor Meng Chuor, director of the National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, said 8 people had died and 1393 were infected through to [31 Mar 2012], up from 4 deaths and 339 cases in the 1st 3 months of last year [2011].

"That's why we're distributing 270 tonnes of [insecticide] across the country," he said yesterday [19 Apr 2012] at a dengue fever awareness parade that involved about 600 school students in the capital's Sen Sok district.

Chor Meng Chuor said the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation had been preparing for an outbreak because of dengue fever's tendency to strike in one of its 4 forms about every 5 years.

In 2007, more than 400 people, mostly children, died from dengue fever in Cambodia, while authorities recorded about 40 000 infections.

"We don't want to see another year like 2007, so this campaign is very important to alert and awaken parents to this," he said. Minister of Health Mom Bun Heng said the campaign would help the community work together to prevent outbreaks. "Children must not die from this virus, because we can prevent it," he said.

Steve Bjorge, malaria and mosquito-borne disease team leader for the WHO in Phnom Penh, said the campaign would focus on distributing insecticide to 10 provinces, including Siem Reap, Preah Sihanouk, Kandal, and Phnom Penh that are at higher risk of dengue fever.

"Nothing unusual may happen, but it would be prudent to take precautions," he said, adding that dengue fever could strike anywhere but was most common in urban areas.

"Mosquitoes lay eggs on water. Water in the vicinity of a house in small containers, cups, tins, coconut shells and especially large water jars under houses ... are breeding sites for dengue mosquitoes. If you live in a house ... you should go around and check if there is any standing water in containers."

"Seven-coloured" fish could be put in water to eat larvae, he said, adding that the black and white tiger mosquito, also known as the _Aedes_ mosquito, was the only type that could transmit dengue fever.

The Post reported in late February 2012 that the Ministry of Health was preparing for an "epidemic cycle" after an "unusual increase" in mosquito larvae.

Dengue fever killed 72 people, mostly children, in Cambodia last year [2011].

[The newswire above reports an increasing trend of dengue infection in Cambodia. A total of 1393 cases and 8 deaths were reported in Cambodia during the 1st 3 months of 2012. About 1000 more cases due to dengue infection were reported in 2012 than for the same period in 2011, when a total of 339 cases and 4 deaths were reported.

According to the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office's (WPRO) report on the dengue situation, dated 3 Apr 2012, the trend of dengue activity is gradually increasing in Cambodia. A total of 684 cases and 3 deaths due to dengue infection, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.4 percent, were reported between 1 Jan 2012 and 13 Mar 2012. Relatively high activity of dengue infection was reported in 2012 compared to the historic seasonal baseline; 232 cases and one death, with a CFR of 0.4 percent in 2011 for the same time period (see http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/03_Apr_2012DengueBiWeekly.pdf).

The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. Over 2.5 billion people are now at risk from dengue. WHO currently estimates there may be 50-100 million dengue infections worldwide every year. There are 4 serotypes of the virus that cause dengue (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4). Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against that particular serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial and temporary. Subsequent infections by other serotypes increase the risk of developing severe dengue. To date, there is no vaccine to protect against dengue (see http://www.who.int/wer/2012/wer8708.pdf).

- Colombia (Hobo city and Huila department) 24 Apr 2012. Due to the increasing number of cases in Hobo, which now total 27, the mayor of the municipality, Jose Humberto Pastrana Charry, issued a 3-month decree for a dengue epidemic in the locale. The decree is due to the fact that the departmental Secretariat of Health, though its public health laboratory, confirmed 27 dengue cases in the locality, where the population was in imminent danger of spread of the epidemic. So far in 2012, the departmental Secretariat of Health reported 1994 dengue cases in Huila department [state equivalent], of which 145 are serious. Neiva has 149 ill patients, of whom 111 are in serious condition.

[This is an unusually high proportion of DHF cases of the total cases reported and suggests either significant underreporting of classical dengue fever cases or misclassification of DHF cases.

- Niue Island. 24 Apr 2012. The Niue Health Department says it believes the dengue outbreak has peaked. The department says there have been 47 recorded cases of dengue fever, but only one case has been picked up in the last 7 days.

He said that there has been a lot of rain lately, and it's hoped this won't contribute to a further spread.
