Update on the Avian Influenza situation as of 12 Mar 2004 - Issue no. 8
------------------------------------------------
a. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) confirmed: As of 12 Mar 2004,
HPAI - H5N1 has been reported in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR,
Japan, Republic of Korea, Indonesia and China. The number of countries
affected remains the same since the last issue 7 [3 Mar 2004].
1. China: China has reported HPAI in 16 provinces (49 confirmed and
3negative). No new suspected cases have been reported since 17 Feb 2004.
Lifting of isolation measures began on 22 Feb 2004 after 21 days
of isolation (Source: FAO and government website).
2. Taiwan province of China: A new outbreak was reported in the southern
Pingtung County on 01 Mar 2004, where 12 000 chickens were culled.
Migratory birds or vehicles moving between farms are suspected as the
source of infection (source: GPHIN, Yahoo news/AFP).
3. Japan: The 3rd H5N1 outbreak (Tanba, Kyoto prefecture) has spread to a
poultry farm within the same town. Crows found dead at the infected farm
and within the movement control area (Tanba town), and in Ibaraki city
(Osaka prefecture) a distance of 30 km from TanbaÃ­ tested positive to H5N1
(Tanba) and H5 (Ibaraki) respectively. (source: gphin, Japanese government
and newspaper websites).
4. Indonesia: The number of districts and municipalities infected has
increased to 80 from as reported last week. Large areas in Sumatra and
Kalimantan are suspected for the disease. Similarly, high mortality in
poultry, have been reported on some other islands such as Lombok, Sumbawa,
Flores. The death toll of chickens has been estimated at 6.2 million as of
the end of Feb 2004. This figure excludes those chickens that were culled
(source: FAO).
5. Thailand: H5N1 case was confirmed in a chicken from Chiang Rai on 26 Feb
2004, and the disease is also suspected in Nakhon Ratchasima and Maha
Sarakham. Deaths in 200 chickens were also reported in Chiang Mai on 11 Mar
2004. (source: GPHIN, FAO).
6. Viet Nam: Ban on movement and sales of poultry has been lifted in Hanoi
city. The government authorities announced that affected localities can
declare themselves free of the disease if they have no new infections for
30 days and if they meet strict disinfection and hygiene conditions.
(source: FAO, newspaper websites).
b. Under investigation / rumours and suspicions / other information:
1. Mongolia: 17 birds including 5 crows have been found dead around
Erdenetsagaan soum county of Suhbaatar aymag province, eastern Mongolia.
Under investigation (11 Mar 2004 - source: GPHIN).
2. India: The sudden death of pigeons observed in Kamakhya Hindu temple in
Guwahati, state of Assam. Further information has been requested. (26 Feb
2004 - source: gphin).

Chickens, ducks back as bird flu suppressed
-------------------------------------
Only 2 of the 49 bird flu epidemic areas have not been freed from
restrictions within the Chinese mainland.
To many poultry eaters, this news almost means the end of the month-long
"torture" they have gone through without dining on poultry.
"I've observed that Beijing has been safe since the avian influenza
outbreak. Now 2 epidemic areas left, I guess poultry should be very secure
to eat," said Wang Ying, a Beijinger fond of chicken.
Wang said she had not been ready to make dishes out of frozen chicken yet,
but last week she took a bite on a chicken burger her boyfriend bought at
KFC. "Because I really cannot resist it and I missed the taste," she explained.
KFC may soon get over the difficult period, too, since more and more of its
followers like Wang are coming back. Though KFC never admitted it, people
noticed the smaller crowds in KFC restaurants in Beijing in February 2004.
"When I took my son to KFC a couple times in February, we felt kind of glad
actually, because the restaurant seemed much less crowded than usual and we
did not need to wait for seats," said Zhu Baoxia, a news editor in Beijing.
Quanjude, famous for Peking roast duck, is also benefiting from the lift of
restrictions in epidemic areas.
"We are seeing more foreign tourists back to our restaurants recently,"
said a spokesman for Beijing Quanjude Group Co Ltd in an interview. He
confirmed that the restaurants in Beijing, usually crowded with foreign
tourists, had received calls to cancel booked dinners.
The selling of vacuum-packed Peking roast duck, a product popular with
tourists out of the municipality, also was influenced and dropped in
February 2004. "Good news is that the business is returning to normal," he
said.
In the supermarket, the retail price of chicken is bouncing back, but still
lower than before the epidemic.
"The lowest price of chicken wings per kilogram has dropped to 20 yuan (USD
2.41). Now it is 23.8 yuan (USD 2.87), but still lower than the usual 27
yuan (USD 3.25)," said Han Fang, a seller at one of the Shouhang
Supermarket chainstores.
[Hopefully, this optimistic news item is a true reflection of an improved
epizootic situation in China; official notifications of the veterinary
authorities, based upon survillance activities on the ground, are necessary
to validate the said information. - Mod.AS]

Tokyo academic says migratory birds unlikely to be avian flu carriers
-----------------------------------------------
There is growing concern that migratory birds are spreading bird flu in
Japan, after results showed that 2 wild crows were infected with the H5N1
virus. This is the same deadly strain that has affected some Asian countries.
To study the possibility, a team of Japanese researchers is now in South
Korea on a fact-finding mission.
But an avian conservationist whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to believes
migratory birds are not to be blamed.
Close to 600 species of birds, including swans, spotbill ducks and
sparrows, can be found in Japan -- both resident and migratory.
And with the current spotlight on avian flu, many are now questioning
whether it is the migratory birds that have carried and spread the virus here.
Japan's leading bird conservationist and researcher however believes there
is no major threat from these birds that pass through.
"We know that migratory birds carry avian influenza with them, particularly
ducks and waders that carry the virus from Siberia to Japan, China and
other southern Asian countries," said Professor Hiroyoshi Higuchi,
Biodiversity Science, University of Tokyo. "But the virus they carry is a
low pathogenic form."
Professor Higuchi did not rule out the possiblity of this virus mutating
into a highly pathogenic form, which could then infect chickens.
He also admitted that his research, using satellite tracking, shows that
certain migratory birds are common to the avian flu hit countries in
Southeast Asia and Japan.
They include ducks, gulls, waders, and buzzards, which he has personally
seen in Japan's bird flu hit areas of Yamaguchi, Oita, and Kyoto. But the
professor says there is no proof that such birds are the culprits.
"We can show where they go, where they come from. We can show their
migration routes but we cannot show spreading routes," said Professor Higuchi.
In fact, the professor says the damage is likely to be far worse if these
birds are the carriers of the virus. He believes it is more likely that
humans carried the virus from place to place.
Despite his conclusions, the Japanese government is taking greater efforts
to monitor migratory birds, something researchers in other countries hit by
bird flu are also doing.
The Environment Ministry, headed by a group of experts has begun collecting
samples of droppings from migratory and non-migratory birds from the area
where the second case of avia flu was reported in Japan.

[The tendency of environmentalists to refute the very possibility that
migratory birds might play a role in the spread of avian influenza might be
partly derived from their fears of possible control measures which may
deleteriously affect wildlife. These fears seem unjustified.
This important subject was included in the technical consultations during
the FAO/OIE Emergency Meeting on Avian Influenza Control in Animals in
Asia, held in Bangkok on 26-28 Feb 2004. The following relevent text is
derived from the article "Wildlife management" in the meeting's final
report, available
at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/avian_recomm.htmlcomm>:
"Massive killing of wild birds thought to be pests in the region lead to
massive famine and failed crops since the wild birds in fact were
controlling crop pests more than being crop pests. Therefore wildlife not
only warrant protection due to the aesthetic and cultural values, but also
because of the ecosystem "services" provided at very low costs by animals
and plants in the environment. As a result:
-Wild birds should not be depopulated in an attempt to control avian
influenza but separation, as much as possible should be attempted.
-Reducing contact rates between wild birds and large commercial poultry
operations to prevent wild waterfowl from direct or indirect contact
-Village poultry health care programs, including possible vaccination
programs and certainly health/husbandry education is the best approach to
1) provide entree for surveillance operations, 2) reduce disease incidence,
3) improve rural livelihoods, and 4) reduce the threat or introduction of
diseases into wild bird populations.
-Ministries of Agriculture, as well as Ministries of Natural Resources
should limit the trafficking of wild birds, and ban the mixing of domestic
and wild animals in live markets.
-Wildlife infectious disease surveillance programs, both in semi-urban
areas and in remote, rural areas may provide insights and early warning
about diseases circulating in the wild prior to livestock outbreaks.
-Investment in raising awareness and capacity building is needed to allow
more countries to begin integrating health monitoring programs as they
develop natural resource management efforts".
The Japanese surveillance of wild birds is commended; it should be valued
in light of the said remarks and recommendations. - Mod.AS]
