[Latvia is the 3rd EU Member to become infected, following Lithuania and Poland, and the 1st EU Member to report African swine fever (ASF) in both domestic animals and in wild boar.

Poland and Lithuania have only reported ASF in wild boar. See also commentaries on ProMED-mail archive number 20140531.2510490 and 20140321.2345369.

According to a media report http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/markets_and_companies/?doc=89874&ins_print: "In February 2014, the Latvian government allocated a total of EUR 1 352 949 [USD 1 842 000] from the state budget's emergency funds to the Finance Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry and the Interior Ministry for African swine fever prevention measures."

The outbreaks were located very close to the borders of Belarus and Lithuania. A map of Latvia can be seen at http://www.ephotopix.com/image/europe/latvia_political_map.gif. - Mod.CRD
