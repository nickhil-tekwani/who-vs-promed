Farmers from districts southeast of Islamabad in Punjab province said that delayed or excessive rains, coupled with heavy hailstorms, have nearly flattened their wheat and mustard crops. [For some], an estimated 70 per cent of their crop was ruined.

As unseasonable rain continues, many farmers are still waiting to harvest their crops. According to farming experts, such delays can increase the chances of attack by yellow rust, a fungal disease that hampers photosynthesis and stunts the growth of grain.

Ibrahim Mughal, Pakistan Agri Forum, estimates that unwanted rains in northern Punjab and Kyber-Pakhtunkhwa provinces have resulted in losses of up to 50 percent in wheat, mustard, and maize production. "We estimate damages of over 3 million tons to the [wheat] crop this year [2015]," said Sikandar Hayat Bosan, federal minister for National Food Security and Research.

A total area of 13 230 hectares of wheat were planted in the region of Nuevo Casas Grandes [state of Chihuahua] in 2015 with a harvest estimated at 5.7 tons per hectare which represents a good income for farmers.

Guillermo Acosta of SAGARPA [Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries & Food] announced that the expected yield will decrease to 3.5 to 4 tonnes per hectare. He said that this is due to yellow rust, a very aggressive disease if conditions are favourable and the wheat variety is susceptible.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
