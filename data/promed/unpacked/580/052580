Determination of Pest Status of _Synchytrium endobioticum_ (Potato wart
disease) in the Netherlands
------------------------------
[Contrary to an earlier ProMED PLANT Digest (v2000.n58), potato wart
disease is not common in the Netherlands. At present the pest status is
considered 'Present - only in some areas where host crop(s) are grown', in
alignment with descriptions of pest status as part of international
phytosanitary standards. Absence of the pest in areas used for the
production of seed potatoes is confirmed by survey.
Potato wart disease [originated in the Andes region in South America and
entered England in 1876. [It was first reported on the European continent
in Czechoslovakia (1888), [subsequently spreading over the entire
continent. [The disease was first found in the Netherlands around 1914,
and gradually spread in potato-growing regions until the Second World War.
In the early 1950s, the disease [had become such a problem that in the
north-eastern part [of the country, potato cultivars susceptible to
pathotype I were forbidden. Further phytosanitary measures [contained the
disease until 1973 but by 1991 pathotypes I and II were again detected in
parts of the country.
Results of intensive surveys [showed that potato wart occurs in 2 areas
used for the cultivation of [ware/table potatoes. [Pathotype 2 only
occured in the northeastern region (24 fields) and [pathotype 1 only in the
southeast (32 fields). Seed potato production is not permitted in these
areas. Strict phytosanitary measures are being applied to prevent further
spread and [to eradicate infestations.

[My thanks to ir. Bram de Hoop for correcting a false impression. It is
reassuring to know that the disease is confined to known areas of the
Netherlands, and that surveillance against spread continues. - Mod.DH
