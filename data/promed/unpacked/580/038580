Florida Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Charles
Bronson says the department's Division of Animal Industry is
continuing the investigation into the presence of Equine Herpesvirus
- type 1 (EHV-1) in several areas of the state including Wellington,
Jupiter and the Ocala area. EHV-1 can be a serious disease of horses
and the virus can spread through the air from the respiratory route
of affected horses.
Transmission can also occur through contaminated equipment, clothing
and hands. So far, 7 horses have tested positive for the virus
through lab tests. All confirmed cases are under quarantine.
Here is a chronology of events:
Five horses imported from Europe were brought to Florida from the New
York animal import station, a quarantine station for imported horses;
3 more horses were picked up en route in Huntington, N.Y. and 1 in
Darlington, Maryland. When the truck arrived on 29 Nov 2006 in
Wellington, Florida, one of the horses from the import station was
ill. That horse is now recovering but 2 horses that were stabled with
the index horse at the original facility became ill and died. A lab
test on one of those horses confirmed EHV-1. The facility, J N and
Company is currently under state quarantine and the horses are being
closely monitored. No horses are allowed to enter or leave the
premises.
The Maryland horse had been transported to another Wellington
location, Southfields Training facility, and died on 2 Dec. While no
lab test was done, because of its exposure to the disease, the
Southfields facility voluntarily restricted all movement of horses.
Late today, a lab test confirmed a positive case within that facility
at the Palm Beach Equine Sports Complex, which is part of the
Southfields Training facility. There is a 2nd suspect case there
awaiting lab test confirmation. The Department is also placing this
facility under quarantine.
A horse that was exposed to the virus during the shipment into
Florida was treated at the Palm Beach Equine Clinic and is believed
to have been a possible link to the horse in Ocala, which was at the
clinic at the same time. The Ocala horse has tested positive for
EHV-1 and was transported to Ocala on 11 Dec. The horse was ill when
it arrived and was immediately isolated from all other horses at the
Ocala location, Tuxedo Farms. The horse continues to be isolated and
a portion of that facility is also under quarantine.
The Palm Beach Equine Clinic indicated it is contacting the owners of
all horses that were there at the same time as the index horse to
make them aware of the situation and find out if any of the horses
are exhibiting any signs of EHV-1. So far the department has received
no reports of any other horses that were at the clinic showing
disease signs.
A horse at Pinehurst Stables, in Jupiter, Florida has also been
reported with neurological symptoms of the disease and a sample has
been submitted for a lab test.
The Division of Animal Industry is working closely with veterinarians
and equine facilities in the impacted locations to monitor the
animals and assist with testing.
Owners with sick horses should contact their private veterinarian to
examine and treat their horses. Veterinarians suspecting EHV-1 with
neurological signs are advised to contact state officials and follow
protocols for collecting and submitting appropriate samples for
laboratory diagnosis.
Horse owners in the impacted areas are being asked to follow
biosecurity measures until the virus is controlled. The measures are:
- Have temperatures taken a minimum of twice daily, with a
temperature log being maintained on each horse. Horses with
fevers >101.9 or >1 degree above their normal temperature should be
reported to the stable's veterinarian. The horse should be isolated
and EHV-1 samples should be taken by the stable veterinarian.
- Limiting admittance of people into the barn area to only necessary
personnel. When entering or exiting a stable or barn use foot baths
to disinfecting outer foot wear and wash hands.
- Washing hands with soap and water or using a dry disinfectant after
handling each horse.
- Minimizing the use of shared equipment. Equipment such as water
buckets, lead ropes, grooming equipment, etc. should not be shared
between horses. These items should be labeled as belonging to an
individual horse. Other equipment such as twitches, shovels, forks
and bits should be disinfected daily and between each use.
- Care should be taken when filling water buckets and feed troughs.
Neither the hose nor the feed scoop should have contact with an
individual horse's bucket or trough.
- Multi-dose oral medications should not be shared between horses.
- Any additional biosecurity precautions the stable veterinarian or
stable manager recommends.

[This disease has a rather long incubation period. Recommendations
are generally a 30-day quarantine, but the virus can survive under
proper environmental conditions for as long as 42 days on an
appropriate vector, such as horse hair.
Clinical signs more typically become apparent when the animal is
stressed, such as by travel.
It is certainly a sad turn of events to have so many horses exposed. - Mod.TG]
