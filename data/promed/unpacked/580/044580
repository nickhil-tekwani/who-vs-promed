Dozens of children were poisoned by contamination in the "Chilean Chernobyl". The episode, which affected some 50 students and 25 educational officials of the commune this Tuesday [7 Jun 2022], led the minister of the environment, Maisa Rojas, to lead emergency meetings with various authorities, as well as to promise to take provisional measures to reduce emissions from the Codelco copper smelter, located near the bay, and the Ventanas thermoelectric company, owned by AES Andes.

The Chilean towns of Quintero and Puchuncaví, also called "the Chilean Chernobyl" by the environmental organization Greenpeace, are home to mining, oil, cement, gas and chemical companies.

On Monday [6 Jun 2022], "we had a peak of sulfur dioxide exceeding 5 times the hourly norm at 02:00 in the morning. Quintero and Puchuncaví are communes (municipalities) having tolerated this for decades, but they have to come to an end," said Rubén Gutiérrez, mayor of the town of Quintero, with more than 31 000 inhabitants located in the Valparaíso region 120 km (~75 mi) west of Santiago, on Tuesday [7 Jun 2022].

"We had a general affectation of municipal and subsidized schools, where more than 50 children and more than 25 education assistants were affected by the effects of toxic gases," said a note from the municipality of Quintero. Health authorities in the Valparaíso region reported all cases presented symptoms associated with headache, itchy eyes and throat, as well as nausea. They were kept under observation and later released.

The presidential delegate of Valparaíso, Sofía González, decreed an environmental emergency in these 2 towns, where classes were suspended and all physical activity and heating sources were prohibited, at a time when the central zone faces a southern autumn of extremely low temperatures.

The Superintendency of the Environment (SMA) confirmed at the Quintero Air Quality Station, a sulfur dioxide peak of 1327 mcg/m3 was recorded on Monday [6 Jun 2022], 5 times higher than the norm. The [analyses] indicate the concentration of sulfur dioxide generated the intoxications which would have come from the Ventanas smelter dedicated to the processing of copper concentrates from the state mining company Codelco, the largest copper producer in the world. "Responsibilities must be investigated because polluting cannot be free and mortgaging the lives of children cannot be free either," said the governor of Valparaíso, Rodrigo Mundaca, a well-known environmentalist.

The SMA ordered Codelco provisional mitigation measures, such as changing operations "in case of bad and regular ventilation conditions" and installing "a new temperature sensor" within 5 days. The AES Andes thermoelectric plant, a subsidiary of the American AES Corporation, was also ordered to take measures, such as operating "in the limit condition of the desulfurizers on environmental alert".

"The measures are based on the increase in the concentrations of sulfur dioxide, which has meant a risk to the health of the population," said Emanuel Ibarra, superintendent of the environment. After a meeting with local authorities and industry representatives, environment minister Maisa Rojas reported "the preventive principle will be applied to the maximum" and progress will be made "in structural solutions. We need to establish short-term measures to be able to face this (austral) winter," she added.

For his part, Máximo Pacheco, president of Codelco's board of directors, affirmed in the state company -- which produces about 8% of the world's copper -- "we are proactively committed to reviewing the operational plan and implementing the necessary measures to avoid the impact on health and the environment."

Pollution has grown in the area since the Chilean government decided in 1958 to relegate artisanal fishing and agriculture to turn this place into an industrial hub which today houses 4 coal-fired thermoelectric plants, crude oil refineries, copper smelters, cement factories, bulk ports, oil tankers and mining concentrate deposits.

Until the middle of the 20th century, this place was a popular spa, abundant fishing cove and a fertile orchard, with production of peas, beans and lentils, [but] was declared by the Chilean State in 1993 as a "pollution saturated zone" by sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. The more than 50 000 inhabitants of both towns breathe gases on a daily basis emitted by some 15 polluting sources.

Similar massive environmental pollution events also took place between August and September 2018, forcing the paralysis of industrial activity and the suspension of school classes for weeks. Then, some 600 people from Quintero and Puchuncaví went to medical centers with an atypical clinical picture such as vomiting blood, headaches, dizziness, paralysis of the limbs, as well as strange welts on the skin which children suffered in particular.

And there is still the fear of new diseases from long-term exposure to chemicals, as well as cognitive damage, according to studies from various institutions.

In April 20219 [sic; I do not know if 2021 or 2019 is meant. - Mod.TG], the Chilean government launched a decontamination plan in the area with the aim of reducing emissions permitted to companies by up to 91% in 5 years.

[This is a terrible situation, and clearly not the first occurrence in this area. Turning a pleasant village into what appears to be a chemical manufacturing and dumping ground cannot be good for the residents or the environment.

From the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/sulfurdioxide/default.html): "Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) is a colorless gas with a characteristic, irritating, pungent odor. Exposure to sulfur dioxide may cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat. Symptoms include nasal mucus, choking, cough, and reflex bronchi constriction, and when liquid, frostbite. Workers may be harmed from exposure to sulfur dioxide. The level of exposure depends upon the dose, duration, and work being done.

"Sulfur dioxide is used in many industries. It's used to manufacture sulfuric acid, paper, and food preservatives. Some examples of workers at risk of being exposed to sulfur dioxide include the following:
- Factory workers in industries where it occurs as a by-product, such as copper smelting or power plants
- Industry workers that manufacture sulfuric acid
- Workers in plants that produce paper
- Food processing to preserve foods, such as dry fruits
- Workers who manufacture fertilizers."

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Routes of exposure
------------------
"Inhalation: Inhalation is the major route of exposure to sulfur dioxide. The odor threshold is 5 times lower than the OSHA PEL (5 ppm). Most exposures are due to air pollution, and this has both short-term and chronic health consequences for people with lung disease. Inhaled sulfur dioxide readily reacts with the moisture of mucous membranes to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3), which is a severe irritant. People with asthma can experience increased airway resistance with sulfur dioxide concentrations of less than 0.1 ppm when exercising. Healthy adults experience increased airway resistance at 5 ppm, sneezing and coughing at 10 ppm, and bronchospasm at 20 ppm. Respiratory protection is required for exposures at or above 20 ppm. Exposures of 50 to 100 ppm may be tolerated for more than 30 to 60 minutes, but higher or longer exposures can cause death from airway obstruction. Sulfur dioxide is heavier than air; thus, exposure in poorly ventilated, enclosed, or low-lying areas can result in asphyxiation.

"Children exposed to the same levels of sulfur dioxide as adults may receive a larger dose because they have greater lung surface area:body weight ratios and increased minute volumes:weight ratios. In addition, they may be exposed to higher levels than adults in the same location because of their short stature and the higher levels of sulfur dioxide found nearer to the ground and because they are slow to leave the site of an exposure.

"Skin/eye contact: Exposures of 10 to 20 ppm cause irritation to mucous membranes. Direct contact with escaping compressed gas or liquid sulfur dioxide can produce severe corneal damage and frostbite injury to the skin. No data were located regarding dermal absorption.

"Ingestion: Ingestion of sulfur dioxide is unlikely because it is a gas at room temperature. Sulfur dioxide is used in small amounts as a food and wine preservative. Highly sensitive asthmatic individuals can develop bronchospasm after eating foods or drinking wine preserved with sulfur dioxide or other sulfur preservatives.

Sources/uses
------------
"Sulfur dioxide gas is released primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels (75% to 85% of the industrial sources), the smelting of sulfide ores, volcanic emissions, and several other natural sources. It is a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority air pollutant, but has many industrial and agricultural uses. It is sometimes added as a warning marker and fire retardant to liquid grain fumigants. Approximately 300 000 tons are used each year to manufacture hydrosulfites and other sulfur-containing chemicals (40%); to bleach wood pulp and paper (20%); to process, disinfect, and bleach food (16%); for waste and water treatment (10%); in metal and ore refining (6%); and in oil refining (4%). Toxic amounts of sulfur dioxide can be released from the preservative chemical metabisulfite in the presence of water and acid.

Standards and guidelines
------------------------
- OSHA PEL (permissible exposure limit) = 5 ppm (averaged over an 8-hour workshift)
- NIOSH IDLH (immediately dangerous to life or health) = 100 ppm
- AIHA ERPG-2 (maximum airborne concentration below which it is believed that nearly all persons could be exposed for up to one hour without experiencing or developing irreversible or other serious health effects or symptoms that could impair their abilities to take protective action) = 3 ppm

Physical properties
-------------------
- Description: colorless gas at room temperature, colorless liquid when pressurized or cooled.
- Warning properties: pungent odor is usually adequate to warn of acute exposure. Most people can detect sulfur dioxide at levels of 1 to 3 ppm (1 ppm is equivalent to 2.62 mg/m3).
- Molecular weight: 64.06 daltons
- Boiling point (760 mm Hg): 14.0°F (-10.0°C)
- Freezing point: -99.4°F (-72.7°C)
- Vapor pressure: 2538 mm Hg at 70.0EF (21.1°C)
- Vapor density: 1.43 g/mL (water = 1.00)
- Water solubility: soluble in water (11.3 g/100 mL at 68°F [20°C])
- Flammability: nonflammable

Incompatibilities
-----------------
"Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water or steam to form sulfurous acid. Liquid sulfur dioxide corrodes iron, brass, copper, and some forms of plastic and rubber. Many metals, including zinc, aluminum, cesium, and iron, incandesce and/or ignite in unheated sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide reacts explosively when it comes in contact with sodium hydride. Sulfur dioxide ignites when it is mixed with lithium acetylene carbide diamino or lithium acetylide ammonia.

Health effects
--------------
- Sulfur dioxide is severely irritating to the eyes, mucous membranes, skin, and respiratory tract. Bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, and acute airway obstruction can occur.
- Inhalation exposure to very low concentrations of sulfur dioxide can aggravate chronic pulmonary diseases, such as asthma and emphysema. Certain highly sensitive asthmatics may develop bronchospasm when exposed to sulfur dioxide or sulfite-preserved foods.
- Sulfur dioxide reacts with water in the upper airway to form hydrogen, bisulfite, and sulfite, all of which induce irritation. As a result, reflex bronchoconstriction increases airway resistance.

Acute exposure
--------------
"Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the moisture on skin, eyes, and mucous membranes to form sulfurous acid, an irritant and inhibitor of mucociliary transport. Most of the inhaled sulfur dioxide is detoxified by the liver to sulfates and excreted in the urine. The bisulfite ion produced when sulfur dioxide reacts with water is likely to be the main initiator of sulphur dioxide-induced bronchoconstriction.

"Children do not always respond to chemicals in the same way that adults do. Different protocols for managing their care may be needed.

"Respiratory: Sulfur dioxide respiratory irritation induces symptoms such as sneezing, sore throat, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and a feeling of suffocation. Reflex laryngeal spasm and edema can cause acute airway obstruction. Bronchospasm, pneumonitis, and pulmonary edema can occur.

"Some individuals are very susceptible to the presence of sulfur dioxide and overreact to concentrations which, in most people, elicit a much milder response. This hyperreactive response occurs the 1st time the individual is exposed and is therefore not an acquired immune or 'hypersensitivity' response.

"Acclimatization (a physiological adjustment of the individual to environmental changes) may also occur in up to 80% of exposed individuals. This is not necessarily beneficial although exposure may become less subjectively objectionable upon continuous or repeated exposure.

"Asthmatics who are sensitive to sulfites in food can develop bronchospasm or an anaphylactoid reaction. Sulfur dioxide, along with other components of air pollution, can exacerbate chronic cardiopulmonary disease.

"Exposure to high concentrations of sulfur dioxide can lead to Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma.

"Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because of the relatively smaller diameter of their airways. Children also may be more vulnerable because of relatively increased minute ventilation per kg and failure to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.

"Dermal: Sulfur dioxide is a severe skin irritant causing stinging pain, redness, and blisters, especially on mucous membranes. Skin contact with escaping compressed gas or liquid sulfur dioxide can cause frostbite and irritation injury.

"Because of their relatively larger surface area: body weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants that affect the skin.

"Ocular: Conjunctivitis and corneal burns can result from the irritant effect of sulfur dioxide vapor or escaping compressed gas, and from direct exposure to the liquid.

"Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain have been reported after inhalation exposure to moderate to high doses of sulfur dioxide.

"Potential sequelae: High-level acute exposures have resulted in pulmonary fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and chemical bronchopneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans. Bronchospasm can be triggered in individuals who have underlying lung disease, especially those who have asthma and emphysema. Rarely, new onset airway hyperreactivity, known as reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS), develops in patients without prior bronchospasm.

Chronic exposure
----------------
"Chronic exposure can result in an altered sense of smell (including increased tolerance to low levels of sulfur dioxide), increased susceptibility to respiratory infections, symptoms of chronic bronchitis, and accelerated decline in pulmonary function. Chronic exposure may be more serious for children because of their potential longer life span.

Carcinogenicity
---------------
"The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) assigned sulfur dioxide to Group 3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans.

Reproductive and developmental effects
--------------------------------------
"Sulfur dioxide is not included in Reproductive and Developmental Toxicants, a 1991 report published by the US General Accounting Office (GAO) that lists 30 chemicals of concern because of widely acknowledged reproductive and developmental consequences. There are no known reproductive or developmental effects of sulfur dioxide alone by any route of exposure. There is no conclusive evidence that sulfur dioxide is a genotoxin in humans." - Mod.TG

This resource continues with details of prehospital management, decontamination, transfer to and treatment in hospital.

The report above describes a "sulfur dioxide peak of 1327 mcg/m3", -- that is, 1.327 mg/m3. From the data above (1 ppm is equivalent to 2.62 mg/m3), this would appear to be equivalent to 0.5 ppm, which seems fairly low in comparison with concentrations described in this discussion. Corroboration of the concentration reported would be helpful. - Mod.SH
