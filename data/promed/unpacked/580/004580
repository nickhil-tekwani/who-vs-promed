MOH: 4 new cases of [MERS-CoV infection] in Jeddah
--------------------------------------------------
Within the framework of the constant monitoring and epidemic surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 4 new cases have been recorded in Jeddah.

The 1st case is a 26-year-old female citizen who has no symptoms.

The 2nd case is a 58-year-old male citizen working in the health sector whose condition is stable.

The 3rd case is a 71-year-old male citizen whose condition is stable.

The 4th case is a 39-year-old male resident working in the health sector who has no symptoms.

It is worth mentioning that 200 samples have been examined during the past period. All were negative except for those mentioned above.

Upon the recorded cases so far, the death rates have decreased from 42 percent to 35.9 percent. The global death rate hits 38 percent..
[Based on the total number of [laboratory confirmed] cases recorded so far, the mortality rate has dropped from 42 percent to 35.9 percent in Saudi Arabia (189 cases including 68 deaths), and it should be noted that the proportion of deaths worldwide is now 38 percent. [In the last official global tally provided by WHO on 11 Apr 2014, there have been a total of 212 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 88 deaths representing a case fatality rate of 41.5 percent. This tally does not include the majority of the reported infections in Jeddah, or the recently reported infections in the UAE, many of whom were reported to have been asymptomatic, which will impact on the globally reported case fatality rate for MERS-CoV infection. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the Saudi MOH website, there have been a total of 189 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia including 68 deaths, representing a case fatality rate of 36 percent.

In the ProMED-mail post on 10 Apr 2014, there was a newswire stating that there were a total of 21 cases of MERS-CoV identified in Jeddah during this current identified presumed nosocomial outbreak (see ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (27): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO, screening 20140410.2395733). As of yesterday, 12 Apr 2014, there have been a total of 23 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Jeddah reported on the Saudi MOH website since 27 Mar 2014. Of these 23 laboratory confirmed infections, 3 have died, 4 were reported to be in intensive care (with presumably serious illness), 5 are reported as in "stable" condition, 11 were reported asymptomatic (presumably known contacts identified through contact screening), Of these 23 cases, 7 have been identified as working in the health sector.

On 6 Apr 2014 there is mention that 356 samples were tested for MERS-CoV infection in the previous week, on 10 Apr 2014 there is mention that an additional 200 samples were tested since the last period mentioned, and in the above report dated 12 Apr 2014 there is mention that 200 samples were tested "in the last period" (unclear if this refers to the same 200 samples mentioned on 10 Apr 2014, or an additional 200 samples were tested in the 2 day period. Hence, either 556 or 756 samples taken from clinically ill individuals and known contacts of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV have been tested for MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah since the identification of the outbreak in early April 2014.

We await further information on the results of epidemiologic investigations surrounding this outbreak in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

[2] Yemen: 1st reported case, media report

A foreigner has died from the deadly MERS coronavirus in Saudi Arabia, while Yemen has reported its 1st case of the disease.

The foreign man, whose nationality has not been disclosed, died from the coronavirus as 8 others in the kingdom, including 5 health workers in the city of Jeddah, were infected.

The death brings the nationwide toll in the world's most-affected country to 68, with 189 people infected.

The Saudi health ministry, which announced the death, said 5 health workers -- 2 women and 3 men -- and 3 other people had been infected by MERS-CoV in Jeddah.

The announcement came days after panic over the spread of the virus among medical staff led to the closure of the emergency room at the city's main public hospital.

Saudi health minister Abdullah al-Rabiah visited hospitals in Jeddah on Saturday [12 Apr 2014] in a bid to calm residents.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Yemen, a Yemeni man became the 1st victim of the disease, which had 1st appeared in Saudi Arabia in September 2012.

"Medical personnel have recorded one case of the coronavirus in Sanaa and the victim is a Yemeni man who works as an aeronautics engineer," the semi-official al-Thawra newspaper quoted Public Health Minister Ahmed al-Ansi as saying.

"The ministry is working in effective cooperation with the World Health Organisation to confront this virus and is in direct and constant communication with all hospitals to receive information on any other suspected cases," Ansi said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Friday [11 Apr 2014] said that it had been told of 212 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection worldwide, of which 88 were fatal.

MERS-CoV is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected 8273 people, 9 percent of whom died.

Experts are still struggling to understand MERS, for which there is no known vaccine.

A study has said the virus has been "extraordinarily common" in camels for at least 20 years, and may have been passed directly from the animals to humans.

The UAE news agency WAM said on Friday [11 Apr 2014] an expatriate health worker had died from the virus and 5 others had been infected in the Gulf state. This followed Saudi reports last week of 2 deaths and 9 other cases of infection in the kingdom, including among hospital staff.

[3] Yemen: 1st reported case, media report

Yemen reported its 1st case of the deadly MERS coronavirus on Sunday [13 Mar 2014] in a further spread of the deadly strain in the Middle East 2 years after its outbreak in neighboring Saudi Arabia.

"Medical personnel have recorded one case of the coronavirus in Sanaa and the victim is a Yemeni man who works as an aeronautics engineer," the semi-official al-Thawra newspaper quoted Public Health Minister Ahmed al-Ansi as saying.

"The ministry is working in effective cooperation with the World Health Organisation to confront this virus and is in direct and constant communication with all hospitals to receive information on any other suspected cases," Ansi said.

MERS, which emerged in the Middle East in 2012, is from the same family as the SARS virus and can cause coughing, fever and pneumonia.

Although the worldwide number of MERS infections is fairly small, the more than 40 percent death rate among confirmed cases and the spread of the virus beyond the Middle East is keeping scientists and public health officials on alert [in the last official global tally provided by WHO on 11 Apr 2014, there have been a total of 212 cases including 88 deaths representing a case fatality rate of 41.5 percent. - Mod.MPP]

Cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, and Tunisia as well as in several countries in Europe. Scientists are increasingly focused on a link between human infections and camels as a possible "animal reservoir" of the virus.

The UAE news agency WAM said on Friday [11 Apr 2014] an expatriate health worker had died from the virus and 5 others had been infected in the Gulf state. This followed Saudi reports last week of 2 deaths and 9 other cases of infection in the kingdom, including among hospital staff.

[According to the media reports, Yemen has identified a case of MERS-CoV infection in a male Yemeni (age not mentioned) who works as an aeronautical engineer. No further information on possible risk exposures such as travel to a known area of MERS-CoV transmission, or contact with known MERS-CoV infected individual, or possible exposure to camels (postulated to be a potential source of MERS-CoV transmission to humans with a growing body of scientific circumstantial evidence pointing in that direction). More information on this case would be greatly appreciated.

Two separate media reports announcing the 1st reported case of MERS-CoV case in Yemen were included by this moderator as an example of how difficult it is and has been to maintain accurate up-to-date global tallies of MERS-CoV cases using a variety of sources. This moderator has developed a line listing of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases, trying to reconcile the various reports available and is still very challenged in coming forth with up to date tallies of the global situation.

Yemen borders with Saudi Arabia to its north. For a map showing the location of Yemen, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2401723,38513. - Mod.MPP]

Al Ain's Filipino community is mourning one of its members, a 45-year-old male, who died last Thursday [10 Apr 2014] after contracting MERS-coronavirus.

Ronnie Balilo, president of the non-profit Filipino Association for Computer Excellence (Face), said the unexpected death of this paramedic, was a "big loss" to the Filipino community in Al Ain, where he had served as a volunteer trainer with Face for many years. "He selflessly shared his time and knowledge," Mr Balilo said. "He was very helpful and truly had a golden heart."

[He] worked for Al Ain Rescue and Ambulance Section, part of the Ministry of Interior. 5 paramedics are currently battling the virus. [It is unclear if the other 5 paramedics were asymptomatic or symptomatic.]

Mr Balilo said his compatriot went from healthy to ill in a short space of time. "I was told that [he] was very joyful and even performed at the graduation," said Mr Balilo, referring to a ceremony organised by Face, on [4 Apr 2014], at the Rotana Hotel in Al Ain. "The function was held at 7 pm and ended at midnight. The next day, he suffered from respiratory symptoms."

Taken to Al Ain Hospital less than 2 days later, on Sunday [6 Apr 2014], the paramedic was told he had bronchitis, Mr Balilo said.

Later that evening, pneumonia was diagnosed, and by the following morning, [his] kidneys had started to fail. MERS was diagnosed on [8 Apr 2014].

"He was declared clinically dead on Tuesday [8 Apr 2014]," Mr Balilo said. "He was pronounced dead officially early Thursday morning [10 Apr 2014]."

[A friend] who works at a private school in Al Ain and had known the victim since 2010, said [he] had not been his usual self at a friend's birthday party on [3 Apr 2014].

"His face was pale and he was unusually quiet that evening," she said. "But, he still attended the graduation ceremony the next day. He's really nice and was like a big brother to me. I can't believe he's gone."

[An engineer in Al Ain, said the 5 paramedics have been kept in quarantine. 4 were admitted to Al Ain Hospital, while one man, from Abu Dhabi, is being treated at Mafraq Hospital. "They are doing well but I'm sad to have lost a friend," [he said].

Face will offer financial assistance to the paramedic's family in Palompon, Leyte, one of areas in the Philippines worst hit by Typhoon Haiyan last year [2013].

Of the 5000 active members of the group, about 1000 are based in Al Ain. Of those, 100 are regular volunteers.

"[He] once served as our Al Ain coordinator about 2 or 3 years ago," Mr Balilo said. "He will really be missed. We are honoured and grateful to have known him as a friend and a dedicated volunteer."
