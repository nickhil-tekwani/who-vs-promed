Africa traveller has Lassa fever
--------------------------------
A patient is being treated in hospital for Lassa fever, which can
cause deafness [among other things], a health watchdog said. The
patient travelled in Nigeria before returning to the United Kingdom
(UK) and is now being treated at the high security infectious
diseases unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London. The Health
Protection Agency (HPA) said the patient, whose gender is not being
disclosed, represented an isolated case and there was no risk to the
general public.

Lassa fever is caused by Lassa virus and is endemic in Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and the Central African Republic.
Hundreds of thousands of people are infected in these countries each
year and isolated cases have been seen in Europe and the US [imported
from Africa - Mod.CP]. Infection also occurs in other African
countries including Mali, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Around 8 in 10 people infected with Lassa virus develop mild or no
symptoms, but in 20 percent of cases people will have severe illness.
Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, a cough, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea and muscle pain. Around 2 percent of all patients
die from the illness and death rates are particularly high in women
in the final months of pregnancy. A common complication of Lassa
fever is deafness.

[Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks
duration that occurs in West Africa. Though 1st described in the
1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969.
The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus
family _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea
(Conakry), Liberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria, but probably
in other West African countries as well.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become
infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir of
Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as
the "multimammate rat." Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not
become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces).

Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women.
Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where
Mastomys are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or
crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper
barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained.

Family members and health care workers should always be careful to
avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick
persons. Routine barrier nursing precautions probably protect against
transmission of Lassa virus in most circumstances. However, for added
safety, patients suspected to have Lassa fever should be cared for
under specific "isolation precautions," which include the wearing of
protective clothing such as masks, gloves, gowns, and face shields,
and the systematic sterilization of contaminated equipment. The
antiviral drug ribavirin is effective treatment for Lassa fever if
given early on in the course of clinical illness.
