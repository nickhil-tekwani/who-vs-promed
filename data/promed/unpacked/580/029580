Parasite becoming resistant, falciparum malaria increasing
---------------------------------------------
The malaria parasite is increasingly becoming resistant to chloroquine, and
incidence of deadly falciparum is on the rise in the country, suggesting a
reappraisal of the treatment approach, so that a combination of drugs is
used rather than only chloroquine, scientists said here.
A study at the Indian Institute of Science in which 73 samples were
analysed showed that 95 percent of malaria cases were resistant to
chloroquine, Dr G Padmanabhan, Hony Professor at the Indian Institute of
Science told a plenary lecture on "Scientific Challenges in Combating
Malaria". He said similar results were obtained from a study at the All
India Institute of Medical Sciences, in which 90 percent of malaria cases
were found to be infected by the chloroquine-resistant parasite, he said.
About 200 samples had been analysed for this study. It shows that
resistance was spreading fast, he said adding the resistance had been
attributed to a mutation in the parasite. Besides, in India the share of
deadly falciparum malaria, which infects the brain and causes high
mortality, is growing. While the ratio of "vivax" malaria, which is usually
easily treated with drugs, and "falciparum" malaria used to be 85/15, the
share of "falciparum" malaria has now gone up to almost to half, he said.
In some tribal areas in Madhya Pradesh, falciparum malaria is contributing
to 75-90 percent of malaria cases, he said.

[The article probably refers to a study conducted by a group of scientists
from the Indian Institute of Science and recently published in the American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene [Vathsala et al. et al. Am. J.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004,70(3):256-9]. The study found that 70 out of 73 _P.
falciparum_ malaria samples (95 percent) had the K76T mutation in the Pfcrt
gene, which is a strong marker of chloroquine resistance. The results
should be seen in the context of unconfirmed anecdotes over the past few
years that chloroquine and proguanil are no longer effective as prophylaxis
in India. If up to 95 percent of _P. falciparum_ in India has this
mutation; chloroquine and proguanil should probably be phased out as
malaria prophylaxis in India. - Mod.EP]
