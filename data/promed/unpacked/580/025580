Health officials reported 3 confirmed epizootic yellow fever cases, resulting in the deaths of 3 monkeys. This took place in the municipality of Coronel Domingos Soares, in the southwest region of Parana state.

Since the beginning of the current monitoring period in July [2020], no human case of the disease in Parana has been confirmed. However, the mortality of monkeys indicates the circulation of wild yellow fever virus in the respective region.

"Monkeys are our sentinels and indicate the path that the virus can take, and given this information, we can anticipate measures to avoid urban yellow fever," explains Secretary of Health Beto Preto.

[Finding 3 monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern, based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Since it is nearly the December-May period, one wonders whether a new period of transmission is beginning. No mention is made of the proportion of the area's human population that has been vaccinated against yellow fever, or whether a vaccination effort in the area is planned. - Mod.TY
