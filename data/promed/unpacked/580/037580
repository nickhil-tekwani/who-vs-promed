At least 12 people have died from cholera in the Kenyan port city of
Mombasa and tourist resort of Malindi, the medical officer for the coastal
region said Wednesday. S.K. Shariff said the cholera outbreak, reported to
have started at Kwa Jiwa slums in Malindi on October 31, 1997 had caused
the deaths of seven people in Malindi and five in Mombasa, both on the
Indian Ocean coast. Some 17 cases have been admitted at Mombasa's general
hospital and 12 others admitted at Malindi's municipal clinic, Shariff
said. He said he had received results of tests on some of the patients
that confirmed that they were suffering from cholera and other related
diseases. "We will contain the situation and there is no need for panic,
as hospitals on the coast are fully equipped to deal with emergency
situations," Shariff said, appealing to the public to observe strict
hygiene and boil all drinking water. Scores of people have died from
cholera in Kenya this year, first during a long drought and recently due to
flooding caused by heavy rains.

[We have yet to receive information about the strain(s) of cholera bacillus
that are circulating in East Africa in response to our RFI (cited above).
I suppose there isn't much specific bacteriologic diagnosis that goes on in
this setting. - Mod.ES
