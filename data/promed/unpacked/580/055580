The 1st H5N6 bird flu patient's rehabilitation quarantine has been lifted [see Avian influenza, human (130): China (GD) H5N6, 2nd case 20141224.3053118]. A 59-year-old male patient, on 4 Mar 2014 [showed evidence of] disease, with fever and cough, followed by isolation and treatment in Guangzhou, [where he] was in critical condition.

[Michael Coston (Avian Flu Diary, http://afludiary.blogspot.com/2015/01/guangdongs-h5n6-patient-recovers.html): This is only the 2nd human H5N6 case diagnosed -- and the 1st was fatal, thus this recovery is noteworthy.

While H5N1 and H7N9 are probably still the 2 avian viruses of greatest concern, the avian flu field has been rapidly expanding the past few years. Over the past year, 4 new avian viruses -- H10N8, H5N8, H5N3 & H5N6 -- have emerged, and we don't have a good handle on how much of an impact they will ultimately have.

H5N8 has certainly shown the ability to travel well, having already shown up in Europe, North America and Asia, but so far it doesn't appear to infect humans. H10N8 and H5N6 have only made a few appearances, but have infected and killed a handful of people. How all of these viruses will interact (and evolve) is something we are going to have to watch closely over the coming months and years. For now, the good news is none of these avian viruses appears capable of transmitting efficiently from human to human, and they remain primarily a threat to birds and the poultry industry.
