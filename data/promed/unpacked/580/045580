Foot-and-mouth disease emerging in Cambodia
--------------------------------------------
PHNOM PENH: An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is emerging in two
Cambodian provinces, threatening farmers' livelihoods, local media reported
on Friday [19 Jul 2002].
The highly contagious disease has attacked hundreds of cattle and pigs in
Battambang and Kompong Cham provinces, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture's monthly livestock report.
Some 316 cows and 458 pigs contracted the disease in June in several
districts of Battambang, and 342 head of cattle fell sick in Kombong Cham,
the report said.
Sen Sovann, deputy director of the ministry's animal health and production
department, blamed the outbreak on cross-border smuggling without health
inspections or other safeguards. The outbreak will endanger beef exports,
the official said.
To curb the disease, the ministry issued an order, asking police to
strengthen the crackdown on cattle smuggling.

[Cambodia is regarded as an FMD-endemic country, reporting outbreaks for
years, including each of the last 6 years. It has been one of the countries
where the Middle East-Southern Asian (ME-SA) topotype of FMDV-O has been
identified by the OIE/FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD Disease
(WRLFMD), in 2000. The said topotype was involved later in the European
epizootic.
Although the occurrence of FMD in an endemic country is not "news", the
recent change in the attitude of the international animal-health
establishment towards vaccinations underlines the importance of keeping
track of currently evolving FMD virus strains anywhere, with special
reference to their genetic profile and immunogenicity. This indicates the
need to send samples for identification and typing to reference
laboratories; also from the current cases in Cambodia. - Mod.AS]
