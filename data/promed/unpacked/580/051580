As of 28 Jan [2022], there have been 14 laboratory-confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 illness linked to this outbreak in the following provinces: Alberta (13) and Saskatchewan (1). Individuals became sick between early December 2021 and early January 2022. No deaths or hospitalizations have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 0 and 61 years of age. The majority of cases (64%) are female.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infections involving 2 provinces: Alberta and Saskatchewan. Based on the investigation findings to date, the outbreak is linked to Hankook (Korean characters only) brand Original Kimchi. Many of the individuals who were sick reported having eaten Hankook (Korean characters only) brand Original Kimchi before their illnesses occurred.

The CFIA issued a food recall warning on 28 Jan 2022 for Hankook (Korean characters only) brand Original Kimchi sold in 2L containers with a net weight of 1670 g, UPC code 6 23431 00030 4, and best before date 29 Jan 2022. The recalled product was distributed in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.

For more information on the recalled product, please consult CFIA's website. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If other products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

Do not eat, use, sell, or serve the recalled kimchi or any products made with the recalled kimchi. This advice applies to individuals, as well as retailers, distributors, manufacturers, and food service establishments such as hotels, restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals, and long-term care homes, across Canada.

This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

[EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food, including produce; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals, or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

"Kimchi, a staple food in Korean cuisine, is a traditional side dish of salted and fermented vegetables, such as napa cabbage and Korean radish, made with a widely varying selection of seasonings, including gochugaru (Korean chili powder), spring onions, garlic, ginger, and jeotgal (salted seafood), etc."

"It is eaten as a side dish with almost every Korean meal."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi)

As a fermented product, pathogens can survive the production process based on temperature and time:

Abstract
---------
"The survival of _Escherichia coli_ and _Salmonella_ strains during diced white radish kimchi fermentation was studied. Kimchi batches inoculated with the pathogens were fermented at 4, 15, and 25 deg C [39, 59, and 77 deg F, respectively] for 42 to 384 h. Cell counts of _E. coli_ and _Salmonella_ were enumerated on _E. coli_-coliform count plates and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar, respectively. Baranyi (primary model) and polynomial (secondary model) models, validated by root mean square error, were used to describe the kinetic behavior of the pathogens. In the primary model, both the death phase shoulder ( _E. coli_: 208.18 to 8.25 h, 4 to 25 deg C [39-77 deg F]; _Salmonella_: 79.91 to 0.97 h, 4 to 25 deg C [39-77 deg F]) and bacterial cell counts (log CFU per gram per hour) decreased with increasing temperature (P less than 0.05) (death rate: _E. coli_: -0.02 to -0.09, 4 to 25 deg C [39-77 deg F]; _Salmonella_: -0.01 to -0.10, 4 to 25 deg C [39-77 deg F]), the results being equally significant in the secondary model. The root mean square error (0.480 to 0.485) showed that the model performance was good. The fermentation temperature and time are the critical factors that control pathogenic _E. coli_ and _Salmonella_ in kimchi."
