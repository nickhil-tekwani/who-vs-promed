FOODBORNE DISEASE INCIDENCE DECREASING - USA

According to a report released Friday based on data collected by the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and cited here, the estimated rate of
food-borne disease fell slightly last year to about 50 cases for every
100,000 Americans, but government scientists are still far from certain how
many people get sick from bad food.
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was quoted as saying, "It's really
too early to extrapolate from that data," adding that at least one more year
of figures was needed to establish a baseline for food-borne disease. The
report marked the second year of the CDC's FoodNet project, which seeks to
collect reliable data on how many Americans fall ill from tainted meat,
vegetables and other foods. The report was quoted as saying that, "In fact,
only 1 percent to 5 percent of food-borne disease cases are believed to be
reported to CDC through passive surveillance systems."
In 1997, 8,031 diarrhea cases were confirmed by laboratory tests as
food-borne disease, out of a sample population of 15.9 million in
California, Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota and Oregon tracked by FoodNet.
That equaled a rate of 50.4 cases per 100,000 people, the report said. By
comparison, in 1996 some 7,322 diarrhea cases were confirmed as food-borne
disease among 14.3 million people in the same states. That incidence of
illness was slightly higher at 51.3 cases per 100,000. The USDA previously
estimated that between 6.5 million and 33 million cases of food-borne
illness occurred annually and that more than 9,000 Americans died from
tainted food. The new report's rate of incidence, if applied to the U.S.
population of 265 million, indicated that at least 13 million cases of
food-borne disease occurred annually.
The USDA report found that campylobacter was the bacteria most often linked
to bad food, accounting for nearly half the food-borne illness cases tracked
by FoodNet. _Campylobacter_ is most often found in raw chicken. _Salmonella_
ranked second, accounting for about one-fourth of the food-borne diseases
logged by FoodNet.
