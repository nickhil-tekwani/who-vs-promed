The total number of pig farm samples that have tested positive for the porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus now stands at 7522 in 30 states.

The National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) reports 105 positive accessions out of 773 tested at 9 veterinary diagnostic labs for the week ending 28 Jun 2014, according to the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV).

The number of states reported to the NAHLN as having at least one confirmed case of PED remains at 30.

The total number of pig farm samples (termed "laboratory biological accessions" in the official report) that have tested positive for the PED virus (PEDv) since April 2013 now stands at 7522, which includes 414 for the month of June 2014 so far.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 23 744 farm samples have been tested, of which 28 per cent have tested positive for the virus.

Suckling pigs
For the current month to date, 466 farms have been tested, of which 98 samples or 21 per cent were positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 3327 farm samples have been tested, of which 1641 samples or 43 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Nursery pigs
For the current month to date, 370 farms have been tested, of which 60 samples or 16 per cent were positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 3651 farm samples have been tested, of which 1348 samples or 33 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Grower/finisher pigs
For the current month to date, 468 farms have been tested, of which 53 samples or 11 per cent were positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 4134 farm samples have been tested, of which 1349 samples or 25 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Sows and boars
For the current month to date, 300 farms have been tested, of which 16 samples or 5 per cent tested positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 2050 farm samples have been tested, of which 630 samples or 23 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Unknown age class
For the current month to date, 1501 farms have been tested, of which 194 samples or 13 per cent tested positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 11 431 farm samples have been tested, of which 2743 samples or 23 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Results by state
According to AASV, the total number of states remains at 30. The total number of positive accessions on this report (up to the week of 22 Jun 2014) is 7522. Those states with 100 or more positive tests are: Iowa, 2119; Minnesota, 1255; Illinois, 808; North Carolina, 745; Oklahoma, 411; Indiana, 402; Ohio, 338; Kansas, 271; Missouri, 240, Michigan, 191; Nebraska, 167 and South Dakota, 108.

Also reporting one or more positive results were Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Dakota.

Pig Samples Testing Positive for PEDv: 28 194. The total number of swine samples (termed "biological samples" in the official report) since testing began in June 2013 now stands at 28 194.

For the current month to date, 22 711 samples have been tested, of which 2145 or 9 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 127 915 samples have been tested, of which 20 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Environmental Samples Testing Positive for PEDv: 6352. The total number of environmental samples testing positive since testing began in June 2013 now stands at 6352. For the current month to date, 3410 samples have been tested, of which 368 or 11 per cent tested positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 25 793 samples have been tested, of which 22 per cent tested positive.
