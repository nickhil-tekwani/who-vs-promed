The epidemic season for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
continues in the Stavropol oblast. The cumulative number of cases was
25 in the oblast this year [2010] so far. The 1st case was a man who
removed ticks from cattle with his bare hands and crushed them.

According to Rospotrebnadzor (the Federal Agency for Consumer
Protection and Welfare), CCHF cases were recorded in 11 regions
[rayons] of the Stavropol oblast. Most cases occurred in the
Ipatovski and Neftekumski regions.

There have been 8000 reports of tick bites. A survey revealed that
only 5 percent of ticks were CCHF virus carriers, but this is a
significantly greater number than recorded in 2009.

The head epidemiologist for the South Federal Okrug in the Russian
Ministry of Health has provided some information about the incidence
of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] in the region. He announced
that the peak of morbidity is expected during June and July. In
total, 11 cases of CCHF have been registered in the Rostov oblast so
far this year [2010].

All the south regions of Russia are endemic for CCHF except for the
Krasnodar Krai. However, there has been one suspected case there
which is still being investigated. Currently, 8 people have been
hospitalized for suspected CCHF.

Overall, 62 people were hospitalized with suspected CCHF, but only 11
cases were confirmed.

[Although CCHF was 1st described in the Crimea in 1944, the disease
is now known to be endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and
Asia. Its distribution is largely determined by that of the tick
vector. A number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with
CCHF virus, but the most efficient and common vectors for CCHF appear
to be members of the genus _Hyalomma_.
