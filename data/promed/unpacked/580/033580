Hendra virus kills Queensland horse
-----------------------------------
A horse that died earlier this week in north Queensland had the deadly bat-borne Hendra virus, authorities say. A total of 4 people are being examined for the bat-borne Hendra virus after a horse died from the disease in north Queensland.

A horse that died this week in the Atherton Tablelands, near Cairns, tested positive for the virus, Biosecurity Queensland confirmed on Friday [22 Feb 2013].

The 4 people who had contact with the animal are being interviewed by health officials to determine whether they need to be tested or treated. All are thought to have had a low level of exposure.

Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young says the virus is not transmitted easily as it requires close contact with body fluids of the sick horse.

Biosecurity Queensland is quarantining the property where the horse died and other horses on the property are being tested.

In January a horse died from the virus near Mackay.

Although people can't contract the virus directly from bats they can through horses which pick up the disease by eating feed or water contaminated with flying fox body fluids and excretions.

A total of 4 people have been killed by the virus in Australia since 1994.

[This disease seems to be persistent for the last several seasons. The vaccine is licensed. People should be protecting their horses by vaccinating them.

While it may sound like a silly suggestion to put a fence around a tree or several trees, it may save the life of the horse or horses and spare some heartache. A fence can be expensive but it pales in comparison to losing your equine companion and potentially your life. Flying foxes like to eat the fruit of fruit trees and are very messy eaters. Horses may graze under those trees and eat the saliva, or partially eaten fruit, or even some feces and become infected with the virus. So fencing seems like an idea that may be a good preventive measure. However, vaccination is desperately needed for all horses.
