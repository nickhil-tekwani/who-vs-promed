Public Health England Briefing Note 2019/038
----------------------------------------------------------------
Public Health England (PHE), Public Health Wales and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) are investigating a 5-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) cluster of _Salmonella enterica_ 4,[5],12:b:- (SNP address: 1.1.249.265.270.271.%) identified through the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. To date, 54 cases have been reported, with sample dates ranging from 23 Apr 2019 to 7 Jul 2019. Investigation is warranted due to the large number of cases and high reporting rate, with 6 cases reported in May, 23 in June and 25 in July [2019].

The age of cases ranges from 14 months to 80 years, with half of the cases 20 to 40 years of age (27 of 54 cases). Sex distribution is similar with 26 females and 28 males. A total of 12 cases have been reported from Wales and 42 from England distributed across 6 PHE centers. An EU-wide query (EPIS) was posted, but there is no indication that this outbreak is affecting other countries. The isolates are fully sensitive to all antimicrobials tested, apart from one strain that is ampicillin resistant.

No common food product has been identified to date; however, several cases reported eating at various Indian restaurants throughout England and Wales in the week prior to their onset: 2 Indian restaurants in London have been identified where multiple confirmed cases reported eating prior to onset. These restaurant outbreaks are being investigated by the relevant HPTs, supported by the Field Service.

To identify the source of the outbreak and allow the FSA to follow up restaurant supply chain information, the OCT has agreed to administer a hypothesis-generating questionnaire developed for this outbreak to prospective cases. Cases will be identified by TARGET (GI infections) and notified to the relevant Field Service team for coordination of questionnaire completion.

[ProMED thanks Hamed Sharaf for this posting. The source of this seemingly expanding outbreak has not yet been determined. The following is a discussion about this serotype:

Abstract
--------
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar 4,[5],12:b:- is a monophasic serovar not able to express the 2nd-phase flagellar antigen (H2 antigen). In Germany, the serovar is occasionally isolated from poultry, reptiles, fish, food, and humans. In this study, a selection of 67 epidemiologically unrelated _Salmonella enterica_ serovar 4,[5],12:b:- strains isolated in Germany between 2000 and 2011 from the environment, animal, food, and humans was investigated by phenotypic and genotypic methods to better understand the population structure and to identify potential sources of human infections. Strains of this monophasic serovar were highly diverse. Within the 67 strains analyzed, we identified 52 different pulsed-field gel electrophoresis XbaI profiles, 12 different multilocus sequence types (STs), and 18 different pathogenicity array types. The relatedness of strains based on the pathogenicity gene repertoire (102 markers tested) was in good agreement with grouping by MLST. _S. enterica_ serovar 4,[5],12:b:- is distributed across multiple unrelated eBurst groups and consequently is highly polyphyletic. Two sequence types (ST88 and ST127) were linked to _S. enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B (d-tartrate positive), 2 single-locus variants of ST1583 were linked to _S. enterica_ serovar Abony, and one sequence type (ST1484) was associated with _S. enterica_ serovar Mygdal, a recently defined, new serovar. From the characterization of clinical isolates and those of nonhuman origin, it can be concluded that the potential sources of sporadic human infections with _S. enterica_ serovar 4,[5],12:b:- most likely are mushrooms, shellfish/fish, and poultry. - Mod.LL
