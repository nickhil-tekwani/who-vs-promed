The director of the Central Hospital of Tropical Diseases, Nguyen Van
Kinh reported that 4 people were infected with pig streptococcus
[presumably _Streptococcus suis_]. [_S. suis_] infection in pigs
occurs as a complication of blue ear disease in pigs. [Porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is popularly named "blue
ear disease" and is caused by the PRRS virus.]

Of the 4 patients 2 required mechanical ventilation. Symptoms include
high fever (above 40 deg C/104 deg F), diarrhea, urinating less, and
patches of hemorrhagic necrosis on the skin. The disease has 3 forms:
meningitis, septicemia, or both meningitis and septicemia. If not
promptly treated, patients may develop blood clots, multi-organ
failure, liver failure, kidney failure, lung failure, and death.

[Human _Streptococcus suis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonosis
that has been reported to cause most commonly meningitis, but also
toxic shock has been reported if the pathogen produces the
appropriate toxins, and less commonly, endocarditis. It occurs mainly
among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating cooked meat or organs
from infected pigs poses no risk and person-to-person spread does not
seem to occur (see <http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201>).

_S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent
strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs
(polyarthritis, meningitis and septicemia) and in recently weaned and
growing pigs (meningitis). In addition, _S. suis_ sometimes causes
pneumonia, endocarditis, myocarditis, or abortions in adult pigs.

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome
(PRRS) in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is
thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.
ProMED-mail recently reported a PRRS outbreak that occurred in March
2010 in Hai Duong province, Viet Nam (see Porcine reprod. & resp.
syndrome - Viet Nam 20100414.1206). This province is located in the
Red River Delta of northeastern Viet Nam
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_Duong_Province >). The news
release above fails to identify any epidemiological link between the
human cases and pigs and does not mention any link to the PRRS
outbreak recently reported in Hai Duong province.

A discussion of PRRS and _S. suis_ can be found in moderators'
comments in ProMED-mail posts listed below.
