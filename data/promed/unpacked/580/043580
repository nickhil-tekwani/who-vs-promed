There have now been 2 human cases of tularemia diagnosed in Tasmania
in 2011, 1 in June, the other in October. Both cases were women in
their 40s, each bitten and/or scratched by separate possums (probably
juvenile and probably ill) at points only a few kilometers apart along
a remote road in western Tasmania. Both developed the ulcero-glandular
form of tularemia, with ulceration at the site of the injury and
prominent lymphadenitis. The 1st case recovered after a complicated
course, the 2nd is improving on treatment.

The microbiological collaboration between the Royal Hobart Hospital
and Westmead Hospital laboratories has been crucial. Both diagnoses
were supported by positive DFA [direct fluorescent-antibody assay] on
excised or aspirated tissues. PCR-based characterization of genetic
material from the 1st case suggested the strain of _Francisella
tularensis_ involved was _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_
biovar _japonica_.

Therefore, the clinical and microbiological evidence to date points to
these zoonotic infections (and possible epizootic) being due to one of
the relatively less virulent strains of _F. tularensis_, that is, not
the type A or subspecies _tularensis_ strain more often associated
with serious sepsis such as pneumonia and septicemia in parts of the
northern hemisphere. The recent Tasmanian cases also appear to be
different from the case acquired in the NT a decade ago (_F.
novicida_).

Public health actions so far have included information to animal
handlers who might work in the area of the 1st case, wider public
advice around wild animal contact via the media, and alerts to
clinicians and laboratories. The extent of the risk-area for this
infection within Tasmania is unclear, but based on these recent cases,
may be relatively restricted. We will also address the possibility of
risk from water, by reiterating existing guidance around protecting
private water supplies from microbial hazards, and rendering raw water
safe by boiling it. We are engaging with our Department of Primary
Industry, Parks, Wildlife and the Environment around further
investigations. These have begun.

We would like to pass the following points on to infectious disease
physicians, microbiologists, and their colleagues who may not
previously have considered the possibility of tularemia acquired in
the Southern Hemisphere.

Clinical features that raise the possibility of Tasmanian-acquired _F.
tularensis_ infection include
- an animal bite or scratch or close exposure to wild animals or their
environment, particularly in the region of the West Coast of Tasmania;
- persistent local soft tissue infection at the inoculation site and
regional lymphadenitis, which may suppurate;
- disease progression, or a poor response, with beta-lactam antibiotic
therapy.

_F. tularensis_ is a major laboratory hazard; clinical specimens must
be managed by a laboratory with PC3 [physical containment level 3]
facilities.

[ProMED-mail sincerely thanks Dr Veitch and Dr Cooley for supplying
vital information regarding the clinical circumstances and
microbiological data regarding these 2 separate cases of
ulceroglandular tularemia acquired from possums in Tasmania. The
organism _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ biovar _japonica_ is
distinct from other _holarctica_ strains that are found in Europe,
Asia, and the USA (1). These _holarctica_ strains, also referred to as
type B tularemia tend to produce significantly milder disease in man
than the subspecies _tularensis_.
