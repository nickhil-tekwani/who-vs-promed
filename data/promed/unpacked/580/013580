The Livingston County Health Department reports the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) identified pigs at the Fowlerville Fair testing positive for swine flu, or influenza A. The Fowlerville Fair Board has taken steps to isolate infected pigs to prevent additional exposure. Infected pigs began showing signs Thursday evening [26 Jul 2018] and laboratory results were confirmed late Friday afternoon [27 Jul 2018]. The fair kicked off [Mon 23 Jul 2018] and concludes today [28 Jul 2018]. At this time, there are no reported human illnesses.

The Health Department and Fowlerville Fair Board are reaching out to swine exhibitors, their families, and anyone who visited the swine barn at the fair to notify them of possible exposure to infected pigs. The Health Department is also instructing healthcare providers in the area to watch for patients with respiratory symptoms who report exposure to swine or who visited the fair.

Swine flu can spread quickly between pigs and while rare, can pass to humans through droplets in the air when sick pigs cough or sneeze. Human symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu and can include fever, cough, runny nose, and sometimes body aches, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear within 3 days of exposure but can occur up to 10 days. Currently there is no vaccine for swine flu, nor will the seasonal flu vaccine protect against swine flu; however, antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, are said to be an effective form of treatment.

[Swine flu, more accurately know as swine influenza (likely H1N1, although there are other strains) is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza virus. This virus is known to regularly cause outbreaks in pigs. This virus does not usually infect humans, however, rare human infections have occurred.

This particular flu virus usually results in many swine become ill, but few dying. While most flu viruses may circulate with in a swine herd most of the year, real impacts are most often seen in the late fall and early winter. This one seems a little unusual in that it is still summer.

This article does not tell us if these animals had recently come to the premises (traveling may have stressed them) or more likely these animals are in their premises of origin. Swine flu viruses are thought to be spread by close contact with the swine herd. This virus could be acquired from contaminated objects moving between infected and uninfected pigs. Infected swine herds, including those vaccinated against swine flu, may have sporadic disease, or may show only mild or no signs of infection.

Signs of illness could include, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, inflamed and red eyes, depression, coughing (sometimes called barking), and anorexia.

The US swine industry routinely deals with H1N1 and H3N2 swine flu viruses, which are endemic in the US swine population.

Some years ago a particular strain of the swine influenza virus did affect human beings. It is a variant influenza. We hope this variant strain is not what is circulating in this swine operation. If you feel ill and believe you have been exposed, please see your physician for appropriate care.

However, Indiana has recorded the 1st case of flu contracted from pigs since 2013, state health officials said. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, test results confirmed on Fri 29 Jun 2018 the 1st human case of H3N2 variant influenza in the United States this year. - Mod.TG
