[Our thanks to ProMED-mail correspondent Susan Baekeland for providing the following summary in English of the radio broadcast.

During the radio broadcast, Mayra Goyzueta Neyra, head of zoonosis control of the Regional Directorate of Health said that SENASA-Tacna [El Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agraria; National Agricultural Sanitary and Phytosanitary Service] reported a suspected case of anthrax after 2 calves were found dead in a farm in the locality of Poquera, Sama Inclan district [Tacna region]. On 4 Jan 2012 personnel from SENASA took samples, which were sent to the laboratory and confirmed positive for anthrax on 6 Jan 2012. There have been no reports of human cases and biosecurity measures have been implemented in the area. Sama Inclan health workers traveled to the farm and "medicated" [?] the owner of the calves and the person who helped bury the carcasses.

Goyzueta gave a full description of anthrax and the conditions under which spores can infect animals and humans . She noted that perhaps work should be done with the municipalities, which could provide the equipment necessary to help farmers dig deeper holes in which to bury the carcasses and so prevent future outbreaks of the disease.

In [2005] there was an outbreak of cutaneous anthrax in the district of Sama Las Yaras [Tacna] resulting in human cases and the deaths of some animals.

Tacna is the southernmost region in Peru, on the border with Chile and Bolivia. It can be seen on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1Fex. - Mod.MHJ]
