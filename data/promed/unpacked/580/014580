The unknown disease that claimed many buffaloes in some villages
under Nungba sub-division of Tamenglong district last month [December
2008] has been established to be "black quarter."

This was confirmed after experts of the Veterinary Department visited
the villages. Besides confirming the disease, the veterinary team
also vaccinated cattle and other livestock in these villages, an
official of the Department reported.

[The above information satisfies ProMED-mail's requests for
information that were included in postings of 4 and 9 Jan 2009,
addressing hundreds of undiagnosed deaths of cows, bulls, buffaloes
and their offspring in Manipur, India during the previous weeks.

Blackleg, also called black quarter, is an acute, febrile disease of
cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_, characterized by
emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found
worldwide. The following background on the disease is extracted from
the Merck Veterinary Manual
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/50704.htm&word=blackleg>
(including pictures):

"_C chauvoei_ is found naturally in the intestinal tract of animals.
It probably can remain viable in the soil for many years, although it
does not actively grow there. Contaminated pasture appears to be a
source of organisms. Outbreaks of blackleg have occurred in cattle on
farms in which recent excavations have occurred, which suggests that
disturbance of soil may activate latent spores. The organisms
probably are ingested, pass through the wall of the GI tract, and
after gaining access to the bloodstream, are deposited in muscle and
other tissues.

Lesions develop without any history of wounds, although bruising or
excessive exercise may precipitate some cases. Commonly, the animals
that contract blackleg are of the beef breeds, in excellent health,
gaining weight, and usually the best animals of their group.
Outbreaks occur in which a few new cases are found each day for
several days. Most cases are seen in cattle from 6-24 months old, but
thrifty calves as young as 6 weeks and cattle as old as 10-12 years
may be affected.

Clinical Findings and Lesions:
Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without
premonitory signs. Acute lameness and marked depression are common.
Initially, there is a fever but, by the time clinical signs are
obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic
edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder,
chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At 1st, the swelling is small, hot,
and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling
enlarges; there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes
cold and insensitive as the blood supply to the area diminishes.
General signs include prostration and tremors. Death occurs in 12-48
hr. In some cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and
the diaphragm, with no reliable antemortem evidence of the localized lesion.

Diagnosis:
A rapidly fatal, febrile disease in well-nourished young cattle,
particularly of the beef breeds, with crepitant swellings of the
heavy muscles suggests blackleg. The affected muscle is dark red to
black and dry and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated
with small bubbles but with little edema. The lesions may be in any
muscle, even in the tongue or diaphragm. In sheep, because the
lesions of the spontaneously occurring type are often small and deep,
they may be overlooked. Occasionally, the tissue changes caused by _C
septicum_ , _C novyi_ , _C sordellii_ , and _C perfringens_ may
resemble those of blackleg. At times, both _C septicum_ and _C
chauvoei_ may be isolated from blackleg lesions, particularly when
the carcass is examined 24 hours after death, which allows time for
postmortem invasion of the tissues by _C septicum_. Field diagnoses
are confirmed by laboratory demonstration of _C chauvoei_ in affected
muscle. The samples of muscle should be taken as soon after death as
possible. The fluorescent antibody test for _C chauvoei_ is rapid and reliable.

Control:
A bacterin containing _C chauvoei_ and _C septicum_ is safe and
reliable for both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated
twice, 2 weeks apart at 2-6 months of age; in high-risk areas,
revaccination may be necessary at one year and every 5 years
thereafter. When outbreaks are encountered, all susceptible cattle
should be vaccinated and treated prophylactically with penicillin to
prevent new cases, which may develop for up to 10 days, at which time
the bacterin provides protection. In some areas, multicomponent
clostridial vaccines are warranted. Treatment of clinical cases with
parenteral and multiple local injections of penicillin may be
attempted but are frequently unsuccessful." - Mod.AS]
