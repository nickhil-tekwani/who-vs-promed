A disease transmitted by water contaminated with rat urine has killed 136
people and made more than 2300 others sick this year, a news report said
Sunday.
The toll is the highest since the disease, known as leptospirosis, was
identified in Thailand in 1985, the Bangkok Post quoted the Public Health
Ministry as saying.
The bacterial disease occurs mainly during the flood season. Most cases
have been found in northeastern Thailand, the country's poorest region.
The ministry said other animals -- including pigs, cows, buffalo and horses
-- could also carry the bacteria that causes the disease. Between 5 and 20
percent of those who contract leptospirosis die.
Rats are rampant in many parts of rural Thailand and there are annual
bounty hunts to thin their populations. A recent campaign exterminated
about 8 million rats.
