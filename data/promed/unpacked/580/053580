From: Robert Savage <RSAVAGE@ci.madison.wi.us>

There is no evidence to support the triathlon in Madison as a source of the
leptospirosis outbreak in 1998.
The final report on the leptospirosis outbreaks associated with the
triathlons in 1998 has not, to my knowledge been published. However,
according to the grand rounds presented to EIS officers by Juliette Morgan,
MD, (Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch, at CDC) "An outbreak of
leptospirosis was confirmed in Illinois triathlon"... "Another unexplained
febrile illness occurred in Wisconsin triathlon" (from Powerpoint slide).
This was suggested in the MMWR article cited. Paragraph 3 identifies
differences in the illnesses experienced by Wisconsin-only vs Illinois-only
racers. The "5%" attack rate for Wisconsin-only racers, mentioned in this
article reflects the broader case definition used early in the outbreak
investigation to identify as many suspect cases as possible.
It is too bad that a final report was not published so that we could see
the final report on this investigation. This would clarify the final
estimates of attack rates and clarify the source of the outbreak.

[Thank you for this information. ProMED-mail would be interested in
receiving details of the final report.
The above points out the importance of noting that there has not yet been
confirmation that the disease in those attending the EcoChallenge Adventure
race in Borneo is leptospirosis. -Man. Ed. DS
