A 6-year-old boy in Florida is fighting for his life after getting rabies. [RR] had hallucinations and then seizures a few weeks after an infected bat bit him. His parents rushed him to the emergency room, where doctors broke the devastating news.

Rabies in the U.S. has become very rare. According to the CDC, there were only 3 cases reported in humans in 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available. It is nearly always fatal once symptoms start. But [RR's] doctors haven't given up. They are betting that a controversial experimental treatment -- which has worked on just 2 others in the U.S. -- will help him pull through.

[RR's] family posted the details of his case along with an appeal for aid on a GoFundMe page. The Florida Department of Health confirmed there is a case of human rabies in the state and the person was infected by a bat and is being treated.

So far, [RR] has survived longer than he was expected to, which is giving his family hope. The treatment has been dubbed "The Milwaukee Protocol" after the city where it was 1st tried in 2004. Doctors will place [RR] in coma and then treat him with a cocktail of antiviral drugs, some of which were made to treat Ebola, says Rodney Willoughby, MD, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin who came up with the treatment. The treatment is freely available to health care providers on the Internet.

"We have 18 survivors, hopefully more soon," Willoughby said, adding that he could not talk about any specific patient's case. A study published in August [2017] offers different numbers. It says there are just 5 published cases of human survivors of the treatment. Most of the survivors have been in Peru, Willoughby says, which has far more human cases than the U.S. Only 2 of them are in the U.S. -- his patient in Milwaukee, he says, and one in California.

Still, the treatment doesn't work most of the time. Willoughby says they've tried it in at least 80 cases. The high failure rate has prompted a backlash by some in the infectious disease community, who say that it should be abandoned.

Willoughby admits that when the treatment seems to work, he has no idea why. "It's witchcraft and voodoo," he says. "I did this once. I baked cookies. They came out fine. Here's my recipe. There's no science in that," he says.

Willoughby says it's been difficult to study patients' immune responses to the treatment because he needs special permission to do that, and patients often die or clear their virus on their own before he's able to get it. "We have patients come and go all the time that we don't get to learn from," he says. "That's a real problem." The idea behind the treatment is to try to buy the patient more time to fight off the virus on their own. "We essentially leave the patient alone as much as we can and wait for the patient to devise their own cure. They make an immune response, and that immune response is far superior to anything we could engineer," Willoughby says.

It's the only treatment associated with recovery from the rabies infection in people who haven't been vaccinated.

Public health officials say that because the odds of survival are so poor, it's important for anyone who comes into contact with a wild animal, like a bat, to get medical help right away, even if they aren't sure they were bitten. Emergency rooms offer a series of shots that, while expensive, can protect people who've been exposed from a full-blown infection.

[M], 14, was one of 3 children from the same family who contracted the disease in November last year [2017]. The virus killed his 2 siblings - 17 and 10, within weeks of each other after it took hold. [M] was bitten several times by vampire bats in Rio Unini, a rural community situated on the Rio Negro, a major river flowing through the Amazon jungle. Now the youngster has made a remarkable recovery after pioneering treatment that saw him placed in an induced coma. This is said to protect the brain and help patients survive long enough for their immune system to produce antibodies to fight off the virus.

He is the 2nd person in Brazil to be cured of rabies, after Recife-based [MM] was saved in 2009.

The boy's father, [LCS], 47, said: '[M's] survival is nothing short of a miracle. He is still recovering and very weak and he is unable to move certain parts of his body. 'The recovery process is full of risks, but we are full of hope as we know the worst is over. We are looking forward to having him home soon, to see him walking, talking and laughing again.'

Rabies is a rare but very serious infection of the brain and nerves and is almost always fatal once symptoms appear. The virus infects the central nervous system, causing confusion or aggressive behaviour, hallucinations, frothing at the mouth and paralysis and ultimately death. The illness can take up to 9 months to manifest.

[M] was admitted to the Tropical Medical Foundation (FMT) in Manaus suffering from fever and tingling in the hands on the same day his sister died. But the resilient youth survived after being treated with the Milwaukee protocol. The experimental procedure, created by American doctor Rodney Willoughby, involves administering antiviral drugs while putting the patient into a chemically induced coma to protect the brain from damage.

Throughout the treatment, medical teams were in contact with Dr Willoughby who monitored and contributed his expertise to the case. [M] spent 40 days in intensive care (ICU) in an induced coma supported by mechanical ventilation. According to Dr Antonio Magela, infectious disease specialist at FMT who coordinated the treatment, the young man's chances were boosted by an early diagnosis and his immediate hospitalisation. Sadly, this was not the case for his siblings, who were already in the full throes of the illness.

During a press conference he said: '[M] arrived just hours after his sister died suffering from tingling and numbness in the hands but he didn't have any neurological symptoms. 'He was immediately admitted and that same night, he had a seizure and had to be sedated and sent to ICU. 'He was treated from the start with the Milwaukee protocol, due to the history of bat attacks.'

Milwaukee Protocol: A teenager from the US became the 1st patient known to have survived rabies without receiving the rabies vaccine. In 2004, student [JG], then 15, was bitten by a bat she picked up while attending church in her hometown in Wisconsin. Thirty-seven days after the bite, she was admitted to hospital with double vision, slurred speech, and jerking in her left arm. Dr Rodney Willoughby successfully treated her with the Milwaukee protocol, sometimes referred to as the Wisconsin protocol. His goal was to put her into an induced coma to essentially protect her brain from the rabies virus with the hope she would survive long enough for her immune system to produce the antibodies to fight off the virus. The girl was brought out of the coma after 6 days and after 31 days in the hospital, she was declared virus-free and removed from isolation.

In Brazil, Recife-based [MM] made history after he became the 1st person in Brazil to be cured of rabies in 2009. He was bitten in the ankle by a vampire bat while he slept. After he left ICU, the man, who is now 24-years-old, underwent orthopaedic surgery for his upper and lower limbs which had atrophied. He remains confined to a wheelchair but dreams of walking one day.

A total of 3 victims beat the disease in the US in 2004 and 2011, and in Colombia in 2008. The latter died from other clinical causes after being cured.

After more than a month of life-saving treatment, the patient was discharged this month [January 2018] from ICU and is already out of bed and in a chair. He is expected to remain in hospital for at least 4 months to combat complications and to aid his rehabilitation. He is being monitored by paediatricians, physiotherapists, nutritionists, neurologist and other professionals.

Dr Magela said: 'It is possible to celebrate his recovery, but we have to be cautious since the disease can leave complications. '[M] is already reacting to the presence of his family and rejecting food he doesn't like. This is all good news. 'Also, the fact that he is swallowing spontaneously and breathing independently makes us think that the key areas of his nervous system have been preserved or are recovering.

'The 1st patient to be cured of rabies in Brazil was hospitalised for 9 months and still has outpatient follow-ups. 'We want to ensure this teenager has the best possible recovery. Therefore, he will continue to be accompanied by a multidisciplinary team.'

His survival has been hailed a miracle by family and friends in the small close-knit jungle community as [M] has become only the 2nd person in the South American country to beat the deadly virus. Mr Castro da Silva said that while he celebrated the prospect of his son's recovery he remained concerned that authorities had failed to protect the community with preventative vaccines and measures to control the blood-sucking creatures, prevalent in the forest area.

He said: 'My children were contaminated with the disease because of the lack of information. 'We have never received guidance on the prevention of human rabies. More than 88 people in our area were bitten by bats in 2017. 'We reported the incidents but never got help. If we had, maybe all my children would be alive today. 'Every day for over a year, my 10-year-old daughter [M] would get up drenched in blood from bites on her elbows, on her hands and to her toes."

'She suffered more than 20 lacerations during this period. But the symptoms of the disease took some time to appear. [M] became poorly in the same week my other son [L] fell ill.'

[L], 17, died in hospital in November last year [2017], from viral encephalitis -inflammation on the brain. He had been bitten more than 10 times since 2016 by the nocturnal mammals. An autopsy found the adolescent was infected with the lyssavirus, which causes human rabies.

[M] was hospitalised for 16 days and underwent urgent treatment to combat the virus but died on [Sat 2 Dec 2017].

Brazil's department of health has been carrying out a vaccination programme in the Rio Unini district including inoculating cats and dogs. It is also capturing and applying a venom paste to the bats to cull and control the spread of them. Health teams have supplied residents with mosquito nets impregnated with pesticide and insect repellents along with health education advice.

The bloody experience of these Brazilian children in Amazonas is, I'm afraid, not unusual in the interior of Amazonas as they sleep in hammocks and mosquito nets get dislodged. Vampire bats pose a significant risk also to cattle and horses.

The Milwaukee Protocol has gathered some controversy over the years and has not been consistently successful. To quote Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_protocol): "Out of 36 rabies patients treated with the Milwaukee Protocol, 5 have survived. Giese's treatment regimen has undergone revision (the 2nd version omits the use of ribavirin). 2 of 25 patients treated under the 1st protocol survived. A further 10 patients have been treated under the revised protocol, with a further 2 survivors.

"In June 2011, another child survived infection with rabies without receiving the vaccine before showing symptoms. [PR], an 8-year-old girl from Willow Creek, California, contracted the disease in April 2011, but did not receive medical care until mid-May, after her grandmother took her to the doctor because of influenza-like symptoms that grew so serious, her grandmother said they resembled polio. The hospital said doctors followed the protocol established for Giese. [R] was placed in a drug-induced coma and received antiviral medications. She survived after spending 2 weeks in intensive care undergoing the treatments.

"Some critics say those survivors are due to the patients having a genetic rabies immunity and that the Milwaukee protocol has nothing to do with the survival rate; However this would imply the 5 patients all happened to coincidentally survive rabies while receiving the Milwaukee protocol -- despite no documented survivors before them.

"Ketamine has been shown to have a direct effect against the rabies virus."

But faced with certain death, it offers an opportunity. - Mod.MHJ]
