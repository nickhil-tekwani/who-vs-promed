Re: Undiagnosed die-off, poultry - Trinidad: RFI
----------------------
On Monday night, 10 Jan [2006] a television station reported that
thousands of birds had died at farms in the Cumuto area.
The 1st the Veterinary Services heard of the purported event was
when it was aired on the news.
Tuesday, 11 Jan [2006] a team comprising members of the Poultry
Surveillance Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Veterinary
Public Health Unit of the Ministry of Health visited the area.
Examination of the records on the affected farm revealed that there
had been increased deaths over a period of 3 weeks, starting 20 Dec
2005. The day old chicks were placed on the farm on 20 Dec
[2005]. In week 1, (20 - 26 Dec 2005) 457 birds died. Week 2, (27
Dec [2005] - 2 Jan [2006]), 374 [birds died] and week 3, (3 - 9 Jan
[2006]), 337 [birds died]. This totaled 1168 [bird deaths] in 3 weeks.
Birds were necropsied on the farm and some were taken to the
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the UWI [University of the West
Indies] School of Veterinary medicine for further examination. The
major lesions seen were nodules of varying size on the air sacs
throughout the bodies ranging in size from pinpoint to approximately
4 mm. diameter. Cloudy air sacs, swollen joints which exuded clear
fluid when lanced, [and] swollen kidneys.
Based on the history, clinical signs and postmortem lesions the
diagnosis of Aspergillosis was made. On investigation it was
revealed that the poultry serviceman from the onset had also
diagnosed the problem as Aspergillosis which is not a notifiable disease.
Cultures set in the lab produced profuse growth of _Aspergillus_ in
less than 24 hours.
On Wednesday 12 [Jan 2006] the team returned to the area to visit a
2nd farm. Examination of the records showed no abnormal pattern of deaths.
Out of an abundance of caution, blood samples were taken from both
farms and submitted to the VDL [Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory] for
testing for avian influenza. These all were negative for avian
influenza. The technician who performed these tests participated in
training in diagnostic methods for avian influenza and Newcastle
disease in Ames Iowa during the summer of 2005.
Therefore the thousands of deaths were really 1168 over a period of 3 weeks.
All samples were negative for avian influenza. The postmortem
lesions, laboratory results indicate Aspergillosis.
The contractor has decided to cull the entire flock of approximately
6000 remaining birds.
Be assured that you will always be kept abreast of any disease
outbreak situations that may occur in Trinidad and Tobago.
