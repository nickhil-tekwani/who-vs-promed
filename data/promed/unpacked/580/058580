The FDA is advising consumers not to eat raw clams harvested in the
Pacific Northwest because of reports of a significant increase in
gastrointestinal illnesses caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ (Vp).
This advisory updates a 31 Jul 2006 advisory to consumers on eating
raw oysters harvested in the Pacific Northwest.
"FDA is working with the CDC and our state partners in this
continuing investigation," said Dr. Robert Brackett, Director of
FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. "We will continue
to update the public as more information becomes known."
In recent months, there has been an unusual increase in bacterial
illness associated with eating raw oysters and raw clams from the
Pacific Northwest. The illnesses are associated with the naturally
occurring bacterium Vp, which is most prevalent during summer months
when water temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are most favorable
for its growth. While Vp can cause mild gastrointestinal disorders in
healthy individuals, older persons and those with weak immune systems
are at greater risk for serious illness, such as septicemia
(infection of the blood system).
Until the threat of Vp from shellfish harvested in the Pacific
Northwest has passed, consumers are advised to thoroughly cook
oysters and clams harvested from that area before eating. They also
should thoroughly cook oysters and clams if they are not certain of
their origin, or if they wish to further reduce their risk of
infection from bacteria that may be found in raw oysters and clams.
Pacific Northwest oysters and clams are distributed nationally. To
date there have been 72 laboratory-confirmed and an additional 105
probable [cases of] Vp illness reported from Washington State,
Oregon, and New York linked to contaminated oysters and clams.
In Washington State, shellfish control authorities are identifying
and closing harvest areas where oysters and clams associated with the
illnesses originated. Washington State has initiated a recall of all
shell stock oysters (in the shell) harvested from areas closed within
the state.
Because of the potential for nationwide distribution, consumers are
advised to follow recall instructions and return associated shell
stock oysters to the retailer from which they were purchased. The FDA
is currently working with state shellfish authorities to take
appropriate action to address any product that be remaining on the market.
Cooking destroys the bacteria, eliminating the risk of illness for
both healthy and immunocompromised individuals. The majority of
illnesses that occur from the consumption of raw shellfish are not
life-threatening to the general population and commonly range from
mild intestinal disorders of short duration to acute gastroenteritis.
The symptoms are watery diarrhea, often with abdominal cramping,
nausea, vomiting, fever and chills. Usually these symptoms occur
within 24 hours of ingestion and last no more than 3 days. Severe
disease is rare and occurs most commonly in persons with weakened
immune systems. Individual who believe they have experienced the same
symptoms of illness after consuming oysters or clams should consult
their health care provider and contact their local health department.
Persons with weakened immune systems, including those affected by
AIDS; persons who chronically abuse alcohol; [those with] liver,
stomach or blood disorders, cancer; diabetes or kidney disease should
avoid raw oyster consumption altogether, regardless of where the
oysters or clams are harvested. Consumers can continue to enjoy
oysters and clams in many cooked preparations by following this advice.
At Restaurants and other Foodservice Establishments: Order oysters
and clams fully cooked.
In the shell:
Purchase oysters and clams with the shells closed.
Throw away any oysters or shells already opened.
Never allow raw seafood to come into contact with cooked food.
Boil oysters and clams until the shells open. Once open boil for an
additional 3-5 minutes.
Steamer - add oysters and/or clams to water that is already steaming
and cook live oysters and clams until the shells open, once open
steam for another 4-9 minutes. Use smaller pots to boil or steam
oysters and clams. Using larger pots, or cooking too many oysters or
clams at one time, may cause uneven heat distribution, which may
cause the oysters or clams in the middle to not get fully
cooked. Discard any oysters or clams that do not open during cooking.
Shucked Oysters and Clams:
Never allow raw seafood to come into contact with cooked food.
Boil or simmer shucked oysters and clams for at least 3 minutes or
until the edges curl.
Fry at 375 degrees for at least 3 minutes.
Broil 3 inches from heat for 3 minutes.
Bake at 450 degrees for 10 minutes
