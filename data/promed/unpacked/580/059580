With the country [Pakistan] gearing up for Eidul Azha [Eid al-Adha, Feast of Sacrifice, Big Eid], hundreds of thousands of animals are being brought to cities and towns where they will remain in herds until sold on for sacrifice. But in recent years, an issue that has cropped up repeatedly is the absence of mechanisms to screen livestock and separate infected animals from the healthy ones. After all, it is crucial to isolate infections that could render an animal unsafe for consumption, or affect the human population. As a study conducted by this newspaper with reference to Karachi found on Tuesday [1 Oct 2013], most animals are not vaccinated and many are infected. For many years, Eidul Azha has been followed by a major outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] -- 1000 outbreaks across the country during the past year alone. And it is not just FMD we need to worry about, but also Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] and sundry others.

The reason behind the lack of screening mechanisms can be found in the manner in which livestock has traditionally been reared in this land for centuries. Where in vast parts of the world there are controlled environments for livestock, in Pakistan the old ways still reign supreme. Thousands of families follow the nomadic lifestyle, driving their livestock across the land in search of fresh pastures and then bringing them down to towns and villages when they are ready to be sold. Even where rearing animals for consumption is an occupation for people who root themselves in a certain area, in Punjab and Sindh, for example, it can hardly be said that technology or veterinary practices figure much in the process. But modern times put forward pressing new challenges, and the need to separate healthy from infected animals before they pass the disease on to larger populations -- human and animal -- is critical. We have been lucky so far that disease outbreaks have been contained; this could change at any time.

With animals converging upon sale points ahead of Eid, city administrations still have time to get their act together.

[Pakistan reported the following OIE-listed diseases, which affect or can be transmitted by ruminants, as present during 2012: anthrax, bluetongue, bovine babesiosis, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_ &_B. melitensis_), contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD; serotypes A, O, Asia 1), hemorrhagic septicemia, peste des petits ruminants (PPR), rabies, sheep pox and goat pox, surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_), theileriosis, trypanosomosis, and vesicular stomatitis (the latter disease is known to be limited to the Western hemisphere; clarification requested).

Similar situations, and a similar need to exercise enhanced efforts to prevent the Eid-related increased hazards to animal and public health, may be encountered in other countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, where the 2-day Feast of Sacrifice is to be celebrated between 14-18 Oct 2013 (most likely, 15-16 Oct). A recent example is Turkey, into which an exotic cattle disease -- lumpy skin disease -- has recently penetrated for the 1st time, and is spreading; measures to prevent its further spread, particularly in view of the approaching Eid, have been discussed (see ProMED posting 20130929.1974690). The disease has already been reported from other Middle Eastern counties and is suspected to be spreading -- without being diagnosed/notified -- in others.

During Eid al-Adha, the Greater Eid (among other names: Eidul Azha, Kurban Bayram, Eid-e-Qurban, Eid-ul-Bakr, Bakrid), animals are slaughtered as a reminder of the Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ishmael to God as an act of obedience and submission. A portion of the meat is then distributed to the poor, along with other charitable donations, as per Islamic tradition. The number of animals slaughtered during the feast, mainly cattle, sheep and goats, worldwide may reach up to a 9-digit figure. In Pakistan alone, nearly 10 million animals were reportedly slaughtered during the 2011 Eid.

The Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is expected to involve millions; imports of slaughter animals to Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries, for the Greater Eid, include significant quantities of live animals from Eastern Africa. - Mod.AS
