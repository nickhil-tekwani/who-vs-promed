Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Chinese Taipei
------------------------------
Information received on 4 Oct 2010 from Dr Kwo-Ching Huang, Chief
Veterinary Officer and Deputy Director General, Bureau of Animal and
Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine Council of Agriculture,
Executive Yuan, Taipei, Chinese Taipei

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 20 Sep 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 29 Sep 2010
Report date 4 Oct 2010
Date submitted to OIE 4 Oct 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 2 Apr 2010
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype H5N2
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Fang-Yuan Township, CHANG-HUA
Date of start of the outbreak 20 Sep 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Birds
Susceptible 18 000
Cases 20
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: An avian influenza virus was isolated by
active surveillance sampling and confirmed as H5N2 subtype on 29 Sep
2010. Antibodies were also detected on those samples. Movement
restriction was implemented on the infected farm immediately after
the confirmation was made. Clinical health investigation in this farm
showed that the layers were in healthy condition with normal egg
production. Abnormal mortality was not observed in the infected farm.
The clinical and epidemiological investigation of surrounding poultry
farms are in progress. Viral pathogenicity testing is underway.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code (2010).

Control measures - Measures applied: Quarantine; Movement control
inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of
affected animals.

Measures to be applied - No other measures.

laboratory)

[Since 2005, the OIE has required that low pathogenic avian influenza
be reported officially, even though most cases follow the subclinical
pattern seen here and indicated by the designation as low pathogenic
avian influenza. The reason these subtypes are reportable is that the
H5 and H7 subtypes have the ability to modify their genetics and
become highly pathogenic after continued transmission with the avian
population. This additional OIE mandated reporting precaution gives
us a more robust surveillance system for tracking the various
subtypes of the influenza virus as they manifest in different ways.
In 2008, Taiwan had a similar subclinical event and contained it
without further spread and, more importantly, without evolution of
the virus into its highly pathogenic form. - Mod.PC]
