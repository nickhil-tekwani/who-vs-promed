Avian influenza A(H5N1) -- update 31 -- 2 Mar 2004
-------------------------------------------------
During last week's emergency meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, officials
from FAO, OIE, and WHO drew attention to several unique features of
the current outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in Asia; in particular its
geographic distribution, rate of spread, and severity, which are
unprecedented.
Prospects for rapid control are inconsistent with worldwide
experience, over more than 4 decades, with previous outbreaks, which
have all been much smaller in scope and inherently less challenging.
Even in countries with good surveillance, adequate resources, and
geographically limited outbreaks, control has often taken up to 2
years. For these reasons and others, WHO has cautioned against
assumptions that the outbreaks can be controlled in the immediate
future.
WHO has described the serious public health implications of these
outbreaks in a previous update.
Up to the end of 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has
been considered a rare disease. Since 1959, only 21 outbreaks had
been reported worldwide. The majority occurred in Europe and the
Americas. Of the total, only 5 resulted in significant spread to
numerous farms, and only one was associated with spread to other
countries.
Since mid-December 2003, 8 Asian countries have confirmed outbreaks
of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by the H5N1 strain. Most
of these countries are experiencing outbreaks of this disease for the
first time in their histories. In several, outbreaks have been
detected in virtually every part of the country
Over the past 2 months, more than 100 million birds have either died
of the disease or been culled in Asia. This figure is greater than
the total number of poultry affected, over years, in the world's
previous 5 largest outbreaks combined.
Worldwide experience since 1959 supports official statements about
the unprecedented nature of the present situation and the unique
challenges for control. Unique features of the present situation
include:
1. Concentration of poultry in backyard farms. In several countries
experiencing outbreaks, up to 80 percent of poultry are produced on
small farms and backyard holdings in rural areas, where poultry range
freely. In China, 60 percent of the country's estimated 13.2 billion
chickens are raised on small farms in close proximity to humans and
domestic animals, including pigs. This situation makes implementation
of strict control measures, essential to the control of previous
outbreaks, extremely difficult. These control measures -- including
bird-proof, ecologically controlled housing, disinfection of all
incoming persons, equipment, and vehicles, prevention of contact with
insects, rodents, and other mechanical vectors -- cannot be applied
on small rural farms and backyard holdings.
2. Economic significance of poultry production. Poultry production
contributes greatly to the economies and food supplies of affected
countries. The agricultural sector faces the challenge of minimizing
losses to industry and subsistence farmers in ways that also reduce
health risks for humans. Because many people in the region are so
dependent on poultry, appropriate culling may be difficult to
implement.
3. Lack of control experience. Since the disease is new to most
countries in the region, very little experience exists at national
and international levels to guide the best country-specific control
measures. In some countries, announcements of successful culling in
certain areas are being followed by subsequent eruptions of disease
in the same areas, suggesting reintroduction of the virus, continuing
presence in the environment, or inadequate verification of outbreak
control.
4. Lack of resources. Several countries with very widespread
outbreaks lack adequate infrastructure and resources, including
resources to compensate farmers and thus encourage compliance with
government recommendations. In some countries that have announced
outbreaks, neither surveillance to detect the extent of spread nor
culling of animals known to be infected is taking place.
5. The scale of international spread. With so many adjacent countries
affected, a region-wide strategy will be needed to ensure that gains
in one country are not compromised by inadequate control in another.
These unique features will make rapid control and long-term
prevention of recurrence extremely difficult to achieve.
Culling remains the first line of action, as recommended by FAO, OIE,
and WHO, for bringing the current outbreaks under control. Unlike
other economically important domestic animals, poultry raising takes
place in a very short production system. Provided sufficient
resources are available to replace culled poultry stock, countries
should not postpone aggressive culling because of fears of long-term
consequences on poultry production.
Wild birds can play a role in introducing a virus of low
pathogenicity into domestic flocks where, if allowed to circulate for
several months, it can mutate into a highly pathogenic form. No
evidence to date indicates that wild birds are the source of the
present outbreaks of HPAI H5N1. Infected poultry are the species of
greatest concern. Wild birds should not be culled.

*Outbreaks with significant spread to numerous farms, resulting in
great economic losses. Most other outbreaks involved little or no
spread from the initially infected farms.
Observations from previous outbreaks (1959-2003)
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza can be extremely
difficult to control, even under favourable conditions (concentration
of infected birds in well-maintained commercial production
facilities, limited geographical occurrence).
- The 1983 Pennsylvania (USA) outbreak took 2 years to control. Some
17 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of US$62 million.
Indirect costs have been estimated at more than US$250 million.
- The 2003 outbreak in the Netherlands spread to Belgium and Germany.
In the Netherlands, more than 30 million birds -- a quarter of the
country's poultry stock -- were destroyed. Some 2.7 million were
destroyed in Belgium, and around 400 000 in Germany.
- In the Netherlands, 89 humans were infected, of whom one (a
veterinarian) died. In that outbreak, measures needed to protect the
health of poultry workers, farmers, and persons visiting farms
included wearing of protective clothing, masks to cover the mouth and
nose, eye protection, vaccination against normal seasonal human
influenza, and administration of prophylactic antiviral drugs.
Control is even more difficult in countries with dense poultry populations.
- The Italian outbreak of 1999-2000 caused infection in 413 flocks,
including 25 backyard flocks, and resulted in the destruction of
around 14 million birds. Control was complicated by the occurrence of
cases in areas with extremely dense poultry populations. Compensation
to farmers amounted to US$63 million. Costs for the poultry and
associated industry have been estimated at US$620 million. 4 months
after the last outbreak ended, the virus returned in a low-pathogenic
form, rapidly causing a further 52 outbreaks.
- Although the last outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in
Mexico occurred in 1995, the causative agent -- the H5N2 strain --
has never been entirely eliminated from the country, in its present
low-pathogenicity form, despite years of intense efforts, including
the administration of more than 2 billion doses of vaccines of
varying efficacy. Similarly, the vaccination policy pursued in
Pakistan does not appear to have resulted in eradication of the
causative agent.
Avoidance of contact between poultry and wild birds, especially ducks
and other waterfowl, can help prevent the introduction of a
low-pathogenicity virus into domestic flocks. Though no evidence to
date has conclusively linked the current outbreaks with wild
migratory birds in Asia:
- Several of these outbreaks have been linked to contact between
free-ranging flocks and wild birds, including the shared use of water
sources. Faecal contamination of water supplies is considered a very
efficient way for waterfowl to transmit the virus. Virus
(low-pathogenicity) has been readily recovered from lakes and ponds
where migratory birds congregate.
- An especially risky practice is the raising of small numbers of
domestic ducks on a pond in proximity to domestic chicken and turkey
flocks. Domestic ducks attract wild ducks, and provide a significant
link in the chain of transmission from wild birds to domestic flocks.
Aggressive control measures, including culling of infected and
exposed poultry, are recommended for avian influenza virus subtypes
H5 and H7 even when the virus initially shows low pathogenicity. (H5
and H7 are the only subtypes implicated in outbreaks of highly
pathogenic disease.)
- Several of the largest outbreaks (Pennsylvania, Mexico, Italy)
initially began with mild illness in poultry. When the virus was
allowed to continue circulating in poultry, it eventually mutated
(within 6 to 9 months) into a highly pathogenic form with a mortality
ratio approaching 100 percent. Moreover, the initial presence of
low-pathogenicity virus in these outbreaks complicated diagnosis of
the highly pathogenic form.
