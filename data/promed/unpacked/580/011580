I am really perturbed by the [ProMED postings on EEE. First,
"encephalitis" is a clinical diagnosis. A clinician can infer the syndrome
from findings made on an equine, human, or other species patient; it may be
difficult in some cases so the level of inference can vary from weak to
strong. A pathologist can usually make a strong statement about the
presence of encephalitis.
The etiological diagnosis of EEE, for example, can only be made in a
limited number of ways:
-finding the virus or definite signs of the virus. I would count
isolation and identification of the virus as the best, and a method that
gives a replicating agent for further study. However, detection of viral
antigens by immunohistochemistry, ELISA, or other sufficiently specific
test also would be good. Obviously RT-PCR can give nucleic acid products
that can be analyzed to provide not only identification but considerable
ancillary information.
-finding evidence for a specific immune reaction ongoing in the host.
Reasonable people can differ on the kind of evidence that is accepted as
proof of a recent antigenic stimulus and it probably differs according to
circumstances (dengue in a setting of multiple flaviviruses circulating;
Sin Nombre virus in North America, etc). This is also tricky because the
immune response could reflect [recent or remote infection or vaccination
unrelated to the pathological process leading one to take the sample. The
recent findings of IgM antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus among
patients suffering from Nipah virus encephalitis reflects this type of
confusion.
I don't want to get cross-ways with people who know more about horse immune
responses to vaccination and infection than I do, but I find the
classification of these cases on a single specimen without even
fractionation into IgM to allow inference of an ongoing acute immune
response to be a little unusual.

["Unusual"? Maybe. If diagnoses being made in this way are "unusual",
that would not be as serious as if they were not "unusual". I'm not
planning on trying to put words in the mouth of C.J. Peters but my word
would have been "unconscionable" or "unacceptable".
Seems to me that the supervisors of each state and federal diagnostic
entity should get right on top of this problem and solve it. We all
realize the pressures that are brought to bear on diagnostic laboratories
but either one can make a confirmed diagnosis or one cannot. It is not
possible to turn a "presumptive" into a "confirmed" just because someone
wants it that way. When I was at CDC, doing routine diagnosis for
arbovirus infections, I would often receive a single serum sample of an
afternoon and the attending clinician, M.D. or D.V.M., would call me the
next day and ask, "Well?" I never got high grades for "tact and diplomacy"
but I never turned a "presumptive" into a "confirmed" based on a request.
As important as the individual (patient) is, the epidemiologic significance
of these terms is as important and people writing review chapters quickly
recognize that for all the data that have been collected and, Lord have
mercy, published, not much of it is useable.
Some years ago, the great Dr. John Emerson, then with the Colorado
Department of Health, asked why I could not more readily make a confirmed
diagnosis. When I fully explained it to him, and begged him a little, he
got on his horse, in his helicopter, and who knows what else and collected
for me convalescent-phase serum samples from horses for which I had made
the presumptive (based on results with a single, acute-phase serum sample)
diagnosis of "Infection or vaccination with western equine encephalitis in
the recent or remote past". We published the results (citations below). It
is not at all easy to collect convalescent phase samples, particularly when
the patient dies just after the acute-phase sample is taken. Can't win
them all. Sometimes all one can do is say "presumptive".
As C.J. has said, virus isolation (something to not only identify but to
put in the freezer for future molecular, pathology, etc. studies) or
nucleic acid detection is as good as it gets. Even so, what would one make
of a rabid sheep with PCR-detected RNA of a bluetongue virus? Neither
"kits" nor short-cuts can replace diagnostic expertise. - Mod CHC
