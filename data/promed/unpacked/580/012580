[1] Multiple jurisdictions reporting high excess mortality during COVID-19 surges in winter 2022/23
[A] Germany: high excess mortality as coronavirus death rates rise in Germany
Date: Fri 2 Dec 2022

Excess mortality has reached record levels in Germany and coronavirus deaths are higher than in any previous year. Nevertheless, governments of all parties at the federal and state levels have declared the pandemic over and lifted the last remaining protective measures.

According to a press release [https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2022/11/PE22_480_126.html] from the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), average excess mortality so far in 2022 is 9 percent, meaning deaths this year are 9 percent higher than the median of the last 4 years, 2018-2021.

Throughout most of the summer [2022], excess mortality was in double digits: 9 percent in June, 12 percent in July, 11 percent in August, and 10 percent in September. In October, excess mortality reached a record 19 percent. Calculations by the EuroMOMO network show that there is a similar trend in other European countries.

A total of 92 000 people died in Germany in October, 14 560 more than the average per month for the last 4 years. The high number of additional deaths can be attributed in significant part to those dying as a result of infection with the coronavirus. According to the Robert Koch Institute, 4334 people succumbed to the virus in October, significantly more than in the same period in pandemic years 2021 (2493 deaths) and 2020 (1482 deaths).

Compared to previous pandemic years, excess mortality this year [2022] can no longer be readily attributed to deaths resulting directly from infection with the virus. In 2020, excess mortality was almost entirely consistent with the number of reported coronavirus deaths. In 2021, this was still largely the case. By 2022, these accounted for just under half of the excess mortality.

However, several scientists believe that a crucial proportion of the higher excess mortality is due to indirect consequences of the pandemic, such as hospitals and hospital staff being overloaded.

For example, Jonas Schöley of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research (MPIDR) in Rostock, Germany, notes that in the autumn of 2022, "only about half [of excess mortality] can be explained by registered COVID mortality." For the remainder, "it is still open what the reason is." However, he believes, "it is plausible that we will see more indirect effects in 2022."

Schöley points to the example of England and Wales. There, excess mortality is also caused by ambulances being delayed for more than 10 minutes. This is a consequence of the overloading of the healthcare system and thus indirectly of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to Der Spiegel magazine, Carsten Tschöpe, a cardiologist and head of the cardiomyopathy unit at Berlin's Charité hospital, pointed out the potentially serious long-term consequences of a COVID infection. With the blood vessels, SARS-CoV-2 attacks "a very central structure of the body." There is no organ in the human body that [is] not dependent on blood vessels, he said. "The organs lose parts of their function when they are no longer sufficiently supplied with blood. This causes global damage throughout the body." According to the magazine, Tschöpe was convinced "that COVID late effects also contributed to the 19 percent excess mortality in October."

Other scientists also cite the earlier-than-usual onset of the flu epidemic and the circulation of other respiratory illnesses as possible contributors to the high excess mortality. The flu epidemic [has] been absent in recent years due to existing pandemic measures around the world. Once these were lifted, the flu wave returned particularly aggressively, creating a "twindemic" in which dangerous dual infections from COVID-19 and influenza are also possible.

Regardless of the exact different direct triggers for high excess mortality, the deeper cause lies in the subordination of public health to private profit, which found its sharpest expression in the response to the pandemic by all governments. Worldwide, life expectancy fell because of the pandemic -- by nearly half a year in Germany, where more than 158 000 people officially succumbed to the virus.

[B] USA: senior citizens in California hit hard as COVID-19 surges this winter
Date: Tue 6 Dec 2022 06:32:00 ICT

https://english.news.cn/20221206/6a56d25c081441c18c7e9072debd8085/c.html


Senior citizens in California, the most populous state in the United States, are hit hard as COVID-19 surges this winter [2022-23], local media reported on Monday [1 Dec 2022], citing official data.

There has been a troubling spike in coronavirus-positive hospital admissions among seniors in the western US state, rising to levels not seen since the summer omicron surge, reported the Los Angeles Times, the biggest newspaper on [the] US West Coast.

The newspaper noted that hospitalizations have roughly tripled for Californians of most age groups since the autumn low, but the jump in seniors in need of hospital care has been particularly dramatic.

Only 35 percent of California's vaccinated seniors aged 65 and up have received the updated booster since it became available in September [2022]. Among eligible 50- to 64-year-olds, about 21 percent have received the updated booster, according to the report.

Of all age groups, 70-plus is the only one that is seeing its hospitalization rate in California exceed that of the summer omicron peak, said the report, citing the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

New coronavirus-positive hospitalizations have doubled in just 2.5 weeks to 8.86 for every 100 000 Californians aged 70 and up. The autumn low, just before Halloween, was 3.09, said the report.

"We are doing a pathetic job of protecting seniors from severe COVID in California," Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, was quoted as saying by the newspaper.

The state, home to around 40 million residents, identified more than 10.65 million confirmed cases as of 1 Dec 2022, with 96 803 deaths since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the most recent statistics on COVID-19 released by the California Department of Public Health.

[C] Libya: coronavirus, the most common disease spreading among irregular migrants
Date: Sat 3 Dec 2022 16:40 EET
Source: The Libya Observer [edited]
https://libyaobserver.ly/news/libyan-official-migrants-are-suffering-diseases-and-international-organizations-are-doing


Irregular migrants in Libya are at risk of contracting infectious diseases, and international organizations are providing no assistance in this regard, officer Ramadan Al-Shaibani of the Libyan Anti-illegal Migration Agency told the London-based Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.

He said the disease is one of the leading causes of death among migrants in shelters, who face only 4 fates: to be seized and transferred to detention centers, intercepted at sea, die on the journey, or be lucky enough to reach the southern European shores.

"These (international) organizations have no excuse, as their teams visit the shelters and see the migrants' illness and suffering, often, the migrants arrive at the shelters with a weak body, and sometimes they are unable to walk."

Al-Shaibani indicated that international reports focus on overcrowding in shelters while turning a blind eye to the "modernly equipped centres" set up for women and children by the Libyan authorities through individual efforts.

For his part, a doctor in the migrant shelters in Tripoli, Abdel-Fattah Zammit, told the newspaper that the most common disease spreading among migrants is the coronavirus.

"Fortunately for immigrants, care for coronavirus patients has become available in shelters, but infections such as tuberculosis, which attacks the lungs and may infect other vital parts, including kidneys, brain, and spinal cord, require isolation," D Zammit said, noting that the local health authorities lack medicines and vaccines for this disease.

[2] USA: FDA rescinds authorization of monoclonal antibody therapy
Date: Sat 3 Dec 2022 12:30 PM CET

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-variants-monoclonal-antibody-drugs-ineffective-rcna59797


No more monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID are available in the US: The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022] rescinded its authorization of bebtelovimab, a drug previously given to patients who faced a high risk of severe disease.

Over the last 2 years, the FDA authorized 6 monoclonal antibody treatments for COVID, but omicron's many subvariants rendered the drugs less effective so the FDA gradually revoked each of those authorizations. Bebtelovimab, made by Eli Lilly, was the last one standing.

According to the FDA's announcement, the drug was "not expected to neutralize omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.," which together now account for the majority of new infections recorded in the US -- around 62%, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show.

"The big problem is that monoclonal antibodies bind to a very small piece of the virus. As the virus changes, we are now in a position in which we lost them all because they don't bind to the virus anymore," said Dr Arturo Casadevall, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.

Paxlovid has become the go-to treatment for most people at high risk of severe COVID, given that it continues to be effective in the face of new variants and is easy to administer (it's a series of 3 pills taken twice daily for 5 days). Bebtelovimab, by contrast, was an IV infusion that took about an hour including the required observation period.

But doctors often recommended the monoclonal antibody for people taking certain immunosuppressive medications, such as cancer patients or transplant recipients, since Paxlovid can interact negatively with several of those drugs.

Dr Rodney Rohde, chair of the Clinical Laboratory Science Program at Texas State University, said he worries about how immunocompromised patients will fare with fewer treatment options.

"There are still segments of the population that have probably very little protection," he said. "You worry about that last push of this virus this winter and going to the spring [2023], if we see higher mortality or hospital beds being filled."

In the spring [2022], when the BA.2 omicron subvariant was dominant, research from Raymund Razonable, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, showed that bebtelovimab was as effective as Paxlovid at preventing severe disease among high-risk COVID patients. But Razonable said his hospital switched to Paxlovid as the primary treatment over the summer [2022] as new subvariants began to spread.

About 2 months ago, he said, doctors began asking patients who got bebtelovimab to report back if their symptoms hadn't improved in one or 2 days. By the time the FDA revoked the treatment's authorization, the Mayo Clinic had already stopped administering it, Razonable said since doctors assumed it was no longer effective against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.

Razonable said Mayo Clinic patients who are at high risk of severe COVID but can't take Paxlovid are now offered the antiviral drug remdesivir at the infusion center where the hospital previously gave monoclonal antibodies. But remdesivir infusions are given over three days, so patients need multiple appointments.

Another option for immunocompromised people is convalescent plasma, which is derived from the donated blood of people who have already recovered from COVID. Casadevall said convalescent plasma is an effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies, but it's more complicated to administer and oversee.

"It has thousands of different antibodies, so convalescent plasma has a lot of breadth that is not found in the monoclonals," he said.

Pharma companies haven't given up on the promise of new monoclonal antibody drugs, however.

"We remain strong in our belief that [monoclonal antibodies] have a critical role in the current fight against COVID-19, particularly in high-risk individuals," said a spokesperson for Vir Biotechnology, the company behind a monoclonal antibody called sotrovimab that was formerly authorized by the FDA.

A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company is searching for and evaluating monoclonal antibody candidates. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, is developing a new antibody cocktail that it hopes to make available by the end of next year [2023], a company spokesperson said.

The FDA authorized AstraZeneca's monoclonal antibody drug Evusheld in December 2021 not as a treatment for COVID, but as a way to prevent infection in immunocompromised people who may not develop a strong antibody response to vaccines. But in October [2022], the FDA announced that Evusheld may not be effective against circulating variants, and Razonable said his hospital is preparing for its authorization to be revoked soon.

"Looking at the distribution of variants currently, Evusheld is effective maybe about 30% of the time," he said.

Casadevall said new monoclonal antibody drugs are still worth pursuing since they have proven safe and effective against COVID.

"I would not give up on something like this," he said. "I think it is possible to find antibodies that will be active with the other variants."

[3] Mainland China: inhaled recombinant booster vaccine authorized
Date: Tue 6 Dec 2022 02:05 AM ICT

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202212/1281201.shtml


VectorFlu ONE, a nasal spray COVID-19 vaccine, has been granted emergency use authorization in the Chinese mainland, its developer announced on Monday [5 Dec 2022]. Analysis of interim primary data from its phase III clinical trial showed that the vaccine provided good protection against omicron variant strains BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5.

The vaccine has been co-developed by Hong Kong University, Xiamen University, and Wantai Biopharmaceutical Company.

On Monday, Wantai announced that China's National Medical Products Administration agreed to its emergency use in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Vaccine Administration Law.

The vaccine is the only nasal spray vaccine that has so far validated its safety and broad-spectrum effectiveness in phase III clinical trials, according to an announcement made by Xiamen University on Monday.

A statement from the University of Hong Kong [https://www.hku.hk/press/press-releases/detail/25507.html] said that Wantai plans to produce 200 million doses of the nasal spray vaccine in the next six months.

The university also quoted a member of the research team as saying that nasal spray vaccines can effectively overcome the shortcomings of traditional vaccines, such as making it easier for children who are afraid of injections to receive the vaccine. The device for nasal spray vaccines is also simpler than other aerosol vaccines, which require an additional inhalation device.

According to data published by Wantai, the nasal spray vaccine provides good protection against omicron infection in new crown pneumonia, regardless of immunization history.

The Phase I clinical trial was completed with 29 volunteers aged 18 to 55 with no major adverse effects reported, showing the vaccine is safe for human use, Hong Kong's Secretary for Health Lo Chung-mau said on November 30. The Phase II clinical trial for use of the vaccine as a booster was conducted with more than 100 volunteers aged 18 to 75. The project team is currently collecting the immune response data for analysis, which is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2023.

The primary data analysis of the phase III clinical trial of the vaccine was completed in October [2022]. The data showed that the vaccine provided good protection against omicron variant strains in both the baseline immunization for people with no immunization history and the sequential booster immunization for people with an immunization history.

According to the announcement from Xiamen University, the vaccine has an excellent safety profile and no serious vaccine-related adverse events have occurred in clinical trials. Moreover, its protective efficacy for the elderly and chronic patients is not weaker than for young and middle-aged healthy people.

[4] Non-pharmaceutical interventions easing in China and South Korea, while US CDC encourages face masks over the holiday season
[A] China: strict COVID measures easing as global cases hold steady
Date: Thu 8 Dec 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/china-eases-strict-covid-measures-global-cases-hold-steady


China's National Health Commission (NHC) today [8 Dec 2022] announced the lifting of many of its signature "zero COVID" measures, which comes in the wake of widespread protests and ongoing outbreaks in several cities.

In other global developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) in its regular weekly update said activity remained stable last week [week of 30 Nov 2022], with levels on the rise in just one world region: the Americas.

At a briefing today, Chinese officials announced the unwinding of several of its strictest COVID-19 measures, which have been in effect through most of the pandemic and have been a drag on its population's morale, as well as on domestic and global economies. In the days after the protests, NHC officials urged local officials to lift lockdowns in a timely manner after outbreaks and signaled that they were considering further measures.

Against that backdrop, COVID activity has been rising steadily since November [2022], but health officials were reluctant to fully step down the measures, due to low vaccine uptake in older people.

Some of the changes announced today include allowing people with mild or asymptomatic infections to isolate at home, rather than in state facilities, and no longer requiring people to show proof of a negative test for entry into public places, according to the BBC.

Other steps include allowing rapid tests to replace polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in most instances, limiting lockdowns to narrowly targeted areas, shortening the lockdown period for outbreak areas, and allowing schools to remain open unless there are outbreaks on campus.

Authorities today also emphasized the need to vaccinate older people.

Weekly COVID cases remained stable for the second week in a row, with the Americas as the only region that saw a rise in cases, the WHO said in its weekly situation report.

Of nearly 3 million new cases reported to the WHO last week, the 5 countries that reported the most were Japan, France, South Korea, the United States, and Brazil.

Deaths dropped 17% compared to the previous week, reflecting declines or stable trends across all 6 world regions.

In the Americas, Brazil and Peru are among the countries reporting notable rises. The largest proportional rises were in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia.

In the United States, where cases largely remained steady, one of the hot spots is Los Angeles County, where cases have doubled since Thanksgiving [24 Nov 2022], according to the Los Angeles Times. Hospitalizations are rising but haven't reached a level that would trigger an indoor mask mandate.

Health officials are urging people to get their booster shots and wear masks when indoors and are pressing doctors to prescribe antiviral medication to eligible patients.

In an update on COVID activity in Europe from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), officials said cases declined 3.5% last week, with deaths down 35.2%. Less than a quarter of the cases were reported in seniors, but people ages 65 and older made up 92.2% of fatal cases.

In its update on variant activity, the WHO said that, for the week ending 20 Nov 2022, the proportion of BQ.1 and related lineages rose from 27.6% to 36.2% compared to the previous week, and the prevalence of XBB rose from 4.2% to 5%. BA.2.75 increased from 6.8% to 7.8%. Other subvariants declined or remained level.

Though most countries have cleared the updated mRNA bivalent (2-strain) boosters for use only after patients have received their primary doses, an European Medicines Agency (EMA) emergency task force yesterday [7 Dec 2022] said the boosters that cover the omicron BA.4/5 subvariants can be used for primary vaccination for children and adults.

The experts based their findings on data in unvaccinated people following natural infection with BA.4/5 when they had not been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.

In another vaccine development, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced it has expanded a deal with Massachusetts-based VBI Vaccines to advance the development of multivalent coronavirus vaccines that could be used to target an emerging strain.

VBI uses a proprietary virus-like-particle platform. The new funding will cover the broader development of VBI-2900, which targets future pandemic threats, and steps toward manufacturing scale-up. The company has three other candidate vaccines that are already in clinical development.

[B] South Korea: indoor mask mandate may be lifted in January 2023
Date: Wed 7 Dec 2022 15:16 KST
Source: The Korea Herald [abridged]
https://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20221207000465


South Korea's pandemic response authorities proposed on Wednesday [7 Dec 2022] to lift the nationwide indoor mask mandate as early as January next year [2023], with plans for policy talks and forums beginning this month [December 2022].

"As long as conditions (regarding the gravity of coronavirus) are met, (the eased mask rules) will come into effect at least in January [2023], or March [2023] at the latest," Peck Kyong-ran, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said in a briefing in Seoul Wednesday [7 Dec 2022].

Peck added the new rules will unlikely be applied to all buildings and facilities, so wearing a mask inside would remain in place for high-risk environments such as hospitals and senior care facilities.

The commissioner cited the reduced virulence of a COVID-19 pathogen, with immunity mainly due to vaccinations and infections, and so the reduced possibility of a sharp surge in infections. Over 65 percent of Korea's population has had 3 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

The remarks came immediately after Interior and Safety Minister Lee Sang-min revealed a final decision over the indoor mask mandate will be made before the end of this year [2023].

The adjustment in the mandate will come with prudence, Lee added, given that coronavirus remains contagious in the nation, with the reproduction number standing above 1 for the past seven weeks. Lee, who chaired the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters meeting in Seoul Wednesday [7 Dec 2022], said the next meeting on Friday [9 Dec 2022] will start working on adjustments to the current rule.

The announcements are in line with indications people may no longer be fined for not wearing a mask indoors in areas such as restaurants, coffee shops, and offices, amid disputes over the rule's efficacy. A violation of the indoor mask mandate is now punishable with a fine of up to 100 000 won (USD 76).

On Tuesday [6 Dec 2022], Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in a briefing hinted at the eased mask rules, saying that certain conditions suggested by medical experts could be met to lift the mask mandate in January [2023].

Jung Ki-suck, a top medical adviser of the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters, echoed Han, saying lifting the mask mandate in January [2023] "sounds plausible" as he projected Korea will achieve hybrid immunity by then, an apparent U-turn from Monday's briefing that the premature decision to ease the mask rule could put those at risk in danger.

The indoor mask mandate has been considered one of the last remaining sanitary measures to curb the spread of the virus in Korea.

If the indoor mask mandate is adjusted, it will mark the end of a nationwide rule that has been in place since October 2020 -- beginning 9 months after the country confirmed its 1st COVID-19 case.

In April 2022, Korea lifted its social distancing measures, which required shops and restaurants to limit the number of people inside as well as adhere to an early closing time. In May the outdoor mask mandate was removed, then in October, the government removed testing and quarantine requirements for those traveling to Korea.

Local governments have sought to make autonomous decisions to ditch the indoor mask mandate over the past few days. South Chungcheong Province, home to 2.1 million people, was the latest to express such intention, while Daejeon city with 1.4 million people is looking to eliminate the mask mandate beginning in January, regardless of the nationwide rules in effect.

Interior Minister Lee, however, downplayed the possibility of a regional disparity in the indoor mask rule, and instead stressed a "uniformity in (COVID-19) preventive measures in the face of what would likely be the last winter wave."

According to the government, any easing of COVID-19 rules by the provincial and local governments must be done upon consultation with the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters, while tightening mask rules can be done autonomously.

Meanwhile, the winter cold wave has led to a spike in infections over the past few days. On Wednesday, Korea saw 74 714 new daily cases of COVID-19, with total COVID infections reaching 27.48 million -- 53 percent of the population -- and the death toll reaching 30 847.

[C] USA: CDC encourages people to wear masks to help prevent spread of COVID, flu, and RSV over the holidays
Date: Mon 5 Dec 2022 6:04 EST
Source: CNBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/cdc-encourages-people-to-wear-masks-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-flu-rsv.html


Key points
----------
1. CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said wearing a mask is an everyday precaution that people can take to reduce their chances of catching or spreading a respiratory virus.

2. Flu and respiratory syncytial virus are circulating at high levels at the same time COVID is picking up, straining hospital emergency departments.

3. Walensky strongly encouraged everyone who is eligible, to receive their COVID booster and flu shot.

The Centers for Disease Control Prevention on Monday [5 Dec 2022] encouraged people to wear masks to help reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses this season as COVID, flu, and RSV circulate at the same time.

CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky, in a call with reporters, said wearing a mask is one of several everyday precautions that people can take to reduce their chances of catching or spreading a respiratory virus during the busy holiday season.

"We also encourage you to wear a high-quality, well-fitting mask to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses," said Walensky, adding that people living in areas with high levels of COVID transmission should especially consider masking.

The CDC director said the agency is considering expanding its system of COVID community levels to take into account other respiratory viruses such as the flu. The system is the basis for when CDC advises the public to wear masks. But Walensky encouraged people to take proactive action.

"One need not wait on CDC action in order to put a mask on," Walensky said. "We would encourage all of those preventive measures -- hand washing, staying home when you're sick, masking, increased ventilation -- during respiratory virus season, but especially in areas of high COVID-19 community levels."

About 5% of the US population lives in counties where the CDC is officially recommending masks due to high COVID levels. The CDC continues to recommend masking for anyone travelling by plane, train, bus, or other forms of public transportation, Walensky said.

People with weak immune systems and those who otherwise face a heightened risk of severe disease should also consider wearing a mask, the CDC director said.

Walensky strongly encouraged everyone eligible to receive their flu shot and COVID booster. Flu vaccination coverage is lagging for at-risk groups -- children under age 5, pregnant women, and at-risk seniors -- compared with last year [2021], the CDC director said. There is no vaccine for RSV.

"I want to emphasize that the flu vaccine can be life saving and importantly, there's still time to get vaccinated to be protected against flu this season and its potentially serious consequences," Walensky said.

The flu has arrived early and hit the US hard with hospitalizations at a decade high for this time of year. More than 8.7 million people have fallen ill, 78 000 have been hospitalized, and 4500 people have died from the flu this season, according to CDC data. 14 children have died from the flu so far this season [2022-23].

More than 19 000 people were hospitalized with the flu during the week ending [26 Nov 2022], nearly double the previous week, according to CDC data.

People hospitalized with COVID also increased by 27% during the week ending [2 Dec 2022], according to CDC data. And respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, has been hospitalizing children at [a] higher rate than in previous years. Walensky said RSV appears to have peaked in the Southeast and may be leveling off in the Mid-Atlantic, though circulation of the virus remains high in much of the nation.

"We now face yet another surge of illness. Another moment of overstretched capacity and really one of tragic and often preventable death," Walensky said, as she thanked healthcare workers for their service during the repeated surges of illness they have confronted since the COVID pandemic began.

Dr Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association, said the circulation of COVID, flu, and RSV at the same time is "a perfect storm for a terrible holiday season." Fryhofer said she understands many people are tired of receiving repeated COVID shots, but getting vaccinated is the best way to [avoid] falling ill over the holidays.

The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics last month [November 2022] asked the Biden administration to declare a public health emergency in response to the surge of pediatric hospitalizations from RSV and the flu.

[5] Post-COVID sequelae

Two new studies offer details about long COVID, with post-acute symptoms linked to disease severity in a Swedish cohort, and a Dutch study showing that almost half of COVID-19 patients reported lingering symptoms 90 days after infection.

The 1st study, an analysis in the Journal of Internal Medicine [ref 1], identifies several characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of developing long COVID, with the condition most common in patients who required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The study included 204 805 Swedish adults with confirmed COVID-19 infections between 1 Mar 2020, and 31 Jul 2021. All participants lived in Stockholm County. Study subjects were followed for the outcome from 90 to 360 days after their 1st positive SARS-CoV-2 test.

Of the participants, post-COVID condition (PCC) was diagnosed in 1% among individuals not hospitalized for their COVID-19 infection, 6% among the hospitalized, and 32% among ICU-treated patients.

Females were more likely to receive a PCC diagnosis, as were middle-aged adults. Elderly adults were not at increased risk for PCC, the authors said. Disease severity, however, was the most predictive factor of PCC.

"Among hospitalized and ICU-treated individuals, the occurrence of PCC diagnosis was associated with an increased length of stay in the hospital/ICU during the acute infection," the authors wrote. "Among non hospitalized individuals, 83% had their PCC diagnosed in primary care only, compared to 72% and 31% for the hospitalized and ICU-treated individuals, respectively."

The most common symptoms seen upon PCC diagnoses for non-hospitalized patients were fatigue (seen in 29%) and anxiety (21%). Difficulty breathing was seen in both hospitalized (25%) and ICU-treated (41%) individuals.

The authors said, however, that many participants had documented health visits related to anxiety and fatigue before COVID-19 infection.

"Our finding of around 50%-60% of individuals with a PCC diagnosis having symptom diagnoses concordant with the WHO definition of PCC before the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection indicates that some of the disease burden could be wrongly attributed to COVID-19 or that COVID-19 accentuates pre-existing conditions," they concluded.

In a news release from Wiley, the journal's publisher, 1st author Pontus Hedberg, MD, said, "Our understanding of health effects beyond the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is continuously improving. In this study, we observed a marked difference in the occurrence of post-COVID-19 condition diagnosis across different severities of the acute infection.

"Furthermore, the elevated outpatient primary and specialist care use indicates poor recovery for individuals suffering from post-COVID-19 condition, highlighting the urgent need to better understand this condition and its potential resolution over time."

The 2nd study [ref 2] is based on a Dutch cohort during the delta wave. It shows that, 3 months after acute infection, 48.5% of COVID-19 patients reported at least one significantly elevated symptom, compared with 29.8% of test-negative controls and 26.0% of population controls.

Moreover, vaccination was significantly protective for loss of smell and taste but not for other symptoms 3 months after acute infection.

The study was published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. In total, 9166 cases, 1698 symptomatic but test-negative controls, and 3708 population controls were enrolled. Case patients had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from [19 May to 13 Dec 2021].

Of the 41 symptoms assessed, only 13 were increased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Fatigue (31.1%), loss of smell (12.0%), labored breathing (16.4%), concentration difficulties (15.0%), and difficulties in busy environments (13.1%) showed the largest difference in prevalence.

In COVID-19 patients who had been previously vaccinated, vaccination was protective only against loss of taste and smell, and no other long-COVID symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
"The occurrence and healthcare use trajectory of post-COVID-19 condition (PCC) is poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate these aspects in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals with and without a PCC diagnosis.

Methods
"We conducted a population-based cohort study of adults in Stockholm, Sweden, with a verified infection from [1 Mar 2020 to 31 Jul 2021], stratified by the severity of the acute infection. The outcome was a PCC diagnosis registered any time 90-360 days after a positive test. We performed Cox regression models to assess baseline characteristics associated with the PCC diagnosis. Individuals diagnosed with PCC were then propensity-score matched to individuals without a diagnosis to assess healthcare use beyond the acute infection.

Results
"Among 204 805 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, the proportion receiving a PCC diagnosis was 1% among individuals not hospitalized for their COVID-19 infection, 6% among hospitalized, and 32% among intensive care unit (ICU)-treated individuals. The most common new-onset symptom diagnosis codes among individuals with a PCC diagnosis were fatigue (29%) among non-hospitalized and dyspnea among both hospitalized (25%) and ICU-treated (41%) individuals. Female sex was associated with a PCC diagnosis among non-hospitalized and hospitalized individuals, with interactions between age and sex. Previous mental health disorders and asthma were associated with a PCC diagnosis among non-hospitalized and hospitalized individuals. Among individuals with a PCC diagnosis, the monthly proportion with outpatient care was substantially elevated up to 1 year after acute infection compared to before, with substantial proportions of this care attributed to PCC-related care.

Conclusion
"The differential association of age, sex, comorbidities, and healthcare use with the severity of the acute infection indicates different trajectories and phenotypes of PCC, with incomplete resolution 1 year after infection."

Abstract
--------
Background
"This prospective study assesses symptoms 3 months after SARS-CoV-2-infection compared to test-negative and population controls, and the effect of vaccination prior to infection.

Methods
"Participants enrolled after a positive (cases) or negative (test-negative controls) SARS-CoV-2-test, or after invitation from the general population (population controls). After three months, participants indicated [the] presence of 41 symptoms, and the severity of 4 symptoms. Permutation tests were used to select symptoms significantly elevated in cases compared to controls and to compare symptoms between cases that were vaccinated or unvaccinated prior to infection.

Results
"9166 cases, 1698 symptomatic but test-negative controls, and 3708 population controls enrolled. At 3 months, 13 symptoms, and severity of fatigue, cognitive impairment, and dyspnoea, were significantly elevated between cases and controls. Of cases, 48.5% reported ≥1 significantly elevated symptom, compared to 29.8% of test-negative controls and 26.0% of population controls. Effect of vaccination could be determined for cases <65yrs, and was significantly protective for loss of smell and taste but not for other symptoms.

Discussion
"3 months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, almost half of cases report symptoms, which is higher than background prevalence and test-negative prevalence. Vaccination prior to infection was protective against loss of smell and taste in cases aged <65."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
This study aimed to assess pulmonary and muscle dysfunction by analyzing the slow component of oxygen uptake (VO2SC), and mechanical and ventilatory efficiency in adult women recovered from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type II (SARS-CoV-2) during a constant load test. 32 women (N = 17 patients with SARS-CoV-2; N = 15 control group) performed two cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPX) on a cycle ergometer.

In the 1st test, the participants performed incremental CPX until extenuation. In the 2nd test the participants performed a 10-min CPX at a constant load intensity (watts) corresponding to the 1st ventilatory threshold. There was a 48-72 h rest period between the 2 tests. There was a significant increase in the VO2SC in the patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 (160.4 ± 60 mL min-1) in comparison with the healthy participants (59.6 ± 65 mL min-1) (P < 0.001).

Mechanical efficiency significantly decreased in patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 compared to the control group (P = 0.04). Ventilatory inefficiency significantly increased in the patients who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Adult women recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection have important pulmonary and muscular dysfunction and fatigue which contributes to increasing the VO2SC and reducing mechanical and ventilatory efficiency during mild-moderate exercise at a constant load.

[The total number of new cases reported over the past 7 days (+73 678) is much lower than in the previous week (+238 874) according to Worldometer data.

It is useful to note that the current data reflects a combination of actual fluctuations in case numbers in each location and changing patterns in testing or case detection in those locations. As many locations gradually relax COVID-19-related testing and prevention measures while transitioning into different ways to "live with the virus," reporting to health authorities of cases in locations that do not mandate PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections may not be fully captured by national-level statistics. - Mod.LWW]
