Cholera in the Americas -- situation summary
--------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2015 up to epidemiological week (EW) 32 of 2015, a total of 21 227 cases have been recorded in 3 countries in the Region of the Americas: Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. Haiti alone registered 98 per cent (20 830) of the total cases in the Region of the Americas. Meanwhile in Brazil, the isolation of toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1, serotype Ogawa in samples from a treatment plant wastewater in the Federal District was reported in EW 33 of 2015. The finding was confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory for Diagnosis of Enteric Bacterial Infections of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) in Rio de Janeiro.

In Cuba, on 29 Aug 2015, national health authorities reported that isolated cases of cholera have been confirmed in the province of Holguin in the past few weeks. Active control measures are being implemented aggressively.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) to EW 32 of 2015, a total of 33 160 suspected cholera cases, including 490 deaths, were recorded. Between EW 1 and EW 32 of 2015, a total of 396 suspected cholera cases were registered, including 12 deaths. This represents the double of the cases recorded for the same period in 2014. In addition, between EW 31 and EW 32 of 2015, an outbreak was recorded in the Bonao municipality, province of Monsenor Nouel. An irrigation canal was identified as the main source related to that outbreak as indicated in the Dominican Republic Epidemiological Bulletin for EW 32.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) through 8 August 2015, there were 745 401 cholera cases, of which 426 856 were hospitalized (57 per cent cumulative hospitalization rate), and 8965 deaths, with a national cumulative case fatality rate of 1.2 per cent. From January up to EW 32 of 2015, there were 20 830 cholera cases, including 16 522 hospitalizations (79 per cent hospitalization rate), and 179 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.9 per cent). On average, there were around 650 new cholera cases and 6 deaths registered by week. In 2015, the number of cases and deaths recorded by epidemiological week show an increase in comparison to the corresponding weeks in previous years.

[Haiti continues, despite much overt reporting, to be the top of the haystack for cholera cases underscoring the continued inability of health organizations to effectively reverse the epidemic. Providing clean safe water and adequate sanitation can go a long way to help minimize the situation there. It is not likely that _V. cholerae_ will soon disappear from the water there.

About 300 affected by outbreaks of diarrhea and cholera in Holguin according to official reports
------------------------------------------------------------------
About "300 patients affected" by cholera and diarrhea outbreaks have been reported in Holguin in recent months, the local newspaper reported in its print edition of this Saturday [12 Sep 2015]. Some have required "special attention for serious conditions" without specifying such data or clarifying whether there have been deaths.

The official publication attributes the spread of disease mainly to "irresponsible attitude", among which are listed the "consumption of unsafe water sources", buying food products of "dubious origin", and the "unscrupulous attitude" of those who sell them. The report does not specify how many of the cases that have been detected corresponded to cholera or to many other diarrheal diseases.

It was noted that "one of the main events of cholera" registered in the provincial capital, in the Lenin District and New Llano, in August 2015, was associated with the ingestion of carbonated soft drink.
