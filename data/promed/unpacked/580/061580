Dengue viruses, transmission by _Aedes albopictus_ 980425215206

From: Luiz Jacintho da Silva <luisjs@guttenberg.correionet.com.br>

In the state of Sao Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, _Ae albopictus_ has not
been associated with dengue transmission. It is, however, a recently
introduced species. Albeit widely dispersed throughout the state, and
co-existing with _Ae aegypti_, it is found mostly in rural and peri-urban
sites.
We mustn't forget that biological clocks have different speeds, there is
no guarantee that after years of close proximity with dengue virus in
Brazil, _ Ae albopictus_ will not become adapted to transmission.
I would pose a question: is dengue transmission by _Ae albopictus_ in
southeast Asia strain-related, i.e., is it different with DEN-1, 2, 3 or
4?
