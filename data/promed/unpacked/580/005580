More than 40 million people attacked by animals annually
--------------------------------------------------------
More than 40 million people in the Chinese mainland are attacked by
animals annually, a recently released Ministry of Health report said,
according to the Xinhuanet News Agency. The number was calculated
from the amount of rabies vaccine [administered] every year.

The Ministry of Health also said China is one of the countries most
threatened by rabies. In recent years, an average of more than 2400
people in China have died from rabies infections annually. Only India
has a higher number of rabies-related fatalities, according to
Xinhuanet.

Most rabies deaths in the past 5 years occurred in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region and the [southern] provinces of Guizhou, Guangdong,
Hunan and Sichuan, accounting for 60.85 percent of the total, the
Ministry of Health report said.

The number of cases in the central and northern parts of China also
increased in the last few years, the report said. It also noted that
rabies infections mostly occurred in rural areas among males,
children under the age of 15, and people over the age of 50.

Rabies is an acute infectious disease which can be contracted by both
human and dogs, and is often spread through dog bites.
