Bovine TB detected in Shiawasee County deer
-------------------------------------------
Test results have confirmed that a deer harvested in the late
antlerless deer season in Shiawassee County was infected with bovine
tuberculosis (TB) (_Mycobacterium bovis_). This discovery comes over
100 miles south of the current bovine TB zone in Northern Michigan
which encompasses southeast Montmorency County, southwest Alpena
County, northwest Alcona County, and northeast Oscoda County.

On 3 Mar 2008, the Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) will
designate a "potential high-risk area" within a 10-mile radius of
where the Shiawassee County deer was taken. Any cattle, bison, and
cervid farms within the 10-mile radius will need to be checked for
bovine TB.

"In the past, MDA designated potential high-risk areas in Osceola and
Mecosta counties. In accordance with state law, these designations
were dropped after 6 months of testing revealed no additional bovine
TB," said Michigan Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian
Steven Halstead. "There are approximately 100 farms around the
positive deer in Shiawassee County, and herds on these farms are
being scheduled for surveillance testing."

Large scale testing is slated to begin early in March [2008],
according to Halstead.

"The Michigan Department of Agriculture and USDA will oversee the
Shiawassee County cattle herd testing effort with an Incident
Management Team, which will begin in early March," he said.
"Utilizing this type of response strategy will be effective in
reaching the overall goals of the bovine TB program."

Although testing has confirmed the presence of bovine TB in the deer,
more specific test results are still not in.

"Further strain typing of the isolated bacteria to determine the
strain of bovine TB will take a few more weeks," said Michigan
Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Veterinarian Steve Schmitt.

Each year, the DNR conducts routine surveillance efforts in every
Michigan county for both TB and Chronic Wasting Disease. With the
cooperation of county officials, DNR has already begun testing
road-killed deer within a 10-mile radius of the Shiawassee County
deer for bovine TB. Next fall surveillance efforts will be increased,
testing a minimum of 300 hunter-harvested animals in that area.

Since the bovine TB eradication effort began in 1995, all of the
state's one million cattle have been tested for the disease, with no
TB found in cattle outside the bovine TB Zone, noted Bridget Patrick
of the Michigan Department of Agriculture.

For more than a decade both the Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
and the Michigan Department of Agriculture have worked with Michigan
sportsmen to eliminate bovine tuberculosis in Michigan's white-tailed
deer population. To date, the DNR has tested nearly 162 000 wild
white-tailed deer, with 594 testing positive for bovine TB.

Strategies adopted by the DNR to reduce bovine TB in the wild
white-tailed deer have reduced the prevalence rate of the disease
from the high in 1995 of 4.9 percent to 2.3 percent in 2006 in the TB
Core Area, located in southeast Montmorency County, southwest Alpena
County, northwest Alcona County, and northeast Oscoda County.

With rare exception deer do not move as move as much as many people
might believe. The vast majority stay within a couple of mile radius
of a home territory. Of course lack of food or high predator pressure
can force them out of the comfort zone.

So a deer this far out of the TB zone is unusual. We look forward to
the results of the tests the state will be conducting. - Mod.TG]
