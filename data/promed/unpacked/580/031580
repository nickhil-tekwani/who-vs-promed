65 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have been
registered in Tatarstan during the past 5 months. During the same
period in 2007, 99 cases were recorded. In June 2008, 36 cases were
registered in Kazan, one case with a lethal outcome. In June 2007, 2
fatalities were recorded. Patients contracted the infection while
spending time in forests and on fishing trips. According to
zoologists in Tatarstan, the increasing incidence of HFRS is
connected with a high survival rate of rodents during the winter.
Zoologists predict that the incidence of HFRS in 2008 will be much
higher in comparison with 2007.

[Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of
clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses from the family
_Bunyaviridae_. HFRS is found throughout the world. Haantan virus is
widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia,
and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and
Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul
virus is found worldwide.

Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can
become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to
aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after
exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when
infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into
broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth.
Rodents are the natural reservoir for hantaviruses. Known carriers
include the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), the reservoir
for Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the
reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_),
the reservoir for Puumala virus; and the yellow-necked field mouse
(_Apodemus flavicollis_), which carries Dobrava virus.

It would be useful to have some up-to-date information regarding the
identities of the hantavirus responsible for HFRS in this part of
Russia and the predominant species of rodent involved in its transmission.
