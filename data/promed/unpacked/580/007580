Resistant-bacteria reports cause alarm
5 cases are seen in Boston patients
-----------------------
5 men in Boston have been infected with a powerful, drug-resistant
bacteria, strikingly similar to larger outbreaks in Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
Beginning last fall, doctors at the Fenway Community Health Center started
seeing patients with pneumonia, sinus infections, and skin conditions
caused by methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ -- a germ normally
caught only in hospitals by patients already seriously ill from other diseases.
The germ, known as MRSA, can elude a whole class of antibiotics, making the
illness significantly more difficult to treat.
Its appearance in the general community has alarmed health authorities. All
5 of the men have been treated and recovered without lasting complications,
but doctors are worried about the broader emergence of bacteria so wily
that they can outrun the best drugs that medicine can produce.
"It's of great concern," said Dr. Scott Fridkin, a medical epidemiologist
at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "The reports are
becoming more frequent, and it appears to be a growing problem."
Fenway physicians alerted the CDC about the cluster of cases, and the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health has begun an investigation,
hoping to establish whether the cases are linked and, if so, to identify a
common source of infection. The men are all HIV-positive, but neither
physicians providing treatment nor disease investigators can say with
certainty that the patients' HIV status had anything to do with the
bacterial infection.
"There's no clear, obvious link that we can pick up with this," said Dr.
Stephen L. Boswell, executive director of the Fenway center. "It could take
months before we know what's going on here."
Drug-resistant bacteria are especially perilous because people infected
with them typically don't know -- and neither do their doctors. That means
they're often started on main-line antibiotics, which do not work because
the bacteria has found a way to get around that drug. In the meantime, the
patients get sicker as the bacteria advances, until doctors find an
antibiotic that will work.
And the threat is not limited to the patient with the original infection.
That resistant bug can spread to other people, which can ignite a cascade
of illness only treatable by more powerful pills or even antibiotics given
intravenously.
Drug-resistant bacteria arrived in Boston in the late 1960s and early 1970s
in hospital wards, said Dr. Alfred DeMaria, state director of communicable
disease control, and they have remained chiefly a problem in hospitals.
That's because patients are already sick, and many have undergone surgery,
leaving them with incisions vulnerable to infection. ''What's really new is
the degree to which they are turning up in community-acquired settings,''
DeMaria said. "But I suppose it was sort of inevitable."
On the West Coast, outbreaks of similar staph infections have stricken
hundreds of patients, with 928 reported in Los Angeles County jails during
2002. And earlier this year, public health agencies in LA and San Francisco
both reported clusters of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in
those cities' gay communities.
Staph bacteria are pervasive, typically causing few problems. But if they
invade a cut or other opening in the skin, they can cause painful skin
infections, bone infections, pneumonia, and life-threatening blood conditions.
In the past, staph cases in the community have been treated with first-line
antibiotics, such as Keflex. But it is exactly those sorts of drugs that
some strains of the bacteria are outwitting.
"It's something we need to be on the outlook for and get better data on,"
said Dr. Anita Barry, director of communicable disease control at the
Boston Public Health Commission.
To prevent further spread of antibiotic-resistant staph, specialists
recommend many of the same measures used to stop other infections,
including rigorous hand-washing. Patients with persistent skin infections
are encouraged to contact their doctors, and they are urged to make sure
that any sores are properly covered.

[This small cluster of apparently diverse types of infections with MRSA
appears to parallel that in gay male populations in other states, though
these HIV-positive cases have the additional issue of potential
immunocompromise. Molecular typing of the isolates, for example by
Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) may be able to determine whether
these isolates are related to each other or to those from the other
outbreaks. As stated in previous moderator's comments, the ongoing
emergence of MRSA acquired in the community (as opposed to nosocomial
occurrence, which has been common for some time) will mandate escalation in
the use of vancomycin for empiric treatment of staphylococcal infections,
with an attendant increase in the risk for the emergence of
vancomycin-resistant bacteria. - Mod.LM]
