The Municipal Center for Early Childhood Education (CMEI) Maria Vila de Carvalho, in the municipality of Marumbi in the state of Parana in the Southern Region of Brazil, suspended activities this week due to an outbreak of impetigo, a highly contagious skin disease, according to a Tribuna report.

City health officials confirmed that 11 cases of the disease were registered and 27 others reported, mainly among children from 4 months to 5 years of age.

Impetigo is a common bacterial skin infection that can produce blisters or sores anywhere on the body, but usually on the face (around the nose and mouth), neck, hands, and diaper area. It's contagious, preventable, and manageable with antibiotics. Two types of bacteria found on our skin cause impetigo: _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (which also causes strep throat). The symptoms of impetigo are present -- itchy red sores that fill with fluid and then burst open, forming a yellow crust, as well as itchy rash and fluid-filled blisters. Impetigo is usually treated with topical or oral antibiotics.

Because impetigo spreads by skin-to-skin contact, there often are small outbreaks within a family or a classroom. Avoid touching objects that someone with impetigo has used, such as utensils, towels, sheets, clothing and toys. If you have impetigo, keep your fingernails short so the bacteria can't live under your nails and spread. Also, don't scratch the sores.

[Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial infection of the skin that especially affects the skin around the nose and mouth, but can spread to other areas around the body. Blisters burst, leaving honey-colored crusts. It is caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or _Staphylococcus aureus_ and occurs more commonly in infants and children than adults. It is transmitted primarily from direct contact with someone who has impetigo or by contact with contaminated objects such as towels, toys, clothing, or household items.

Hot humid weather and the presence of eczema predispose to developing impetigo. Antibiotic therapy can shorten the course of the disease and help prevent the spread to others. The patient may no longer be contagious 24-48 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. Impetigo may be complicated by post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which cannot be prevented by prior antibiotic therapy for the impetigo.
