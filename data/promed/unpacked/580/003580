Seven Ponies Dead from R. equi Outbreak in Mayotte
--------------------------------------------------
Seven ponies have died at an equestrian center located on the Indian Ocean island of Mayotte [map at http://healthmap.org/r/1QUp]
following a _Rhodococcus equi_ outbreak, according to local agriculture officials.

The Departmental Federation of Farmer's Unions (FDSEA) of Mayotte reported that 2 other ponies at the Hajangua equestrian center on the eastern coast of the Mozambique Channel were infected but have been treated and are recovering. Health officials have placed the facility under quarantine until the epidemic is considered resolved.

"The managers of the center have acted very responsibly in this situation, working closely with veterinarians and breeding professionals," an FDSEA press release read.

Guillaume Chenut, DVM, associate director of the region's Department of Agriculture (DAF), revealed that laboratory analyses results of blood samples taken from horses residing at the equestrian center revealed the presence of _R. equi_, according to the Internet news site Malango Actualite.

_R. equi_ is an opportunistic bacterium that often causes bronchopneumonia in foals up to about 5 months old, but it does not usually affect adult animals unless they are immunosuppressed, according to Robert van der Geize, DVM, PhD, molecular biologist and head of the molecular pathology department of the Laboratorium Pathologie Oost Nederland, in Enschede, the Netherlands. Van der Geize recently worked for several years on developing a vaccine against the disease with some success.

"It is indeed unexpected that adult ponies would be affected by a _Rhodococcus equi_ infection, and in fact a serious outcome of the infection is mostly observed in foals," van der Geize said.

_R. equi_ can survive and reproduce inside a horse's lung cells but is also found in their droppings, according to van der Geize. Treatment with antibiotics is usually long and expensive and unfortunately not often successful.

The riding center remains open for activities, according to the FDSEA, despite being under quarantine and significant hardship after losing more than a third of its equine tenants.

[_Rhodococcus equi_ was 1st described in 1923 as _Corynebacterium equi_. In 1977, it was reclassified as _R. equi_. It is a zoonotic disease, mainly affecting immunocompromised humans, mostly resulting in pneumonia with fever, cough, and chest pain, but can also spread to other organs and cause bacteremia.

In addition to equines and humans, other mammals have also been reported as
sporadically infected: pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, llama, cats, and dogs.

In pigs, _R. equi_ can cause a chronic cervical lymphadenitis with
tuberculosis-like lesions, but also found in submaxillary lymph nodes and
tonsils of healthy animals.

_R. equi_ can cause tuberculosis-like lesions in lymph nodes of cattle and
in the livers of young goats.- Mod.AS.
