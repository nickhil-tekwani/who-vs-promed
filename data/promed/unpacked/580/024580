Polio Outbreak Now Under Control
--------------------------
Although the presence of poliovirus has been confirmed in fewer than a dozen patients, more are showing the classic symptoms of poliovirus
infection, including paralysis. It has been known for many years that the
[infectious viruses constituting the Sabin oral polio vaccines can survive
passage through the body. [Infectious virus which passes successfully
through the gut may be excreted in the faeces [and can give rise to
contamination of watercourses and sewers. [During replication in the gut,
attenuated virus may regain virulence. Such virulent virus may be able to
infect [non-immune humans and cause illness, and also to pass from human
to human.
There have been several examples of cases of poliomyelitis thought to have been caused by vaccine viruses, particularly among those with suppressed
immune systems. However, the Hispaniola incident appears to be the first where there has been an outbreak, rather than individual isolated
cases. The 2 island states are thought to be most at risk because vaccination rates were low. Additionally, because no wild poliovirus has
been found for some time, natural immunity was also low.
Dr. Ciro de Quadros, Director of the Division of Vaccines and
Immunisation at the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO), said
the outbreak was now under control. [Supplementary oral polio
vaccination has been successful. However, he added: "It is a powerful
reminder that even polio-free areas need to maintain high coverage
with polio vaccine until [world-wide polio eradication has been
achieved."
Others, however, are saying this is a potential hurdle for the World
Health Organisation's hopes of worldwide polio eradication by 2005.
WHO experts had always hoped that while the occasional isolated case
of polio caused by the oral polio vaccine viruses might occur,
outbreaks were unlikely even in a community with low vaccination
rates. Funding further vaccination programmes using non-live viruses
might prove too expensive for the WHO.
