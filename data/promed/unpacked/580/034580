Brucellosis is a zoonosis resulting in reproductive failure in wild
and domestic animals and febrile disease and occasionally severe
infections of the central nervous system and endocarditis in humans.
In animals and humans alike, it is found worldwide, including
southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean basin (Portugal, Spain,
southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, northern Africa), parts of
Mexico, Central and Latin America, Asia, and Africa (1). Human
brucellosis represents a professional hazard, being acquired via
ingestion, inhalation in laboratories or abattoirs, conjunctiva and
skin trauma contamination with infected animal tissues and products
(1,2). Symptoms can appear as acute or insidious onset, after 5 to 60
days and last for days, months and occasionally as long as a year.
Relapses can also occur. Treatment is effective with antibiotics.
Untreated brucellosis can lead to death (case-fatality ratio around 2
percent), usually by heart complications.

Epidemiological situation in Greece
-----------------------------------
Between 2000 and 2007, the mean yearly incidence rate of brucellosis
in Greece was 2.9/100 000 population. The annual incidence rate shows
a decreasing tendency: 5 in 2000, 3.7 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2.2 in
2003, 2.1 in 2004, 3.1 in 2005, 2.6 in 2006, and 1.38 in 2007. The
data indicate that the disease mainly affects rural areas of the
mainland, all cases either engaged in a high-risk occupation
(shepherds, workers in animal husbandry, vets) or sharing
unpasteurized milk or dairy products with friends and relatives (3-5).

Strict regulation in Greece only permits the circulation in the
market of licensed producers' fully processed milk and its products
(either pasteurized or cheese matured for at least 3 months before
consumption) and Human Public Health and Veterinary Public Health
authorities in all prefectures of the country ensure implementation
by performing regular inspections in all restaurants, hotels,
catering establishments and other settings. During the summer months,
the Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity (MHSS) reinforces more
frequent inspections for the prevention of all foodborne diseases,
including brucellosis.

The majority of islands, including Thassos of Kavala mainland
Prefecture, are free from human cases and herds are considered
brucellosis-free, with serology conducted sporadically that prove
this. The Ministry of Rural Development and Food (MRDF), regularly
provides these results to the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (HCDCP) and the MHSS, both of which it collaborates with
closely. All animals are tested before importation to the islands, so
no brucellosis vaccination is conducted thereafter. On the other
hand, in mainland Greece the brucellosis control program includes
vaccination of herds and regular testing for brucellosis.

Outbreak in Thassos
-------------------
No cases of human brucellosis were reported in Thassos in 2007 or
during the 1st quarter of 2008, until early May 2008, when a
considerable number of cases were notified to the Department of
Epidemiologic Surveillance and Intervention, of the HCDCP MHSS (Table
1 [for tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The onset of symptoms of
the 1st case was 1 Apr 2008. As of 17 Jun 2008, 55 human cases have
been reported: 53 had consumed unpasteurized milk and/or dairy
products (Figure 1 [for figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]): 8 had a
high-risk profession (6 herd owners and 2 butchers), and 9 had had
systematic contact with sheep and/or goats. A total of 50 cases and 5
cases were permanent residents of Thassos and Kavala respectively,
the age ranging from 8 to 88 years old, with a median of 46 years,
sparing only 0-4 years old (Figure 2); 26 cases were male, 29 female.

Laboratory results
------------------
All cases reported tested positive for brucellosis (Standard
Agglutination Test), except for 1 patient who met the clinical and
epidemiological criteria while the laboratory result was pending when
reported. 8 were asymptomatic while testing positive, 6 of whom
reported consumption of non-pasteurized milk/dairy products, and 2
reported their husbands' illness and high-risk profession.

There is a widespread custom among local residents of Thassos of
consuming unpasteurized milk and its products around Easter-time in
their households. This does not affect tourists from Greece or abroad
visiting the island.

Control measures
----------------
There is a a standard procedure of close cooperation between the
Human Public Health (HPH) and Veterinary Public Health (VPH)
officials at the local level in the Prefectures of Greece, under the
constant supervision of the Unit for Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases,
of the HCDCP-MHSS, and the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.
More specifically, once the HPH is informed by physicians of the
National Health System (general practicioners, internists,
pediatricians) of a single human brucellosis case, they define the
animals or flock linked in any way with the patient and immediately
provide this information to the Veterinary Public Health office so
that brucellosis serology and/or testing of milk and its products are
conducted in the veterinary reference laboratories. If indicated, the
herd immediately undergoes all measures indicated by the brucellosis
eradication and control programme operating in Greece. A spontaneous
sharing of all data has been established across the country among
local HPH, VPH authorities, HCDCP, and the General Veterinary
Directorate, MRDF.

Soon after the 1st human case was notified early in May 2008 in
Thassos, the above spontaneous usual procedures resulted in positive
herd serologies. The HPH officials, being aware of the local habit,
distributed advice to all health authorities, and to all residents,
door to door, suggesting the destruction of any improperly processed
milk products in households.

Currently, the slaughter of seropositive animals and vaccination has
been applied to all herds of the island, which is the control program
already operating across mainland Greece (6), and this will continue
until the island is again free of brucellosis.

Coordinated HPH and VPH inspections in all restaurants, groceries,
hotels, and other settings proved that only licensed products were
circulated in the market. A rapid telephone survey with a structured
questionnaire was conducted by the Unit for Zoonoses and Foodborne
Diseases, HCDCP, and all interviewed cases confirmed that these
household products were not offered to any tourist in any setting.

Work on a case control study has been initiated and is scheduled to
take place shortly.

Conclusions
-----------
Brucellosis is a disease of public health priority in Greece. The HPH
and VPH authorities (7) at the central and local levels have a close
collaboration and integration, aiming at the target of eradicating
the disease which, judging by both reported cases and comments from
leading hospitals? microbiologists, is thought to be in decline
regarding annual incidence in the country. According to the
information we have on this outbreak at the time of writing, it is
unlikely that any tourists were exposed to brucellosis on Thassos. In
addition, the public health measures applied after this local
outbreak ensure that there is no future risk for tourists visiting the island.

[Brucellosis is considered a Category B bioterrorism agent, which is,
in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its
manifestations are protean, including undulant fever, with positive
blood and/or bone marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized
disease in many organ systems including skeletal, urinary tract,
central nervous system, liver, heart, and lung. With a caprine and
ovine source, the organism here is probably _B. meletensis_.

The location of Thassos in the northern aspect of the Aegean Sea can
be found on a map at:

[_B. melitensis_ is maintained mainly within small ruminants (sheep
and goats), though cases in cattle and buffaloes may occur sporadically.

Efforts to eradicate _B. melitensis_ from the European countries
affected (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, and Greece) have been under
way -- with EU support -- for a long period; though total eradication
has not been achieved yet, advances in three of them have been
encouraging. The continued, significant animal infection in Greece is
a cause for concern.

According to the reports of Greece to the OIE, 171 outbreaks of
B.melitensis in sheep and goats have been recorded during 2006 and 54
during 2007. The above described outbreak in humans is a cause for
concern regarding the rate of eradication achieved; moreover, it is
indicative of surveillance deficiencies.

EU's Food and Veterinary Office Programme of Audits and Inspections
for 2008 includes a planned inspection of the Greek system, covering
also its Tuberculosis and Brucellosis Eradication Control . A
similar inspection is planned for Portugal. Reports will be awaited
with interest.- Mod. AS]
