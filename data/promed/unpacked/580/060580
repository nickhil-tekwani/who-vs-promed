[Regarding the report from Sweden, although the neuraminidase has not yet been typed, there is a high likelihood that these findings may also be associated with subtype H5N8. On 23 Nov 2016 Sweden reported HPAI H5N8 detected in the same county where the current outbreak was notified.

A map of H5N8 HPAI outbreaks officially reported in Asia and Europe by onset date, since 1 June 2016 is available at, (update 25 Nov 2016)

A webinar titled "Intercontinental spread of H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza - Analysis of the current situation and recommendations for preventive action", targeting national veterinary services and FAO regional and country teams, was conducted by FAO on 24 November 2016.
