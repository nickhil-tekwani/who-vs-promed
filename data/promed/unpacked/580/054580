The chickenpox outbreak that in late October [2018] started at a private school isn't over, according to [Buncombe] county health officials, who say the virus has sickened people outside of the school.

In addition to the 37 Asheville Waldorf School students who contracted chickenpox in the weeks following the 1st case, 4 people in the community have become ill, according to the Buncombe County Department of Health and Human Services.

State health officials have deemed this North Carolina's worst chickenpox outbreak since the mid-1990s, when a vaccine for the virus went into circulation.

The onset of rash in the most recent Asheville case occurred [Mon 26 Nov 2018], said Buncombe health department spokeswoman Stacey Wood.

Wood would not say whether the 4 cases outside of Asheville Waldorf School were reported in parents or the friends of sickened students.

There are no longer any pending quarantine orders, the last of which expired on 20 Nov 2018, she said.

The health department, acting in accordance with the rules set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will not declare Asheville's chickenpox outbreak finished until 42 days after the onset of the most recent case.

This chickenpox outbreak drew national attention as the West Asheville private school became the battleground for debate over the efficacy of vaccines.

Roughly 75 percent of the school's 152 students -- ranging in age from 2 to 12 -- hadn't received a varicella vaccine. Varicella is the virus responsible for both chickenpox and shingles.

Barring 2 outliers, Asheville Waldorf had the highest percentage of incoming kindergartners during 2017 whose parents had claimed religious exemption from one or more mandatory vaccine.

In North Carolina, a religious exemption can be obtained with relative ease. There is no official paperwork. State statute, however, doesn't allow parents to forgo vaccination for their children based on their personal beliefs.

After county health officials learned of the early chickenpox cases at Asheville Waldorf School in the final days of October [2018], the Buncombe health department issued a quarantine order to 104 students.

[It appears only 25% of the school's children are vaccinated with measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, which creates a very dangerous public health situation. The unvaccinated children were quarantined for 3 weeks to protect them from infection. A judge struck down a portion of the quarantine order, ruling the county had the authority to keep children out of school but couldn't prevent them from leaving home. -Mod.LK]

[2] USA-Mexico border (Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico)

Several thousand Central American migrants are living in a filthy, overcrowded sports complex near the US-Mexico border. They are facing sickness and indefinite waits amid shifting US border policies.

Since the migrants began cramming into the complex in Tijuana, Mexico, there have been multiple cases of respiratory illnesses, lice, and chicken pox, 3 city officials told Reuters.

Many of the people have been living in tents made of trash bags, or on patches of cold floor walled off with backpacks.

Since the bedraggled men, women, and children of a caravan of mostly Hondurans began cramming into the complex in the Mexican border city of Tijuana about 3 weeks ago, there have been multiple cases of respiratory illnesses, lice and chicken pox, according to 3 city officials who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

With too many to fit into shelters in a city used to receiving deportees and migrants, the caravan, which had traveled about 3000 miles (4800 kilometers) since mid-October 2018, was ushered into the complex to wait until US and Mexican authorities settled on how to deal with it.
