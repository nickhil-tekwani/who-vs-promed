[1] USA: Texas quarantine over

At least one chapter of the Ebola saga neared a close Sun [19 Oct 2014], as most of the dozens of people who had direct or indirect contact here with D, the Liberian man who died of Ebola, were told by officials that they were no longer at risk of contracting the disease.

D's fiance, who nursed him in their cramped apartment while he suffered from diarrhea and who was put under state-ordered quarantine, was set to be declared Ebola-free by officials at the end of Sunday [19 Oct 2014]. So, too, were the paramedics who drove [the patient] to a hospital and health care workers who drew or processed his blood. And a mandatory quarantine was lifted for a homeless man who later rode in the same ambulance as D before it was disinfected.

The 21-day monitoring period ended on Sunday and Mon [19-20 Oct 2014] for nearly all the roughly 50 people. It concludes as federal health officials are tightening the guidelines for the protective gear worn by health care workers treating Ebola patients.

[2] USA: Another recovered patient discharged

The unidentified Ebola patient who has been treated in Atlanta since early September [2014] has been released. Emory University Hospital officials said on Mon [20 Oct 2014] that the man was released on Sun [19 Oct 2014], after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. The man is a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone when he tested positive for the disease. He was taken to Emory on 9 Sep [2014]. The hospital never identified the man, in keeping with his family's wishes for privacy.

Emory is one of 4 US hospitals with specialized treatment units for people with dangerous infectious diseases.

[3] USA: prevention -- military to train medical support team for home deployment
Date: 19 Oct 2014

The military is establishing a 30-person expeditionary medical support team to assist medical professionals in the US in treating Ebola cases, the Pentagon said on Sun [19 Oct 2014]. Pentagon press secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said defense secretary Chuck Hagel had instructed the chief of US Northern Command to prepare and train the team of "20 critical care nurses, 5 doctors trained in infectious disease, and 5 trainers in infectious disease protocols." Starting within the next week or so, the team will receive as many as 7 days of specialized training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Kirby added. Then, they'll be prepared to deploy to locations in the United States, but they won't be sent overseas, he said.

[4] USA: Control, the 1918 flu in Washington DC - Ebola preview?
Date: 20 Oct 2014
Source: WP [excerpted, edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-flu-pandemic-that-came-to-washington-in-1918-killed-2800-sickened-many-more/2014/10/19/370203de-54a5-11e4-ba4b-f6333e2c0453_story.html?wpisrc=nl-headlines&wpmm=1


The flu pandemic that came to Washington [DC] in 1918 killed 2800 and sickened many more. The 1918-1919 flu caused high fever, sore throat, a cough, and sometimes a serious nosebleed.

- Many people wore protective masks in public.
- Schools and churches were closed.
- Federal offices went to staggered schedules to alleviate commuter crowding.
- People were told to avoid crowds altogether.
- Streetcar operators in Washington were urged to keep windows open, regardless of the weather.
- Funeral rites, often held at home, could be crowded and therefore dangerous, and those who were not close family members of the dead were advised to stay away.
- More than 50 people were dying daily, and coffins and gravediggers were in short supply, and the Army assigned soldiers to dig graves.

Congress appropriated USD one million [USD 17 million in 2014 dollars], to fight the outbreak.]...

[Could a similar scenario happen today if Ebola reached Washington DC? But:
(a) The flu was spread by violent coughing, which Ebola is not, so there should be far fewer cases;
(b) The case fatality rate was "only" 2800/33 000 -- just over 8 per cent -- so there might be more deaths.

In the face of the epidemic, the Surgeon General of the Army urged the public to "avoid wearing tight shoes, tight clothing, or tight gloves!" - Mod.JW]
