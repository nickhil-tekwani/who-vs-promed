A total of 3 people have been admitted to the same Kakamega hospital after eating meat from an infected cow. One of them has reportedly observed bitter reactions to his body after enjoying the delicious meat.

Residents are now being urged to go to the hospital if they begin to experience any symptoms of anthrax. Anthrax is a highly contagious disease that commonly affects forest animals and wildlife around the world.

The hospital's clinical officer Brian Angadi confirmed the incident, saying the 3 patients ate meat from a cow with anthrax. "All 3 were diagnosed with anthrax. We made every effort to treat them and we managed to get them out of danger," Angadi told The Standard. However, he has warned of the possibility of receiving more patients as some residents of the village received a share of the meat.

Commenting on the incident, G.M., one of the patients who had already been allowed to go home, said he had been called by 3 of his friends to help slaughter the cattle and would be given beef as payment. He took the meat home with him but a week later he began to rub his hands and his body weakened. "I began to experience reactions in my skin and other symptoms in my hands and feet. I used traditional medicine but it did not help. When I went to the hospital the doctors told me that I had eaten meat from an infected cow," he said

[Confirmation of anthrax appears to be based on clinical signs, symptoms, and possible exposure history. A notable characteristic of cutaneous anthrax is that the inflamed site(s) itch but are not painful. Scratching them can result in infections elsewhere from the contaminated finger nails, especially in the face. The patient's foot infections would have been from being barefoot during the butchering and being contaminated by the infected animal's blood.

It is unclear whether they just slaughtered a single sick cow or that it was just one of a number slaughtered. Either way it can be a mess. And the bloody butchering site will remain contaminated for a number of months. If one wants to, the spores can be recovered from soil samples and demonstrated in the laboratory.

We still do not know the source of infection, but the comment about diseased wildlife suggests that the local authorities are not taking note of unreported livestock outbreaks but pointing at infected wildlife.
