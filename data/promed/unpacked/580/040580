-------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to make what comment I can on the question you posed in regards to our reported case of rabies in Labrador, the 1st of what we expect to be many more cases this year [2012]. You were wondering about the reference to a 4-year cycle. We have not studied this disease to any great extent in this region, we only observe the outbreaks and advise the public accordingly.

Labrador has a land area of 294 330 sq km [113 642 sq mi] and a human population of approximately 26 000, making the population density less than 0.1 people per sq km [0.2 per sq mi]. Most cases that we see are of those animals that come close to the communities. We saw significant outbreaks in the years 1988, 1992, 1996, 2001, 2004, and perhaps now in 2012. Though we saw a pattern of about 4 years at the beginning of this series it is certainly not appearing this way in more recent years.

All of our data are subject to the individual efforts of people within the communities so cannot be considered to have any statistical value. Our outbreaks would be related to the population dynamics of both the coloured fox (_Vulpes vulpes_) and the arctic fox (_Alopex lagopus_) in an area much larger than Labrador alone, no doubt also including northern Quebec and the territory of Nunavut.

As such, we do what we can. Our historical data are available at http://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/rabies.
