Fishery at Earith, Cambridgeshire, hit by outbreak of koi herpesvirus disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Movements of fish into, out of, and within a fishery in Cambridgeshire have
been restricted, following the confirmation of koi herpesvirus disease.

The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS),
acting on behalf of the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA), has issued a Confirmed Designation prohibiting the movement of
fish into, out of and within the affected site. The affected fishery is
Long Island Lake, Earith, Cambridgeshire, and the designation also includes
nearby Earith Carp Lakes.

Under the requirements of the designation both fisheries have been directed
to either, establish and maintain on-site facilities for the disinfection
of angling equipment at all access points or, to provide anglers with nets,
mats, and slings for exclusive use on the affected fisheries. Anglers must
comply with these requirements. Samples were taken from Long Island Lake
following reported deaths of fish.

Koi Herpesvirus disease affects all varieties of carp (_Cyprinus carpio_),
including common carp, mirror carp, ghost carp and koi carp and can result
in high rates of fish mortalities. There are no implications for human health.

Koi herpesvirus disease is notifiable, any suspicion of its presence should
be immediately reported to: The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Science (Cefas) in Weymouth.

[Mass mortality among fingerling, juvenile, and adult common carp _Cyprinus
carpio carpio_, and fancy carp or koi _Cyprinus carpio koi_ was initially
reported from the USA, western Europe, and Israel in 1999. Eventually, the
emerging causative agent was identified as _Cyprinid herpesvirus 3_
(CyHV-3). The disease, which is temperature dependent, occurring between
16Â­25 deg C [60.8 - 77 deg F], spread to other parts of the world. The
disease was suspected to have been present in the UK during the earliest
stages of its initial emergence.
