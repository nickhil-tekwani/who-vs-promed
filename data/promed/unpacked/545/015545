A comment to the ProMED post "Angiostrongylus cantonensis - USA (04): (HI) 20180818.5973796" published 18 Aug [2018], in which the moderator states that transmission requires the ingestion of the infected snail or slugs: I find the best source of information to be the article by Cowie [Cowie RH. Pathways for transmission of angiostrongyliasis and the risk of disease associated with them. Hawaii J Med Public Health 2013;72(6 Suppl 2):70-74]. Cowie presents data supporting the statement that ingestion of snails and slugs is the main mode of acquisition of this nematode and the ensuing illness, if any.

There are other methods of acquisition, some documented, some possible but not proven. My initial comment to the moderator concerned the possible role of slug or snail mucus or slime in transmission. Because of the low number of _A. cantonensis_ larvae found in studies of slime and mucus, Cowie concludes, "While slime trails may represent a source of sporadic infections, the evidence suggests that this is not one of the main routes of transmission of the parasite nor a major cause of disease." Anecdotal information in Hawaii suggests that this may not be rare, but there is no good scientific evidence to support this.

Cowie presents data confirming acquisition of _A. cantonensis_ by animal hosts, which carry the nematode but do not become infected. Included are freshwater prawns and shrimps, land crabs, frogs and toads (including tadpoles), monitor lizards, and planarians. He also mentions animals that are common food sources that can be experimentally infected and could conceivably be a source of infection if not properly cooked, but he did not find any data to demonstrate that such a route of infection occurs.

As angiostrongyliasis may be increasing in incidence and is also being found in a wider geographic range than previously noted, it is important to keep in mind the variety of ways in which this pathogen may be acquired.
