Malaria cases rise in Limpopo
-----------------------------
Confirmed cases of malaria continue to rise in Limpopo. More than 947
people have been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease since the
start of the rainy season, and numbers are expected to soar.

The provincial department of health has urged people who have
flu-like symptoms to contact their nearest clinic.

Spokesperson Selby Makgatho said: "We do not have an outbreak now but
the situation is expected to take a turn for the worst.

"The department has devised a plan to fight malaria. About 42 teams
have been formed to fight the disease. They will go around the
province fumigating and educating communities.

"We are also using community gatherings to promote awareness. Health
facilities are ready and equipped to deal with malaria cases."
