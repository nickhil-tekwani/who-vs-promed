VARICELLA, NEONATAL (5)
=======================

According to "Dermatology and Venereology" (Braun-Falco ed.),
varicella infection in the first trimester of pregnancy may lead
to congenital abnormalities in about 1% of the cases. There appears
to be no such risk in the second and third trimester. If a maternal
varicella occurs at the end of pregnancy about 25% of
the neonates will develop clinical symptoms. The course the infection
takes is more severe in the infant, the closer the maternal infection
is to the delivery date. Pregnant women with a documented exposure and
without acquired immunity should receive VZIG [varicella-zoster immune
globulin], which is useless after the manifestations of varicella have
appeared. In the above case it was warranted to give the neonate
VZIG at birth which hopefully has modified the clinical symptoms.

Regarding the newborn with suspected varicella, the description of the
infant's lesions as maculopapular (as opposed to vesicular) and their
disappearance within 24 hours would be highly unusual for an infant with
vertically-acquired varicella. Are you sure these skin lesions weren't
erythema toxicum (a common rash of newborn which may appear pustular and
is often mistaken for lesions of Herpes simplex virus)? If any
lesions remain the distinction can be made easily by doing a
Wright's or Giemsa stain on the contents of the pustules;
erythema toxicum lesions contain eosinophils, while VZV [varicella]
lesions should contain multinucleated giant cells and PMNs.
I presume the VZIG [varicella zoster immune globulin] was given
to the infant for prophylaxis rather than as treatment, since
a sick newborn with VZV infection should receive acyclovir.
With regard to the relative timing of the infant's versus the mother's
lesions, several possibilities exist. The infant can acquire virus either
postnatally (i.e. horizontally) from contact with the mother, in utero
during the mother's secondary viremia (when her lesions appear), or, much
less commonly, in utero during the mother's primary viremia (during the
incubation period). In the first instance, the infant's lesions usually
appear about 2 weeks postnatally; in the second instance, the infant's
lesions usually appear about 2 weeks after the mother's lesions first
appeared; in the third instance, the infant's lesions appear at about the
same time or shortly after the mother's. In the case in question, one
would have to suppose that the third route of exposure was operative,
assuming of course that the infant indeed has varicella.
I hope mother and baby are both doing well.
