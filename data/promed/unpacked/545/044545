A total of 5 people from Armenia's Gegharkunik Province have been diagnosed with anthrax, the Ministry of Healthcare said in a news release.

According to the healthcare ministry two villagers from Geghhovit (Martuni region, Gegharkunik) sought medical treatment in the local hospital for what appeared to be the skin form of anthrax. The patients told the medics that a few days earlier they had slaughtered cattle in the village.

Experts from the Healthcare Ministry's National Center for Disease Control and Prevention were dispatched to the village to find out how and where the disease was contracted. During the visit another 6 people were suspected in having contracted the disease. A total of 5 were sent to the Nork Infectious Diseases Hospital in Yerevan for a confirmation. All were confirmed to have anthrax. According to the ministry all patients were treated and a medical supervision has been set for the village.

The Food Safety Inspection was immediately notified. Medics and food safety agents are working in the village.

Anthrax cases have been reported in Geghhovit community of Armenia's Gegharkunik province, the press office of Armenia's health ministry reported on [Tue 20 Aug 2019]. According to the ministry's press release, 2 residents of the community came to a medical center in Martuni with sores on their fingers. The patients told doctors that they had taken part in butchering a cow of a fellow villager.

The health ministry has dispatched its experts to the community. As a result of joint efforts with local medical centers' workers, 6 other infected people have been found. All the patients are being treated now, and the community is under medical control now. The Armenian Food Safety Agency has been informed.

[Gegharkunik province is on the eastern border of Armenia and pokes into Azerbaijan; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_pol_2002.jpg Geghhovit is south of Sevana Lich (lake); see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geghhovit.

When the dust settled there were 2 initial cutaneous cases subsequent to them butchering a neighbor's cow, which would have been sick or dead. The first report suggests that they might have butchered a number of "cattle" carcasses, though the 2nd report has a single cow. And in due course another 6 villagers came down with cutaneous anthrax as they were sent to the local hospital merely for diagnostic confirmation.

Anthrax is sporadic in Armenia and thus the risks of butchering sick and dead animals are only realised after the onset of human anthrax lesions. And the number of human cases can exceed the indirectly reported livestock cases. - Mod.MHJ
