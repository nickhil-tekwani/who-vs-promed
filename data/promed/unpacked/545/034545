[Neither Singapore nor nearby Malaysia or Indonesia have reported any cases of leishmaniasis in dogs since 2005.

Leishmaniasis is frequently imported when dogs travel away from endemic areas, a not infrequent occurrence. For an overview of the occurrence in Southern Europe and valuable references, see "Leishmaniasis - Europe: imported 20120113.1009135." Please note that treatment is parasite species-specific in dogs; see "Leishmaniasis, canine - Argentina (02): (CN) 20110323.0908." - Mod.PC
