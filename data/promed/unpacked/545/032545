As many as 80 persons in Aurangabad district [Maharashtra] took ill after consuming milk of the cows bitten by rabies infected dog, said an officer.

"The incident came to light on Saturday evening [21 Jan 2017] when many people complained of vomitting and nausea. They are being treated and none of them is serious," said Vishwambhar Gawande, resident district collector of Aurangabad.

"We have found 2 cows whose milk had been consumed by people who fell sick later. Officers from health and animal husbandry jointly department found that these cows were bitten by dogs having rabies. Treatment of cows has started," he said.

When asked about the dogs with infection, he said, "It is a serious issue and dogs can bite people as well. Preventive measures are going on," he said.

The report above does not explain if the bitten cows exhibited any symptoms of rabies. The key question in this case would be whether such exposure would warrant rabies prophylaxis in humans.

Human cases due to non-bite exposures to rabies are very rare. Scratches, abrasions, open wounds, and mucous membranes contaminated with saliva or other potentially infectious material (such as brain tissue) from a rabid animal constitute non-bite exposures. Inhalation of aerosolized rabies virus is also a potential non-bite route of exposure, but other than laboratory workers, most people are unlikely to encounter aerosolized rabies virus. There are no published studies that have demonstrated the presence of rabies virus in cow milk. Although transmission of rabies virus from consuming unpasteurized milk from an infected animal is theoretically possible, no human has ever been reported to develop rabies via this route. Milk that has been heat pasteurized presents no risk for rabies virus transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/news/2005-12-23.html).

According to a published report from the US CDC, "Management of mass human exposures to rabid animals requires public health officials to balance knowledge of rabies epidemiology, risk for transmission, and pathogenesis with the perceived risk for death among exposed persons. Because of the nearly 100 percent case-fatality ratio of human rabies and the virtually complete effectiveness of PEP [post-exposure prophylaxis], many mass exposure incidents prompt administration of rabies immune globulin and vaccine, even if the circumstances do not meet the criteria for exposure." (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056759.htm). - Mod.UBA

The CDC article cited above refers to 2 incidents, investigated by the CDC, in which people drank unpasteurized milk from rabid cows that prompted their recommendation to give post exposure prophylaxis. This was cited in a prior ProMED-post Rabies - Bhutan: (TY) bovine, human exp 20120817.1249239.

Also, aerosol transmission has been documented in experimental work with animals and several human cases of rabies have been attributed to aerosolized rabies virus, for example, in spelunkers exposed to bats in a cave and documented aerosol transmission of rabies virus to experimental animals in this cave (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/195/8/1144/816583/Effects-of-Aerosolized-Rabies-Virus-Exposure-on). - Mod.ML]
