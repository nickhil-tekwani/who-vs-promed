Belgium has identified 726 confirmed cases of monkeypox since the start of the outbreak, Sciensano reports in its latest weekly update, based on data for up to 5 Sep [2022].

The number of new cases appears to be going down, according to the public health institute. The last recorded case for which information is available dates back to 30 Aug [2022].

Of the 726 confirmed cases of the disease, 384 (53%) were reported in Flanders, 258 (36%) in Brussels, and 84 (11%) in Wallonia.

Almost all of those infected are male: 699 of the 703 cases for which the sex is known. The vast majority are between 16 and 71 years old. One is a child under the age of 3 years.

Few of the infected have had to be hospitalised: out of 638 patients for whom information is available, only 32 were admitted to hospital. So far, one death -- that of a person with underlying medical conditions -- has been reported.

[4] Hong Kong: 1st case ex Philippines
Date: Tue 6 Sep 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited]
https://outbreaknewstoday.com/hong-kong-investigates-1st-monkeypox-case-76729/


Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) reported today [6 Sep 2022] it is investigating an imported case of monkeypox.

This has prompted the government to activate the Alert level of the Preparedness and Response Plan for Monkeypox.

The case involves a male patient aged 30 who arrived in Hong Kong alone from the Philippines via flight PR300 on 5 Sep [2022] and proceeded to undergo quarantine at a designated quarantine hotel (Ramada Hong Kong Harbour View). He developed symptoms including a severe sore throat and difficulty in swallowing in the late evening of the same day [5 Sep 2022]. He also developed a skin rash as well as lymphadenopathy in the past week. He has been sent to Queen Mary Hospital and has not entered the local community. The patient is isolated in a single airborne infection isolation room. He is now in stable condition. His samples were collected and tested by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch, and the result tested positive today [6 Sep 2022].

The CHP's epidemiological investigations of the case are ongoing. An initial investigation revealed that he had also travelled to the United States and Canada between 2 Aug and 2 Sep [2022], and he had high-risk exposure during the incubation period. According to the patient, he had not contacted any confirmed patients during his overseas stay and has no close contact in the local community. As a precautionary measure, crew members and passengers of flight PR300 are advised to watch out for symptoms and seek medical attention if necessary, despite their relatively low risk.

Subsequent to the confirmation of the case, the Government today activated the Alert level of the Preparedness and Response Plan for Monkeypox, reflecting a low immediate health impact caused by monkeypox on the local population. Generally, it depicts a situation when there is an imported human case and/or epidemiologically linked cases or an imported animal case.

Under the Alert response level, the Government will take a series of follow-up actions, including enhancing its control and prevention measures in the community by putting potentially exposed persons under medical surveillance or quarantine as appropriate. It will also strengthen health surveillance measures at boundary control points and enhance related health education to the public through various means.

The CHP has reported the case to the World Health Organization and the relevant authority of the Mainland. Letters will also be sent to doctors and private hospitals reminding them to pay attention to symptomatic patients seeking consultations without contact history. The CHP also urges the public, especially those subject to high risks of exposure, to take precautions and avoid close physical contact with persons or animals suspected of monkeypox infection. They should seek medical attention as soon as possible if they experience symptoms of monkeypox, including rash, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion, muscle pain, and severe headaches.

[5] Delhi: female case

https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/sixth-monkeypox-case-in-delhi-patient-in-stable-condition-at-lnjp-hospital-122090601288_1.html


The condition of a young woman of African origin, who is the 6th reported case of monkeypox in Delhi, is stable, sources said. The patient is admitted to the LNJP Hospital here.

"A total of six cases of monkeypox have been reported in Delhi so far. The latest is a young woman of African origin. Her condition is stable at present," a source said.

The 6 cases comprise 3 men and 3 women. "The early 5 cases have been treated and discharged," a senior doctor said.

Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease having common symptoms such as fever, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, headache, muscle aches, exhaustion, chills or sweats, and sore throat and cough.

According to a study done recently by the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), all the 1st 5 cases had presented with "mild to moderate grade intermittent fever, myalgia (muscle pain), and lesions on the genitals, groins, lower limb, trunk, and upper limb."

Of these cases, 4 had non-tender firm lymphadenopathy (swelling of lymph nodes). No secondary complications or sexually transmitted infections were recorded in these cases except for hepatitis B in one case, it had said.

In Delhi, the 1st case of monkeypox was reported on 24 Jul [2022]. Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital has been made the nodal facility to treat patients with this viral infection.

[This latest case is a woman of African origin. There is no indication that she had been in Africa recently or what the circumstances were had she acquired her infection in India. Half the cases being women is unusual. That might be an artifact of the small number of cases (3 women of 6 total cases). The report provides no information or speculation about how the virus might have been transmitted to women (person-to-person or exposure to objects that might have been contaminated by an infected person). - Mod.TY]

[6] Duration of immunity
Date: Tue 6 Sep 2022
Source: Thaiger [abridged, edited]
https://thethaiger.com/news/national/new-study-shows-smallpox-vaccine-ineffective-against-monkeypox


Despite previous hopes, the Department of Medical Sciences warned that most adults and seniors who have been previously vaccinated against smallpox are not protected from monkeypox, unfortunately. The news comes after testing in labs of people who received the smallpox vaccine when they were younger and are now over 40 showed no correlation between the inoculation and any immunity from monkeypox.

The smallpox vaccine has been recommended as a tool to fight the spread of monkeypox, at least until a proper vaccine created specifically for the new outbreak has been created. In fact, Thailand ordered 1000 Jynneos smallpox vaccines, enough to administer 2 doses each to 500 people just in case, though who the Department of Disease Control will decide who receives them is still unconfirmed.

The chief of the Department of Medical Sciences says those 1st doses should go to health workers as a preventative measure, considering they are the most likely to be exposed during an outbreak and are therefore the highest risk. But, he warned, the smallpox vaccine does come with some neurological and cardiological side effects that can be fairly significant.

Scientists suspected that the smallpox vaccine could be at least somewhat effective against monkeypox because the 2 diseases have some striking similarities. The study tested this theory by gathering 30 people from 45 to 74 years old who had the smallpox vaccine already and used a plaque reduction neutralization test on serum from the volunteers. The tests found, according to the chief of the DMS, that any protection against the monkeypox virus is minimal at best.

"We have found that 28 of trialists had no immunity against monkeypox, although one had maintained immunity level against the disease's A.2 variant and another against both B.1 and A.2 variants. However, overall results led to the conclusion that the majority of older Thai citizens have no marked immunity against monkeypox."

Before anyone panics, though, the department chief reminds us that there are currently no plans for mass vaccinations as monkeypox is not nearly as common or rapidly spreading as COVID-19, and personal safety measures can be protection enough for now. The National Vaccine Institute and others are working on replacing the old smallpox vaccine with an inactivated vaccine, and say a traditional inactivated vaccine will do for now, but there isn't a rush to push something out quickly.

[This study should elicit a discussion and additional observations to determine if there is any residual immunity to monkeypox from earlier smallpox vaccination. The question will be if neutralizing antibody is a reliable indication of at least partial immunity to monkeypox. It would be interesting to know if there is any remaining cell-mediated immunity in those vaccinated against smallpox years ago. - Mod.TY]
