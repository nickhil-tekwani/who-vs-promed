According to Gulf News more than 100 people have contracted typhoid in a
region of Saudi Arabia already hit by Rift Valley Fever (RVF). "Okaz" (an
Arabic daily) said 118 people, including 3 Pakistanis, have caught typhoid
in the southern region of Jizan, which borders Yemen. However, no deaths
have yet been reported.

[Dr. Badrinath also inquired as to whether anyone had observed an
epidemiological link between RVF and typhoid. I know of no reason to
suspect that this would be the case. A prior report from Kenya, cited
above, indicates a coincidence of typhoid and RVF outbreaks, but does not
suggest a relationship between the two. - Mod.ES
