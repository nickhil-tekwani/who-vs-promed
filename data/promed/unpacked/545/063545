RE: Characterisation of B. anthracis culture mentioned in ProMED-mail
post Anthrax, caprine - USA (TX) 20080404.1234

[A culture from the isolate obtained from the dead male goat was sent
to Alex Hoffmaster, Emergency Investigation Laboratory, CDC, Atlanta,
and Alex informs me that "Yes it was GT 78 in A4" strains group.

This is a typical contaminated-feed group well represented in Texas
20-50 years ago in the bone meals fed to cattle. In our collections
we have seen this strain in sheep, Stillwater, Oklahoma, 1996; a cow
from Ozona, Crockett County, Texas in 1998; from an Aoudad sheep in
north Kenny County, Texas in the 2001 epidemic on the Edwards
Plateau; and from a 1995 Norwegian cow. Crockett borders on Terrell
and Val Verde counties, and Kinney is on the SW border of Val Verde.
All in all a pattern that one would expect from a past sales
distribution of bone meal and salt.

So this March 2008 caprine outbreak reflects an ongoing background
threat in that part of west Texas.

Our thanks to Alex Hoffmaster for the genotyping information. - Mod.MHJ]
