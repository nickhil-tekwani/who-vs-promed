Suspected cases of Zika reach more than 24 000 statewide
-----------------------
A disease that began in Camacari, in the metropolitan region of Salvador, today has spread to several municipalities in Bahia. With
fever, headaches and red spots scattered throughout the body, symptoms of Zika, a disease [virus] transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ the same mosquito [that transmits] dengue and chikungunya [viruses] -- have reached 168 cities and 24 834 people in the state.

The government still treats the disease as an "Indeterminate exanthematous disease" (DEI). Right behind Salvador, which has 10 799 notifications, is Camacari, which counts 5000 people who presented with symptoms; 3rd comes Jequie, with 1162 suspected cases; and in 4th [place], Porto Seguro in southern Bahia, with 711 recorded cases.

The east of the state is the place reported as [hardest hit], with 71 per cent of victims. The South comes next, with 11 per cent of case notifications.

[News like the above will become more frequent; and with it the inquiries, inaccuracies and misconceptions about the real epidemiological situation concerning dengue, Zika, and chikungunya.

How many of the "nearly 40 000 cases" referred to above are, in fact, dengue? And among the "more than 24 000 cases of Zika", how many could not be dengue or other acute rash illnesses?

In the absence of routine laboratory research capacity, systematic (case by case) or even sampling of suspected cases of such infections will generate extremely weak figures susceptible to criticism and challenges. In times of co-circulation of dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and -- why not, measles* -- viruses in the state of Ceara, the surveillance of arboviruses and particularly of rash diseases (including, and especially, for obvious reasons, rubella and measles) need to be in the short term, revised ... or, even reinvented. - Mod RNA]

*[Autochthonous transmission in Brazil was halted by vaccination in 2000. From 2001-2004 only 4 cases were recorded, all imported from
Europe & Japan -- but it would never be recognized now submerged in thousands of cases of other rash diseases. - Mod.JW]

[Testing all these cases in order to differentiate between these virus infections likely would exceed current laboratory capacity. Decentralization of diagnostic laboratory capacity might help manage the load. Testing a subset of cases would reduce the work load and provide an idea of the incidence of the specific virus infections in the area. This challenge is very likely to grow as the geographic area affected by Zika virus infection increases.
