Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Erlun Township, Yunlin County [Taipei province]
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Apr 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 4184 / 20 / 0 / 0 / 0 /
Affected population: native chicken breeders

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.48 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: The H5N2 subtype virus was isolated by active surveillance and confirmed by national laboratory on 29 Apr 2014. Antibodies were also detected on collected serum samples. Movement restriction was implemented on the infected farm on 29 Apr 2014. Clinical health investigation on the affected farm showed that the breeders were in healthy condition without abnormal mortality and egg production. The pathogenicity of the virus has been subsequently confirmed by national laboratory as low pathogenic (less than 75 per cent mortality of the tested chickens) on 19 May 2014. The clinical investigation and surveillance of surrounding poultry farms are in progress.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory) / Birds / gene sequencing / 1 May 2014 / Negative
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory) / Birds / haemagglutination inhibition test (HIT) / 1 May 2014 / Positive
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / 29 Apr 2014 / Positive

[Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

In their 6-monthly report (January to June 2013) submitted to the OIE, Taiwan reported 6 outbreaks of LPAI serotype H5N2 http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2013&semester=1&wild=0&country=TWN&this_country_code=TWN&detailed=1 (Note: go to Section 3 of the report named "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present" for information on these outbreaks).

In July 2013 a new LPAI event was reported: 2 outbreaks were reported in Hualien County with serotype H5N3 identified. The event was resolved on 18 Feb 2014. See complete report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014965_20140410_113308.pdf.
