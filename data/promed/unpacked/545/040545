Multistate investigation of non-travel-associated _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infections (melioidosis) in 3 patients: Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota, 2021
------------------------------------------------
Summary
---------
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Minnesota Department of Health, with assistance from the CDC, are investigating 3 cases of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (melioidosis) infections. Based on genomic analysis, these 3 cases (1 male, 2 females; 2 adults, and 1 child) may share a potential common source of exposure. The 1st case, identified in March 2021, was fatal. Two other patients were identified in May 2021, one of whom is still hospitalized. One has been discharged to a transitional care unit. None of the patients' families reported a history of traveling outside of the continental USA.

Symptoms of melioidosis are varied and nonspecific and may include pneumonia, abscess formation, and/or blood infections. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, melioidosis can initially be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis, and proper treatment may be delayed.

Background
-----------
Initial presentation among the 3 patients ranged from cough and shortness of breath, to weakness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, intermittent fever, and rash on the trunk, abdomen, and face, later diagnosed with infectious encephalitis. The fatal case had several risk factors for melioidosis including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cirrhosis and died 10 days after being hospitalized. Genomic analysis of the strains suggests a common source, such as an imported product or animal; however, that source has not been positively identified to date.

_Burkholderia pseudomallei_, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a Tier 1 select agent, which can affect both animals and humans. Cases are most common in areas of the world with tropical and sub-tropical climates. Most cases in the USA occur in persons returning from a country where the disease is endemic. These 3 cases are unusual, because no recent travel outside the USA has been identified.

Melioidosis symptoms are nonspecific and vary depending on the type of infection. Symptoms may include localized pain or swelling, fever, ulceration, abscess, cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, anorexia, respiratory distress, abdominal discomfort, joint pain, disorientation, weight loss, stomach or chest pain, and muscle pain or joint pain and seizures. Mortality varies depending on disease severity and clinical presentation, with case fatality ranging between 10-50%. People with certain conditions are at higher risk of disease when they come in contact with the bacteria. The most common factors that make a person more likely to develop disease include diabetes, kidney disease, chronic lung disease, and alcoholism. Melioidosis is confirmed by culture and with testing conducted by trained personnel since some automated identification methods in clinical laboratories may misidentify _B. pseudomallei_ as another bacterium.

Melioidosis is not considered to be transmitted person-to-person via air or respiratory droplets in non-laboratory settings. There have only been a few documented cases of person-to-person transmission; percutaneous inoculation is probably the most frequent route for natural infection. In contrast to other healthcare personnel, laboratory personnel are at risk because some procedures may aerosolize particles and release _B. pseudomallei_ into the air. Laboratory personnel can reduce their risk of exposure by following good laboratory practices (1). Laboratory staff who may have been exposed to _B. pseudomallei_ should refer to existing CDC guidance (2).

Recommendations
------------------
- Consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness even if they do not have a travel history to a disease-endemic country.
- Culture of _B. pseudomallei_ from any clinical specimen is considered diagnostic for melioidosis. If melioidosis is suspected, culture blood, urine, throat swab, and, when relevant, respiratory specimens, abscesses, or wound swabs.
- When ordering specimen cultures to diagnose melioidosis, advise the laboratory that cultures may grow _B. pseudomallei_, and the laboratory personnel should observe appropriate laboratory safety precautions.
Treatment of melioidosis consists of IV antimicrobials, i.e., ceftazidime or meropenem) for at least 2 weeks. Depending on the response to therapy, IV treatment may be extended for up to 8 weeks. Intravenous treatment is followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 3-6 months to prevent relapse. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used in persons with a contraindication to or who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX (3).
- Consider re-evaluating patients with isolates identified on automated systems as _Burkholderia_spp. (specifically _B. cepacia_ and _B. thailandensis_), _Chromobacterium violaceum_, _Ochrobactrum anthropi_, and, possibly, _Pseudomonas_ spp., _Acinetobacter_ spp., and _Aeromonas_ spp. Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (e.g., MALDI-TOF, 16s, VITEK-2) may misidentify _B. pseudomallei_ as another bacterium. The isolate from the Texas case was initially misidentified as _B. thailandensis_ by MALDI-TOF.
- If _B. pseudomallei_ is identified or an organism is suspicious for _B. pseudomallei_, contact your local public health department immediately. The health department can facilitate forwarding the isolate for confirmation to the closest reference laboratory and initiate a public health investigation.

[In 2020, ProMED posted on a report of what was likely locally acquired melioidosis in Texas from 2018 (Cossaboom CM, Marinova-Petkova A, Strysko J, et al.: Melioidosis in a resident of Texas with no recent travel history, United States. Emerg Infect Dis. 2020; 26(6): 1295-9; https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2606.190975). It is not clear where in Texas this more recent case was thought to be acquired. It is quite interesting that all 3 geographically separate 2021 USA cases seemed genetically related, suggesting a common source such as an imported animal or product. ProMED eagerly awaits more information related to the acquisition of infection in these cases.

Although a classical infection in eastern Asia and northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, the Caribbean basin, Central America, and South America, particularly Brazil and North America. This 2016 article (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al.: Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016; 1: 15008; http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158.pdf.) for 2015 estimates the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:

Area / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands
South Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42
East Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31
Sub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15
Latin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1
Middle East and North Africa / 49 / less than 1 / less than 1

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%. A small percentage of cases can occur as reactivations, even decades later, sometimes called the "Vietnamese Time Bomb."
