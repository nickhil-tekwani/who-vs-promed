----------------------------------------------------------------------
We hereby would briefly report findings of a patient with severe leptospirosis whom we have treated in Tübingen, Germany, at the Tropenklinik Paul-Lechler-Krankenhaus in June 2018 after having returned from a trip to Israel. He might have been the 1st patient of this leptospirosis-outbreak. Unfortunately, he has still not fully recovered.

The patient, a 51-year-old previously healthy man, had travelled as a leader of a tourist group to Israel from 22 May to 3 Jun 2018. Disease onset was 7 days later, on 10 Jun 2018, already back in Germany.

Signs and symptoms consisted of high fever, headache, myalgia, dry cough, transient dysuria, nausea, and dizziness. According to his wife the patient was partly unable to articulate full sentences.

The patient had visited the Dan Springs [Galilee, HaZafon (Northern district)], had gone hiking in the Jordan River Park close to Bethsaida on 30 May 2018. There, he had walked through a 1 km long Roman aqueduct despite a skin laceration from a stick on his left foot.

On admission (13 Jun 2018) he was febrile (39.1 C [102.4 F] auricular), with an blood pressure of 100/70, a heart rate of 96 bpm/min, and a small superficial healing wound on the dorsum of his left foot.

Chest X-ray and ECG were normal. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a splenomegaly. Laboratory changes included leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, increased serum CRP [C reactive protein] and LDH [lactic dehydrogenase] concentrations, elevated liver and kidney functions tests. Under the suspicion of leptospirosis based on the travel history and clinical findings he was immediately started on intravenous ceftriaxone. His renal failure improved rapidly with increased oral and i.v. fluids. Since 15 Jun 2018, he has been afebrile and was discharged on 16 Jun 2018; he was continued on oral doxycycline.

Initial serology for leptospirosis was negative in the sample from 14 Jun 2018, but showed seroconversion against leptospiral antigens by complement fixation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Due to persistent speech disturbance and dizziness, the patient was readmitted to the neurologic department of the University of Tübingen from 18 to 20 Jun 2018, where a lumbar puncture showed pleocytosis, and meningoencephalitis was diagnosed. The patient is currently still in a neurologic rehabilitation center and suffers from fatigue and concentration problems.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Günther Slesak and colleagues for submission of their patient's findings. We wish the patient a more rapid and full recovery.

This patient visited the Dan Springs and the Jordan River National Park. The Dan Stream rises in the Tel Dan Nature Reserve -- the largest and most important of the sources of the Jordan River (https://en.parks.org.il/ParksAndReserves/teldan/Pages/default.aspx). Tel Dan Nature Reserve is in the northern Golan Heights (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/RdjwnYeUumN2). The Jordan River National Park, located about 50-60 km (31 to 37 mi) south of Tel Dan has walking trails that pass by water sources, aqueducts, pools, and sites of archaeological interest, such as the ancient Bethsaida (https://shalomisraeltours.com/jordan-river-national-park/, http://www.israeltripplanner.com/galilee-lake/nature-parks/jordan-park). - Mod.ML
