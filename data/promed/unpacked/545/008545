A coordinated government response to an outbreak of flea-borne typhus is critical, a Los Angeles county official said this week, calling for public health and other city agencies to work together.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger said Los Angeles county health workers need to collaborate with their peers in Pasadena -- where the disease has reached epidemic proportions -- and Long Beach. Both cities have independent health agencies. Barger previewed a motion calling for more outreach to at-risk individuals as well as the many city agencies that manage animal control and trash collection across the county. It will be considered by the Board of Supervisors next week.

The recent typhus outbreak downtown [Los Angeles] represents about 15 percent [9 cases] of the 59 cases identified by Los Angeles County's Department of Public Health this year, according to Barger. 6 of the 9 downtown [Los Angeles] cases were contracted by homeless individuals and all 9 were hospitalized for treatment, according to the DPH.

The county total reflects an upward trend over at least the last 3 years, with 67 cases reported for the full year 2017. That does not include cases in Long Beach or Pasadena.

Pasadena has been disproportionately impacted, confirming 20 cases of typhus to date in 2018, as compared with a history of 1 to 5 cases annually. Long Beach has had double its historical rate of cases, with a total of 12 reported to date.

Infected fleas are most often spread by rats, cats and opossums, which do not show symptoms of the typhus infection. However, typhus can cause high fever, chills, headache and rash in humans and, if not treated with antibiotics, can also lead to hospitalization and, in rare cases, death.

The best way to control the fleas is to control the animals that spread them, Barger said. The disease is not transmitted person-to-person, according to county health officials.

In addition to avoiding contact and keeping fleas off house pets, residents should keep garbage cans tightly covered to discourage wild and stray animals.

Barger's motion includes a recommendation that the Department of Animal seek donations of flea collars that can be handed out to homeless individuals with pets.

I wonder how many of the Pasadena cases are in the homeless population. California, and especially the big cities like Los Angeles, has serious problems with a lack of affordable housing and so have large homeless populations. They're working on making more housing available but I can only see problems like this getting worse. One thing that would help with this particular outbreak would be free veterinary care for the homeless populations, including flea prevention meds. I don't know how many shelters allow pets, and people will choose to stay on the streets before giving up their pet. Also an issue if affordable housing doesn't allow pets, so an interesting public health overlap with housing policy. Even more so, having a pet helps mental health.

[The news report above adds 2 additional cases of murine typhus for a total now of 59 cases in Los Angeles county in 2018. This news article also mentions distribution of free flea protection for pets of homeless individuals. Although the frequency of homelessness among 50 of the 59 individuals with murine typhus in Los Angeles County is unknown, 6 of the 9 cases of flea-borne murine typhus in downtown Los Angeles were homeless. How many of these infected homeless individuals had companion animals is unknown, but, as proposed by Nelly Hugh-Jones above, free veterinary care for the homeless populations, including flea prevention meds, may help those homeless individuals that do have pets.
