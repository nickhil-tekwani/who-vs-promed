The Department of Veterinary Services warns farmers and the general
public about an outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] at Seribe crush
in Ramotswa.

A press release from the department reported that the outbreak
follows outbreaks of the disease in the Republic of South Africa and
Namibia early this year [2010].

It says the disease was detected in aborted cattle fetuses and that
it is the 1st ever recorded case of RVF in Botswana. It is a viral
disease of domestic and wildlife animals, but it can also affect
people.

In animals, it is mainly transmitted through mosquito bites. It is
characterized by abortion at all stages of pregnancy and high
mortality in young animals.

People can contract the disease through handling or consuming
contaminated materials such as meat, milk, body fluids and sick
animals. The disease may present itself with fever, muscle or joint
pains and bleeding from the nose, mouth and skin. The disease can
lead to death, hence the public is advised to be careful.

In order to reduce the risk of spread of the disease and determine
the extent of the outbreak, the following measures have been put in
place with immediate effect:

- Movement of cattle, goats and sheep within, out and into Ramotswa
extension area is not allowed.
- Movement of cattle, goats and sheep within, out and into Kgatleng
District, Good-hope Sub-district and Lobatse, Otse, Tlokweng,
Gaborone and Mogobane extension areas except for direct slaughter at
slaughter facilities licensed by the Department of Veterinary
Services is not allowed.
- Transiting cattle, sheep and goats for rearing through Kgatleng and
Southeast Districts and Goodhope Sub-district from other parts of the
country is allowed under permit after dipping with a mosquito
repellent dip or pour-ons.
- Transiting of imported vaccinated cattle, sheep and goats is
allowed through Kgatleng and Southeast Districts and Goodhope
sub-district after dipping with a mosquito repellent dip or pours-ons.
- However, movement of cattle, sheep and goats in the rest of the
country is not affected by these movement restrictions.

As part of surveillance, farmers are urged to report any cases of
abortion in cattle, sheep and goats or mortality in young animals to
the nearest veterinary office. Farmers and the general public are
strongly advised to avoid handling or consuming any suspect or
possibly contaminated material.

The general public is further advised to thoroughly cook animal
products before eating such products.
