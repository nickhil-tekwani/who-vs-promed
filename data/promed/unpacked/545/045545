Another Afghan national is suspected to be infected with the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF], commonly known as Congo virus, and was shifted to an isolation ward at Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) [Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan] on Tuesday [23 Jun 2015]. The victim, a 13-year-old boy, hails from Bamyan province of Afghanistan.

The number of patients from Afghanistan arriving in the city for medical treatment has increased over the last 2 months. At least 9 suspected virus-carriers have been brought to the provincial capital [Peshawar] for treatment during last 2 months.

Earlier on Tuesday [23 Jun 2015], blood samples of 2 Afghan nationals who died at the Hayatabad Medical Complex earlier this month confirmed the presence of Congo virus. An HMC official told The Express Tribune the blood samples had been obtained by the hospital administration and sent to National Institute for Health (NIH) earlier. A man, 33, and another, 30, were both confirmed as patients of Congo virus [infections]. "The laboratory results confirmed both men were carrying the virus," he said, requesting anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

"One man was admitted on 9 Jun [2015] and died on 10 Jun [2015]," the official said. According to the official, a 20-year-old resident of Jalalabad [Nangarhar province, Afghanistan] also died at HMC on 8 Jun [2015]. He was also suspected to be a carrier of the virus.

Of the 9 Afghan nationals who had been admitted at the facility, some [how many?] were discharged after their blood samples ruled out the possibility of the virus [infection].

A man, 40, a resident of Kabul, was shifted to the isolation ward as doctors suspected he was suffering from Congo fever. Another individual, a resident from Kabul [Kabul province, Afghanistan], was also admitted to HMC on the same day and his blood samples were also obtained. However, he left the hospital before the test results arrived.

Relevant authorities claimed they were prepared to manage any situation. However, the number of patients arriving from Afghanistan who are suspected to be suffering from the virus created an alarming situation. "We take all necessary steps," said K-P Health Services Director General Parvez Kamal. "We have collected blood samples of patients, sent them to National Institute of Health and at the same time kept patients in isolation wards." According to Kamal, blood samples of a patient's family members are also collected to check if they are also carrying the virus.

"No cases of Congo virus have been reported from residents of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa [province]," he said. "If such cases are reported, we will adopt necessary measures to prevent the virus from spreading."

[CCHF virus is endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Interestingly, in addition to the Afghanis treated in Pakistan above, there was an earlier case in May 2015 and another case of CCHF infection acquired in Afghanistan who sought medical attention in Pakistan in 2014. Cases of CCHF occurred in Sindh province, Pakistan, this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014).

Circumstances under which the patients acquired their CCHF virus infections are not stated in the above report. They probably acquired the infections via tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can occur also, which is why the patients are admitted to isolation wards.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

Iranian officials have confirmed that 3 people have died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), as the contagious disease makes a return to the country riding on a new heat wave.

Mohammad Reza Shirzadi, an official in Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), said Wednesday [24 Jun 2015] that the deaths have been recorded in the western province of Kermanshah, Khorasan Razavi in the northeast and Mazandaran Province in the north.

He added a total of 9 people have been diagnosed with the disease since the current Iranian calendar year started on 21 Mar [2015], according to Fars News Agency.

Shirzadi, who serves as the head of the MOHME department of Zoonoses Control, said a total of 900 people have been infected with the disease since 2000, of whom 144 people have died, showing a mortality rate of around 15 percent.

The 1st death incidence from CCHF [this year] was recorded on 20 Jun [2015] in Chalous, Mazandaran, where a 29-year-old man reportedly died as a result of the infection.

The head of the Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Ghasem Jan Babaei, said later that provincial laboratories have confirmed the CCHF case.

Endemic in Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans and Asia, CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease which can be fatal. Iranian officials blame the illegal import of the livestock, especially through the eastern borders, as the main reason behind the spread of the disease. However, an ongoing heat wave is also to blame, with temperatures rising to above 35 degrees Celsius in some provinces, facilitating the spread of the infectious disease.

[CCHF virus is endemic in eastern Iran, and cases have sporadically occurred there, mainly in abattoir workers (see archives listed below). The official does not indicate why the heat wave is to blame for these cases. Perhaps cross-border livestock movement is responsible as animals are moved into Iran in search of better pastures, or taken to market in Iran as available forage is exhausted by climatic conditions.
