Four cattle died in Bingöl due to anthrax
-----------------------------------------
Peri Valley Environment Platform announced that 4 cattle have died due to anthrax in Yazgun and Agacoven villages of Kigi district in Bingol and called on the authorities to take precautions.

The statement -- which stated that samples were taken by the District Directorate of Agriculture and anthrax was detected as a result of the analysis -- said "We want the authorities to take the necessary measures immediately. We also demand that the grievances of our villagers, whose animals have died, be remedied."

What is anthrax?
----------------
Anthrax is a deadly disease seen in herbivorous animals such as sheep, cows, goats and camels and can also be transmitted to humans. The disease is caused by a spore-forming bacterium called _Bacillus anthracis_. The disease can be transmitted from herbivorous animals to humans, but it is not transmitted from person to person. It spreads very quickly among animals. The flock with the disease must be strictly quarantined.

One of the most important factors spreading the disease is flies that land on sick animals. Spores also remain viable for years in the region they are transported and maintain their potential to cause disease.

The vast majority of people who get the disease have cutaneous anthrax. It is also called black boil. If the disease, which is common in shepherds, is not treated in time and the disease microbe enters the blood, it can cause death.

Eating meat containing anthrax causes intestinal anthrax. Typical symptoms are nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, fever and bloody diarrhea. The mortality rate is high if not treated in time.

Anthrax spores cause lung anthrax disease if inhaled. This disease, which causes severe breathing difficulties, usually causes death within 1-2 days.

Anthrax is very rare in countries where animal herds are regularly checked by veterinarians and vaccination services are provided periodically.

ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi

[The last report we have of an outbreak in Bingol is in 2005 (see below for link) which is not to say that there have not been any more recent outbreaks, but just not reported. This report clearly originated as a result of the laboratory diagnosis and this limited information on the submission document. Maybe we will see follow-up information. Two villages are reported, so we can expect that there were more animals affected than just the 4 reported.

Anthrax is enzootic in eastern Turkey and a constant problem, and the previous multiple outbreaks in 2018 were serious, with very significant numbers of livestock deaths. Anthrax is patently a serious human and livestock problem in this country, which is economically and politically stressed. Niche modelling shows that some 75% of the country is at serious risk. Put another way, if a livestock national control and surveillance programme were to be initiated, some 80% of the cattle would have to be vaccinated annually for at least 10 years before targeted area vaccination could be used to tidy up.

Bingöl is a city in Eastern Turkey. It is surrounded by mountains and numerous glacier lakes, hence the name. Lately, the town has become a popular tourist destination. See the Wikipedia report for a map showing the location of this eastern province. According to 2017 estimates, it has a population of over 111 000. Bingöl is the capital of Bingöl Province, one of the 81 provinces of Turkey. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing%C3%B6l_Province). - Mod.MHJ
