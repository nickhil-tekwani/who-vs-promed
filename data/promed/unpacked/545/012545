[1] Utah - first fatalities

A total of 2 people have died from hepatitis A, marking the 1st deaths amid an outbreak of the disease in Utah, health officials said [Tu, 3 Apr 2018]. Both victims were Salt Lake County residents, the county's health department said. One died late last month, March 2018, but the other person died in January 2018.

"Due to other health conditions affecting the individual, officials were waiting on confirmatory tests to declare an official cause of death" for the initial victim, Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp said in a release. He said the fatal cases are related to a hepatitis A outbreak centered in Salt Lake County that began last May 2017 and has infected 212 people statewide since then. "Their test came back positive for the outbreak strain. So they are linked to the current outbreak happening here and in other states," said Dr. Dagmar Vitek, medical director of the county health department.

The victims are adults, ages 18 to 65, according to Vitek. Rupp said the county is unable to further identify the victims "due to medical privacy laws." The outbreak has been most prevalent among those who are homeless, who are or were recently incarcerated or who use illicit drugs, public health leaders have said. The two who died "belonged to one or more" of those populations, Rupp said. However, those who do not belong to at-risk populations should not be complacent about the outbreak, Rupp has said. Customers of a pair of restaurants in Spanish Fork and a convenience store in West Jordan were warned in December 2017 and January 2018 that an employee at each of those establishments was infected with hepatitis A. Some of those potentially affected customers were told to get vaccines, which Rupp has said can be effective for up to two weeks after exposure. In February [2018], the Salt Lake County Board of Health began mandating that all food workers at an eatery be vaccinated if any of their co-workers had been exposed to hepatitis A.

Vitek said neither of the victims who died were restaurant workers. The Salt Lake County Health Department "has conducted targeted vaccination and awareness campaigns to try to control the outbreak, including holding on-site vaccination clinics at community locations where individuals thought to be at high risk congregate," Rupp said. "The department has also distributed thousands of hygiene kits to people in need; the kits contain soap, disinfectant wipes, and other products encouraging hand washing and good hygiene," he said. Besides vaccines, proper hand washing after using the bathroom and before eating or preparing food is the best way to prevent hepatitis A, according to Rupp. The virus can be spread through even a tiny amount of an infected person's feces and is easily transmitted through contaminated food.

Vitek said the county's response to the outbreak is "concentrating on ... sanitation, vaccination and education." She said the health department's vaccination campaign has been "enormous," numbering more than 9000 kits administered to people in high-risk populations. "It's really sad that we have to report that people are dying because it's a vaccine-preventable disease," she said. Hepatitis A can take several weeks before causing noticeable symptoms, so tracking precisely when the worst of the outbreak is over is difficult. However, Vitek feels optimistic. "It looks like maybe it has peaked already and (that) we are on the downward slope," she said.

Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in [August 2016], public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.6 percent of the total males are MSM, 2.8 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.7 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total cases continue to increase and have altogether in numbers and in fatalities surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.
