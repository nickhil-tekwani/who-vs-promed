A big difference between the epidemic in 2001 [and the current outbreak] is
the amount and quality of information that is now available from the
Argentine animal health sanitary office official website. This information
includes complete reports in Spanish, English, and Russian.

Comment: Argentine sanitary services learned a lesson in 2001 and now seems
to be in a much better condition to prevent the infection [spreading] from
neighboring countries. In some aspects, the situation is similar to what
happened in the Republic of Ireland in 2001, when the veterinary services
imposed a restriction area in order to prevent the infection spreading from
infected premises in Northern Ireland. In that case, prevention was
effective, since all the outbreaks were located within that restriction
area. Similarly, the outbreaks reported in Argentina were located in the
restriction area imposed to prevent the infection spreading from infected
premises in Bolivia and Paraguay. If the strategy is effective, more
outbreaks may be detected, but in a shorter time and within this
restriction area.

[Andres makes a sound point. When I checked the Argentine website, I had
problems, but hopefully these have been corrected. It should be remembered
that the 2001 foot & mouth disease series in Argentina came after a change
in government and senior staffing in Buenos Aires. Though Buenos Aires was
warned in plenty of time by the northern ranchers and veterinarians, the
warnings were disregarded, with disastrous results. The Argentines have
taken that lesson to heart with the above result. The Canadians have been
equally open with their BSE investigations and reports. One just wishes
that more governments would follow this example. On the other side of the
argument, the knee-jerk opportunist trade embargoes by other countries do
not positively reward honesty in reporting. - Mod.MHJ]
