Crohn's disease is almost certainly caused by bacteria found in milk - even
if pasteurised - and drinking water supplies, according to research by a
world expert on the chronic illness. John Hermon-Taylor of St George's
Medical School in Tooting, South London, says that up to 55 per cent of
dairy herds in Western Europe and America are infected with the bacteria,
which can survive the pasteurisation process. Water supplies become
infected as the droppings from herds seep into the soil, down into natural
aquifers.
The organism is called MAP (_Mycobacterium avium_ subspecies
_paratuberculosis_), which is difficult to detect and destroy. The normal
pasteurisation process involves heating milk to 72C for 15 seconds, but to
be sure of killing MAP it would need to be heated to that level for twice
as long.
Crohn's disease is not fatal but causes chronic diarrhoea, persistent
abdominal pain, weight loss, tiredness and mental problems. Because it is
not notifiable, the number of people affected can only be estimated but it
is thought that up to 80 000 suffer from it in Britain, with between 4000
and 8000 new cases every year. The cost to the nation of sufferers' medical
care is estimated to be BPS 240 million a year.
Professor Hermon-Taylor, who has researched the illness for 20 years, said:
"If there were no MAP I believe there would be almost no Crohn's disease.
It is certainly responsible for between 60 per cent and 90 per cent of all
cases and I would think that it is more likely to be 90 per cent."
His study, funded by Action Research, the medical charity, shows that MAP
can live undetected in cattle for years. Infected cows secrete the bacteria
into their milk and on to their pastures. Tests have proved that MAP causes
chronic infection of the intestines of many animals, including four types
of primates. American studies have isolated MAP from the breast milk of
women with Crohn's disease but not in women who do not have the illness.
"The problems caused by MAP in the milk supply constitute a public health
disaster of tragic proportions, for which a range of remedial measures are
urgently needed and for which the Government must take responsibility,"
Professor Hermon-Taylor said.
He wants to see the Government reverse its decision to allow the sale of
unpasteurised milk and to increase the stringency of the pasteurising
process. Dairy herds ought to be tested for the infection and the illness
ought to notifiable, he said.
Professor Hermon-Taylor said that anybody worried about catching the
disease from milk could be certain of killing any MAP by heating it to 80C
and then allowing it to cool before drinking it.
There is no evidence that the measles virus is implicated in Crohn's
disease, according to a study published today in the specialist journal
Gut. The researchers, from the Akita University School of Medicine in
Japan, looked for any potential link between the disease and the triple
vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).
They say that the theory of a link, which was suggested in a research paper
by the Royal Free Medical School published two years ago in The Lancet, was
based on the hypothesis that the measles antibody was uniquely present in
Crohn's disease. "Our results directly contradict this theory.
Children who are allergic to eggs are at no greater risk of a severe
allergic reaction to the MMR vaccine, which is cultured in chick embryo
cells. The researchers, from the Sheffield Institute for Vaccine Studies,
report in today's Archives of Disease in Childhood that a trial of 410
children with egg allergy showed that only four had a mild reaction after
being vaccinated. Their study suggests that the real culprit in allergic
reactions to MMR could be gelatin. Overall, they say that any severe
adverse effect is almost certain to occur within half an hour of the
vaccination and that clinics should be aware of this and have antidotes on
hand in case a child does have a dangerous reaction.
