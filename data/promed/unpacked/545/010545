Ebola situation report - 7 Oct 2015
-----------------------------------
Summary
-------
No confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 4 Oct 2015. This is the 1st time that a complete epidemiological week has elapsed with 0 confirmed cases since March 2014. All contacts have now completed follow-up in Sierra Leone. However, over 500 contacts remain under follow-up in Guinea, and several high-risk contacts associated with active and recently active chains of transmission in Guinea and Sierra Leone have been lost to follow-up. There remains a near-term risk of further cases.

Case incidence has remained below 10 confirmed cases per week for 11 consecutive weeks. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. A refined phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola will build on these measures to drive case incidence to 0, and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission. Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, improved testing and counselling capacity as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors, and the increased use of innovative technologies -- from vaccines to rapid diagnostic tests -- are central to the phase-3 response framework.

A total of 509 contacts remain under follow-up in 3 prefectures in Guinea: Conakry, Coyah, and Forecariah. All contacts are associated with a single chain of transmission centred on the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. In addition, approximately 290 contacts have been identified but have so far proven untraceable in the past 42 days in 4 Guinean prefectures: Conakry, Coyah, Dubreka, and Forecariah. The 4 most recent cases in Guinea, which were reported on 26 and 27 Sept 2015 from 2 villages in the sub-prefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah, were infected by an unregistered contact of a probable case linked to the Ratoma chain of transmission. Several door-to-door case-finding operations were undertaken in the areas of Dixinn and Ratoma in Conakry and in several villages in the sub-prefecture of Kaliah, Forecariah, in the week to 4 Oct 2015 in order to mitigate some of the risk posed by contacts who have not been traced.

Sierra Leone reported no confirmed cases for the 3rd consecutive week. All contacts linked to the country's 2 most recently active chains of transmission, Bombali and Kambia, have now completed 21-day follow-up. In addition, the last case to receive treatment was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre in Kambia on 26 Sep 2015. However, 2 high-risk contacts -- one from Bombali and one from Kambia -- remain untraced. Efforts to trace these missing contacts and mitigate the risk of any undetected transmission will continue until at least 42 days have elapsed since the last reported case in each district.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas. 8 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 725 samples in the week to 4 Oct 2015. Analyses of the geographical distribution of samples collected indicate that 20 of 34 Guinean prefectures did not collect any samples from either live or dead suspected cases of EVD over the 1-week period. In Liberia, 928 samples were collected from 100 percent (15 of 15) of counties and tested in the 4 operational laboratories in the week to 4 Oct 2015. Over the same period, 1738 samples were collected from 100 percent (14 of 14) of districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 10 operational laboratories.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the outbreak there have been a total of 28 421 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 4 Oct 2015, with 11 297 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). No new cases were reported in the week to 4 Oct 2015.

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 years of age are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia, and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone. Adults aged 45 years and above are approximately 5 times more likely to be affected in Guinea, and approximately 4 times more likely in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 4 Oct 2015. Since the start of the outbreak a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[3] India: Asian Ebola active (misnomer)
Date: Tue 6 Oct 2015
Source: The Indian Express [edited]
http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/asian-ebola-virus-active-in-almost-all-states-says-niv-study/


Known as 'the Asian Ebola virus', the CCHF or the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, is now believed to be prevalent across the country. A study by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) here has determined 17 outbreaks so far, affecting 50 people, most of whom succumbed to the virus.

The CCHF [virus infection] has a fatality rate of up to 80 percent [This is too high. The usual CFR is 10-40 percent]. First detected in January 2011 in Ahmedabad, the virus that spreads from animals to humans is now active across almost all states, with Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, and Gujarat reporting cases, a serosurvey shows.

NIV Director Dr Devendra Mourya, along with scientist Pragya Yadav and others, published these findings in the October issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta.

The disease is usually transmitted to humans by bites of _Hyalomma_ ticks, which are found on cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep. Humans can also acquire the virus through exposure to CCHF-infected blood and tissues or to body secretions of an affected animal, during slaughtering or allied procedures or at a hospital.

While there is a lot of awareness in India about the threat posed by the Ebola virus, Mourya told The Indian Express, the real threat posed by the CCHF is little understood.

The virus could also go undetected and the cause of death misunderstood as the symptoms of dengue and CCHF are overlapping, Pragya Yadav said, adding that CCHF belonged to the high-risk group IV, as per the CDC and WHO.

"A large section of the Indian economy as well as rural development are dependent on agriculture, livestock farming, and dairy industry. India exports over USD 400 million of meat and beef every year. India also has many animal-trading fairs (such as Pushkar, Rajasthan; Sonepur, Bihar) where there is extensive movement of tick-infested animals. There is a high threat of transmission of the CCHF virus to new areas via such trade," Mourya said.

Detected in India for the 1st time only in 2011, the CCHF virus is widespread in several countries of Africa, Asia, South-East Europe, and Eurasia. Hard ticks, especially _Hyalomma_ ticks, are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. Numerous wild and domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep, and hare, serve as amplifying hosts for the virus.

"Animal husbandry and abattoir workers are at high risk, as they are always in close contact with live animals or carcasses that may be infested with CCHFV-infected ticks. Infected animals do not develop severe disease as viraemia (presence of virus in the body) in livestock is short-lived (up to 2 weeks), and of low intensity," Mourya said.

Yadav stressed the need for more higher-level laboratories to check the samples. The diagnosis of high-risk group pathogens is a major concern in India, where only few Biosafety Level-3 (BSL-3) laboratories and just one BSL-4 laboratory exist, Yadav said.

[This is REALLY confusing the issue. The only ebolavirus present in Asia is Reston virus -- see ProMED-mail Reston virus - Philippines: bat 20150730.3548017. It has a reservoir in monkeys, pigs, and bats, and can infect humans but does not make them sick. It is the only ebolavirus that does not make people sick. I hope the report is wrong and that CCHF virus is NOT widely known as the Asian Ebola virus. CCHF virus, although deadly, belongs to an altogether different group of viruses from Ebola. - Mod.JW

It is important to note this report is about Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a tick-transmitted nairovirus, and NOT Ebola -- very confusing!!! CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. The virus is a member of the _Bunyaviridae_ family of RNA viruses. It is a zoonotic disease carried by several domestic and wild animals. While clinical disease is rare in infected animals, it is severe in infected humans, with a mortality rate of 10-40 percent. Outbreaks of illness are usually attributable to _Hyalomma_ tick bites or contact with infected animals or people.

[After he became sick from the Ebola virus, Thomas Eric Duncan shared brief hugs with 5 people, a residence with 4 people and a bed with 1 person -- even as his condition steadily worsened. None of those people knew that his illness would be fatal and that they could easily become infected. Ebola had never been diagnosed in the United States before Duncan brought the virus to Dallas a year ago [2014].
A scientific report, published last summer, mentions these unidentified people as being among Duncan's 17 contacts in the Dallas area. None of them got sick, not even the 3 people designated as "high risk" for an Ebola infection. ... -- more]
[While it is not clear how 2 of his caregivers at Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas became infected, even while wearing protective gear and following protocol, it appears Duncan's apartment mates who did not become ill, were protected by following strict protocol for hospital infections other than Ebola, that is, frequent hand washing and thorough surface cleansing. Not knowing the patient had Ebola, they proceeded as best they could with the knowledge they had from their work. The experience is described in Louise Troh's memoir of the events, "My Spirit Took You In," which was published in April 2015 by Weinstein Books. - Mod.LK]
