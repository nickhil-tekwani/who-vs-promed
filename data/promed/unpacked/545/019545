US investigates food outbreaks linked to 20 deaths
--------------------------------------------------
US health and food officials said on Thursday, 3 Oct 2002, that they are
investigating the source of a foodborne listeria outbreak blamed for at
least 20 deaths and 120 illnesses in north eastern states.
In this outbreak, the United States Department of Agriculture said its Food
Safety and Inspection Service began "vigorous sampling" of lunch meats and
deli products after illnesses were reported in early September 2002. Most
illnesses were in New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, but Michigan,
Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut, and Delaware also were affected. Federal
officials have not yet been able to pinpoint whether the listeria
contaminated ready-to-eat meats or other foods such as seafood, soft
cheeses, and unpasteurized milk.
"Working with state health officials, Food Safety and Inspection Service
(FSIS) investigators have been probing every possible lead in an attempt to
narrow the list of possible sources of contamination," FSIS administrator
Garry McKee said in a statement. "Multiple samples have been collected and
analyzed, but as of yet, all have tested negative."
Of the 120 listeria illnesses reported to health officials, 36 were linked
through laboratory tests, said FSIS spokesman Steve Cohen. The 36 illnesses
resulted in 6 deaths. Officials said they have not yet determined the
strain of listeria that caused the other 14 deaths.
