The Electronic Telegraph, August 23, 1997 (one year ago):
"A new official veterinary survey shows that countries in the European
Union have reported only one in six cases of mad cow disease...By
January [1997, the Republic of Ireland had reported 188 cases - but the
number expected was 911. Germany reported five - the expected number
was 243. Of the others:
France reported 28 (expected number 32);
Spain reported none (54);
Italy reported two (50);
Portugal reported 61 (262);**********
Holland reported none (44);
Belgium and Luxembourg reported none (17)."
At a meeting of farmers and residents in the lower Alentejo region in
southern Portugal late on Tuesday, President Jorge Sampaio urged strict
compliance with sanitary checks to prevent the spread of BSE in
Portugal, adding, "It is important that all sanitary steps are taken so
that there is
no alarmism. We need rigorous information and ruthless controls."
The European Commission is considering taking legal action against
Portugal over what it sees as an alarming increase in mad cow disease
this year. Portuguese farm minister Fernando Gomes da Silva has admitted
that his government was in contact with Brussels over the issue but
stressed Portugal
did not officially export any beef. However, veterinary officials
informed the Portuguese media on Tuesday night that Portugal does export
beef, and that Spain was one destination. The Commission's fears are
based on an inspection report carried out by EU veterinary experts
earlier this year.
According to EU officials, the report highlighted serious deficiencies
in Portugal's controls over animal feed.
The report has now been passed to the Portuguese authorities, who are
expected to reply before the end of the week. The Commission's next step
will depend on the reply it receives. The most likely response from
Brussels will be a threat of court action, according to EU officials.
