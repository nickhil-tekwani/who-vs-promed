[Hereafter a Pacnews message on the first case of diphtheria diagnosed in
New Zealand for the last 20 years. Migration, international travels,
tourism: it may be time for the Pacific to have a good check on
immunisation coverages against diphtheria!]
NZL - HEALTH: RadAustralia; PACNEWS 2: Wed Aug 12 10:23 1998

NZ records its first case of diphtheria after 20 years
MELBOURNE -- Scores of children in New Zealand are being tested for
diphtheria, after a toddler attending an Auckland child care centre was
diagnosed with the disease -- the first case in New Zealand for almost 20
years.
The potentially fatal disease, which is passed on by close contact, starts
with a sore throat, fever and neck swelling, but can progress to blocked
breathing passages and paralysis.
The case is the first in New Zealand since 1980. Authorities say the child
possibly picked up the disease from his parents, who recently returned from
Indonesia.

It would be interesting to know what the immunisation protocols for New
Zealand are. Can any one provide information on this?
