Abstract
-------
During February 2018-January 2019, we conducted large-scale surveillance for the presence and prevalence of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and louping ill virus (LIV) in sentinel animals and ticks in the United Kingdom. Serum was collected from 1309 deer culled across England and Scotland. Overall, 4% of samples were ELISA-positive for the TBEV serocomplex. A focus in the Thetford Forest area had the highest proportion (47.7%) of seropositive samples. Engorged ticks collected from culled deer within seropositive regions were tested for viral RNA; 5 of 2041 ticks tested positive by LIV/TBEV real-time reverse transcription PCR, all from within the Thetford Forest area. From 1 tick, we identified a full-length genomic sequence of TBEV. Thus, using deer as sentinels revealed a potential TBEV focus in the United Kingdom. This detection of TBEV genomic sequence in UK ticks has important public health implications, especially for undiagnosed encephalitis.

Background
----------
The only tickborne virus in the United Kingdom documented to cause disease in vertebrates is louping ill virus (LIV), a flavivirus transmitted by the deer/sheep tick, _Ixodes ricinus_ (1). This tick species is the most abundant and widely distributed tick species in the United Kingdom and a known vector of Lyme borreliosis.

Results
-------
Of serum samples from across the United Kingdom, 4% were positive by ELISA, and 5% by HAI. Cohen's Îº indicated substantial agreement (0.61) between the methods, indicating ELISA results agreed closely with HAI test results (Table 1). ELISA yielded positive results in all deer species for which it was used. These were 27/663 roe (_Capreolus capreolus_), 10/246 fallow (_Dama dama_), 9/242 red deer (_Cervus elaphus_), 6/108 muntjac (_Muntiacus reevesi_), 1/48 sika (_Cervus nippon_), and 0/2 red/sika hybrids. HAI determined the following positives: 28/662 roe, 15/245 fallow, 18/242 red, 7/106 muntjac, 0/45 sika, and 1/2 red/sika hybrid.

Of all ticks submitted from deer carcasses, 2041 collected from 339 deer were from within 15 km [about 9.3 mi] of an ELISA-positive result. All ticks were identified as _I. ricinus_; 1450 were adult females, 585 adult males, and 6 nymphs. One blood-fed tick (male) showed high levels of TBEV RNA (cycle threshold 15.4). Sequencing revealed a full-length TBEV genome designated TBEV-UK (GenBank accession no. MN128700). Phylogenetic analysis illustrates this as a TBEV-Eu subtype; it is most closely related to the Norwegian Mandal strain of TBEV isolated from ticks in 2009 (Figure 2), sharing a 99% sequence identity.

Discussion
----------
The deer were culled within a large forest habitat, which aligns closer with ecology required for TBEV, rather than LIV, maintenance (7). Based on these findings, and the evidence that all rRT-PCR-positive results were for TBEV and not LIV, we propose that TBEV is established and is being maintained through enzootic cycles within the Thetford Forest area, rather than resulting from multiple importation events, which is in line with findings in many endemic focal areas of TBEV (30). The hypothesis that TBEV infection might be maintained in Thetford Forest is supported by previous work in the United Kingdom that provided evidence of co-feeding between ticks from different life stages on small mammals in a southern English woodland, which is a crucial factor for the maintenance of TBEV (9, 12). In addition, our positive serology data support the concept that the virus is circulating nonviremically in local wildlife and by cycling among the co-feeding nymphs, larvae, and adult ticks, through nonviremic transmission. Good evidence shows that TBEV is maintained in other parts of Europe through nonviremic transmission (31).

The genomic sequence of TBEV-UK shows close identity to a TBEV-EU virus isolated in 2009 from questing ticks collected in Norway. This similarity suggests that TBEV-UK might have been brought to the United Kingdom on migratory birds, such as blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) and redwings (_Turdus iliacus_) (33), which are known to transport ticks over wide distances (34-37). The United Kingdom experiences a large influx of migratory birds each autumn from several TBEV-endemic countries in northern Europe, including Norway. During this migration, birds 1st arrive on the east coast of the United Kingdom, and it is feasible that TBEV-UK could have originated from a tick imported by an autumn migratory bird. We are collecting tick samples from migratory birds to assess the proportion of tick-infested birds arriving in the United Kingdom and testing these imported ticks for TBEV (among other potential pathogens). In addition, because of lower viral RNA levels, we are looking into primer-amplification sequencing approaches to further decipher the virus responsible for the rRT-PCR-positive samples detected from Thetford Forest.

[This report fills in some of the gaps that were in the initial report (see Tick-borne encephalitis - UK (England) 20191029.6752219). The ticks in the above report identify _Ixodes ricinus_ as those in which the TBE-EU full sequence was found. The above report also provides evidence that several species of deer had antibody to TBE. No mention was made about possible involvement of rodents in TBE virus transmission in the UK. In mainland Europe where TBE is endemic, the bank vole (_Myodes glareeolus_) is the rodent host of the virus. That rodent is found throughout the British Isles and it would be interesting to know if TBE virus is present in that rodent population.

It is not surprising that TBE virus has found its way to the United Kingdom. The above report points out that birds from TBE virus endemic countries migrate to the UK. It is reasonable to suppose that this may have been the route of introduction of the virus into the country.

Although no human cases of TBE have been diagnosed in the UK, TBE is a significant public health problem in several European countries. The clinical spectrum of acute TBE ranges from symptoms of mild meningitis to severe meningoencephalitis with or without myelitis. The incubation period of central European TBE is 7-14 days. Onset is generally biphasic. The 1st phase involves a non-specific influenza-like illness with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, lasting about a week. After a period of remission lasting a few days, the fever returns with aseptic meningitis or encephalomyelitis. The case fatality rate is 1-5%and about 20% of survivors have neurological sequelae. Residual motor defects are rare.
