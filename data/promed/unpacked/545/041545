Pelicans dying from Tampa to Naples
-----------------------------------
Scientists are still trying to determine whether it was cold-weather stress
or other factors that led to the death of dozens of brown pelicans from the
Tampa area south to Naples. Reports of dead pelicans began springing up in
mid-December 2002, about the same time that a cold weather pattern spread
over the region. Biologists in Gainesville are testing pelicans for any
evidence of West Nile virus or exposure to red tide. The results should be
available in a couple of weeks.
The topic of the birds' deaths was raised on Monday during an Estero Bay
Agency on Bay Management (ABM) meeting in North Fort Myers. The
non-regulatory agency monitors development, the environment, and other
related issues within the Estero Bay watershed. "We started having people
come into the office and calling about dead pelicans," said Heather
Stafford, director of the Estero Bay Aquatic Preserve and an ABM member.
"They were mostly in Hurricane Bay." Hurricane Bay is a small water body
east of Fort Myers Beach that connects to Estero Bay. Stafford said she was
unsure how many dead birds were reported. The number of reported dead
pelicans in the Estero Bay area have dropped in recent weeks. "It sounds
like (scientists) are thinking it was more cold-related than anything."
ABM chair Jim Beever said the reasons for the pelican deaths could include
cold-stress, starvation, or even pollution that has built up in the
pelicans' systems. "Sometimes when the fish are not where they're supposed
to be and the birds expect them there, there may be some starvation
involved," Beever said. "Then there may be malnutrition, which leads to
susceptibility to disease." Beever said several frozen pelican carcasses
were sent to a laboratory at the University of Florida for testing. "The
majority of birds sent in were immature," Beever said. "There's also
potential that there are certain diseases that strike this way."
Alex Kropp, an assistant regional biologist for the Florida Fish and
Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the lack of food is a possible
reason for the pelican deaths. "It seems like we've seen more brown
pelicans inland this year, so it could be food supply," Kropp said from his
Lakeland office. "A fair number of them were juveniles, so that leads us to
believe it was lack of food." Juveniles need about a year to acquire the
hunting skills displayed by their skydiving elders. Juveniles are also more
affected by cold spells. Kropp said more than half of all brown pelicans
don't survive their first year. Recent blood tests on pelicans at the
Center for the Rehabilitation of Wildlife, or CROW, on Sanibel Island
showed low levels of protein. Tests for toxins were not performed on those
birds.

While one area scientist said the deaths of more than 150 grackles at 2
area shopping centers should be cause for alarm, local authorities still
say it is too soon to tell.
Lane Gergely, who is a microbiologist with Sure Life and Legend
Laboratories, said there is every reason for the community at large to be
concerned. "They think this is chemical in nature, but I am concerned that
they did not take proper precautions," Gergely said. "They (the birds)
hemorrhaged internally, they (their organs) were mush, and it did not come
from anything they ingested. Somebody either poisoned them with a chemical
that travels through the skin or it's viral and bacterial in nature."
Merchants at the Plaza Del Rey shopping center were shocked on Wednesday to
discover the north end of the parking lot littered with the carcasses of
more than 150 grackles when they came to work. About 150 grackles were
recovered at Plaza Del Rey with at least 10 more discovered across the
street in a parking lot. Plaza Del Rey merchants said they had spoken with
an official with Trammell Crow, the commercial real estate company that has
a financial interest in the shopping center, and learned the company had
experienced a similar incident at one of their properties in San Antonio.
Attempts to contact officials with Trammell Crow were unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, Animal Control Supervisor Randall Springs said several samples
of the dead birds had already been sent to the Texas Department of Health,
the Texas Animal Health Commission, and the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department, with more being sent out to the US Fish and Wildlife Service in
Madison, Wisconsin. Springs said it was still too early to tell just what
caused all these birds to die en masse so suddenly, but that everything
that could be done was being done. "It could be a number of things," he
said. "There is no telling. I went with Parks and Wildlife, and there are
no more dead birds. I guess if there is something really bad we'll know in
a few days."
No matter how bad it is, it's something the community needs to be aware of,
Gergely said. She said whatever was used to kill the birds could have been
used elsewhere. "I'm not a chemist, I am a microbiologist, but I do know
epidemiology. And this thing just had to have happened very rapidly to
cause that," she said. "It's a real scary thing, and it's something the
community needs to be worried about." Gergely said a virus carried by these
birds or any possible poison used to kill them could ultimately affect
humans. "If a human gets enough of this, it could have the same effect,"
she said. "We need to find who did this, where it came from, and how they
got hold of it." In small doses, Gergely said there could be symptoms in
the community that could crop up later that are comparable to the effects
of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans.
Because of the implications to other species and the fact this occurred in
such a public place, Gergely said she was considering asking the
Environmental Protection Agency to come in and investigate the matter.
"Whatever happens, it's not good. Whether it's chemical, viral, or
biological, it can affect humans," she said.

[These 2 communications from 2 very different locations -- Gulf coast of
Florida and central Texas -- are being posted more for background
information than the probability that either is due to an infectious
process. The Texas grackle report is very likely to be of a poisoning. It
is the wrong time of year for a vector-borne disease. The deaths of 150
birds "all at once" suggests an acute exposure to a chemical agent with a
fixed lead time to death. Grackles are very noisy birds, widespread in
Texas, and have many human enemies. The birds could simply have been in the
wrong place at the wrong time; they might have previously ingested
crop-sprayed chemicals, but died only after roosting in trees near the
malls. Bird deaths associated with crop-spraying are not unusual at this
time of the year. Sea birds, such as pelicans, are exposed to a wide range
of pollutants and toxins. Such die-offs are good sentinel events, and one
never knows until the lab report comes in -- and not always then -- what
caused them. Better to be vigilant but cautious than to ignore them. When
the respective reports become available, we would appreciate being updated
on the probable causes. - Mod.MHJ]
