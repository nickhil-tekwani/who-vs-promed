Watermelon farmers of Patuakhali district [Barisal division] are facing losses as the melon vines are dying in different areas due to 'wilting' disease, just 2 weeks before harvest. This disease is found in different areas in the district.

A farmer said, "I cultivated watermelons on half an acre of land, but some vines suddenly started dying. First, the roots became rotten and then the vines died." He added that he had never seen such a disease in the area in the [last] 10 years. Another farmer of the same area, said, "there was heavy rainfall about 15 days ago, and the disease was detected after that."

Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) sources said a total of 17 020 hectares [about 42 000 acres] in the district were cultivated with watermelons this year [2016]. Watermelon is a profitable crop.

[A large number of pathogens can affect cucurbit crops, which include melons, cucumber, squash, and pumpkins.

The symptoms described above may point to some form of fungal root rot, but reliable diagnosis is crucial for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
