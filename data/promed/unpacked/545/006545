E. COLI O157:H7 INFECTIONS, HUMAN - USA (WASHINGTON)

Seven children who attend a day care center in Spokane, Washington are
reported to have suffered from _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections in recent days.
Investigators have not yet identified the index case, or a common source
for the outbreak. An additional case reported from the same locality has
been confirmed by DNA typing of bacterial isolates, but appears to
represent an early case from a recovered patient rather than an indication
that the outbreak is spreading. All patients are either recovered, or out
of imminent danger.
