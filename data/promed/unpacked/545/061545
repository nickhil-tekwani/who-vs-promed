UNDIAGNOSED LIVESTOCK DEATHS - AFGHANISTAN (04)

Unfortunately the information is meager, and we may start to
speculate with dozens of possible diagnoses.
However, I would like to make a few comments:
1. I would disregard Dr Baker's suggestion of an "unexpected outbreak
of _Coenurus cerebralis_ (_Taenia pisiformis_)", and I may also say
that _Coenurus cerebralis_ is the larval stage of _Multiceps
multiceps_, and not of _Taenia pisiformis_, whose intermediate hosts
do not include ruminants.
I have seen quite a number of these in sheep in our country [Peru],
and our native Indians in the mountains recognize the disease very
well. Known as "sturdy" in English, we call it "torneo", and many
people (not necessarily veterinarians) know how to carefully extract
the cyst from the brain, when it is superficially located. I am sure
people in Afghanistan would have recognized sturdy at once.
2. Toxic plants are a possibility, but here again, natives would have
recognized endemic plants in their area.
3. Lead poisoning should indeed be considered; perhaps mercury also.
Some evidence of mining contamination of pastures should be evident.
4. Polioencephalomalacia (corticocerebral necrosis), due to sulphate
toxicity. [Other PEM-related etiologies are known; for some details
see

5. Hypomagnesemia is probably not a problem for a country like Afghanistan.
6. Some unusual infectious disease, viral or bacterial, seems to me
to be more reasonable. Perhaps _Haemophilus spp_ or _Listeria
monocytogenes_, or even Clostridial enterotoxemia.

[Dr Andresen's corrective comment regarding the identity of the
cestode helminth of which _Coenurus cerebralis_ is the larval (and
clinically-related) stage, is appreciated.. The following text,
titled "Coenurosis," from the Merck Veterinary Manual, is copied here
for the benefit of subscribers who are not familiar with the clinical
condition also known in English-speaking countries as "gid,"
"sturdy," or "staggers":
"_Taenia (Multiceps) multiceps_ is an intestinal parasite of canids
(especially dogs, foxes, and jackals) and man. Its intermediate hosts
include sheep, goats, deer, antelope, chamois, rabbits, hares,
horses, and less commonly cattle, which acquire the eggs while
grazing. Some oncospheres reach the brain and develop by endogenous
budding into a metacestode (larval) stage known as _Coenurus
cerebralis_. Initial invasion and development of the oncospheres may
be responsible for acute suppurative meningoencephalitis. The fully
developed coenurus may be 5-6 cm in diameter and cause increased
intracranial pressure, which results in ataxia, hypermetria,
blindness, head deviation, stumbling, and paralysis. In sheep,
palpation of the skull caudal to the horn buds may reveal refraction;
surgery to remove the cyst, including its wall, has a reasonable
chance of success and is justified in valuable animals. Dogs
associated with sheep and other livestock should not be fed the heads
or nervous tissue from infected animals and should be dewormed
regularly".
Dr Andressen's skepticism regarding the possible involvement of
Coenurosis in the current condition(s) in Badakhshan seems justified;
the other suggested differentials are also rather speculative. More
likely, the disease and mortality, particularly in small ruminants,
might be caused by an infectious agent, a probable candidate -- as
proposed in the FAO response -- being the PPR Morbillivirus.
The results of the ongoing epidemiological investigations are
anticipated. Until then, this thread is cut. - Mod.AS]
