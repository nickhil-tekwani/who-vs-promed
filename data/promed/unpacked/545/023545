The Burkinabe Ministry of Health announced on Sunday evening [22 Aug 2021) the detection of a suspected case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever at the Bogodogo University Hospital Center (CHU-B), in Ouagadougou.

The Ministry of Health said in its statement that the 22-year-old patient arrived 2 days [20 Aug 2021] ago from Cote d'Ivoire.

After a trip to 2 health facilities in the health district of Ziniare (Central Plateau region), he was received in a medical emergency in Ouagadougou.

The patient was immediately isolated by the CHU-B team in accordance with recommended standards; a diagnostic and care process are underway, according to the same source, which calls for compliance with disease prevention measures.

In view of the national and sub-regional epidemiological context, Burkina Faso recently announced the strengthening of its epidemiological surveillance system in order to face the various health threats.

On 14 Aug [2021] Cote d'Ivoire declared an imported case of Ebola virus disease -- the 1st since 1994 -- in Abidjan, the economic capital of the country, where nearly 5 million people live.

No deaths have been reported.

Cote d'Ivoire has received 5000 doses of Ebola vaccine from the World Health Organization, which has already enabled 828 exposed people to be vaccinated, having been in contact with the 1st case, according to Ivorian authorities.

Guinean authorities have confirmed that 58 people have been confined to their homes after being identified as contacts of a woman who contracted the Ebola virus.

The Ebola case was discovered in Cote d'Ivoire in an 18-year-old Guinean woman who had travelled by bus from Labe, Guinea, a journey of some 1500 km (930 miles). It was Cote d'Ivoire's 1st known case of the disease since 1994.

Ebola is often deadly, causing severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

The discovery in Cote d'Ivoire came nearly 2 months after the United Nations' health agency declared an end to Guinea's 2nd Ebola outbreak, which started last year [2020] and killed 12 people.

Regional health director, Elhadj Mamadou Houdy Bah told the AFP news agency, "In Labe, 58 contacts have been identified. However, the good news is that none of them are presenting any signs (of Ebola) at the moment, all are being followed."

The driver of the vehicle that transported the young Ebola sufferer to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, is one of those identified.

As the sole centre in Labe able to handle such contact cases is currently full dealing with coronavirus patients, the Ebola contact cases were placed under confinement at home for an observation period of 21 days, the Guinean health authorities said.

An Ebola outbreak between 2013 and 2016 killed 11 300 people throughout West Africa, including 2300 people in Guinea. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) believes the toll has been underestimated.

On Tuesday [17 Aug 2021], the WHO said 9 Ebola contact cases had been identified in Cote d'Ivoire, following the case of the Guinean woman who is currently being treated in a hospital in Abidjan, while health workers are being vaccinated against the disease.

[The fact that the case that occurred in Cote d'Ivoire was acquired in Guinea and brought into Cote d'Ivoire by land transport indicates that further spread into Burkina Faso is possible. One hopes that the laboratory tests are negative for this suspected case but increased surveillance, while results are awaited, is prudent.

It is reassuring to learn that the 58 possible contacts in Guinea are being followed and so far are negative for the infection. The circumstances under which the Guinea woman acquired her Ebola virus infection are still unclear, nor do we know the Ebola virus subtype involved. - Mod.TY
