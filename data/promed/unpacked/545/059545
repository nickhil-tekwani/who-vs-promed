"Yongeichthys criniger" Contains Tetrodotoxin
16 Poisoned by Eating Seafish, One Dead
-----------------------------------------
Recently, a number of villagers in Xilian Township of Xuwen County in
Zhenjiang Municipality suffered food poisoning after eating
_Yongeichthys criniger_. 16 people developed symptoms and one died
en route to hospital.
On the morning of 12 Mar 2007, the Guangdong Provincial Health Bureau
received a report from the Zhenjiang Municipal Health Bureau that
between 7 & 9 Mar 2007, 13 people in Dajing Village of Xilian
Township in Xuwen County and 3 people in Guateng Village developed
symptoms of poisoning after eating seafish; 2 children were
included. A 56 year old male died en route to hospital.
3 people recovered and were discharged from hospital on 11 Mar
2007. Based on investigations and animal experimentation, health
agencies in Zhenjiang preliminarily believe that the poisoning
incident was caused by consumption of toxin-containing fish.
Experts at Zhenjiang Marine Fisheries Bureau and Zhenjiang Ocean
University confirm the fish species is _Yongeichthys criniger_, a
poisonous fish. The toxin it contains is Tetrodotoxin. [This is]
consistent with the conclusions of health agencies [following] on
site investigations. Local health agencies have strengthened health
supervision, launched public education, and recommended prohibitions
on the catching, purchasing, selling and consuming goby fish.
The Guangdong Provincial Health Bureau states that this is the 1st
report of food poisoning following consumption of this species of
fish in Guangdong Province.

[Puffer fish are notorious as a source of tetrodotoxin, see ProMED
refs. below. The diagnosis has changed from suspected ciguatera
poisoning to tetrodotoxin, whose intial symptomes are similar.

[Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal
species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the
genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and
xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No
algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was
assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent
reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by
several bacterial species, including strains of the family
_Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas sp._, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_
point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are
relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with
marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some
significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to
these bacterial species.
The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and
tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating
poisonous puffer fish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia in
the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of
lightness or floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea,
and/or vomiting may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty
in walking may occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing
paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be
difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is
affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea, cyanosis, and
hypotension. Paralysis increases and convulsions, mental impairment,
and cardiac arrhythmia may occur.
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) caused by ingestion of the
dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxin produces almost identical symptoms,
as the mode of action of the toxin is the same, although the moderate
to severe hypotension in puffer fish poisonong is not usually seen in PSP.
Anticholinesterase pesticide poisoning can be mistaken for puffer
fish or PSP-induced disease but can be alleviated by use of atropine
and is accompanied by other evidence of cholinergic nervous system
stimulation such as excess salivation, tearing and bronchial
secretion, and constriction of the pupil of the eye. - Mod.LL]
