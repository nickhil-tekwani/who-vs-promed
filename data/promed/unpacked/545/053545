A meningitis outbreak sweeping through southern Sudan has killed 17
people and infected 2011, the WHO said on Mon 22 Jan 2007, adding
that it had enough vaccines to contain the outbreak.
On Sun 21 Jan 2007, the governor of south Sudan's central Warap state
said in a statement that at least 1000 people had died in a week in
an outbreak of meningitis and another unknown disease.
But Abdullahi Ahmed, head of WHO in south Sudan, said on Mon 22 Jan
2007: "As of 17 Jan 2007, the number of cases was 2011, of which only
17 died, and that includes Central Equatoria states and Warap states."
He said health officials had not confirmed any disease other than
meningitis but laboratory tests were under way.
Ahmed said medical workers had enough vaccines to cover the most
affected county in Warap state.

At least 1000 people have died in a week in south Sudan's Warap state
from meningitis and another unknown disease, state governor Anthony
Bol Madut said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sun 21 Jan 2007.
Emerging from Africa's longest civil war, south Sudan's
infrastructure is almost non-existent, and outbreaks of disease are
frequent. A cholera outbreak in 2006 killed 147 people.
"There is an outbreak of meningitis and (an) unknown disease
spreading fast throughout the state, and there is fear it may affect
other neighboring states," Madut's statement said. He said the
symptoms of the 2nd disease were similar to yellow fever, but the
patient died quickly. He appealed to medical experts to come diagnose
the disease and help stop the spread of the outbreak.
"Up to this time, the death toll is over 1000 this week alone," the
statement said. "As I am writing this press release, I am expecting
other death reports sooner or later."
Africa's "meningitis belt" stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia through
some of the world's poorest and most war-scarred places, including
Sudan. It accounts for more than half the cases of the disease
worldwide each year.
Hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese returning home after a
January 2005 peace deal with the government in Khartoum are
especially at risk because they live in crowded camps, where
infectious diseases like meningitis thrive.
Warap is one of the poorest states in the south, on the border
between north and south Sudan.
WHO officials were not immediately available to comment on the outbreak.

[3] Uganda (Karamoja, West Nile)

At least 13 people have died of meningitis after an outbreak in
Karamoja and West Nile sub regions, the health ministry has
announced. According to a statement from the ministry, by Tue 16 Jan
2007, 13 people had died, and 131 others were admitted to hospitals
around the districts of Kotido, Yumbe, Koboko and Arua. Kotido
registered the highest number of deaths, with 11 people.
State Minister for Primary Health Care Emmanuel Otaala told
journalists on Wed 17 Jan 2007 that the government was trying all
means to combat the disease.
"We have successfully identified the strain in some of the victims as
the deadly new meningitis subtype X, Y & Z, whose vaccine [is] not
available. It (subtypes X, Y & Z) is resistant to the available
drugs, but we are embarking on controlling the attack rate."
Dr. Otaala said the majority of the patients found to have serotype A
are given the available drugs. The epidemic broke out in the sub
regions in December 2006 and was 1st reported in Kotido UPDF
Barracks, where 7 people died.

[What is meant by "new meningitis subtype X, Y & Z" as well as its
resistance to drugs (vaccine or antimicrobial?) is unclear. There are
at least 13 serogroups based on antigenic differences in the capsular
polysaccharides; the ones causing most meningitis infections being A,
B, C, Y, and W-135. Vaccines are available for A, C, Y and W-135.
Others include 29E, H, I, K, L, X, & Z.
This moderator could find little information regarding serogroup Z in
outbreak form. Only individual case reports from the developed world
were located. One report from Niger (Djibo S, Nicolas P, Alonso JM,
et al: Outbreaks of serogroup X meningococcal meningitis in Niger
1995-2000. Trop Med Int Health. 2003;8: 1118-23) reflects the
similarity of cases of serogroup X to serotype A. The abstract is as follows:
In the African meningitis belt, the recurrent meningococcal
meningitis epidemics are generally caused by serogroup A. In the past
20 years, other serogroups have been detected, such as X or W135,
which have caused sporadic cases or clusters. We report here 134
meningitis cases caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup X that
occurred in Niamey between 1995 and 2000. They represented 3.91
percent of the meningococcal isolates from all CSF samples, whereas
94.4 percent were of serogroup A.
Meningococcal meningitis cases were detected using the framework of
the routine surveillance system for reportable diseases organized by
the Ministry of Public Health of Niger. The strains were isolated and
determined by the reference laboratory for meningitis in Niamey
(CERMES) and further typed at the WHO collaborating center of the
Pharo in Marseille and at the National Reference Center for the
Meningococci at the Institut Pasteur. Reference laboratories in
Marseille and Paris characterized 47 isolates having the antigenic
formula (serogroup:serotype:sero-subtype) X:NT:P1.5.
Meningitis cases due to meningococcus serogroup X did not present any
clinical or epidemiological differences to those due to serogroup A.
The seasonal incidence was classical; 93.3 percent of the cases were
recorded during the dry season. The mean age of patients was 9.2
years (+/- 6 years). The sex ratio M/F was 1.3. Case fatality rate
was 11.9 percent without any difference related to age or sex. The
increasing incidence of serogroup X was not related to the decrease
of serogroup A but seemed cyclic and evolved independently of the
recurrence of both serogroups A and C.
