Vets have discovered 2 new cases of bird flu in dead swans found in
southern Moravia, State Veterinary Authority spokesman Josef Duben said.
Tests have confirmed the H5 virus in both birds, and a highly contagious
form in one case, he added.
In all, 14 cases of bird flu have occurred in the Czech Republic. The
previous 12 dead swans were found in South Bohemia and all of them were
infected with the H5N1 strain, dangerous to humans.
Special measures will now be introduced in the critical area. The towns and
villages situated in the zones of strict protection and supervision must
make a count of all household poultry breeds and secure containers for the
dead birds.
Local breeders must not keep poultry in open-air enclosures.
A ban will be imposed on the transfer of poultry, eggs and further
material, and access to poultry farms will be limited. Steps will be taken
to secure disinfection of the people and cars in contact with the farms.
The measures are to last at least 21 days. The previous special measures
were cancelled on 10 May 2006.

[According to the recent update (19 May 2006) of EU's Animal Disease
Notification System (ADNS), 10 new HPAI cases in wild birds have been added
this week to the list of 455 wild birds reported since the beginning of
2006 until 12 May 2006 (previous weekly report). These new cases were
reported from Germany (5), Poland (one), and Italy (4, probably detected in
March). Obviously the new cases in the Czech republic are not yet included
in these statistics. See

Tests have confirmed that 86 dead chickens found in the village of
Maksimovka in the Omsk region between 29 Apr and 13 May were infected with
the H5N1 bird flu strain, the press service of the Emergency Situations
Ministry's Siberian branch told Interfax on Tuesday [16 May 2006].
"Examinations have confirmed the bird flu virus. A total of 3893 domestic
birds have already been inoculated against the disease in the village," the
press service said.
No poultry deaths have been reported over the last 24 hours, it said. The
village has been quarantined.

The avian flu virus which killed birds in the Novosibirsk and Omsk regions
in late April-early May 2006 does not significantly differ from the virus
exposed in Siberia during 2005. [Administrative map of Russia at
<http://www.eegas.com/images/11-legend.gif>].
"The H5N1 virus most likely had the same source as the spring outbreak at
Lake Qinghai in China," Alexander Shestopalov, head of the laboratory
monitoring and studying zoonotic infections, told Interfax.
"This year's virus is almost the same by its pathological characteristics
and methods of transmission. It still has a fecal-oral way of transmission,
instead of aerosolic," the expert said.
2 villages in the Novosibirsk region and 3 in the Omsk region have
registered cases of bird flu in 2006.

[The West-Siberian oblasts Novosibirsk and Omsk, bordering to their south
Mongolia and Kazachstan, were the first Russian territories to be infected
by the H5N1 virus in 2005. The outbreak began in early July in Novosibirsk,
spreading initially to Omsk and Tyumen and then further west. The outbreak
in wild birds in Qinghai, China, had taken place earlier, probably
beginning in May. Alexander Shestopalov might be right in pointing to
similarities between the chronologies of 2005 and 2006. - Mod.AS]
