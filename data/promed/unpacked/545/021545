Cryptosporidiosis infection cases continue to increase in Hawkes Bay with numbers now reaching nearly 90 this year [2013].

Medical officer of health Nicholas Jones said ongoing investigations continued to indicate there were multiple sources of infection including swimming pools, person-to-person spread within households and day care centres, and water consumption from untreated water supplies.

The infection is caused by a parasite found in the gut of cattle and other animals. The parasite cyst is passed on to humans through contact with animals, contaminated water or food, or through direct contact with human waste such as when changing nappies.

The disease usually causes diarrhoea, but children may go off their food and vomit before the diarrhoea starts. Diarrhoea is often watery and tends to be accompanied by stomach cramps. Symptoms can come and go but have usually stopped within 4 weeks. In rare cases when a person's immune system is very weak the disease can go on longer and cause complications.

Hand hygiene is the key to preventing spread in households and is particularly important for parents with sick children in nappies. Parents should keep young children away from day care for at least 48 hours after symptoms clear. Anyone who has symptoms and handles food at work should also stay off work for 48 hours after symptoms clear.

Anyone with symptoms should stay out of swimming pools for at least 2 weeks after symptoms disappear. This is because people who have had the illness can continue to excrete cysts that are resistant to chlorine. Larger public pools generally have systems for filtering out crypto cysts, but in pools without microfiltration crypto may survive for weeks.
