The death of an elephant due to anthrax in Kharsawan forest area of
adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district triggered an alarm for the forest
department officials. According to the postmortem report submitted by a
team of veterinary doctors, the elephant's death was due to anthrax. The
Seraikela divisional forest officer Paritosh Upadhayaya also confirmed the
cause of the death. "The symptoms confirmed the disease. Blood containing
poisonous liquid oozed from the animal's nose, mouth, ears, and anus.
Besides, the spleen was swollen enough to prove that the elephant was
suffering from the deadly disease," said Upadhayaya.
The animal was found dead in Narayanbera village under Kharsawan block of
adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district yesterday morning. This was the 4th
elephant death in less than a year in the Seraikela forest division. The
forest office has sent the viscera of the tusker to Patna-based animal
forensic laboratory for investigation.
Upadhayay said the disease is uncommon among the wildlife and there is no
proper mechanism to prevent the spread of the disease. "For domestic
animals like cattle, the animal husbandry department could restrict the
spread of the bacteria through vaccination. But it is not possible for the
wild animals", said Upadhayaya.
As the disease is transmissible to cattle and human beings, the forest
department has sent an SOS to the state animal husbandry department.
Upadhayay said the elephant's body did not have any external injury.
However, forest officials said villagers have been witnessing sluggish
movement among elephants for quite some time. However, some of the forest
officials confessed that due to extreme heat and unavailability of water
and food, the elephants had restricted [their] movement to a small forest
tract. Anthrax spread[s] among the animals in conditions of extreme heat, a
forest department official added.
This is the 4th reported case of elephant death within a year in Seraikela
forest division. During 2004, 3 elephants were found dead in the Chandil
range of the same forest division.

[I have titled this "suspected" until there is laboratory confirmation,
even though the account is persuasive. I have referred this report to New
Delhi for any further available details.
We have had reports of elephant anthrax in India before (see below).
However, it is generally not that common in India. In Namibia it has been
reported in elephants in the Etosha National Park for about 80 years,
initially in working elephants. Jharkhand is a new state, split out of
Bihar in NE India in 2002. It is directly north of West Bengal, where
anthrax is unfortunately very common. Those needing more information on the
areas in question should go to <http://www.seraikela.nic.in/> or
<http://www.jharkhand.nic.in/>.
Wild elephants can be vaccinated using Sterne vaccine and darts, if there
is the desire. In this instance it is clear that a field necropsy was
carried out. Burning a dead elephant is a major undertaking. I suspect it
wasn't done in this case.
If anthrax is suspected, do not open the carcass. Take a blood sample --
from the description this would not have been problem -- let the swab dry
and send it in to the laboratory for confirmation. All else that needs be
done is to keep animal and human scavengers off the carcass for 5-7 days so
that decomposition changes the pH to acid, killing all the vegetative
cells. Sporulation will then be minimal. If one can clean up and disinfect
any spilt blood it should be done. In this instance, opening the carcass
has maximised the number of spores and the subsequent environmental
contamination. This site will then present an ongoing risk to the local
livestock and wildlife. I am sure that the animal's tusks have been
salvaged -- officially or unofficially -- adding to the mess. - Mod.MHJ]
