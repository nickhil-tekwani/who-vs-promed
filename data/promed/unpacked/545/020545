A case of whooping cough has been reported at Canyon Ridge High School, the school district announced [Fri 2 Feb 2018]. The district was notified [Thu 1 Feb 2018] by South Central Public Health District. "We are working with local health officials to monitor the situation, and at this time, the school will remain open and operating normally," Twin Falls School District spokeswoman Eva Craner wrote in a statement.

Whooping cough - also known as pertussis - is also affecting other Magic Valley communities. An outbreak was reported [Mon 29 Jan 2018] at multiple Kimberly schools and it's affecting Minidioka County schools, too. Across south-central Idaho, 13 cases of whooping cough among children or adults have been reported since [Mon 1 Jan 2018]. Those are just cases confirmed by a medical provider or laboratory. Three school districts have been affected: 3 students in Kimberly, one student in Twin Falls and 2 students in Minidoka County.

It's hard to compare the number of cases with previous years because they ebb and flow, said Logan Hudson, nurse manager at South Central Public Health District. "It's difficult with pertussis because it sort of cycles." In 2014, there were 53 cases reported here in south-central Idaho. But numbers dropped to just one case in 2016 and 6 last year. "We know that (pertussis is) always in the community," Hudson said. "It's never not here. It's whether cases are identified."

Those affected can return to school after 5 days of antibiotic treatment. In Twin Falls, Canyon Ridge High will send home letters to parents with information about the reported case of whooping cough. School employees have been directed to be diligent about cleaning and sanitizing surfaces, Craner wrote in a statement, to help stop the spread of illnesses. Each of the school district's 16 campuses also has a plan to help prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The Minidoka County School District found out about its 2 confirmed cases of whooping cough - both at Minco High School in Rupert - a couple of weeks ago, Superintendent Ken Cox said. Notices in English and Spanish were sent home to parents, he said. "This is something we take seriously. As soon as it was confirmed, we made sure parents were made aware of it."

In Kimberly, students or school employees who exhibit symptoms of whooping cough will be required to go home, Kimberly School District Superintendent Luke Schroeder wrote in a Tuesday letter to staff and parents. They won't be allowed to return to school without written documentation from a health care provider. Twin Falls students who are coughing are also asked to stay home. "In addition, with flu season in full swing we are urging caution for families and advise that everyone practice healthy habits like regular hand washing," Craner wrote in the statement. It's extremely important for community members to know the difference between influenza - also known as the flu - and whooping cough, Hudson said. "Right now, we're seeing both. It's a stronger than usual influenza year, along with pertussis. We want people to go to the doctor for any kind of cough illness, but pertussis tends to last a lot longer," he said.

South Central Public Health District recommends students and teachers should watch for symptoms and update their immunizations if they're not current on the pertussis vaccine. Children are required by state law to receive immunizations before entering preschool through 12th grade schools. But parents can fill out a state exemption form if they choose not to immunize their child. They must cite a reason for their decision such as a philosophical, medical or religious objection. Under state law, immunization requirements include 4 doses of the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine for children born before 1 Sep 1999, and 5 doses for children born after 1 Sep 2005. In addition, children entering 7th grade must receive one dose of DTaP. For adults, the Centers on Disease Control and Prevention recommend one DTaP dose in their lifetime. The exception is pregnant women, who should receive one dose during every pregnancy. Oftentimes, people will get a tetanus shot after sustaining a wound or cut, Hudson said, but it may not include the pertussis protection.

Queensland's peak medical body is urging people to ensure their vaccinations are up to date after a spike in whooping cough cases in northern Queensland, including the recent diagnosis of a high school student. Parents were notified late last week [week of Sun 4 Feb 2018] after the Cairns student was suspected of suffering from whooping cough. That diagnosis has since been confirmed and is one of 37 cases in the north of the state this year [2018]. Only 10 cases had been reported by this time last year [2017].

Australian Medical Association Queensland Council of General Practice chairman Richard Kidd urged all Australians, particularly those in northern Queensland, to vaccinate against largely preventable diseases in the wake of the recent spike. "In pre-vaccination times [whooping cough] would kill at least one person in 10, and today sadly we will still see babies that will die because they haven't had the opportunity to get vaccinated," he said.

"For older children and adults who haven't been vaccinated, there's still a risk of dying from whooping cough."

Confirmed cases [annually] of whooping cough in northern Queensland, as [of] 13 Feb 2018: 2015 - 23; 2016 - 24; 2017 - 10; 2018 - 37.

http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/02/17/east-java-targets-to-vaccinate-10m-following-diphtheria-outbreak.html


The East Java Health Agency has targeted to vaccinate 10 717 765 residents aged between one and 19 years old in 2018 following a diphtheria outbreak in the province. The province has set aside Rp 89 billion (USD 6.5 million) to finance the program, dubbed the Outbreak Response Immunization.

Agency head Kohar Hari Santoso said on [Sat 17 Feb 2018] that the agency had also involved religious figures affiliated with major organizations such as the Religious Affairs Ministry, the Indonesia Ulema Council and Muslim groups in anticipation of resistance based on religious reasons, such as doubts over the halal status of the injection. "[Some people have] doubts over vaccinations. We have anticipated this by involving religious figures. [Vaccination] is important," he said.

East Java saw the highest number of diphtheria cases in 2017, which stood at 460 cases, 16 of whom died, up from 352 in 2016.

The vaccination program will be conducted in 3 phases. The 1st phase is set to be carried out between February and March [2018]. The 2nd and 3rd phases will be conducted between April and May and October and November [2018], respectively.
