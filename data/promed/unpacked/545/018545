Over the last (few) years the situation with anthrax human cases
became severe. In 2006, 17 cases were registered, 12 in Jalal-Abad
oblast and 5 in Osh oblast. The epidemiologic situation is already
severe in the current year [2007]: 12 cases had already been
registered by 10 Aug 2007, including 3 cases in Jalal-Abad oblast (2
in Suzak rayon, one in kokzhangak city) and 3 cases in Osh oblast (in
Karasuu, Karakuldzha, and Uzgen rayons), 4 cases in Chui oblast
(Sokuluk rayon), one case in Bishkek city, and one case in Balykchy
city. In Jalal-Abad and Osh oblasts anthrax cases were registered in
June-July [2007]. [On the instructions] of the Health Ministry a
complete system of anti epidemic activities, preventive vaccination
of risk group was done (workers of slaughter houses and suppliers of
animal products).
The situation with anthrax morbidity became acute in Chui oblast. In
April 2007, there was a human case of anthrax in Sokuluk rayon, "1st
May" village. The source was not identified.
[The situation worsened in August 2007]. On 6-7 Aug 2007, [a
43-year-old man and his 51-year-old wife] from Gavrilovka village,
Sokuluk rayon, were brought to the infectious hospital. Their
diagnosis was "anthrax, skin type." On 8 Aug 2007, an 18-year-old
'contact' patient living in the same village was also taken to the
infectious department of Sokuluk regional hospital with suspected
anthrax, and on 10 Aug 2007 he was moved to Republican infectious hospital.
On 10 Aug 2007 in Balykchy city, a 28-year-old man was hospitalized
in the infectious department. He had been living with his relatives
in Gavrilovka village and was involved in butchering carcasses; he
also consumed meat and internal organs from these carcasses.
During the epidemiological investigation it was found that all these
patients were involved in the slaughter and butchering of sick
animals and they had consumed contaminated cow meat. [The 43-year-old
man mentioned above] was the owner of that cow.
On 10 Aug 2007, a 66-year-old living in Bishkek, who had been in
contact with sick-cow meat, was taken to hospital with suspected
anthrax. All patients got adequate treatment. Their health status is
satisfactory. Besides, The daughter and son-in-law [of the owner of
the cow] were also taken to hospital for examination and preventive
treatment purposes.
Presently, complete anti epidemic and anti epizootic measures are
being carried out in the focus and in the settlement. It should be
noted that the domestic slaughtered cow was not reported to the
government veterinary services, and she had not been vaccinated
either. A team of specialists from Center for Quarantine & Especially
Hazardous Diseases, Republican Infectious Hospital and Veterinary
Department are working in the focus to provide practical,
consultative, and methodological assistance.
In Gavrilovka village quarantine and restrictive measures are in
hand, and animal movements into and out of the village is banned.
Surveillance of sanitary rules in the markets of the region has been
enhanced. The remains of meat and instruments have been collected and
burnt. The slaughter area, place of animal keeping, the area of
ownership, and facilities where meat was stored were treated with
disinfectants. All detected contact patients in Gavrilovka village
and Bishkek city (22 persons) got preventive treatment.
In the course of the epidemiological investigations it was found that
part of the contaminated meat from the sick cow was brought to
Bishkek and sold through a shop in "Osh Market." Presently the shop
is not functioning after disinfection. The persons who broke sanitary
and veterinary rules got penalties, and some of them will [be charged
by] the [Regional] Prosecutor.
The Osh oblast Sanitary and Epidemiological Inspectorate, Republican
Center for Quarantine & Especially Hazardous Diseases reported an
anthrax case in Uzgen rayon, Osh oblast on the 15 Aug 2007. The
patient, a 43-year-old man from Sherali village, Karool Rural
Council, Uzgen rayon, was hospitalized in the infectious department
of Uzgen regional hospital on 13 Aug 2007. His health status was very
poor with toxic shock syndrome, temperature reaching 39.4 deg C (103
deg F), mental confusion with excitement stage, short breath,
tachycardia, and signs of cyanosis. There were several ulcers on the
left forearm and hand. The primary diagnosis was "carbunculosis of
left forearm, anthrax?"
Intensive treatment was prescribed, but the patient's health status
worsened and in spite of reanimation measures he had cardiac arrest
and died. The dead body was autopsied and samples of the spleen,
intestines, and ulcers were sent to Osh Anti-Plague Department. The
body was buried following appropriate rules. Preliminary studies are
positive for anthrax. Final results are awaited.
In the course of the epidemiologic investigation it was found that on
8th August, 2007, in Zhanchukur distant pasture 4 animals had died (3
calves and a cow) with suspected anthrax.
The body of the first calf was brought to Sherali village, Karool
Rural Council on 8 Aug 2007. A total of 6 people were involved in
butchering it, including the 43-year-old, who died at the hospital.
The calf meat was distributed among the inhabitants of Sherali
village, all in all 18 families (88 people). In addition, 4 men (the
dead man's friends) roasted the meat and ate it. On 14 Aug 2007 all
of them were hospitalized.
The body of the 2nd calf was brought to the same village on the same
day [8 Aug 2007] and its meat was distributed among 21 families (94
people). On 14 Aug 2007, papules appeared on the hands of his mother
and grandchild. They were taken to hospital with suspected anthrax.
They had been involved in processing the calf's head and cutting meat.
The 3rd calf died in the distant pasture and was buried.
On the evening of the same day [8 Aug 2007,] a cow carcass was
brought from the distant pasture. The meat was delivered to a butcher
who sold it to unknown persons. Currently the contact persons are
being traced. By 15 Aug 2007, there were 188 contact persons with
possible suspect anthrax. All contact persons are receiving
antibiotic therapy. It was found that for that Zhanchukur distant
pasture 7 historic soil anthrax foci had been registered.
