Uganda: anthrax death toll up
-----------------------------
The number of people dead from anthrax in Bushenyi district has risen
from 5 to 6, after another person died yesterday [18 Feb 2009]. The
Ministry of Health spokesperson, Paul Kaggwa, said a team of health
officials from Mbarara and Kampala was in Bushenyi to carry out
public sensitisation and education.

In a separate incident, villagers of Katunguru sub-county also
discovered 2 hippos, which had died under mysterious circumstances.
The Katunguru sub-county LC3 chairperson, Swalley Kabuye, told The
New Vision that the hippos were discovered on Wednesday morning [18
Feb 2009] on Kazinga Channel, which connects lakes Edward and George.
Kabuye said they informed the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) after
discovering the 2 carcasses. "We asked UWA authorities to take away
the carcasses and check whether the hippos also died of anthrax." The
Queen Elizabeth National Park chief warden, Tom Okello Obong, could
not confirm, adding that he had only arrived the previous day.
"Sometimes the hippos fight and die as a result but we are trying to
find out whether it is a disease and we are trying to search whether
there are more carcasses in the park."

So far, 6 people in the sub-county have died out of the 9 admitted at
Rugazi Health Centre, Kaggwa said yesterday [18 Feb 2009]. The
district director of health services, Dr Celestine Barigye, said 2
people who had been admitted at the health centre, escaped from their
sickbeds for fear of being arrested by UWA officials for eating game
meat. Barigye said their whereabouts are still unknown. Kaggwa said:
"If it's true that they escaped, then they would die on their own."

Kabuye said following reports of an anthrax outbreak, they mounted an
operation with UWA authorities and discovered the remains of an
unidentified wild animal. "We have alerted people not to eat any wild
animal found dead or alive," Kabuye said. He said the district health
department recently distributed drugs to over 100 people who had
eaten the meat.

Efforts to contact the UWA executive director, Moses Mapesa, and the
director of conservation, Sam Mwandah, were futile as the 2 were
reported out of office and could not answer their mobile phones.

However, Dr Nicholas Kauta, the commissioner for livestock health and
entomology in the Ministry of Agriculture, said he toured the area on
[2 Jan 2009] and at Katunguru, he saw a waterbuck bleeding from the
mouth. On inquiry, he was told that the waterbuck had been attacked
by a lion. Kauta said Katunguru is largely a fishing community and
had a small number of goats. He said a committee comprising of
veterinary and medical personnel had been formed to establish the
risk of the disease outbreak and its threat to livestock in the area.

[We seem to be getting a clutter of reports out of Uganda and we have
yet to see a laboratory confirmation that any -- humans or wildlife
-- had been afflicted with anthrax. Whether any or all are anthrax is
still unclear. And as my good friend Sean Shamody commented to me:
"According to the 1st report, the animal was slaughtered on/around 27
Jan 2009, with 1st onset of the human cases noted on 6 Feb 2009, with
5 deaths reported between 14 Feb and 17 Feb 2009. This is beyond what
is normally recognized to be the incubation period for
gastrointestinal anthrax (1 to 6 days) and the reported duration of
fatal illness. Also, there are no reported cases of cutaneous
infection."

In my experience of the African literature the initial lethal cases
of gastrointestinal anthrax occur very soon after ingesting the meal,
sometimes within 24-36 hours. These incubation periods are
significantly longer, though still fatal, and not one reported
instance of a cutaneous lesion. Odd.
