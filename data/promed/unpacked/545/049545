A 15-year-old girl from India who was visiting for the Intel
International Science and Engineering Fair has been hospitalized with
measles, and New Mexico health officials say she was likely
infectious when she was traveling and while at the fair.
The New Mexico Health Department's lab confirmed the measles case on
Thu 17 May 2007. Officials said the girl, who traveled from India to
Atlanta and then to Albuquerque last Saturday, was admitted to a
local hospital. The Health Department said it is concerned about
possible exposure at the science fair, which is being held at the
Albuquerque Convention Center, and hotels where the girl stayed. The
department plans to hold a vaccination clinic Friday [25 May 2007]
for fair attendees.
A separate clinic will be held Friday [25 May 2007] afternoon for
other members of the public who think they may have been exposed.
"With the expertise of the New Mexico Department of Health, we are
confident that anyone who has a health concern will have that concern
addressed," said Elizabeth Marincola, president of Science Service, a
fair sponsor.
Health officials said the girl stayed at the MCM Elegante hotel from
12 May to 16 May 2007 and the Fairfield Inn on 16 and 17 May 2007.
She also went to a Wal-Mart store at Carlisle and Menaul on 14 May
2007. The Health Department also is working with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention to identify people who may have been
exposed during plane flights or at airports.

[Measles, a vaccine-preventable disease, though eradicated in the
United States and some other countries, still exists incompletely
contained in many parts of the world. Visitors, principally
un-immunized children, from countries with incomplete or no vaccine
exposure are potential carriers of infection and can reintroduce
measles into apparently immune populations. Awareness of this risk is
an important component in the maintenance of complete protection of
the community. The response of the New Mexico Department of Health
appears to be appropriate and timely. - Mod.CP]
