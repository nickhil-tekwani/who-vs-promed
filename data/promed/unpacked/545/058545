While the human race is battling with COVID-19 and its variants, the man's best friend is falling prey to the deadly virus -- canine distemper (CD). There has been a severe outbreak of CD in the city [Mangaluru, Karnataka, map at https://goo.gl/maps/JtcHNHj5qd2Bwzbb9] and it has claimed many lives, with surviving dogs suffering untold misery.

The fact that the virus is not communicable to humans has made the government ignore CD, which could be very well prevented with annual vaccination. The expensive vaccine is a bottleneck that prevents most pet owners from immunizing them.

Suma Ramesh, honorary trustee, Animal Care Trust (ACT) says, "To our shock, there has been an outbreak [since] September [2021] affecting a vast population of dogs, even older one's which we thought were resistant," indicating mutation.

She says the government should provide vaccines at subsidized costs so that dogs can be vaccinated, lest dogs will fall prey to this disease with pet owners reluctant to vaccinate them. The fallout is pet owners abandoning infected dogs on the streets to fend for themselves, rues Suma.

ACT's birth control programme has also been a casualty of this virus. "We neuter a dog, which may be in the incubation period and after we leave the dog in that area, it gets full blown CD and dies/suffers. Residents think that it is because of our operation while it is the other way round. As the virus is airborne during the outbreak, all dogs are in the danger zone barring vaccinated ones," notes Suma. Also, she points out that when the disease progresses a dog may lose recognition and try to attack people and shows symptoms of rabies, hence people beat the dog to death suspecting the dog to be rabid.

Dr Supriya Salins, a veterinarian, says the usual symptoms include, losing strength in the limbs, twitching, or paralysis of the mouth area. The initial indicative symptoms are watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes, fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, and reduced appetite and vomiting. Once the dog is infected there's nothing much that can be done, barring symptomatic treatment and hoping for the best, she says.

[[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for the submission above].

A case of canine distemper in a dog can be seen as rabies to a common person. People, particularly in a rabies-stricken environment, when bitten by a dog with distemper, may try to get post exposure rabies treatment for themselves; this could lead to confusion. On the other hand, sadly, some rabies infected dogs may go overlooked because of a situation as described from Mangaluru in the report above.

For additional information on canine distemper in dogs, a disease known to occur worldwide, and against which puppy vaccination is essential, please refer to the commentary in 20210711.8511292. - Mods.TG/AS]
