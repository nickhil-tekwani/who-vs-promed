Federal wildlife officials have found, for the 1st time, a deadly fungal infection in gray bats. 2 instances were documented in Tennessee.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday (29 May 2012) that gray bats in Montgomery and Hawkins counties were found infected with white nose syndrome. The infection has decimated bat colonies in 19 states and 4 Canadian provinces. It was first discovered in New York state in 2006.

Gray bats have a limited geographic range in limestone karst areas of the southeastern United States. They are particularly vulnerable to the fungus because they live in large colonies in relatively few caves.

Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe said the discovery is devastating.

The infected bats were discovered during winter surveillance of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency and the Nature Conservancy.

For endangered species such as the gray bat this kind of discovery is very bad news. The numbers of this bat are already quite low, lets hope they are able to overcome this fungus. - Mod.TG
