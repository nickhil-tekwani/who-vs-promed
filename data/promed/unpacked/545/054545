At least 18 people died in 10 days after eating pesticide-contaminated food in 2 localities in Burkina Faso. A dozen still remain under observation in hospitals, according to the Minister of Health.

The 1st cases were reported on [1 Sep 2019] in the town of Didyr in the center-west of the country, said Professor Claudine Lougue, Minister of Health.

About 15 members of the same families felt unwell after eating local dishes made from bean leaves and small millet seeds, which are actually seed remains. Thirteen died later despite medical care.

On Monday [2 Sep 2019], the ministry received another alert, this time from the central-eastern region. Here again, 14 people from the same family were admitted to the health centers. Five have lost their lives. After analysis, doctors diagnosed massive food poisoning, said the minister. Complementary examinations incriminate pesticides, she said.

"Investigations have been made on samples of biological products such as blood and urine, and we found an unusually high level of pesticides in foods that were consumed. There was an abnormally high level of pesticides, and these pesticides were strongly incriminated," said the minister.

The remains of food have been secured, announced Professor Lougue, who calls on citizens to observe strict hygiene measures in the use of plant leaves for consumption. Pesticides are used for the needs of field work, especially in the countryside during this period of wintering.

At least 18 died from food poisoning in 2 different parts of the country. About 15 other people are still under observation in health centers. According to the initial tests, these deaths are due to the consumption of food contaminated by pesticides.

A total of 13 people died on [1 Sep 2019] in the town of Didyr in the central-western region. On [9 Sep 2019], 5 deaths were reported from 15 or so people in Nayamtenga in Kouritenga province.

According to Professor Leonie Claudine Lougue, Minister of Health, the initial tests reveal that all these deaths are linked to food poisoning due to pesticides.

"In Didyr," she explained, "investigations were made on samples of biological products such as blood and urine. An unusually high level of pesticides has been found. In the foods consumed as well, there was an abnormally high level of pesticides. There are several families of pesticides."

The offending pesticides are used in agriculture, and they were used to protect the millet against caterpillars. The Minister of Health recommends that families refer now to the Ministry of Agriculture for the use of pesticides. She said, "It is necessary [to] scrupulously follow the recommendations of the Ministry of Agriculture in the choice and use of pesticides."

All those affected by these intoxications were evacuated to the medical center with a surgical branch (CMA) in Pouytenga and the University Hospital Yalgado Ouedraogo in Ouagadougou, for better care, according to the Minister of Health.

[This outbreak of foodborne illnesses apparently caused by toxic pesticide ingestion was 1st covered by ProMED on ProMED-FRA, with comments by our Mali-based editor Boubacar Maiga, translated as follows. - Mod.LXL

PRO/FR> Maladie d'origine alimentaire, mortelle - Burkina Faso: (Region du Centre Ouest) 20190906.6659539
Eleven deaths following the consumption of a pesticide-contaminated food is a real tragedy. Pesticides used in agriculture to kill weeds or caterpillars pose a problem for controlling these pesticides and their use in agriculture. These pesticides have advantages, but also have many disadvantages for humans, domestic and wild animals, and the environment. How was the food contaminated with the pesticide? In all cases, an investigation must be opened to locate those responsible and to know if the contamination of the food was accidental or intentional. - Mod.BM

Food poisoning is commonplace in our [West African] countries. Most often, these intoxications cause annoying signs and symptoms without causing death. But these intoxications currently in Burkina Faso appear exceptional because several members of the same family were killed there. These cases were apparently due to pesticides. Pesticides are increasingly used in agriculture and gardening. Sometimes the handling of these products is done by non-expert hands and by people who do not follow the instructions for the use of these substances. In addition, these substances end up in places where they should not be. This explains these domestic accidents. The health authorities, in collaboration with the public health and agronomic services, must ensure that these products do not end up in non-expert hands, and raise awareness about the danger of these substances. In addition, the sale, storage and use of these pesticides should be regulated. - Mod.BM

The article does not tell us the clinical signs associated with the affected individuals. Nor does it tell us if the agent was food borne. If the food were homegrown, it should have been washed before eating. However, failure to do so would mean people may have ingested some of the chemicals present on the food.

According to a relatively recent review, the pesticides most used in Burkina Faso are the organochlorines (endosulfan), followed by organophosphates, carbamates, pyridines, and pyrethroids (Ouedraogo M, Toe AM, Ouedraogo TZ, Guissou PI. Pesticides in Burkina Faso: overview of the situation in a Sahelian African country, pesticides in the modern world -- pesticides use and management. Stoytcheva M, editor. 2011; ISBN 978-953-307-459-7. PDF download available at http://cdn.intechweb.org/pdfs/21979.pdf).

There are 4 major chemical classes of organochlorine compounds:
- DDT
- Cyclodienes (e.g., aldrin, dieldrin and endrin, and chlordecone)
- Lindane and related chlorocyclohexane agents
- Toxaphene and related compounds

Most organochlorines have a "negative temperature coefficient," meaning they are more toxic at lower temperatures. This property renders organochlorine agents more toxic to cold-blooded creatures such as insects than to mammals and other more complex lifeforms. The general mechanism of pesticidal actions of these agents is neurotoxicity that renders insects and other pests unable to move or breathe. Most organochlorines are formulated with petroleum products as solvents or carrier substances.

Organochlorines tend to be well-absorbed orally, and all undergo extensive hepatic metabolism once absorbed. Skin absorption is variable: Lindane and cyclodienes demonstrate excellent dermal penetrability, whereas DDT and toxaphene are poorly absorbed through skin.

After an oral exposure, the organochlorines are internalized rapidly and quickly enter the central nervous system (CNS); subsequently, they redistribute into the blood and adipose tissues, where they can remain for a prolonged duration. Thus, these agents typically demonstrate rapid neurologic symptoms and recovery, but a prolonged total body persistence.

The organochlorines most commonly stimulate the CNS, and symptoms can range from paresthesias to seizures. With large exposures and severe toxicity, status epilepticus with respiratory failure and death can ensue. In addition, nonspecific neurologic symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, and dizziness can also be seen. Myoclonus, increased deep tendon reflexes and tremors are also reported following toxic exposures.

Some of these agents can cause sudden seizures, without any prodromal symptoms. These include lindane, cyclodienes and toxaphene. These sudden seizures can happen from 1 to 6 hours post-exposure, and the effects can last for days in severe cases (https://calpoison.org/news/lindane-organochlorine-poisoning).

As a reminder, chlorinated hydrocarbons include dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), methoxychlor, lindane, dieldrin, aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, Perthane, toxaphene, heptachlor, Mirex, and endosulfan (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/toxaphene).

Chlorinated hydrocarbons exert their toxic effects by an unknown mechanism and can be absorbed through the skin and the gastrointestinal tract. The toxic dose of each compound varies.

Clinical signs are similar to those observed in organophosphate toxicity: CNS excitation, seizures, SLUD (salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation), excessive bronchial secretions, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle tremors, and respiratory paralysis. Secondary toxicity from toxic metabolites can cause renal and hepatic failure. Chronic exposure may cause anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, tremors, seizures, and hepatic failure. The clinical course can be prolonged in small animal patients.

Treatment of chlorinated hydrocarbon toxicity is largely supportive in nature, as there is no known antidote. Procure and maintain the patient's airway. Normalize the body temperature to prevent hyperthermia. If the substance was just ingested and the patient is not demonstrating any clinical signs, induce emesis. If the patient is symptomatic, perform orogastric lavage followed by activated charcoal administration. Bathe the patient thoroughly in cases of topical exposure. Administer intravenous crystalloid fluids to maintain hydration. These compounds do not appear to be amenable to fluid diuresis (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/toxaphene).

Without a more detailed description of the clinical signs in the victims, it is very difficult to determine which substance they may have been exposed to. - Mod.TG
