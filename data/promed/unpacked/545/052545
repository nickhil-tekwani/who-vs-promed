The Health Department of Queretaro acknowledged that a hepatitis
outbreak in the state is spreading. There have been more than 290
cases, and approximately 26 000 persons are at risk according to the
State Secretary of Health.

The head of the agency, Rafael Asencio Asencio, stated that although
only 14 outbreaks of hepatitis A have occurred, there are more than
290 cases [reported] in the state, which is forcing the health
authorities to implement greater measures.

"We have to study a population of approximately 26 000 persons who
might be at risk in these outbreaks; this is the extent of the
problem we are facing in order to prevent the spread of hepatitis A
[virus infection].

Asencio Asencio noted that the disease trend is low, since so far
this year [2008], there have been 14 outbreaks reported, while in
2007 there were 29 cases [outbreaks?], which means that the disease
has decreased by 60 percent. [Presumably, here there is a discussion
on the number of individual outbreaks and not the number of actual
cases for 2007. It would be interesting to know the actual number of
cases of hepatitis A reported in 2007. - Mod.MPP]

The most recent outbreaks were in Tequisquiapan as a consequence of
heavy rain, resulting in unhygienic environmental conditions, which
have promoted the spread of the [virus], with a resultant 80 reported
cases of hepatitis so far, in a population of 24 000 people.

The health official mentioned that the Health Ministry contacted the
municipal authorities in order to inform them that 200 houses exist
in the municipality that do not have access to drainage, or possibly
septic tanks or latrines, a situation that leads to poor health
conditions as a result of an environment that is conducive for
development of the bacteria. [The newswire uses the word "bacteria"
in referring to the causative organism of hepatitis A when in fact it
is caused by a virus. In this case though, it is not inappropriate to
use the word bacteria, as long as viruses and other microorganisms
are also mentioned, as the lack of adequate waste removal facilities
in a neighborhood is associated with increased transmission of many
different diseases caused by a wide variety of different species of
microorganisms. - Mod.MPP]

Finally, he said that in order to combat this [virus], it is
necessary to keep the water clean and not exposed to people who are
sick, and also said that medical resources are adequate. [Presumably,
this means that the health sector is not responsible for the actual
provision of clean water, but another ministry. - Mod.MPP]

[Hepatitis A is a self-limited disease which results in fulminant
hepatitis and death in a small proportion of patients. However, it is
a significant cause of morbidity and socio-economic losses in many
parts of the world. Transmission of hepatitis A virus is typically by
the fecal-oral route. Infections occur early in life in areas where
sanitation is poor and living conditions are crowded.

Almost all hepatitis A virus infections are spread by the fecal-oral
route. Good personal hygiene, high quality standards for public water
supplies and proper disposal of sanitary waste have resulted in a low
prevalence of hepatitis A virus infections in most well-developed societies.

The rather confused statement from the Queretaro Health Department
omits mention of control of infection by vaccination. Until resources
become available to improve the water supply, sanitation and social
infrastructure, targeted vaccination would be an appropriate approach
in controlling this epidemic of hepatitis A in Queretaro, since the
outbreaks appear to be localized and spreading only slowly. Further
information as the situation develops would be welcomed.
