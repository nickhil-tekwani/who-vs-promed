Multistate Psittacosis Outbreak among Poultry Plant Workers, 2018
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Virginia and Georgia departments of health are investigating a multistate outbreak of psittacosis occurring at 2 poultry slaughter plants owned by a single corporation. CDC and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are assisting with the investigation.

Recommendations
---------------
- Contact a healthcare professional if you have fever, cough, headache, or muscle aches after working at a poultry slaughter plant involved in the outbreak. Tell your healthcare professional that you may have been exposed to psittacosis. Healthcare professionals can treat psittacosis with antibiotics.
- Plant management should implement steps to minimize exposures to bird droppings and respiratory secretions to protect their workers.
- Learn how people who work in poultry slaughter plants can prevent psittacosis.

Latest Outbreak Information
---------------------------
- During August-September 2018, psittacosis cases were reported among workers at 2 poultry slaughter plants in Virginia and Georgia. A single corporation owns both plants.
- _Chlamydia (Chlamydophilia) psittaci_, the type of bacterium that causes psittacosis, was detected by a laboratory test in 10 people. Additional illnesses in workers at the 2 plants have been identified, although have not been confirmed by the laboratory.
- No deaths have been reported.
- Virginia and Georgia departments of health are conducting an investigation, and the number of cases is likely to change.
- Current evidence indicates that all of the people who have psittacosis work at poultry slaughter plants in 2 states: Virginia and Georgia. Investigators are still working to understand why the outbreak occurred.
- The affected plants in Virginia and Georgia voluntarily suspended operations for cleaning. On [8 Sep 2018], the affected plant in Virginia suspended operations. The plant reopened on [18 Sep 2018]. On [15 Sep 2018], the affected plant in Georgia suspended operations. The plant reopened on [19 Sep 2018].
- Plant management held town hall meetings in both plants to inform their workers about the outbreak.
- CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

How You Can and Cannot Get Psittacosis
--------------------------------------
The latest data suggest that this outbreak is only affecting people who work at the identified poultry slaughter plants. Public health officials are investigating whether other people exposed to chickens (e.g., farmers, truck drivers) that were shipped to the affected plants got sick. At this time, investigators do not believe people working outside of this industry or consumers are at risk.

The most common way someone gets infected with the bacteria that cause psittacosis is by breathing in dust containing dried secretions (e.g., droppings, respiratory) from infected birds. There is no evidence that these bacteria can spread by preparing or eating chicken meat.

It is rare for psittacosis to spread from person to person. In this outbreak, infection among family members who are not workers at the affected plants has not been reported.

Symptoms of Psittacosis in People
---------------------------------
In general, psittacosis causes mild illness in people. The most common symptoms include:
- Fever and chills
- Headache
- Muscle aches
- Dry cough

Psittacosis can also cause pneumonia (a lung infection) that may require treatment or care in a hospital. Rarely, psittacosis can result in death. Most people begin developing signs and symptoms of psittacosis within 5 to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria. Occasionally, people report the start of symptoms after more than 14 days.

[Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
