Rift Valley fever in alpacas in South Africa
--------------------------------------------
Regarding your RFI in ProMED Digest V2011 #47 "Rift Valley fever in
South Africa" [archive no. 20110129.0350]:

I am a diagnostic veterinary pathologist and was involved in the
diagnosis of the initial RVF outbreak in Alpacas in the Western Cape
last year and on a different property this year.

None of the affected alpaca herds had been vaccinated against RVF.

In the 2010 outbreak, it was mostly yearling animals that were
affected(I have presented the macroscopic and histopathology findings
at the American College of Veterinary Pathologists' - ACVP meeting in
Baltimore, in October/November 2010). [See abstract below].

Preliminary investigations of the most recent outbreak (2011) seem to
be affecting more mature male animals. To my knowledge, RVF has not
been reported in alpacas before and there is also no registered
vaccine for use in camelids.

[ProMED-mail post 20110129.0350 included the following comment: "It
would be interesting to obtain more information on the disease in
alpacas: age, clinical observations. Are alpacas included in the
applied vaccination regime?"

Dr Gers is gratefully acknowledged for responding with the above
firsthand information. The abstract follows:

Abstract 165 2010 47: 3S Vet Pathol.

"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute to peracute zoonotic disease of
domestic ruminants occurring predominantly in Africa. It is caused by
a single serotype of a vector-borne RNA virus (Bunyavirus) of the
genus Phlebovirus. Floodwater-breeding mosquitoes of Aedes species
play a major role in outbreak initiation following periods of above
average rainfall, while Culex and Anopheles species, and less
importantly biting flies, are considered epidemic vectors. In South
Africa (SA), RVF occurs at irregular intervals; the first known
outbreak reported in the 1950s, a major outbreak in 1974-76 and small,
localized outbreaks in 1981 and 1999. In 2008, RVF reoccurred, with
isolated outbreaks reported in 2009 followed by an extensive epidemic
in 2010 affecting most parts of SA.

In April 2010, RVF was diagnosed in 4 sub-adult alpacas that died on
a farm in the Western Cape Province of SA. The disease had an abrupt
onset and short course lasting from 4 to 6 hours. Affected animals
were anorexic, depressed, pyrexic, showed signs of abdominal
discomfort, developed respiratory distress and despite supportive
therapy, died. At necropsy, widespread petechiae and ecchymoses were
observed in the buccal mucosa, subcutis, serosal surfaces, endo- and
epicardium, liver, thymus, lungs, and lymph nodes. Small intestinal
intraluminal hemorrhage was present in 2 animals. Histologically the
liver showed multifocal to coalescent, extensive areas of coagulative
to lytic necrosis. Characteristic intranuclear inclusions were present
in two animals. Both immunohistochemical staining and rtPCR confirmed
RVF.

Various epidemiological aspects of the outbreak were investigated,
including vector trapping and identification. Interestingly, although
this is a multi-age alpaca enterprise, only the yearling group was
affected. To the authors' knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of
RVF virus infection in alpacas".

During the 2010 major epizootic, which reportedly started on 19 Jan
2010 and resolved on 18 Sep 2010, a total of 489 outbreaks were
reported to the OIE; a summary of the epizootic,including a map, is
available at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8967>.


The initial report on RVF cases in 'camelidae' was included in
follow-up report No 6, submitted 21 Apr 2010, addressing 2 cases (and
deaths) in Bains Game Lodge, Mangaung, Free State, on 12 Apr 2010.

The affected population was described as follows: "A few llamas were
kept in a camp, together with springboks, blesboks and giraffes. Signs
of disease were only observed in the llamas". Later (follow-up report
no 8, submitted 7 May 2010; see archived 20100512.1548) the disease
was reported to have affected, on 18 Apr 2010, 3 alpacas (out of 223)
which died in Landskroon, Drakenstein, Western Cape Province.

The (78) sheep on the same holding remained, reportedly, unaffected.

Interestingly, according to available literature, RVF has been
regarded hitherto to be clinically inapparent in camels (dromedaries),
though abortions may occur. See 2004 review at
