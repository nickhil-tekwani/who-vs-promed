[Please note that there may be discrepancies between the various sources of
information due to different times of "closure" of daily figures reported.
Times of daily report closures where known are listed in the table of
contents below. Newswires may mention a confirmed case in a location that
has not been on the official reporting entity list as the confirmation
arrived after closure of the day's report. As the number of reports has
been increasing, we are changing the format of the tables to give the
cumulative cases reported by the weeks ending on Fridays (1 May 2009, 8 May
2009, 15 May 2009) and then daily for the current week of reporting. The
daily summaries for prior dates can be found in all "case count" postings
ending with Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (40): case counts 20090521.1906.
