200 stalls closed temporarily following typhoid cases
-----------------------------------------------------
About 200 stalls in Jelawat were ordered to be closed for a day on Wed 4
May 2005 and their operators instructed to clean their premises in a
gotong-royong to prevent the spread of typhoid in the district, which has
already recorded 53 cases. [In Malaysia, "gotong-royong" is the concept of
doing things together and helping each other in the spirit of "muhibbah,"
or goodwill. - Mod.LL]
The directive came from the health authorities following complaints that
many people had been infected by the fever after eating cakes from the
stalls. The District Health Officer, Dr Hanuzah Mohd Sultan, said they were
still investigating. He said 12 operators were ordered to close their
stalls for 2 weeks for breaching the rules on hygiene, and 100 operators
were given anti-typhoid injections.
About 300 people, including the state assemblyman for Jelawat, Datuk Dr
Ilias Hussin, and the president of the Bachok District Council, Mohd Faudzi
Che Mamat, participated in the gotong-royong.

Typhoid fever cases in Kelantan have dropped sharply since last week [final

The State Health Department said that, as of 7 May 2005, in Kota Baru, a
total of 105 cases were in hospitals. 27 were confirmed to have the
disease, and 78 were suspects.
Meanwhile, hospitals in other districts registered 91 cases, with 55
confirmed cases. Deputy health minister Datuk Dr Abdul Latiff Ahmad said
that, during the height of the outbreak, there was an average of 100 cases
per week. "But now, there are only 30 cases per week, and the number is
decreasing," he said.
