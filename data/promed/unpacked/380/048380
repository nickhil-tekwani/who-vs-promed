Accepted for publication 8 Dec 1999.
In much of the world, resistance to stem rust in wheat, caused by _Puccinia
graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_, is based at least in part on the gene Sr31.
During February 1999, high levels of stem rust infection were observed on
entries in wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) grown in a nursery at Kalengyere
Research Station in Uganda. Because several of the rusted entries were
known to carry the 1BL-1RS chromosome translocation containing the Sr31,
Lr26, and Yr9 genes for rust resistance, virulence to Sr31 was suspected.
Bulked urediniospores, collected from rusted stems of seven entries
containing Sr31, were suspended in light mineral oil and sprayed on primary
leaves of 7-day-old seedlings of South African wheat cv. Gamtoos (=Veery
#3, pedigree: Kvz/Buho¢S¢//Kal/BB). Plants were incubated overnight in a
dew chamber (19 to 21 C) before placement in a greenhouse at 18 to 25 C.
After >14 days, urediniospores were collected from large, susceptible-type
stem rust pustules and subsequently increased on Gamtoos, which served as a
selective host for the new rust culture, designated Pgt-Ug99.
Pathogenicity of Pgt-Ug99 was studied in seedling tests of available wheats
containing Sr31, as well as other stem rust differential lines. All
seedling tests were conducted at least three times in independent
inoculations.
Isolate Pgt-Ug99 was not virulent to Avocet¢S¢/Yr9 (Australian line
containing Sr26) or Oom Charl (South African cultivar) but was virulent to
the other Sr31 testers: Alondra ¢S¢, Bobwhite, Chokka, Clement,
Federation/Kavkaz, Gamtoos, Grebe, Kavkaz, Letaba, Line E/Kavkaz, RL6078,
and Veery ¢S¢. Virulence to Sr31 (infection types [ITs 3 - 3 to 3 ++4) was
clearly contrasted by the low reactions (ITs 0; to 1) produced by UVPgt53,
a South African pathotype avirulent to Sr31. According to the reactions of
the differential lines, Pgt-Ug99 is avirulent to Sr21, -22, -24, -25, -26,
27, -29, -32, -33, -34, -35, -36, -39, -40, -42, and -43, Agi, and Em and
virulent to Sr5, -6, -7b, -8a, -8b, -9b, -9e, -9g, -11, -15, -17, -30, -31,
and -38. Virulence to the _T. ventricosum_-derived gene Sr38, which is
linked to Lr37 and Yr17 and occurs in cultivars from Australia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States, was not known previously (1). Both Pgt-Ug99
and UVPgt53 produced a continuum of ITs (; to 2+3) on Petkus rye (obtained
from the USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection, Aberdeen, ID), the
original Sr31 donor source. Pgt-Ug99 did not appear more virulent than
UVPgt53 on Petkus. All triticales tested, as well as oat cv. Overberg, were
highly resistant to Pgt-Ug99. According to McIntosh et al. (1),
Huerta-Espino mentioned a Sr31-virulent culture from Turkey, but this could
not be confirmed.
Should the Sr31-virulent pathotype migrate out of Uganda, it poses a major
threat to wheat production in countries where the leading cultivars have
resistance based on this gene.

[According to researchers at the Cereal Disease Laboratory (CDL), this is
the first report of infection by wheat stem rust on wheat lines containing
the Sr31 gene for resistance. In tests performed at CDL during the winter
of 1999-2000, results were in agreement with those of Pretorius et. al.
(Plant Disease 84:203). Moreover, resistance to the virulent Sr31
pathotype was found in cv Waldron (CI 13958), Triumph 64 (CI 13679), and
Kota (CI 5878). With the limited use of Sr31 in the USA, CDL scientists
believe that the Ugandan isolate does not appear to provide a threat to
U.S. wheat production.
