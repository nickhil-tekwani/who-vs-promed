A white-tailed deer in Ponca recently tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), according to the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC). The disease is fatal to deer and elk.

The positive CWD test from a deer comes on the heels of an elk near Pruitt, about 12 miles [19.3 km] east of Ponca, that was confirmed to have the disease [23 Feb 2016]. Both areas are in northern Newton County.

The AGFC took tissue samples from the 2.5-year-old female deer, which was found dead. The US Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the test today [9 Mar 2016].

The 2.5-year-old female elk was killed by a hunter on 6 Oct 2015 on the Buffalo National River near Pruitt during elk hunting season. It was the 1st animal in Arkansas confirmed to have CWD. The disease was confirmed on 23 Feb 2016. The elk was tested by the same labs that confirmed CWD in the deer from Ponca.

To determine the prevalence and distribution of the disease among deer, the AGFC will begin taking samples [Mon 7 Mar 2016] within a capsule-shaped area ranging from 5 miles [8 km] west of Ponca to 5 miles [8 km] east of Pruitt, and 5 miles [8 km] across.

"We need to sample 300 deer to determine the prevalence and the spatial distribution of CWD in the population with 95 percent confidence," said Dick Baxter, an assistant chief in the Wildlife Management Division.

Enough free-ranging deer have to be tested before there's a strong statistical chance of detecting CWD in 1 percent of the herd. This is a common method to estimate CWD prevalence in deer populations. As results are analyzed, wildlife biologists will adjust the strategy.

"The test area will expand as positive (CWD) tests warrant," said Cory Gray, AGFC deer program coordinator.

Wildlife biologists will not use the same tactics with the elk herd.

"We're not going to determine the prevalence of CWD in elk at this point, because it would require a large sample of the relatively small elk herd to be valid statistically," Baxter said. "We want to target sick elk throughout the elk range to find the spatial distribution."

The elk strategy changed when the deer at Ponca tested positive.

"When we thought CWD was confined to the area where the elk was killed at Pruitt, we believed we could take the elk herd that was in close contact, maybe 30-40 animals," Gray said.

The sampled deer and elk will be processed at a base camp staffed by AGFC and National Park Service personnel. Meat from deer that don't test positive for CWD will be given to landowners where the deer were harvested or Arkansas Hunters Feeding the Hungry. Since only unhealthy elk will be harvested, meat from those animals will not be consumed. Everything that is not packaged for consumption will be incinerated.

"Landowners have been very helpful in allowing us access to their property," Gray said. "Much of the land within the zone where we'll be working is privately owned. We need their help and help from anyone who sees a deer or elk that appears to be ill."

The public can report sick deer and elk by calling 800-482-9262, 24 hours a day.

Although there are no confirmed cases of CWD transmission from cervids to humans or to livestock, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and the Arkansas Department of Health recommend that people not consume meat from animals known to be infected with CWD.

CWD was first documented among captive mule deer in Colorado in 1967, and has been detected in 24 states and 2 Canadian provinces. It's been found in the wild in 20 states and among captive cervids in 15 states. Biologists don't know how the disease reached northern Arkansas at this point. The Arkansas elk herd began with 112 animals from Colorado and Nebraska, relocated during 1981-85.

The AGFC has taken several steps to prevent the disease from entering the state. The Commission established a moratorium on the importation of live cervids in 2002, and restricted the importation of cervid carcasses in 2005. It also set moratoriums on permits for commercial hunting resorts and breeder/dealer permits for cervid facilities in 2006, and on obtaining hand-captured white-tailed deer in 2012.

According to the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance (http://cwd-info.org), CWD affects only cervids (members of the _Cervidae_ family such as deer, elk, and moose). Research shows that prions (abnormal cellular proteins) are transmitted through feces, urine, and saliva. The shortest period between infection and symptoms of the disease is 16 months, although the infectious agent can survive for years in organic matter such as soil and plants.

CWD is a neurological disease that's part of a group of diseases called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Once in a host's body, prions transform normal cellular protein into abnormal shapes that accumulate until the cell ceases to function. As the brains of infected animals degenerate, they lose weight, lose their appetite and develop an insatiable thirst. They tend to stay away from herds, walk in patterns, carry their head low, salivate, and grind their teeth.

Two meetings have been scheduled in Ponca and Huntsville to discuss the most recent finding of CWD. The 1st meeting will be held in Ponca on [Thu 10 Mar 2016]. The meeting will begin at 6 pm at the Ponca Fire Department on Arkansas Highway 43. The 2nd meeting will be held on [Fri 11 Mar 2016] at Carroll Electric, 5056 Highway 412B in Huntsville. This meeting will begin at 6 pm

[If the disease is found in one species of cervid, it is likely it will be found in other cervid species. So in this particular area, deer and elk have both been documented with the disease.

It would seem that a surveillance plan for testing for next hunting season should be developed. - Mod.TG]
