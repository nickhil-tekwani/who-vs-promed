Britain's opposition Conservative Party has called for a Europe-wide ban on
French beef after reports mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, BSE) is rising in France. France has recorded 14 cases of
BSE this year, compared to a total of 30 in 1999. France is to start
conducting tests for BSE in May on 48 000 cows and has taken several other
steps to halt transmission of the illness.

France's Agriculture Ministry reported 2 new cases of mad cow disease
(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE) in western France. The cows were
the 15th and 16th cases in France this year. The animals were from the
Cotes d'Armor region. The 2 cows and their herds, comprising 112 cows were
slaughtered.
Thirty-one cases of BSE were discovered in France in 1999, up from 18 in 1998.

BSE "spread through cowpats"
-----------------------------
Experts believe cattle continued to catch BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, mad cow disease) after August 1996. The BSE epidemic may
last longer than expected because cattle were at a "real risk" of catching
the disease from the cowpats of infected cattle, according to leading
scientists. BSE experts believe cattle continued to catch the disease
through contaminated soil long after the date the government believed was
possible.
The government has insisted that the last cattle were infected in August
1996, either through contaminated feed or, in a small number of cases, from
mother to calf.
Microbiologist Dr Stephen Dealler told the program he feared the findings
could lead to France and Germany extending their bans on the import of
British beef. He added that the future spread of BSE could be "drastically
reduced" if cattle and sheep were injected with the drug pentosan polysulphate.
The compound, used in the United States to treat cystitis, has been shown
to drastically reduce BSE infectivity in laboratory mice, Dr Dealler said.
