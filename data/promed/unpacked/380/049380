[This is the 10th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases with local transmission reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. 31 new cases were confirmed, 29 were imported, and 2 local (1 in Liaoning and 1 in Guangdong).

According to the report above, a total of 81 620 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3322 deaths, representing an increase of 31 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (1 Apr 2020) report was prepared. There were an additional 12 suspected cases reported, all imported. In addition, 4 deaths were reported, all from Wuhan. 37 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

A total of 29 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 870. There are an additional 135 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the report above, there were 60 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 7 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1027, 221 of whom are importations from abroad. 7 originally asymptomatic cases have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours (all imported cases).

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 86 cases and 5 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (1 Apr 2020-2 Apr 2020) when there were 89 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 062 confirmed cases, including 174 deaths were reported today, up from 9976 cases and 169 deaths yesterday [1 Apr 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 12 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 66.9% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.0% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 10.5% of the total newly confirmed cases while Gyeonggi represented 26.7% of the newly confirmed cases, and Seoul represented 20.9%. Quarantined imported cases represented 25.6% of the newly confirmed cases.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 242 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 115 242 cases, including 13 915 deaths, up from 110 574 cases and 13 155 deaths reported on 1 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 1 and 2 Apr 2020 was 4668 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4782 newly confirmed cases between 31 Mar 2020 and 1 Apr 2020, stable from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (46 065), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (15 333), and Veneto (10 111), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 52.0% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 10 353 cases and represents 12.5% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 24 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 22 days since the countrywide lockdown. There does appear to be a positive trend of decreasing daily newly reported cases, still with small hiccups occasionally.

[4] Iran: 50 468 total cases, 3160 deaths
Date: Fri 2 Apr 2020 09:48 IRDT
Source: Arab News, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.arabnews.com/node/1651701/middle-east


Iran on Thursday [2 Apr 2020] reported 124 new deaths from the coronavirus, raising its total to 3160, as President Rouhani warned that the country may still battle the pandemic for another year. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour announced the latest toll in a news conference and confirmed 3111 new infections over the past 24 hours, bringing Iran's total to 50 468.

He said 16 711 of those hospitalised had so far recovered.

Iran has been scrambling to contain the COVID-19 outbreak since it reported its 1st cases on [19 Feb 2020]. After weeks of refraining from imposing a lockdown or quarantine measures, Tehran decided last week to ban all intercity travel until at least [8 Apr 2020]. There is no official lockdown within Iran's cities, although the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home to contain the spread of the virus.

Rouhani warned at a cabinet meeting Thursday [2 Apr 2020] that there was no quick fix: "Coronavirus is not something for which we can point to a certain date and say it will be completely eradicated by then," he said. Rouhani said the virus "may be with us in upcoming months, or until the end" of the current Iranian year, in March 2021.

The country, one of the world's worst hit by the pandemic which originated in China, must remain vigilant and more limitations may be implemented, he said. Iran has closed schools and universities until early April [2020] and also 4 key Shiite pilgrimage sites, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom. It has discouraged travel, cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers, and temporarily closed parliament.

[In the 24 hours from 1 Apr 2020 to 2 Apr 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 47 593 to 50 468, an increase of [2875 vs the stated 3111] newly confirmed cases. [There is a discrepancy; using the total newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, yesterday's total should have been 47 357 cases. A challenge of using media reports.) The number of deaths has also increased from 3036 to 3160, an increase of 124 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 7th globally -- behind the USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, China, and France.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 245 066, including 6075 deaths, an increase from 215 081 cases and 5110 deaths. New York state, with 93 053 (38.0%) cumulative case reports and 9152 (30.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (3335 newly confirmed cases 11.1%), Louisiana (2726 newly confirmed cases 9.1%), Michigan (1457 newly confirmed cases 4.9%), Pennsylvania (1262 newly confirmed cases 4.2%), and Florida (1235 newly confirmed cases 4.1%); very close behind, Massachusetts, and California.

A closer look at New York State, the epicenter as of 4 pm on 2 Apr 2020, the total number of cases were 92 381, with NYC (New York City) reporting 51 809 (56.1% of the total cases), Westchester county 11 567 (12.5%), Nassau County 10 587 (11.5%) and Suffolk County 8746 (9.5%). The counties mentioned are surrounding counties for New York City (see http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/genealogy/counties.htm, note that NYC is composed of 5 counties: Kings, Queens, Bronx, Richmond, and New York). Data on county case totals from https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/county-county-breakdown-positive-cases).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 25.2% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain has been rapidly accelerating. As of today (1 Apr 2020), totals of 110 238 cases and 10 003 deaths have been reported, up from 102 136 cases and 9053 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 198.0. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 110 238 cases, 54 113 (49.1%) were hospitalized and 6092 (5.5%) were admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate was 9.1%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
