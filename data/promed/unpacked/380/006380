An epidemic of measles is sweeping through parts of northern Syria, with at least 7000 people affected because the ongoing civil war has disrupted vaccination programmes, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Tuesday [18 Jun 2013]. "The main factor leading to the worsening of the situation and to outbreaks has been the disruption of routine immunisation activities," MSF said. Consequently, vaccination coverage for measles has dropped from around 80 percent to almost zero among young children, it added.

Only 13 cases were reported throughout the country in 2010 and 26 in 2011, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) data. Now at least 7000 people have been infected, with the disease spreading more quickly in part because of the large number of Syrians displaced by the conflict and living in close quarters.

In a bid to stem the epidemic, MSF has been conducting an immunisation programme in parts of northern Syria that are largely rebel-controlled. The group said it had vaccinated more than 75 000 children in the provinces of Aleppo, Raqa and Idlib. But the war has made the process difficult. "Queues for vaccinations had to be avoided for fear that they might attract air strikes or rocket attacks," MSF said. The group also warned that while the mortality rate associated with the current measles outbreak was low, infection would render children more vulnerable to other diseases at a time when basic healthcare is increasingly unavailable. "Complications arising from measles can be life-threatening," the group said. "Apart from the direct victims of the violence in Syria, mortality rates are rising, especially among the most vulnerable, due to the lack of preventative measures such as vaccinations and the lack of access to basic healthcare," MSF said.

The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said a measles outbreak in the northern part of the country has killed 36 children and infected more than 4000 people so far. The agency's North Central Coordinator, Mohammed Abdulsalam, said this at a workshop in Jos [Plateau state] on Thursday [20 Jun 2013].

Mr. Abdulsalam said that the epidemic was ranked 3rd after draught and flood in emergency data of the 10 top natural disasters in Nigeria. He blamed the high rate of the epidemics in the country to illiteracy, ignorance, poor state of personal and environmental hygiene. He said that congestion and absence of community-based early [detection], reporting and surveillance system were also contributing factors.

The NEMA coordinator explained that the one-day workshop was aimed at creating awareness and sensitising stakeholders to the ways of mitigating the spread of cerebrum-spinal meningitis, measles, cholera and Lassa fever, especially during the rainy season. "Health matters are being given proper attention nationwide particularly by the Ministry of Health and other health-related agencies. And during raining season, there are some epidemics that do happen as a result of flooding, because of the nature of our environment.

"Some environment[s] are slum where you have dirt surrounding the people; the waste disposal system is very poor.

"So, people are vulnerable to all sorts of diseases which informed NEMA's decision to organise this workshop where we bring in experts from the health sector to enlighten us and the general public on what we need to do to avoid diseases, such as measles, cholera, meningitis and other diseases that are troubling our societies so that people will take caution and prevent the occurrence of such diseases," he said.

The NEMA boss said his agency wants to help avoid the loss of lives that has resulted from the measles epidemic. He said that the agency had carried out several awareness and sensitisation programmes in collaboration with state governments.

"We have carried out free immunisation exercises, monitoring the states' preparedness on epidemic and trained disease and surveillance notifications officers on effective reporting.

"Stakeholders must know the importance of working with NEMA to avoid more death cases in the country, especially this period as the rain has set in," he said. He urged the state Ministries of Health in the country to improve on mitigation efforts to prevent avoidable hazards from developing to disasters.

Also speaking, Joseph Kumba, Director, Public Health, Benue State Ministry of Health, called on parents to immunise their children and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene. He said such measures would help in the control of epidemics that may occur during the rainy season. "In this country, we have free routine immunisation that is given to every child under the age of 5. So, I [advise] mothers to take their [children under 5] to the nearest health facilities to ensure that they are immunised against measles, against other contagious diseases, and against polio. "For our own sake, the critical [factor] is our personal hygiene. Most epidemics that occurred in our environment are occurring because of poor environmental hygiene.

"I [advise] that if your source of water is not hygienically verified, it will be [necessary] to boil your water, filter it before taking it. If we take some of these precautionary measures, we will be able to control a lot of epidemics that would occur, especially during this rainy season," he said.

More and more measles patients continued to approach public sector hospitals in the [Punjab] province for treatment, enhancing the burden on already overloaded health facilities facing severe shortage of necessary drugs. On Sunday [16 Jun 2013], as many as 99 measles patients were admitted to different hospitals in the province, including 18 in Lahore. So far, 17 948 measles cases have been reported from across the province, including 5204 in Lahore.

The disease that broke out in Punjab virtually assumed shape of an epidemic as 6 to 10 measles-affected children were being reportedly taken on a daily basis [to] the 3 teaching hospitals from different parts of the district. Ironically, officials of the district health department termed the situation normal and under control, while the surge in cases of measles speaks otherwise.

HFH [Holy Family Hospital] Spokesman Dr Javed Hayat confirmed that a total of 6 children have been admitted in the hospital. He said that out of 6 children, 5 were brought from different areas of Rawalpindi and Islamabad while one [was brought] from Attock. He said that the doctors were medicating the patients and [that the] condition of all patients was stable.

So far, a total of 516 cases of measles have been reported in teaching hospitals including Benazir Bhutto Hospital, HFH and District Headquarters Hospital. Of the total number, 295 were only reported in HFH.

The Halton Region Health Department says 3 related cases of measles have been confirmed in Burlington [Ontario province]. People who visited any of the following locations on Saturday [8 Jun 2013] may have been exposed to measles:

- SportChek in Burlington Mall, Guelph Line and Fairview Street, at 1 p.m. until approximately 4 p.m.
- The Collector's Vault, near New Street and Guelph Line, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
- Al's Source for Sports, 3485 Fairview St., between 1 and 4 p.m.

"Persons who have measles need to isolate themselves while they are ill and for 4 full days after the rash 1st appears," Halton Region Medical Officer of Health Dr. Bob Nosal said in a press release. Dr. Monir Taha, associate medical officer of health for Halton Region, told the Post all 3 of the cases involve children in the same family who are all under the age of 16. "To my knowledge nothing serious has happened to these children," said Taha. He noted they would all be past the contagious phase of the disease by now.

"We received notification of these cases at the end of the day on Friday [14 Jun 2013]. There were other locations, which included healthcare settings and sports events where exposure may have occurred. The health department has made good progress in contacting people. We continue to try connecting with people we don't get to right away," said Taha. "Our (measles) vaccination rate (in Halton) is 90 per cent but it's too bad it isn't even higher; it's highly infectious. You can never really have high enough immunity levels. Things (diseases) in the world are never more than an airport away."

Taha says reasons for those who have not been vaccinated can include an allergy to the vaccine, religious beliefs, lack of faith in its effectiveness or those with a weakened immune system being treated for cancer. Measles starts with a cough, a runny nose, red, watery eyes and a fever. After about 4 days a rash begins on the face and moves down the body. There may be white spots inside the mouth. Measles spreads easily to people who are not immune. Anyone born in 1970 or later that has not had 2 doses of measles vaccine is considered susceptible to the disease. Infants under one year old, pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems can get very ill with measles. Complications of measles can include middle ear infections, pneumonia, croup and inflammation of the brain. About one in 1000 people with measles die of it.

A 2nd case of measles has been confirmed in Dallas County [Texas], according to CBS DFW [Dallas-Fort Worth]. A 14-year-old child who had been fully immunized contracted the disease after reportedly being in contact with the person who contracted the 1st case of measles last month [May 2013].

Dallas County Health and Human Services is warning doctors and health care providers to consider the rare disease when patients come in with similar symptoms, such as runny nose, fever, red and watery eyes, cough, or signs of rash all over the body.

More than 1000 cases of measles have been reported in the United Kingdom. In the US, outbreaks have occurred in New York and North Carolina. This year, 2 cases have been confirmed in Denton County [Texas].

Cairns residents are being warned they may still be at risk of measles, after the detection of a 2nd case linked to a local cinema in the far north Queensland city. A man in his 20s was diagnosed earlier this month and had visited the cinemas at the Cairns Central Shopping Centre. The Director of Tropical Public Health Services, Dr Richard Gair, says a teenage girl who had visited the cinema on the same day as the man has been confirmed as having the disease. Dr Gair says the girl was not vaccinated.

He says anyone who attended the shopping centre on [31 May 2013] should be vigilant. "If they get any measles symptoms and they get a rash, if they're not immune to measles, if they haven't been vaccinated against measles or had measles in the past, they should contact their GP," he said. "[But] maybe not go along to the surgery, because if they go along to the surgery and they've got measles they might infect other people."
