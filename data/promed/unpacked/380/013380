During April, there was 1 case of canine rabies in a raccoon (Webb County)
in South Texas. One person and 3 vaccinated dogs were exposed to the rabid
raccoon; all received post exposure rabies prophylaxis. To date, no cases
of canine rabies have been reported north of the South Texas Oral Rabies
Vaccination Program (ORVP) drop-zone for coyotes.
In West-Central Texas, there were 10 cases of gray fox rabies in the
following counties: Crockett (1 fox), Edwards (1 fox), Kimble (2 foxes),
Llano (1 fox), Pecos (1 fox), Schleicher (1 fox), Sutton (1 fox), and Tom
Green (2 foxes). To date, no cases of gray fox rabies have been reported
beyond the boundaries of the original ORVP drop-zone for gray foxes;
however, the rabid fox in Llano County was located beyond the border of the
1999 drop-zone.
There were 46 cases of rabies in animals reported statewide, including:
20 skunks
10 foxes
8 bats
3 raccoons
