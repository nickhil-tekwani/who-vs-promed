A case of H3N2 swine influenza has been lab confirmed in one hog at the Clinton County Fair. There are no human cases at this time.

The Clinton County Fair Board is working with the Ohio Department of Agriculture and the Clinton County Agricultural Society, along with local and state health officials, to stop further spread of this virus in the animal population. By Friday morning [14 Jul 2017], all swine will have been removed from the Clinton County Fairgrounds.

Swine flu, like any flu virus can be spread, although rare, from pigs to people. Spread of swine flu viruses from pigs to people is thought to happen the same way that human flu viruses are spread; mainly through droplets when infected pigs cough or sneeze.

What to do if you get sick:
- flu symptoms usually include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and sometimes vomiting or diarrhea;
- if you are at high risk and you get the flu symptoms, call your health care provider. Tell them about your high risk factors and your symptoms. If you have had recent exposure to pigs, tell them that too;
- if you are not at high risk and you get flu symptoms after exposure to pigs, seek medical care as you normally would;
- a health care provider can decide whether influenza testing or treatment is needed;
- these drugs work better the sooner you start them, so seek medical treatment promptly if you get symptoms and are at high risk.

"If you have been in contact with swine and are experiencing signs and symptoms of flu-like illness, please consult your medical provider," said Dr Terry Holten, Clinton County Health District Medical Director. "Especially if you are high risk which includes children under 5 years, those with long-term health conditions, like asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems, as well as pregnant women and people 65 years and older."

The Clinton County Fair remains open to the public. As with any pet or livestock contact, visitors should continue to wash their hands after petting animals and before eating. Sanitizer stations are available throughout the Clinton County Fairgrounds.

Highland County Junior Fair Coordinator Jana Holbrook said that she has not received any guidance from the Ohio Department of Agriculture at this time. She is asking all Junior Fair participants to "please be patient and keep taking care of your hog projects as you were."

[The surveillance for the virus is clearly at a heightened level and even more so since an animal has a positive diagnosis.

Thus far, no humans from this particular fair have been reported with this strain of flu. Personal hygiene around animals is more than just a good idea; it is a great way to reduce the spread of any virus among animals or from animals to people - Mod.TG
