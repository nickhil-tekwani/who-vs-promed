A total of 132 Hong Kong race horses have been infected with equine
herpes in the territory's worst outbreak of the disease, a year
before the city is due to host the equestrian event of the 2008
Beijing Olympics, the local jockey club said. The horses fell sick
since 9 Feb 2007, showing symptoms of mild fever, blood problems and
swelling in the legs, and among them, 5 horses pulled out of races
Monday [9 Apr 2007], Hong Kong Jockey Club spokesman Wilson Cheng said.
Cheng said the equine herpes virus isn't new to Hong Kong, but the
latest outbreak is the territory's biggest in history. "We've never
had an outbreak involving so many horses," he told The Associated
Press in a phone interview. The horses also fell sick despite being
vaccinated against the herpes virus, but Cheng said that wasn't a
dangerous sign.
"Even if you're vaccinated against the flu, it doesn't mean you're
totally immune. You may get mild symptoms, but they can be quickly
controlled," he said.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club said in a statement the sick horses
recovered within a few days and that most returned to training within
a week. It said Hong Kong's strong surveillance and disease control
measures helped limit the impact of a "potentially serious" outbreak.
Cheng said Jockey Club officials suspect the herpes was spread by
shared horse equipment.
News of the outbreak comes 3 weeks before the prestigious Queen
Elizabeth II Cup race on 29 Apr 2007 and a year ahead of the Beijing
Olympics in August 2008, whose equestrian event will be held in Hong
Kong. After Beijing won the bid to host the 2008 Games, it received
permission to move the equestrian events to Hong Kong because of
concerns about equine diseases on the mainland. Hong Kong has a horse
racing tradition and experience working with the animals.
A spokesman for the Olympic equestrian event in Hong Kong said
organizers aren't worried about the equine herpes virus outbreak
because it has ordered stringent quarantine measures. Christopher Yip
said competing horses must be quarantined for a week before they
depart for Hong Kong and another 10 days after they arrive here, and
that they will be separated from the local horse population. "We will
not be affected," Yip said.
The herpes outbreak is the 2nd major horse safety scare in Hong Kong
in recent weeks. On 21 Mar 2007, Jockey Club workers discovered a
12-meter (40 feet) long hose that branched out into metal tubes
embedded in a race course, a device police say may inflict serious
injury to horses. Asked about the apparent sabotage attempt, Yip
said, "Security is very tight for every Olympic games."

[If the equine authorities in Hong Kong want to build confidence in
their disease control abilities, it is important for them to provide
more clinical details. Pathology of equine herpesvirus-4 is limited
to the respiratory track, but it appears as if there were other
symptoms as well in this case. Therefore, it appears we are probably
dealing with equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1). Several locations in the
United States recently have suffered a neurological syndrome
associated with EHV-1, but the quick recovery indicated in the
article suggests that we are not dealing with that particular strain.
The Merck Veterinary Manual describes EHV as follows:
"Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and EHV-4 comprise 2 antigenically
distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2
of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide
and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary
infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis.
Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas
with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in
weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and
geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and
horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is
determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and
possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results
in abortion. Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical
or subclinical infection with EHV-1. An infrequent clinical sequela
of EHV-1 infection is development of neurological disease. The
natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent
infections and carrier states occur with both virus types.
Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious
nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids."
See <http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121302.htm>.
In the previous postings on this outbreak (see references below),
there were strong assertions that, regarding the unknown disease at
the time, it was "99 percent certain" that the horses were not
infected with equine herpesvirus. I guess the one percent actually
happens sometimes. More clinical details and laboratory results are
needed. - Mod.PC]
