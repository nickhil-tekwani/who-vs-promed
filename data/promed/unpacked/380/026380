A case of anthrax in Rostov
---------------------------
A single case of animal anthrax has been discovered in Dubovsk rayon of the
Rostov region. The information came from the Ministry of Emergency
Situations of the Russia Federation in Rostov. This case has been
registered in the village of Sirotskiy in a pig.
According to the source, this animal (pig) was slaughtered by one of the
households and brought for testing before sale. As a result of the test and
sanitary epidemiological surveillance, the staff discovered _Bacillus
anthracis_ in the meat. The additional test confirmed that the pig in fact
had anthrax.
92 people were vaccinated in Sirotski village, and quarantine was put into
effect.

[There is a discontinuity in this report. If the carcass was submitted for
testing "before sale," why did the authorities vaccinate 92 people?
Logically, there had been a series of sick livestock and slaughtering in
the village before someone tipped off the authorities. Pigs are somewhat
resistant to this disease and will be perceived to be ill before dying, and
not all die. Oropharyngeal lesions and edema are not uncommon in pigs so
afflicted. As it is now summertime, one can ask what the local authorities
discovered as to the source of this outbreak. If these were commercially
raised pigs, one would expect that their feed was contaminated, for which
there is indirect Russian evidence. If rural backyard pigs, they may have
had access to the viscera of butchered dead sheep & cows. - Mod.MHJ]
