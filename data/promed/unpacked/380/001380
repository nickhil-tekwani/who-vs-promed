See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=27128. According to the report, (see outbreak no. 22 of the report), the affected animals included 43 800 susceptible, 8 cases, and 8 deaths. The actions of culling and disposing of the animals are in progress. This is a huge operation that has now been affected by ASF.
