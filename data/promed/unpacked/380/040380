Influenza A (H1sw), Germany ex Saudi Arabia, Hadj returnee
----------------------------------------------------------
Here we report on a 52-year-old female German resident, coming to our department on [7 Oct 2015] with high fever (40 degrees Centigrade) and non-productive cough. She had just returned from Hadj pilgrimage in Mekka [Saudi Arabia], where she stayed from [6 Sep 2015 to 6 Oct 2015].

On admission she was put into isolation to rule out MERS-CoV. A deep-throat-swap was negative for MERS-CoV, but the sample returned positive for influenza virus A, subtype influenza A(H1sw).

The patient was on immunosuppression with Ciclosporin and Prednisolone due to kidney-transplantation in 2001 and no other underlying diseases. She was travelling alone.

The flight back [6 Oct 2015] from Mekka, Saudi Arabia to Frankfurt, Germany was with a stopover in Istanbul, Turkey but she reported that she had not left the plane there. The fever started during the flight onwards to Germany.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Christian Kleine for provision of this report of influenza virus infection probably contracted in Saudi Arabia during the period of the Hajj religious celebration [see also: Influenza (49): Canada ex Saudi Arabia, Hajj returnees, susp., RFI, Alert, 20151005.3693052].

The presence of [seasonal] influenza among members of the mobile population attending the Hajj could constitute a source of infection of Hajj participants and the source of the next global outbreak of seasonal influenza. - Mod.CP
