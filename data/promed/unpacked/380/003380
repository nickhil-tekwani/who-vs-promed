The 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) which has just concluded in Dar es Salaam, has directed the East African Community (EAC) Secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever [RVF] promptly.

SCAFS urged the EAC to convene a meeting of the Technical Working Group on Transboundary Animal and Zoonotic Diseases (TADs), to address the issue of RVF outbreak, which has been reported in the region.

The meeting of the Sectoral Council was attended by the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Charles Tizeba and Uganda's Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Mr. Vincent Bamulangaki Ssempijja, among other delegates. They directed the Secretariat to include emerging and re-emerging diseases as a permanent agenda item in the subsequent meetings of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security.

Tanzania is, however, not affected by the outbreak. At least 26 people in 2 north-eastern counties in Kenya are suspected of having contracted Rift Valley Fever (RVF). By [16 Jun 2018], 7 of these cases were confirmed and 6 of the people had died according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). The outbreak was reported to World Health Organisation and the International Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).

In Rwanda, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources confirmed cases of RVF among cattle after samples were tested at the Rwanda Agriculture Board Laboratory [see comment]. South Sudan reported an outbreak of RVF in March [2018] and is reported to be containing the situation.

The East African Community (EAC) Secretariat is closely monitoring the outbreaks and is urging the Partner States that are not yet affected by RVF to step up surveillance to detect any spread of the disease to their territories at an early stage and to inform the public about the risk and preventive measures.

The affected areas in Kenya include the counties of Wajir and Tana River on the border to Somalia and in Rwanda the districts of Kayonza, Kirehe and Ngoma. Kirehe borders Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda, causing a risk of cross-border spread of RVF.

Rift Valley Fever is a virus disease that is transmitted by infected mosquitos. This year's heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats and camels and also wildlife, such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses.

Human-to-human transmission of RVF has not been documented.

[The statement about the confirmation of RVF cases in cattle in Rwanda, as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources in Rwanda, warrants official notification to the OIE, including details of the laboratory technique applied. Earlier media reports from Rwanda informed about high mortality rates in cattle, attributed to RVF. As rightly commented by a subscriber, such high mortality in (adult) cattle is rather unusual. Could other disease agents be involved, such as tick borne diseases? No human RVF cases have been reported, so far, from Rwanda

Outbreaks of RVF occur in populations with low immunity levels and in association with events in local hydrology, like prolonged rains. As herd immunity is high just after an outbreak, in most endemic areas there are periods of years between reports of RVF.

East Africa is regarded an endemic RVF region; it has been demonstrated that the virus is transmitted transovarially in _Aedes_ mosquitos of the neomelaniconium group. These are floodwater breeding species that emerge in enormous numbers in floodplains and other habitats, where they oviposit. These mosquito eggs and the virus they carry, remain viable for long periods in the mud of dried-up surface pools or shallow depressions (locally known as dambos or pans and vlei), or in floodplains. Infected mosquitoes hatch from these when they flood again. This is now widely accepted as a key component of the endemic mechanism, outbursts of the zoonsis taking place after prolonged interepidemic periods in grasslands and semi-arid regions in East Africa.

This vector-ecology RVF does not preclude spread by other, though probably less significant routes, in the mentioned ecosystems - such as transhumance and international trade in infected, virus-amplifying animals, as well as short or longer distance windborne transmission of infected mosquitoes.

While RVF has been initially identified in Kenya during an extensive event, affecting animals (sheep) and humans in 1930-31, the major epizootic in the East African region occurred in 1997-1998. This took place in the drier areas of northeast Kenya and southwest Somalia after heavy rains associated with El Ni√±o. This caused human deaths as well as livestock losses, particularly of camels. Arguably more significant was the disruption to livestock exports from the Horn of Africa to the Middle East.

The most recent large outbreak of RVF in East Africa was in 2006-2007. On top of the most affected territories in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania, the disease was reported from Sudan, Uganda and the islands Comoros and Madagascar. A WHO map showing the main regions and sites affected in 2006-7 is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/RVF2007050.jpg.

Despite forecasts and widespread disease in livestock, the 1st identification of the causative RVF virus, during the 2006-2007 epidemic, was achieved by diagnosing human cases. This underlined the need for improved surveillance in endemic countries. FAO has recently published an updated RVF manual (2018, at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf). Notably, a similar situation has been seen during the current, evolving event, in Kenya, where the 1st identification of the virus was carried out in a hospitalized patient.

Regional approach and internationally cooperated surveillance, prevention and control activities are conditional to effective handling of RVF. Hopefully, the activities to be undertaken by EAC will contribute to early control of the emerging outbreak, and - ideally - to the prevention of its further spread; in particular, to the exclusion of additional human cases.

EAC is a regional intergovernmental organisation of 6 Partner States, comprising Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, with its headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania.

According to another media report, one of the measures to be undertaken is restriction of livestock movement within the EAC partner states (http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/EAC-sends-alarm-over-rift-valley-fever/688334-4627180-3cr4ca/index.html). - Mod.AS
