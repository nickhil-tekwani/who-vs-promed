Glanders kills Amur tiger presented by Russia to Iran
-----------------------------------------------------
Glanders, a respiratory infection, killed the
Amur tiger presented by Russia to Iran as a gift,
Tehran Zoo manager Amir Elhami told the IRNA news
agency on Friday [11 Jan 2011]. He said the tiger
was terminally ill before it was brought to
Tehran from Russia. The manager refuted claims
that the tiger had allegedly died because of poor
conditions at the zoo. He said that other zoo
inhabitants had no glanders and were in good
health. The previous case of glanders happened at
the Tehran Zoo 50 years ago, Elhami said. "The
Russian tiger that was brought to the country was
itself a carrier of glanders and did not catch
the disease in Iran," Amir Elhami told Press TV.

Meanwhile, a source at the Russian trade office
in Iran strongly denied the possible transfer of
ill animals to Iran in an interview with
Itar-Tass. "Two Amur tigers -- a male and a
female -- presented by Russia to Iran in April
2010 were absolutely healthy at the moment of the
transfer. The animals were closely examined by
veterinarians and put under quarantine. Top-grade
biologists examined them upon the arrival in
Iran," he said. "Eight months have passed since
the moment of the transfer. A sick animal
accustomed to a rather cold climate would not
have survived Tehran summer heat, especially in a tight zoo cage," he remarked.

About USD 5 million had been spent on the tiger
reproduction project in northern Iran. Iranian
environmentalists planned to restore the tiger
population in pre-Caspian areas, and the Amur
tiger was the closest to the Mazandaran tiger by
genetic parameters. Russian tigers were due to
live in the Miankaleh nature reserve but the
Iranian media said that the tiger living quarters were still not ready.

The tiger, which died in Tehran [at the end of
December 2010], was active and healthy through
the 2 years it spent at the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Zoo
[in Russia, before being sent to Tehran Zoo], a
zoo representative told Itar-Tass on Friday [11 Jan 2011].

14 lions killed at Iran zoo over infection fears
------------------------------------------------
Authorities put down 14 lions at the Tehran zoo
that had been diagnosed with an infectious
bacterial disease that could affect visitors, a
local newspaper reported on Monday [17 Jan 2011].
The lions were suffering from glanders, a
bacterial disease found in horses, donkeys, mules
as well as other domesticated animals. It can
spread from infected animals to humans. The paper
did not say when the lions were killed.

Houman Moloukpour, a veterinarian, told the
newspapers that over the past 2 months 3 lions
have died in the zoo after they contracted
glanders, which he said cannot be treated among
[wild animals, but domesticated animals] do respond to treatment.

The semiofficial Fars news agency reported that
the disease could also be spread through the city
by stray cats. "The feral cats, which frequently
go to the zoo, can transfer the disease to the
rest of the city easily," veterinarian Ami Peiman
Khosravi of the Tehran Veterinary Center told the
agency. The zoo is located in the western part of
Tehran near densely populated neighborhoods and
the main football stadium. The death of the lions
came some 2 weeks after a [Amur] tiger died in the zoo.

Mohammad Javad Mohammadizadeh, head of Iran's
environmental department, told Fars Sunday that
the tiger died after being fed contaminated meat,
though it is possible it could also be related to
the glanders. The tiger was in the zoo as a part
of an exchange program between Iran and Russia
under which Iran gave 2 leopards to Russia in
return for the tigers. The other tiger is still in the zoo, under quarantine.

The disease can lead to death in the affected
animal or human in a matter of days or weeks, but
the bacteria itself is easily destroyed by
sunlight, heat and ordinary detergents. Glanders
is rare in the Western world, but is still
endemic in parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and South America.

[From the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2008 page 919:
Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of
horses, donkeys, and mules, and is caused by
infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia
mallei_. The disease causes nodules and
ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and
lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as 'farcy.'
Control of glanders requires testing of suspect
clinical cases, screening of apparently normal
equids, and elimination of positive reactors. It
is transmitted to humans and all
infected/contaminated or potentially
infected/contaminated material must be handled in
a laboratory that meets the requirements for Containment Group 3 pathogens.

In horses, inflammatory nodules and ulcers
develop in the nasal passages and give rise to a
sticky yellow discharge, accompanied by enlarged
firm submaxillary lymph nodes. Stellate scarring
follows upon healing of the ulcers. The formation
of nodular abscesses in the lungs is accompanied
by progressive debility, febrile episodes,
coughing and dyspnoea. Diarrhoea and polyuria can
also occur. In the skin form ('farcy'), the
lymphatics are enlarged and nodular abscesses
('buds') of 0.5­2.5 cm develop, which ulcerate
and discharge yellow oily pus. Nodules are
regularly found in the liver and spleen.

Discharges from the respiratory tract and skin
are infective, and transmission between animals,
which is facilitated by close contact, by
inhalation, ingestion of contaminated material
(e.g. from infected feed and water troughs), or
by inoculation (e.g. via a harness) is common.
The incubation period can range from a few days to many months (23, 42).
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf>

Limited data is available about glanders in
felines, let alone tigers and lions. A historical
account by Dr. Rush Shippen Huidekoper in 1895 states that:
"I have seen a number of lions die in a menagerie
from having eaten glandered meat. In the
post-mortem house of a veterinary college, in
which I had just made an autopsy upon a glandered
horse, as I was washing my hands I noticed a cat
with a litter of kittens eating at some of the
organs which I had placed to one side for
demonstration. I had the cats immediately locked
up, and in 4 days all of them were infected with
the disease and had to be destroyed."
<http://chestofbooks.com/animals/cats/Guide/Glanders-In-Cats.html>

Although glanders can theoretically have an
incubation from days to months, most infection
progresses in weeks. If these Amur tigers from
the cold region of Far East Russia had contracted
glanders since living in Russia, the disease
would have more likely flared up during the
environmental stress of the hot Iranian summer, not the cool winter.

The possibility of stray cats at the zoo
transmitting glanders to city people is possible.
Another possibility is that the stray cat might
have been infected with glanders from elsewhere
and transmitted the disease to zoo animals. But
either scenario is quite unlikely, as the sick
stray cat with glanders would have to wander
through the animal cages, eat or contaminate the
same water or food source as the tiger and lion
without being eaten by the wild felid itself.

The news does not clearly state what diagnostic
tests were given for the confirmation of glanders
and whether other seemingly healthy animals at
the zoo had been thoroughly tested. If
contaminated meat were the source for glanders,
then other carnivores at the zoo which are likely
fed the same meat source would also be in danger
of contracting the disease. Further information
on the diagnostic tests given and the animals
administered the tests would be appreciated.

The following video shows the lions at Tehran
Zoo. Caution of judgment should be made in that
this might be the back cage in which the lion
will spend only a limited amount of time. The
front of the lion exhibit would presumably be
much larger with a more naturalistic environments.

The Amur tiger (_Panthera tigris_ ssp. altaica),
is one of the 9 subspecies of tigers recognized
in the world. A comprehensive population census
in 2005 found 331­393 adult-subadult Amur tigers
in the Russian Far East, with fewer than 100
likely to be sub-adults >20 ­ <36 months of age
(breeding adult population = approximately 250).
However, after having been stable for more than a
decade due to intensive conservation efforts,
partial surveys conducted in subsequent winters
indicate that the Russian tiger population is declining.

The ISIS.org world zoo database lists 468 Amur
tigers living in captivity in zoos around the world.

The Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. virgata)
is a subspecies that ranges from west and south
of the Caspian Sea and west through Central Asia
into the Takla Makan desert of Xinjiang, China.
It has become extinct from hunting and habitat
loss. The last Caspian tiger was seen in the
early 1970s and there are none in captivity.
