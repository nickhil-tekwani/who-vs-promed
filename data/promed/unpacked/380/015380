The [Hong Kong] Department of Health is investigating a
gastroenteritis outbreak involving 88 passengers and 4 crew aboard a
cruise ship that arrived in Hong Kong today [30 May 2007].
The 44 male and 44 female passengers, aged 3 to 83, and the 4 crew
came down with diarrhea, vomiting and fever between 21 and 29 May
2007. None required hospitalization. 70 have recovered, while the
others are in stable condition after treatment by the ship's doctor.
The ship, carrying 639 passengers and 465 crew, left Singapore on 20
May 2007, stopping in Ko Samui and Bangkok in Thailand as well as Ho
Chi Min City and Da Nang in Viet Nam.
Port Health Office and Centre for Health Protection staff have
inspected the ship and advised control measures. The ship will be
thoroughly disinfected before its next cruise. The crew have been
advised to observe personal and food hygiene. Laboratory tests on
patients' samples are being conducted.

[It is presumed that this outbreak of rapid onset gastroenteritis is
caused by norovirus infection, a disease problem that, up to now, has
been associated with cruise ships operating mainly in the Caribbean
and the north Atlantic regions. Confirmation of the final diagnosis
is awaited. - Mod.CP]
