AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN - EAST ASIA (122): MIGRATORY BIRDS, CORRECTION

[Re the moderator comment in the previous post:
"The most westerly H5N1-positive bird (recovered in Finland) carried a low-
pathogenicity -- possibly indigenous -- virus (see ProMED-mail post: Avian
influenza - Europe (08): Finland, seagull, LPAI, conf. 20050830.2560)."]
I would like to correct the moderator's comment on the spread of H5N1 avian
influenza. We do not have HPAI H5N1 in Finland or Europe.
Today (2 Sep 2005) the EU avian influenza reference laboratory in Weybridge
(UK) reported to us the virus isolated in Oulu to be H13 and according to the
molecular studies to be of the LPAI [low pathogenic] type. Further
characterization of the virus isolated is pending. The characterization will
be concluded after the proper animal experiments for the pathogenic index have
been carried out.
This result seems to be about what we strongly expected from the beginning of
the case.

[Yes, in fact the ProMED-mail post quoted says:
"The Finnish chief veterinary officer said this is *not* the H5N1 virus,"
European Commission spokesman Philip Tod told journalists in Brussels
today. "This is a mild, low-pathogenic strain of avian influenza [LPAI] that
is commonly found in wild birds." The Finnish case poses a minimal risk to
poultry and humans, he said." (emphasis added). ProMED regrets the error. -
