Medical personnel of the Epuyen Hospital held a press conference in order to answer questions about the death of a 14-year-old girl who could have been infected by [a] hantavirus. They stated that the girl was admitted with digestive problems and after some hours she was considered a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. However, this has not been confirmed.

Because of this, it was indicated that in Chubut province there is just one confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection] that was detected on 13 Nov [2018]. This was a case of a man who resided in an agricultural [chacras] area.

Nevertheless, there are another suspected 5 cases. Now the technical team has to identify the common factors that could determine the source of the infection.

Of these suspected cases, 3 are patients in intensive therapy. The others are in ambulatory care.

"We can say that they are not of the same nuclear family, are not from urban areas, rather from rural ones, but tomorrow we are going to be in the Epuyen locality to carry out a survey.

Recommendations for residents of the mountains
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health recommends: camp in a sunny area, free of weeds and trash where no rodent nests are found," as well as "do not go into the forest, into places that have brush and where there are no warning signs stating that it is a safe area."

For rural area residents: "precautionary measures must be taken when carrying out tasks in rural areas," and in that sense, "dampen down areas before cleaning and wear eye, nose, and mouth protection in order to not breathe rodent excrements or urine that, with the passage of time become desiccated and produce dust that can be easily breathed, which is the mechanism by which hantaviruses infection occurs."

"If the area has been closed for considerable time, first ventilate it and later clean it."

The [Epuyen] community in Chubut [province] is shocked about the death of a 14-year-old girl, whose demise could be due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. Meanwhile, another 4 people are receiving [medical] attention in Esquel. One of these is in intensive care.

In Epuyen, 5 cases, one of them fatal, are suspected to have hantavirus [infections]. The mayor of the locality, Antonio Reato, stated that confirmation is awaited for the samples sent to the Carlos Malbran Institute.

The dead child was 14 years old; the other 4 cases are attended in Esquel. One of the patients being treated is a municipal employee.

Mayor Reato spoke with the Minister of Health, Adrian Pizzi, and coordinated the dispatch of Zoonoses personnel to conduct a survey of the area where the residents of Epuyen with suspected hantavirus infections live.

"This is a sad day for us due to the girl who died. There is no definite diagnosis. The samples are sent to Buenos Aires, but all was delayed because there were flights during the [G20 Buenos Aires summit, 30 Nov-1 Dec 2018]," Reato stated.

"There are 4 suspected cases, in addition to the 14-year-old girl," he continued. "The hospitalized individuals are in stable condition. There is a municipal employee in intensive case, and we hope that he will leave it in coming days."

"Hantavirus disease is an emergent zoonoses transmitted to humans by rodents infected with that virus, mainly in suburban and rural environments, in peridomestic situations, or in closed places like sheds or storage buildings. However, it has been seen in periurban and domestic areas where there are invasions of rodents seeking food or refuge.

[These reports do not indicate which hantavirus might be responsible for these 5 suspected cases. Esquel is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
