Bovine viral diarrhea has been going through herds of cattle in
Australia over the last year with the most serious results. There
have been calving rate losses of up to 40 percent in recorded herds of cattle.

Known as BVDV, there are vaccinations available but not yet in Australia.

Many farmers will not accept that there is a problem until it's too late.

[Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), most common in young cattle (6-24
months old) and generally accompanied by typical mucosal lesions,
must be distinguished from other viral diseases that produce diarrhea
and mucosal lesions. These include malignant catarrhal fever (MCF),
which usually is a sporadic disease in more mature cattle, and
rinderpest (a disease practically eradicated worldwide). Serologic
surveys indicate that BVD virus (BVDV) is distributed worldwide.

BVDV is classified in the genus _Pestivirus_ in the family
_Flaviviridae_. Although cattle are the primary hosts for BVDV,
several reports suggest most even-toed ungulates are also
susceptible. Isolates of BVDV are separated into noncytopathic and
cytopathic biotypes based on cytopathic effects observed in infected
cell cultures. Noncytopathic BVDV is the predominant viral biotype in
nature. Cytopathic BVDV is relatively rare and arises in cattle that
are persistently infected with noncytopathic BVDV. Based on viral RNA
sequence, there are at least 2 viral genotypes of BVDV that can be
further divided into subgenotypes. The viral genotypes are termed
BVDV type 1 and BVDV type 2, and both cytopathic and noncytopathic
BVDV are represented in each viral genotype.

ProMED-mail usually does not carry information on BVD since it is
regarded as endemic in most parts of the world. However, a recent
notification from Israel to the OIE on an unusually severe, acute
outbreak caused by genotype 2 has been posted (see 20080824.2639).
Subscribers are referred to the commentary by Mod.PC at the said posting.

The BVD situation in Australia is, most likely, similar to the
situation in other cattle breeding countries. In view of the above
newswire, it will be interesting to obtain more information on the
cases observed there during 2008. - Mod.AS]
