A bat has tested positive for rabies in the Savannah area. The Coastal Health District said the bat bit a resident on the hand. That person is receiving post-exposure rabies treatment and is expected to fully recover.

The bat's exact home location isn't known. The resident hit the bat with their car on a commute from downtown Savannah to Whitemarsh Island and was bitten when removing the bat from the car windshield. The resident then notified the health department so the animal could be tested for rabies.

Several species of wild animals which are native to coastal Georgia -- including raccoons, foxes, and bats -- can carry rabies. Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that is primarily spread by infected animals.

Following these tips can protect you and your family from rabies:

- Avoid contact with animals you don't know.
- Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines after 12 weeks of age, followed by a booster shot within 1 year and vaccination every 1-3 years depending on veterinary recommendation and vaccine used.
- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving out pet food at night.
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home.
- Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone" is a good principle for children to learn.

[2] New York (Oneida County): cat, additional animal & human exposure

Five people and 6 animals were exposed to a cat testing positive for rabies in the town of Forestport, resulting in one exposed animal being euthanized, the Oneida County Health Department announced Friday [7 Oct 2022].

The cat was sent to the New York State (NYS) Department of Health Wadsworth Center for testing, and positive results were reported on 5 Oct 2022 officials say.

Two people were directly exposed to the cat and have received post-exposure treatment. Officials say 3 additional people had secondary exposure to the rabid cat and also received treatment.

A total of 6 cats and dogs were exposed to the rabid cat, officials said. One cat was unvaccinated, and as a result, had to be euthanized and tested for rabies. Those results are pending. Two other animals were not up to date with their rabies vaccines and are now in quarantine for 6 months. The 3 other exposed animals were up to date with vaccinations and received booster doses.

Department officials are urging residents to look out for signs of rabies in animals, including strange behavior, shyness or willingness to get unusually close, and drooling or foaming at the mouth. If an animal is displaying this behavior, department officials say your local animal control should be contacted for help.

Under NYS Public Health laws, all dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated by 4 months old with updated booster doses in the years following. Find more information on rabies prevention at https://www.ocgov.net/oneida/envhealth/MosquitoesTicksRabies.

https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/rabid-cat-prompts-nj-health-warning-entire-colony-of-feral-felines-likely-exposed/3904556/


Health officials in New Jersey are sounding the alarm after a feral cat found in Woodbridge Township tested positive for rabies and scratched 2 people, potentially infecting them as well, authorities say.

The cat was found last Friday [7 Oct 2022] on Edward Street in the Iselin section of the township when animal control officers responded to a call about a feline acting abnormally during daylight hours. It also appeared sick.

The calico-colored critter was safely captured and taken to a forensic lab, where tests showed it was positive for rabies. Now authorities are directing their attention to an apparent "colony" of feral cats in the area which may have been exposed -- and 2 people who live on Edward Street who were scratched by the rabid animal are being monitored closely.

The state has instructed animal control officers to capture any feral cats in the Edward Street vicinity.

Rabies is usually spread through an animal bite, though human cases are rare. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle spasms, paralysis, mental confusion, and other problems. If you think you've been bitten, seek immediate medical attention. Rabies affects the central nervous system and can be fatal in people without urgent treatment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says pet vaccination and staying away from wild animals are the best preventive measures.

Any Woodbridge resident who may have seen or come into contact with any of the neighborhood cats around Edward Street is advised to call the health department. Health officials also offered these tips:

- Don't come into close contact with stray or wild animals that can spread rabies, including cats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, groundhogs, dogs or cats.
- Don't let kids play with or feed feral cats or other wildlife.
- Make sure trash, garbage, and recycling containers are closed tightly.
- Be cautious when you see feral cats or other wild animals acting erratically. If you notice odd behavior, call the health department's animal control division.
- Make sure your pets are up to date with their vaccination. If not, take them to the vet immediately for a rabies vaccine.
- If you're bitten by an animal, especially one acting abnormally, contain it if you can safely do so or get a good description, cleanse the wound, and seek medical attention for yourself.

[4] South Carolina (Dorchester County): bat, human exposure

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) says a bat found in North Charleston tested positive for rabies, and 2 people were exposed to the infected animal. The bat was located near Sentry Circle and Royal Palm Lane, officials say. On Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], tests on the bat came back positive for the virus. The 2 people who were exposed were referred to their healthcare providers, according to DHEC.

"Never handle a bat or any wild or stray animal, alive or dead, with your bare hands," says Terri McCollister, rabies program team leader. Health officials say because bats have relatively small teeth, it's not always easy to tell when someone or something has been bitten.

If you believe you, someone you know, or one of your pets have come into contact with a rabid animal, you are urged to call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston office during normal business hours (8:30 am-5:00 pm, Monday-Friday) or on the after-hours/holiday line.

[5] Florida (St. Lucie County): bats, human exposure

Local health officials are advising people to avoid contact with bats. The advisory followed "a bat-related situation" Friday [14 Oct 2022] at The Landings in Tradition, according to a new release from the Florida Department of Health in St. Lucie County.

Officials were providing treatment for the risk of rabies to exposed individuals and working with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

If you are exposed to a bat through accidental contact, a bite, or a scratch, call 772-462-3883 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday or 772-462-3800 after hours.

Appropriate treatment through post-exposure vaccination, started soon after exposure, protects people from the risk of rabies, according to the release. The only preventative treatment for human exposure to rabies is rabies-specific immunoglobulin and rabies immunization.

Rabies is present in the wild animal population, and people should avoid contact with wildlife.

Local officials gave the following precautions:
- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter.
- Call your local animal control agency to remove any stray animals from your neighborhood.
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home.
- Keep rabies vaccinations up to date for all pets.
- Keep your pets under direct supervision so they don't come in contact with wild animals.
- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, schools, and other similar areas where they might come in contact with people and pets.

[6] New Jersey (Buena borough, Atlantic County): horse
Date: Tue 18 Oct 2022

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/new-jersey-buena-borough-horse-confirmed-positive-for-rabies-21292/


The Atlantic County Division of Public Health is reporting a case of rabies in a horse located in Buena borough. The horse's owner sought treatment for the horse after it was behaving strangely. The horse was transported for treatment and diagnosis but died upon arrival. It was then sent for testing and was confirmed positive for rabies on 13 Oct 2022.

Rabies is a fatal but preventable viral infection of the nervous system, and prompt medical care is required for effective treatment. Rabies is relatively uncommon in horses with only 30-60 cases confirmed each year in the US.

An investigation by the Division of Public Health is ongoing to identify any possible human, livestock, or domestic pet exposures.

This is the 10th confirmed case of rabies this year in Atlantic County. Rabies has previously been confirmed in a groundhog, 2 raccoons, 4 skunks, a fox, and a cat.

Rabies is transmitted through direct contact with saliva through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth. Most human cases of rabies are the result of a bite from an infected animal. If you are bitten by an animal, wash the wound immediately with soap and water and seek medical attention. All bites should be reported to the Atlantic County Division of Public Health.

A rabies vaccination is recommended for domestic animals to not only protect the pet but also the pet owner and family members who could contract rabies from an infected pet.

Public health officials also advise residents to teach children to stay away from wild, stray, or aggressive animals. Never feed or touch wild animals or try to keep them as pets.

Residents should also ensure trash cans have secure lids to prevent wildlife from foraging for food and not leave pet food outside. Many animals are also attracted to bird seed.

If you see wildlife that is behaving strangely, especially nocturnal animals such as skunks and raccoons found during daylight hours, do not approach the animal. Instead, call your local animal control officer.

[It seems bats are enjoying some cooler weather. Or perhaps because it is cooler they are searching wider ranges for food. Whatever the reason, it seems in this report we have interactions between bats and other animals and/or humans.

Please recall the frequency of bats having rabies is extremely high, so do be careful. Do not touch or pick up injured bats. If you awaken and find a bat in your room, seek out medical care as bats can bite you in your sleep and you are unlikely to be aware of it. If you find the bat before going to sleep, vacate the room and call animal control. Bats can also nest in chimneys, and as we open up our fireplaces for use in the autumn/winter we may be allowing bats into the home. Have your chimney or flue checked prior to use.

Our larger pets, such as horses or our show calves, lambs, etc., are also susceptible to rabies. Any mammal is susceptible to rabies. Cattle and horses can be particularly dangerous as they are so much bigger and stronger than us and can inflict much damage to the human body. Yes, vaccinate your farm animals against rabies. Skunks and bats, known for carrying and transmitting rabies, are just as likely to bite a horse or a cow as any other animal. Our large animals are often curious about these strange little creatures in their domain, so they investigate with their noses and get nipped (bitten) for their interest. There are multiple reports of the damage rabid horses have done to a human owner/caretaker. So please vaccinate your pets, regardless of size. - Mod.TG
