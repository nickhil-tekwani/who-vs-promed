The state's 2 national trout hatcheries -- on the North Fork and Little Red rivers -- provide more than 940 000 fingerling rainbow trout annually for the Spring River hatchery. The national hatcheries also directly stock 1.1 million fish annually in Arkansas waters and will continue to provide trout for the state's coldwater fisheries.

IPN occurs in trout and other members of the Salmonidae family. Most fish carry the virus without incident, although it can be fatal to young trout. It is passed from parents to offspring, and from fish to fish through contact.

The Spring River hatchery produces more than 1 million 11-inch [29cm] rainbow trout annually. Fish from the hatchery are distributed in the Bull Shoals Lake and Greers Ferry Lake tailwaters, Spring River, Blanchard Springs and southern Arkansas trout waters, as well as the Family and Community Fishing Program's seasonal trout ponds.

Rainbow trout at the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission's (AGFC) Jim Hinkle Spring River State Fish Hatchery have tested positive for infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN), a virus that can be fatal to fingerling trout. IPN is not transmittable to humans and presents no risk to anglers who handle or eat trout.

An annual fish health inspection at the hatchery recently revealed the presence of the virus. Biologists will gather fish samples from the state's tailwaters to determine the presence or absence of IPN in the wild. AGFC plans to postpone or reduce trout stockings from the Spring River hatchery until the extent of the infection can be determined. "We're looking at commercial vendors and other state hatchery systems to keep us up to speed," said Chris Racey, AGFC chief of fisheries. "This is just a bump in the road. Trout fishing in Arkansas will continue to be great."

[Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is the causative agent of infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) disease in salmonid fish. The virus is an aquatic birnavirus.

The mortality of the affected fish varies considerably, depending on the species, age, physical conditions of the fish, but also on the virulence of viral strain (that is, capability to cause disease). The susceptibility to the virus generally decreases with age, and virus carrier fish with no disease symptoms are often found among fish surviving an outbreak. In such persistently infected fish, the virus can be found associated with leucocytes in blood and in head kidney and spleen, presumably in macrophages.

The apparent healthy virus carriers represent a potential risk for uncontrollable spread of the disease, including transmission of virus from parent to progeny, which still is regarded as uncertain in effect and importance.

Use of non-lethal diagnostic methods, such as blood sampling, to detect virus in the carriers has been presented as a potential method to screen brood fish pre-breeding.

There are 4 genera of salmonid fish in the US. There are a number of different trout species, all members of the salmonid family. Those genera are _ Oncorhynchus_, _Salmo_, _Salvelinus_, and _Thymallus_.

Many diseases, such as this one, are viewed very differently among the various state regulatory agencies.

Borrowing information from fellow Mod.AS: The following information on Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) is derived from chapter 2.2.3. of OIE's Diagnostic Manual for Aquatic Animal Diseases - 2000, where further information on its diagnostic procedures and an extensive reference list can be found: http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00020.htm.

IPN is a highly contagious viral disease of young fish of salmonid species held under intensive rearing conditions. The disease most characteristically occurs in rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), brown trout (_Salmo trutta_), Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), and several Pacific salmon species (_Oncorhynchus_spp).

Susceptibility generally decreases with age, with resistance to clinical disease in salmonid fish usually being reached at about 1500 degree-days (value obtained by multiplying the age in days by the average temperature in degrees centigrade during the lifespan), except for Atlantic salmon smolts, which can suffer from disease shortly after transfer from fresh water to seawater.

The 1st sign of an outbreak in salmonid fry is frequently a sudden and usually progressive increase in daily mortality, particularly in the faster-growing individuals. Clinical signs include darkening pigmentation, a pronounced distended abdomen, and a corkscrewing/spiral swimming motion. Cumulative mortalities may vary from less than 10 per cent to more than 90 per cent depending on a combination of several factors, such as virus strain and quantity, host, and environment.

The disease is transmitted both horizontally via the water route and vertically via the egg. Surface disinfection of eggs is not entirely effective in preventing vertical transmission.

The disease has a wide geographical distribution, occurring in most, if not all, major salmonid-farming countries of North and South America, Europe, and Asia. - Mod.TG/AS
