Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------

Sierra Leone
------------
As of 18:00 on 29 May 2014, 34 new cases (7 confirmed, 3 probable, and 24 suspected) and one suspected death were reported from 5 districts. This brings the cumulative total number of clinical cases of EVD to 50 (14 confirmed, 3 probable, and 33* suspected) including 6 deaths (2 confirmed, 3 probable, and 1 suspected). The geographical distribution of these cases and deaths are as follows: Kailahun (37 cases and 6 deaths), Kenema (1 case and 0 death), Koinadugu (1 case and 0 death), Bo (1 case and 0 death), Moyamba and (1 case and 0 death) [correct total here appears to be 41 cases - Mod.JW]

* On 2 Jun 2014 it was noted that this number was incorrect and it was changed from 36 to 33.

[2] Sierra Leone: Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium report
Date: Mon 2 Jun 2014
From: Pardis Sabeti <pardis@broadinstitute.org> [edited]


Please accept this report on behalf of Physician In-Charge of the VHF [Viral Hemorrhagic Fever] Program at Kenema Government Hospital, Dr S Humarr Khan, Director of the VHF Laboratory, Mr Augustine Goba, and Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, Dr Robert Garry for the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS), in collaboration with the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) and Metabiota.

Previously, 14 samples from Koindu in Kailahun District bordering the current Ebola virus disease (EVD) epicenter of Gueckedou, Guinea were confirmed to be positive for ebolavirus at the Lassa Laboratory at Kenema Government Hospital (KGH). All of these 1st 14 PCR positive cases are females who attended the burial of a traditional medicine practitioner (herbalist). The traditional medicine practitioner treated individuals with EVD from neighboring Guinea. Here, we provide an update on an additional 4 PCR positive EVD cases in Sierra Leone, and report on an EVD transmission chain and the ongoing activities of the KGH viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) Outreach team. The new cases bring the total to 18 PCR positive cases that have been recorded in Sierra Leone (numbers are subject to change); 7 patients, 3 from Koindu and 4 from Daru, have been transported to KGH with 2 deaths.

The 4 new positive patients represent the 1st cases in Sierra Leone of transmission from contacts of the index case, the Koindu traditional medicine practitioner. A sample from healthcare worker B (HCW-B; case 15) sent to KGH through Sierra Leone's district health network tested positive for ebolavirus on Saturday [31 May 2014]. On Sunday [1 Jun 2014] healthcare worker B (HCW-B; case 15) was admitted to the KGH VHF Ward. HCW-A attended one of the 14 confirmed cases from Koindu with exposure to ebolavirus at the funeral of the index case. HCW-A was on her way to self-admit to KGH via Kailahun and Daru when she became too sick to continue. HCW-A died with suspected EVD and major signs of acute kidney failure in Daru without a blood sample being taken. HCW-B attended HCW-A in Daru.

The KGH-MOHS outreach team supported by VHFC (Lansana Kanneh and Michael Gbakie) and Metabiota (James Bangura) collected 7 samples from additional contacts who attended HCW-A and HCW-B in Daru. These samples were transported to KGH by motorbike on Sunday [1 Jun 2014] afternoon. 3/8 are positive for ebolavirus by qPCR employing primers developed and verified by the USAMRIID Critical Reagents Program and performed by Dr Nadia Wauquier (Metabiota) on Sunday [1 Jun 2014] evening. Results were repeated this morning [2 Jun 2014] by RT-PCR by Mr Augustine Goba, Mr Mambu Mamoh and Mohammed Fullah (KGH-MOHS, with support from VHFC) using primers developed and verified in the field by VHFC (Dr Kristian Andersen and Stephen Gire, Harvard/Broad Institute and Dr Lina Moses, Tulane).

Ambulances were sent to Daru for pick-up and transport of the 3 positive cases (cases 16-18) this morning [2 Jun 2014] to the KGH VHF isolation ward. These cases include the 1st male EVD case in Sierra Leone, a community health officer (CHO). The KGH-MOHS VHF isolation ward receives support from VHFC (with funding from the United States National Institutes of Health), Metabiota, other funders and partners. In response to the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) provided an isolation tent and other supplies to the KGH VHF isolation ward.

The Sierra Leone MOHS under the leadership of Minister of Health, Hon. Miatta Kargbo, along with Dr Brima Kargbo (Chief Medical Officer), Dr Mohamed Vandi (Kenema District Medical Officer), Dr Amara Jambai (Director, Infection Control), Dr Donald Bash-Taqi (Director, Hospitals and Laboratories) are responding quickly and decisively to the public health threat of EVD in Sierra Leone. To date all samples for EVD diagnosis in Sierra Leone have been referred to the VHF Laboratory at KGH through Sierra Leone's district health network managed effectively by the MOHS.

On 30 May 2014 the MOHS team conducted a "training of trainers (ToT)" for approximately 120 HCW from Kailahun district in a day long training on EVD, and the results of this ToT are already evident in the current response. MOHS, VHFC, and Metabiota gratefully acknowledge and commend other partners and international teams, including those from MSF and WHO, currently engaged in the response to this outbreak.

[3] Contact quarantine
Date: Mon 2 Jun 2014
From: Daniel Bausch <dbausch@tulane.edu> [edited]

Re- contacts, from WHO:
http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-a%20lert-and-response/epr-highlights/3648-frequently-asked-questions-on-ebola-h%20emorrhagic-fever.html

Note at the end:
"Contacts
---------
As the primary mode of person-to-person transmission is contact with contaminated blood, secretions or body fluids, people who have had close physical contact with patients should be kept under strict surveillance. Their body temperature should be checked twice a day, with immediate hospitalization and strict isolation in case of the onset of fever."

Also, not to sound arrogant, but as someone who has spent a lot of time responding to filovirus outbreaks with both CDC and WHO (including in Guinea recently), I can assure you that isolation of asymptomatic persons is not the protocol. It's frankly difficult enough to isolate even the symptomatic persons.

[Adherence to WHO procedures would have avoided the unfortunate scenes at Koindu hospital in Sierra Leone -- see ProMED post 20140530.2510209.

To complement the acknowledgements from the VHFC above, ProMED understands that a special secure ambulance was paid for by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and delivered by Metabiota. AFRICOM [United States Africa Command] and many other people were also involved.

Cote d'Ivoire, which shares a border with Guinea, has had a preparedness plan in place since mid-April 2014, but has seen no cases so far. See http://reliefweb.int/map/c-te-divoire/c-te-divoire-ebola-virus-disease-evd-preparedness-19-apr-2014.
