Health leaders said the number of whooping cough cases is climbing in Southwest Georgia. Since January [2018], 3 cases have been confirmed in Thomas, Mitchell, and Colquitt Counties.

Monday [12 Mar 2018], the Southwest Health District said the entire region could be at risk for the disease if they are not vaccinated immediately. "We could walk around for a week thinking we have a cold or a sinus infection, and it could really be pertussis," said Rebecca Snow, District Immunization Coordinator. Snow said this is alarming because adults could have the whooping cough and spread it without knowing. "This could be in an infant, medically, or immune-comprised person; it could be pretty serious," said Snow.

"So far this year [2018], we've had 3 cases, one of which included a 5-month-old. The other 2 are associated with a 5-month-old," said Snow.

The Southwest District covers 14 counties, including Dougherty, Worth, Lee, and Terrell Counties. They are encouraging all residents to go to their local health department to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

[Southwest Georgia is a 14-county region in the U.S. state of Georgia. It has a 2010 census population of 496 433 and is the least populated region in Georgia, just slightly behind Southeast Georgia; additionally, the area has historically been the poorest region of the state since at least 1995, when over 25% of the residents were in poverty (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Georgia#Counties).

The city of Albany (population 77 434) is the most populous city and the region's sole metropolitan area. Southwest Georgia includes the following counties: Baker, Calhoun, Colquitt, Decatur, Dougherty, Early, Grady, Lee, Miller, Mitchell, Seminole, Terrell, Thomas, and Worth (http://www.southwestgeorgiapublichealth.org).

Yamhill County Public Health officials have confirmed 5 new cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, at Newberg High School, bringing the total to 7 since mid-January 2018.

According to Yamhill County Health and Human Services (HHS) Deputy Director Lindsey Manfrin, the situation is considered an outbreak per Oregon Health Authority investigative disease guidelines.

The Public Health arm of HHS shared the information with parents in a letter dated 26 Feb [2018], encouraging families to continue adhering to the precautions it has been recommending since notifying the community of the 1st confirmed case in early January [2018].

The 3 primary recommendations are to consult a health care provider if they or their children have symptoms of pertussis, to ensure families are up to date on their vaccinations and that pregnant women should receive the Tdap booster with every pregnancy to prevent infecting newborns after they are born.

The notification letter stated that people exposed to the infection could currently be symptomatic or become so between 4 to 21 days after close contact exposure. It also stated that close contact exposures did occur with members of the boys' basketball and wrestling teams.

For more information, call the Public Health office at 503-434-7525.

The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reported this week a community-wide outbreak of whooping cough in McKinley County.

As of 14 Mar 2018, NMDOH reports 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of whooping cough and an additional 15 probable cases. These cases have primarily occurred in school-aged children and their close household contacts.

Early diagnosis and treatment of potential cases and immediate reporting of cases to NMDOH for public health investigation and contact management will help in limiting more cases from occurring. Healthcare providers should be vigilant for possible additional cases among their patients, especially infants and caregivers of infants.

12 students have confirmed cases of whooping cough at 3 schools in Draper, officials said. Parents of Corner Canyon High School students were warned of an outbreak in late March [2018] after 5 students were diagnosed with the respiratory disease, according to Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp. Corner Canyon is now reporting 7 cases, Draper Park Middle School reports 2 cases, and Oak Hollow Elementary reports 3.

Parents of Corner Canyon High School students were notified Thursday [5 Apr 2018] by the Salt Lake County Health Department of an outbreak of whooping cough at the school. The letter directs people with cold symptoms to contact their health care providers.

Out of 2200 students at Corner Canyon High, 105 students are exempt from vaccination either because of parental choice or medical conditions, according to Rupp. 21 of 1491 students at Draper Park Middle School and 35 of 658 students at Oak Hollow Elementary are also vaccine-exempted. "As a health department, we support parental choice. We just have to remind those parents who make this particular choice that the ramifications may be that their student is not able to attend school. For pertussis, it is 21 days after the last student confirmed case is no longer symptomatic," Rupp said. The health department's medical officer has not recommended that any unvaccinated students remain at home during the outbreak, according to Rupp. Those seeking immunization can contact their health provider or call the Salt Lake County Health Department at 385-468-7468.

The surprising resurgence of whooping cough in the United States in recent years cannot be blamed on shortcomings in the current vaccine, a new study finds. Rather, incomplete coverage among children -- possibly fueled by the anti-vaccination movement -- is responsible for the pertussis increases, along with natural population turnover and slowly waning protection from the vaccine, researchers say.

In the study published online in Science Translational Medicine, the team found little evidence that the switch in the 1990s from the whole cell to the combined acellular pertussis vaccine contributed to the resurgence in whooping cough [1].

During the 1970s and 1980s, an average of 2000 to 3000 pertussis cases were reported annually, according to figures from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html].

In 2003, pertussis cases in the U.S. increased to more than 10 000 for the 1st time in almost 4 decades and have not dropped below this number since. In 2012, there were 48 277 reported cases, followed by 28 639, 32 971, 20 772, and 17 972 cases in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively.

The CDC recommends a series of 5 pertussis shots to be given before age 7, combined with the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines (DTaP), with a booster dose (Tdap) recommended around the age of 11. "The conventional wisdom has been that the current vaccine may not protect for very long, but we found strong evidence that this is not the case," study co-author Aaron King, PhD, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told MedPage Today. "A small fraction of people who get the vaccine appear to be capable of being infected again after a relatively short period of time. But this is such a small number that the overall efficacy of the vaccine is quite high."

The researchers employed disease-transition models and statistical analysis to examine 3 potential modes of failure: primary vaccine failure; failure in the duration in the waning of vaccine-induced protection with time and failure in the degree of protection, also known as vaccine "leakiness. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts," the researchers wrote. "Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity."

Specifically, the team examined age-stratified pertussis incidence data from Massachusetts from 1990 through 2005, which was before the introduction of the Tdap booster, employing statistical methods for extracting information from the data that could be generalized to the entire U.S. and to western Europe.

King explained that the introduction of the 1st pertussis vaccine in the late 1940s led to what the researchers refer to as a honeymoon period where very low disease incidence was seen. The analysis suggested that the resurgence of pertussis in recent decades signals the end of this honeymoon period.

Pertussis was a common, and deadly, childhood disease before the 1950s. But the combination of the introduction of the vaccine and natural immunity among a large percentage of adults who had the disease as children led to dramatic declines in incidence.

King said the cyclical increase in pertussis cases in recent decades does not support the idea that the vaccine is ineffective or that changes in the vaccine have contributed to the resurgence: "The roots of the resurgence go back 2 decades before the switch from the whole cell vaccine was made. What we are seeing is in part due to the fact that we are not vaccinating enough people and in part due to the decline in adults with naturally acquired immunity."

He said that even though protection from the pertussis vaccine gradually wanes over time, it lasts far longer than many in the field have suggested. "For 90% of people who get the vaccine, immunity is lasting longer than 10 years, and for over half, it is lasting an entire lifetime."

The finding that schoolchildren now represent a core transmission group has implications for public health efforts to address the pertussis resurgence, the researchers noted. "Efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults."

Abstract
-----------
The resurgence of pertussis over the past decades has resulted in incidence levels not witnessed in the United States since the 1950s. The underlying causes have been the subject of much speculation, with particular attention paid to the shortcomings of the latest generation of vaccines. We formulated transmission models comprising competing hypotheses regarding vaccine failure and challenged them to explain 16 years of highly resolved incidence data from Massachusetts, United States. Our results suggest that the resurgence of pertussis is a predictable consequence of incomplete historical coverage with an imperfect vaccine that confers slowly waning immunity. We found evidence that the vaccine itself is effective at reducing overall transmission, yet that routine vaccination alone would be insufficient for elimination of the disease. Our results indicated that the core transmission group is schoolchildren. Therefore, efforts aimed at curtailing transmission in the population at large, and especially in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed if targeted at schoolchildren, rather than adults. - Mod.ML]

The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:

The spokesperson for Prince of Wales Hospital made the following announcement today 13 Mar [2018]:

Three babies (2 male and one female, aged 28 days to 30 days) in a postnatal ward presented with respiratory symptoms since February 25 [2018]. Appropriate viral tests were arranged for the babies, and the test results were positive for _Bordetella pertussis_. Two of them have been discharged, while the remaining one is under isolation treatment with stable condition.

In accordance with prevailing infection control guidelines, the hospital has performed contact tracing, and no new cases were found. The hospital infection control team has discussed the matter with the Centre for Health Protection and the following enhanced infection control measures have been adopted:
- Thorough cleaning and disinfection of the cubicle concerned;
- Enhanced environmental hygiene in the ward; and
- Carrying out stringent infection control measures, including reminding families of babies and visitors to wear surgical masks and wash hands.

The cases have been reported to the Hospital Authority Head Office and the Centre for Health Protection for necessary follow-up. The hospital will continue to closely monitor the condition of patients in the ward.
