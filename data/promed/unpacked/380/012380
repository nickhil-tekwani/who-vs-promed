[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD cases remains
168. A total of 4 definite/probable patients are still alive so that
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases is now 172. So
far, only one fatality has been recorded in 2010.

Although 3 new deaths due to vCJD were recorded in 2009 and one death
so far in 2010, the overall picture is still consistent with the view
that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a
pronounced tail. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17
in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, one
in 2008, 3 in 2009, and one so far in 2010.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK so far in the year 2010
------------------------------------
During the 1st 3 months of 2010, there have been 39 referrals, 15
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one fatal case of vCJD, and none of
familial CJD, iatrogenic CJD, or GSS.

During the 1st 3 months of 2010, there were 452 referrals, 15
confirmed cases of sporadic CJD, one case of familial CJD, and no
cases of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

A total of 25 cases of confirmed or probable vCJD has now been
recorded in France since records began in 1992. There was 1 case in
1996, 1 in 2000, 1 in 2001, 3 in 2002, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, 2 in 2009, and none so far in 2010.

The 25 confirmed cases comprise 13 females and 12 males. All 25 are
now deceased. Their median age is 37 (between 19 and 58). Seven were
resident in the Ile-de-France and 18 in the provinces. All the
identified cases have been Met-Met homozygotes. No risk factor has
been identified. One of the 25 had made frequent visits to the United Kingdom.

[4] New form of prion disease - Science Daily

National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists (together with
scientists from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Lasswade,
Scotland) participating in a study investigating how prion diseases
destroy the brain have observed a new form of the disease in mice
that does not cause the sponge-like brain deterioration typically
seen in prion diseases. Instead, it resembles a form of human
Alzheimer's disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, that damages brain
arteries. The study results, reported by NIH scientists at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the
online journal PLoS Pathogens (see [6] below), are similar to
findings from 2 newly reported human cases of the prion disease
Gerstmann- Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS). This finding
represents a new mechanism of prion disease brain damage, according
to study author Bruce Chesebro, M.D., chief of the Laboratory of
Persistent Viral Diseases at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories.

Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, primarily damage the brain. Prion diseases include
mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle;
scrapie in sheep; sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), [familial
CJD], variant CJD and GSS in humans; and chronic wasting disease in
deer, elk and moose.

The role of a specific cell anchor for prion protein is at the crux
of the NIAID study. Normal prion protein uses a specific molecule,
glycophosphoinositol (GPI), to fasten to host cells in the brain and
other organs. In their study, the NIAID scientists genetically
removed the GPI anchor from study mice, preventing the prion protein
from fastening to cells and thereby enabling it to diffuse freely in
the fluid outside the cells.

The scientists then exposed those mice to infectious scrapie and
observed them for up to 500 days to see if they became sick. The
researchers documented signs typical of prion disease including
weight loss, lack of grooming, gait abnormalities and inactivity. But
when they examined the brain tissue, they did not observe the
sponge-like holes in and around nerve cells typical of prion disease.
Instead, the brains contained large accumulations of prion protein
plaques trapped outside blood vessels in a disease process known as
cerebral amyloid angiopathy, which damages arteries, veins and
capillaries in the brain. In addition, the normal pathway by which
fluid drains from the brain appeared to be blocked.

Their study, Dr. Chesebro says, indicates that prion diseases can be
divided into 2 groups: those with plaques that destroy brain blood
vessels and those without plaques that lead to the sponge-like damage
to nerve cells. Dr. Chesebro says the presence or absence of the
prion protein anchor appears to determine which form of disease develops.

The new mouse model used in the study and the 2 new human GSS cases,
which also lack the usual prion protein cell anchor, are the 1st to
show that in prion diseases, the plaque-associated damage to blood
vessels can occur without the sponge-like damage to the brain. If
scientists can find an inhibitor for the new form of prion disease,
they might be able to use the same inhibitor to treat similar types
of damage in Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Chesebro says.

Abstract:
Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative diseases of humans and
animals characterized by gray matter spongiosis and accumulation of
aggregated, misfolded, protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres).
PrPres can be deposited in brain in an amyloid-form and/or
non-amyloid form, and is derived from host-encoded protease-sensitive
PrP (PrPsen), a protein normally anchored to the plasma membrane by
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Previously, using heterozygous
transgenic mice expressing only anchorless PrP, we found that PrP
anchoring to the cell membrane was required for typical clinical
scrapie. However, in the present experiments, using homozygous
transgenic mice expressing 2-fold more anchorless PrP, scrapie
infection induced a new fatal disease with unique clinical signs and
altered neuropathology, compared to non-transgenic mice expressing
only anchored PrP. Brain tissue of transgenic mice had high amounts
of infectivity, and histopathology showed dense amyloid PrPres plaque
deposits without gray matter spongiosis. In contrast, infected
non-transgenic mice had diffuse non-amyloid PrPres deposits with
significant gray matter spongiosis. Brain graft studies suggested
that anchored PrPsen expression was required for gray matter
spongiosis during prion infection. Furthermore, electron and light
microscopic studies in infected transgenic mice demonstrated several
pathogenic processes not seen in typical prion disease, including
cerebral amyloid angiopathy and ultrastructural alterations in
perivascular neuropil. These findings were similar to certain human
familial prion diseases as well as to non-prion human
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Author Summary:
Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, are infectious fatal neurodegenerative diseases of
humans and animals. A major feature of prion diseases is the
refolding and aggregation of a normal host protein, prion protein
(PrP), into a disease-associated form which may contribute to brain
damage. In uninfected individuals, normal PrP is anchored to the
outer cell membrane by a sugar-phosphate-lipid linker molecule. In
the present report we show that prion infection of mice expressing
PrP lacking the anchor can result in a new type of fatal
neurodegenerative disease. This disease displays mechanisms of damage
to brain cells and brain blood vessels found in Alzheimer's disease
and in familial amyloid brain diseases. In contrast, the typical
sponge-like brain damage seen in prion diseases was not observed.
These results suggest that presence or absence of PrP membrane
anchoring can influence the type of neurodegeneration seen after
prion infection.

[This research indicates that prion diseases can now be divided into
2 groups: those with plaques that destroy brain blood vessels and
those without plaques that lead to the sponge-like damage to nerve
cells. Which form of disease develops depends on the presence or
absence of the anchor region of the prion protein. These findings may
open up new approaches to the study of other forms of
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. - Mod.CP]

Physician Discharge Summary, Parkland Hospital, Dallas Texas General
Neurology Team: General Neurology Team

A Hispanic female with no past medical history presented with 14
months of increasing/progressive altered mental status, generalized
weakness, inability to walk, loss of appetite, inability to speak,
tremor and bowel/bladder incontinence. She was in her usual state of
health up until February 2009, when her husband noted that she began
forgetting things like names and short term memories. He also noticed
mild/vague personality changes such as increased aggression. In March
[2009], she was involved in a hit-and-run motor vehicle accident,
although she was not injured. The police tracked her down and
ticketed her. At that time, her son deployed to Iraq with the Army
and her husband assumed her mentation changes were due to stress over
these 2 events. Also in March 2009, she began to have weakness in her
legs, making it difficult to walk. Over the next few months, her
mentation and personality changes worsened, getting to a point where
she could no longer recognize her children.
She was eating less and less. She was losing more weight. In the last
2-3 months, she reached the point where she could not walk without an
assist, then one month ago, she stopped talking, only making
grunting/aggressive sounds when anyone came near her. She also became
both bowel and bladder incontinent, having to wear diapers. Her
tremor and body jerks worsened, and her hands assumed a sort of
permanent grip position, leading her family to put tennis balls in
her hands to protect her fingers. The husband said that they had
lived in Nebraska for the past 21 years. They had seen a doctor there
during the summer time who prescribed her Seroquel and Lexapro,
thinking these were signs of a mood disorder. However, the
medications did not help, and she continued to deteriorate
clinically. Up until about 6 years ago, the patient worked at Tyson
foods, where she worked on the assembly line slaughtering cattle and
preparing them for packaging. She was exposed to brain and spinal
cord matter when she would euthanize the cattle. The husband says
that he does not know any fellow workers with a similar illness. He
also says that she did not have any preceding illness or travel. The
patient died at 38 years old on 6 Feb 2010 in Mesquite Texas.

[Terry S. Singeltary Sr. has added the following comment:

"According to the World Health Organisation, the future public health
threat of vCJD in the UK and Europe and potentially the rest of the
world is of concern and currently unquantifiable. However, the
possibility of a significant and geographically diverse vCJD epidemic
occurring over the next few decades cannot be dismissed
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2003/9241545887.pdf>. The key
word here is diverse. What does diverse mean? If USA scrapie
transmitted to USA bovine does not produce pathology as the UK c-BSE,
then why would CJD from there look like UK vCJD?"

Attention has been drawn to this case on account of the occupation of
the of the deceased patient and her prolonged exposure to cattle
brain and spinal cord tissue fragments. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) is a rare, degenerative, invariably fatal brain disorder. It
affects about one person in every one million people per year
worldwide; in the United States, there are about 200 cases per year.
CJD usually appears in later life and runs a rapid course. Typically,
onset of symptoms occurs about age 60, and about 90 percent of
patients die within one year. In the early stages of disease,
patients may have failing memory, behavioral changes, lack of
coordination and visual disturbances. As the illness progresses,
mental deterioration becomes pronounced, and involuntary movements,
blindness, weakness of extremities, and coma may occur. There are 3
major categories of CJD.

CJD cannot be transmitted through the air or through touching or most
other forms of casual contact. Spouses and other household members of
sporadic CJD patients have no higher risk of contracting the disease
than the general population. However, exposure to brain tissue and
spinal cord fluid from infected patients should be avoided to prevent
transmission of the disease through these materials. In some
situations, CJD has spread to other people from grafts of dura mater
(a tissue that covers the brain), transplanted corneas, implantation
of inadequately sterilized electrodes in the brain, and injections of
contaminated pituitary growth hormone derived from human pituitary
glands taken from cadavers (all usually designated as iatrogenic
cases). Since 1985, all human growth hormone used in the United
States has been synthesized by recombinant DNA procedures, which
eliminates the risk of transmitting CJD by this route.

The appearance of the new variant of CJD (nv-CJD or v-CJD) in several
younger than average people in Great Britain and France has led to
concern that BSE may be transmitted to humans through consumption of
contaminated beef. Although laboratory tests have shown a strong
similarity between the prions causing BSE and v-CJD, there is no
direct proof to support this theory.

Nonetheless, the occupation of the deceased patient in Texas has
raised concerns regarding the origin of this woman's illness, and
further investigation is merited. - Mod.CP]
