[1] Cholera - Somalia (southern)

A cholera epidemic is spreading in southern Somalia, causing an alarming number of children and elderly to travel to Mogadishu for treatment, Banadir Maternity and Children's Hospital (BMCH) officials say. BMCH has been receiving hundreds of cases of cholera from Mogadishu, Kismayo, and towns in the Middle and Lower Shabelle regions in southern Somalia.

The Somali Ministry of Health says the rainy season in Mogadishu and the southern areas has exacerbated the spread of the disease.

Duniya Khalif, a nurse at BMCH, told Sabahi that children and elderly people are affected most acutely from the effects of the disease. "People come here for free treatment, which is offered by the state-run Banadir Hospital in collaboration with humanitarian organisations from Kuwait, Germany, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey," Khalif said. "We are currently seeking solutions to stop the spread of this disease and trying to prevent its recurrence in the capital so we can eradicate it. We will conduct health-awareness campaigns for citizens through the local media and leaflets that we will soon publish."

The Sudan office of the Kuwait Patients Helping Fund Society has been running the diarrhea section at BMCH for the past year. It said there has been a sharp increase in the number of fatal cases of cholera. Sudanese pediatrician Ibrahim Osman Mohamed said 2000 patients suffering from diarrhoea and malnutrition have been admitted to BMCH in the past 3 months. He said the hospital treated 1057 such cases in June 2011.

Mohamed said many people die from cholera because they do not receive treatment in the early stages of the disease. "We received 12 [bodies] that reached us too late due to lack of transportation and security issues since there is a curfew in Mogadishu that bans vehicles on the streets an hour after sunset," he told Sabahi. "24 children and several elderly women died in the past 3 weeks because the disease had reached a late stage, and they were totally dehydrated and lost all minerals and fluids in their bodies, resulting in kidney failure."

Mohamed says he sees 57 patients daily, including children under 5 years old who suffer from severe diarrhea. He said health conditions are likely to worsen over the next several weeks unless the international community intervenes in Kismayo and other southern towns, where residents rely on the Juba and Shabelle rivers for drinking water and there are no water treatment and desalination plants to remove contaminants.

The WHO says the number of cholera cases registered among internally displaced persons in Mogadishu is worrying due to food and water shortages. "Cholera cases have doubled and tripled since 2011, which is why we can say there is a cholera epidemic," said WHO staff member Michael Yao, adding that 4272 cases of severe diarrhea have been registered so far in 2012 at the Banadir Hospital, most of which are children under 5, resulting in 181 deaths.

"The movement of people has increased the danger of spreading the disease to more areas," Yao said.

[2] Cholera - Malaysia (Borneo)

Minister of Local Government and Community Development Dato Sri Wong Soon Koh yesterday, 26 Jul 2012, confirmed that there is a cholera outbreak in Bintulu. Speaking to reporters after a briefing by officers from the state Health Department at his office, he said the department detected the outbreak on 14 Jul 2012 after a case was confirmed positive with _Vibrio cholerae_.

"Since 14 Jul 2012, the state Health Department declared there is an outbreak detected in Bintulu. Since then, the state Health Department initiated its investigation to trace all the suspected symptomatic cases. Anyone coming down with diarrhea and vomiting will be investigated to check whether it is cholera or not," he added.

Based on investigation by the department, the outbreak was believed to have started when 3 groups of regatta participants from Rumah Gawan, Kampung Jepak and Kampung Hilir in Sebauh, Bintulu used water from the Kemena River to wash plates, fish, and their hands.

"The bacteria from the river had contaminated the food and the hands of the people during the regatta and then continuously spread from person to person and contaminated food and drinks. Now the state Health Department is also suspecting that it is spread from Ramadan Bazaar due to contaminated food and drinks," he added.

He noted that as of yesterday, 26 Jul 2012, the department had received 140 cases: 33 positive for cholera; 55 negative; and 52 cases still pending result. The youngest patient was one year 11 months old, while the oldest was 84 years old. The department also detected 9 cases with _Vibrio cholerae_ but without any symptom.

On the outbreak, Wong said it was still spreading in Bintulu with 11 localities declared positive for cholera; Rumah Panjang Gawan at Sungai Sebauh, Kampung Jepak, Kampung Sebauh Hilir in Sebauh, Rumah Usah in Sungai Segan, Setinggan Mozako, Kampung Assyikirin, Kampung Sinong in Jalan Masjid, Setinggan Hock Peng Tanjung Kidurong, Batu 10, Jalan Bintulu/Miri, Kampung Baru, and Kirana Palm Oil/Brightwood Quarters, Kemena Industrial Estate.

At least 117 gastroenteritis patients were admitted to the Civil Hospital at Dasuya in Punjab where spread of cholera and gastroenteritis cases was reported in some districts. Senior Medical Officer of the Civil Hospital Dr Naresh Kansra said the number of gastroenteritis patients in the hospital had increased to 117 today from 79 on 26 Jul 2012. A 2-year-old child in a critical condition was referred to the Institute of Medical Sciences, Jalandhar, the SMO said. Meanwhile, 64 of the admitted patients had been discharged today [27 Jul 2012], Kansra said, adding that 3 mobile teams of medical staff were attending to the patients in the hospital.

Meanwhile, the Municipal Council (MC) had replaced the leaking water supply pipes which were considered to be the main cause for spread of gastroenteritis. The MC was also supplying potable water through water tankers in the area as a precautionary measure, officials said. Dr Sardul Singh, SMO Civil Hospital here at Hoshiarpur, said that out of 10 seized water samples from the hospital wards, 9 were found un-potable. Out of 4 stool samples collected, he said, the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium was confirmed in 2 of them. Cholera had claimed the lives of 3 persons in Patiala district of Punjab recently.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating a confirmed case of cholera and reminds people to observe good personal, food, and environmental hygiene, whether in Hong Kong or travelling abroad.

The case involves a 62-year-old woman who developed diarrhea since 20 Jul 2012. She sought medical consultation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on 24 Jul 2012 and was discharged on the next day.

Laboratory tests today [28 Jul 2012] showed that culture of her stool specimen yielded _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa. She was admitted to the isolation ward of Queen Elizabeth Hospital today and is now in stable condition.

The CHP's investigation revealed that the patient had travelled to India between 14 Jun 2012 and 19 Jul 2012. She lives in Kowloon City, and her home contact has no symptoms of cholera.

This is the 1st case of cholera reported in 2012. There were 2 cholera cases in 2011, 9 cases in 2010, and none in 2009.

A CHP spokesman said: "Whether in Hong Kong or travelling abroad, people should pay attention to hygiene and take measures to prevent cholera and food-borne infection."
