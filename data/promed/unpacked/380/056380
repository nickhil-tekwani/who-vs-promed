Chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne disease [virus], struck a village on Batan Island of the town of Rapu-Rapu in Albay [province, Bicol Region], afflicting some 83 villagers, Albay Gov Joey Salceda said Monday [1 Oct 2012]. Salceda said he has directed Dr Luis Mendoza, the provincial health officer, to check on the reported sudden rise of the chikungunya fever cases over the last 3 weeks in Barangay San Ramon, Batan [Rapu-Rapu municipality].

Chikungunya fever is similar to dengue but is milder in form and without bleeding. Symptoms include on and off fever, rashes and muscle and body pains [often with severe joint pain. - Mod.TY], according to the Department of Health.

The governor said municipal health employees reported that the cases of the mosquito-borne disease in the Barangay San Ramon stood at 70 in the middle of September [2012] and surged to 83 cases by the end of the month.

Batan is one of the 3 islands under the town of Rapu-Rapu. The others are Guinanayan and Rapu-Rapu, where the town center is situated. Batan is only accessible by boat and is about 3 hours by boat from this city.

Salceda said he also directed the provincial health office to closely coordinate with the municipal health office employees due to the absence of a full time municipal doctor in the area. He said a PHO epidemiology surveillance team would start gathering laboratory examinations specimens from the patients that would be sent brought to the Department of Health (DOH) in Bicol, located in this city, for analysis.

Mendoza, who went to Batan with a team of medical personnel, brought along medicines to treat the patients that fell ill of chikungunya fever.

[It is not clear if these cases are laboratory confirmed or suspected cases of chikungunya virus infection based on clinical signs. Severe arthralgia, not mentioned in the report above, can persist in individuals weeks or months following the acute phase of the infection. There have been sporadic epidemics of chikungunya virus infections in the Philippines in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985 to 1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120929.1315954).
