Hansen's disease is the preferred terminology in the USA.

The national figures have shown fewer cases in recent years. [CDC's]MMWR
reported 93 cases in 2003 and 82 cases in 2004. The disease is not
reportable in all states, so there may be a few more.

It is hard to understand why 7 to 10 days are needed to confirm the
diagnosis. While the disease is often misdiagnosed, once it is
suspected, a competent dermatopathologist should be able to confirm
the diagnosis.

Isolation is generally not used for patients with Hansen's disease in
the USA. While there are differences of opinion with regard to the
degree of contagiousness, most people have natural immunity, and the
institution of antimicrobial therapy quickly reduces the risk of
transmission.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Frankel for his comments.

Where the inmate spent his life from youth to incarceration is not
stated. The Levis and Ernst chapter referenced below (1) reports
that in 2002, WHO reported over 600 000 new cases of leprosy, also
called Hansen's disease (which as Dr. Frankel states is the preferred
terminology), with the largest number of cases originating in South
Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar). Africa and the Americas
each reported about 40 000 new cases, with most of the Americas cases
from Brazil.

Levis and Ernst also note that _Mycobacterium leprae_ was the 1st
bacterium to be associated with a disease. The Norwegian Armauer
Hansen discovered the organism in 1874 just prior to Koch's discovery
of the the tubercle bacillus. The inability to cultivate _M. leprae_
on artificial media (which persists today) allowed Koch to be
credited with the discovery opening the germ theory of disease.

In the USA, _M. leprae_ is known to have been transmitted in several
states: Louisiana, Texas, Hawaii, and possibly California. 2 cases
have been reported, however, in residents of the eastern USA who had
no obvious history of relevant travel or exposure (2).
