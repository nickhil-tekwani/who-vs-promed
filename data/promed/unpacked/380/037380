Outbreak 1 (Uru_leishmania_001): Barrio Brazo Oriental, 13, Montevideo
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Oct 2011
Outbreak status: resolved (29 Dec 2011)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a 5 year old Labrador female dog in a private residence. She was brought to a veterinary clinic after having showed skin problems and polyarthritis. A dermatologist recommended a skin biopsy following a suspicion of leishmaniasis.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: the sick dog was introduced in the country late December 2007 from a country of the region where leishmaniasis is endemic. In early January 2008, she returned to her country of origin and came back at the end of the same year. She lives in Montevideo since her introduction into the country. There are no other animals in the residence. As control measures, a repellent (imidacloprid 5.15 per cent and permethrin 40) is applied every 30 days; also, it is prohibited to move her out the house. It is worth noting that in 2010 following an entomological investigation the presence of vectors of visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed in 2 departments in the north of the country. After this finding, a serological sampling was carried out in dogs living in these areas and no positive animals were found.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: The disease had already been reported by the Veterinary Services as suspected since 2009.

[The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

Since 2009, the disease has been reported in surrounding countries including Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. Paraguay was the only country providing quantitative data and it had 17 outbreaks in 2011 and 4 in 2010. In 2009, the disease was reported but not with outbreak counts.

It is important to remember that leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease of significant public health importance and it can become established in previously free dog populations as has occurred in the last decade in the United States.
