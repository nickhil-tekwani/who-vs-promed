A total of 4 people have been put in an isolation ward at Mt Kenya Hospital Nyeri after been suspected to be infected with anthrax. Nyeri Central sub-county commissioner John Marete said the 2 brothers and their 2 neighbours from Thunguma village are reported to have eaten uninspected meat in Ruiru, Kiambu County before travelling to Nyeri on [Fri 8 Dec 2017].

Mr Marete confirmed that the patients presented themselves at Nyeri Referral Hospital on [Sat 9 Dec 2017] morning and were immediately transferred to the health facility after screening. "They went to the county hospital in the morning and were immediately transferred to Mt Kenya hospital. They are receiving treatment at an isolation room since Anthrax is a contagious disease," said Mr Marete.

He added that public health officers have been mobilized and dispatched to the village to assess the situation and investigate if there could be other possible cases. "We want to find out how they contaminated the disease and if there could be other possible victims who are yet to present themselves in hospital. The medics are controlling the homestead," he noted.

The commissioner however assured the public that the situation is under control.

[In [Mon 8 May 2017] abattoir workers were treated for anthrax, presumably cutaneous anthrax. The source was not clear. This outbreak reflects the ongoing anthrax situation in the area. And in my experience veterinary officers are better at tracking sources of livestock disease and initiating the necessary retroactive vaccination programme. And then planning the necessary control and surveilance to prevent future outbreaks.

Anthrax is an infectious disease but it is effectively non-contagious. Normal precautions for any infectious condition are adequate in such circumstances, especially if it is cutaneous anthrax which is suggested in this report.
