CDC announces 1st case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection (MERS) in the United States
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MERS case in traveler from Saudi Arabia hospitalized in Indiana
---------------------------------------------------------------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was confirmed today [2 May 2014] in a traveler to the United States. This virus is relatively new to humans and was 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

"We've anticipated MERS reaching the US, and we've prepared for and are taking swift action," said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. "We're doing everything possible with hospital, local, and state health officials to find people who may have had contact with this person so they can be evaluated as appropriate. This case reminds us that we are all connected by the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the water we drink. We can break the chain of transmission in this case through focused efforts here and abroad."

On [24 Apr 2014], the patient traveled by plane from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia to London, England then from London to Chicago, Illinois. The patient then took a bus from Chicago to Indiana. On [27 Apr 2014], the patient began to experience respiratory symptoms, including shortness of breath, coughing, and fever. The patient went to an emergency department in an Indiana hospital on [28 Apr 2014] and was admitted on that same day. The patient is being well cared for and is isolated; the patient is currently in stable condition. Because of the patient's symptoms and travel history, Indiana public health officials tested for MERS-CoV. The Indiana state public health laboratory and CDC confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the patient this afternoon [2 May 2014].

"It is understandable that some may be concerned about this situation, but this 1st U.S. case of MERS-CoV infection represents a very low risk to the general public," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general and director of CDC's National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person through close contact, such as caring for or living with an infected person. However, there is currently no evidence of sustained spread of MERS-CoV in community settings.

CDC and Indiana health officials are not yet sure how the patient became infected with the virus. Exposure may have occurred in Saudi Arabia, where outbreaks of MERS-CoV infection are occurring. Officials also do not know exactly how many people have had close contact with the patient.

So far, including this U.S. importation, there have been 401 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in 12 countries. To date [2 May 2014], all reported cases have originated in 6 countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Most of these people developed severe acute respiratory illness, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath; 93 people died. Officials do not know where the virus came from or exactly how it spreads. There is no available vaccine or specific treatment recommended for the virus.

"In this interconnected world we live in, we expected MERS-CoV to make its way to the United States," said Dr. Tom Frieden, Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We have been preparing since 2012 for this possibility."

Federal, state, and local health officials are taking action to minimize the risk of spread of the virus. The Indiana hospital is using full precautions to avoid exposure within the hospital and among healthcare professionals and other people interacting with the patient, as recommended by CDC.

In July 2013, CDC posted checklists and resource lists for healthcare facilities and providers to assist with preparing to implement infection control precautions for MERS-CoV.

As part of the prevention and control measures, officials are reaching out to close contacts to provide guidance about monitoring their health.

While experts do not yet know exactly how this virus is spread, CDC advises Americans to help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by washing hands often, avoiding close contact with people who are sick, avoid touching their eyes, nose and/or mouth with unwashed hands, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.

The largest reported outbreak to date occurred April through May 2013 in eastern Saudi Arabia and involved 23 confirmed cases in 4 healthcare facilities. At this time, CDC does not recommend anyone change their travel plans. The World Health Organization also has not issued Travel Health Warnings for any country related to MERS-CoV. Anyone who develops fever and cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after traveling from countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula should see their doctor and let him or her know where they travelled.

[2] Media report

The 1st U.S. case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus has been reported in Indiana, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday [2 May 2014].

The patient is a health-care provider who recently traveled to Saudi Arabia to provide health care, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The person, an American male, traveled on [24 Apr 2014] from Riyadh to London, then to Chicago, and took a bus to Indiana, officials said.

The patient is in an Indiana hospital, has been isolated and is in stable condition, she said. He was receiving oxygen support, but was not on a ventilator.

The virus poses a "very low risk to the broader general public," Schuchat said, as it has not been shown to spread easily from person to person.

The CDC and the Indiana State Department of Health are conducting a joint investigation into the case, according to a CDC statement. The CDC confirmed Indiana test results on Friday [2 May 2014].

The coronavirus, known as MERS-CoV, was 1st reported in the Middle East -- specifically, the Arabian Peninsula -- in 2012.

Laboratory testing has confirmed 262 cases of the coronavirus in 12 countries, including the Indiana case, Schuchat said; 93 people have died.

So far, all MERS cases have been linked to 6 countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula, Schuchat said.

The Saudi Ministry of Health has reported 339 cases, and said nearly a 3rd of those have died. Not all of the Saudi cases have been confirmed by the World Health Organization. Late last month [April 2014], Saudi officials noted a spike in new cases.

The CDC has expected MERS to come to the United States, Schuchat said. "We have been preparing for this." However, "The introduction of MERS-CoV is another reminder that diseases are just a plane ride away," she said.

MERS-CoV comes from the same group of viruses as the common cold and attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms, which include fever, cough and shortness of breath, can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.

No one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence is emerging implicating camels. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from 2 single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. The same group of researchers reported in February [2014] that nearly 3/4ths of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus.

Although many of the cases have occurred on the Arabian Peninsula, people have died of the infection elsewhere, including in European countries and Tunisia in North Africa. Egypt reported its 1st case on [26 Apr 2014], according to the WHO. Limited human-to-human transmission of the disease has also occurred in other countries -- meaning some people who traveled to the Middle East gave the virus to others. Officials are not aware of any other confirmed U.S. cases, Schuchat said, adding it's too early to assume no one else is ill. An active investigation is underway.

[Given the global village that we live in where microbes can travel, combined with the recent increase in transmission of the MERS-CoV in both Saudi Arabia and the UAE, it is not surprising there is an imported case in the United States. In the past few weeks there have been imported cases into Malaysia, Greece and Egypt, and it would not be surprising if other countries identified MERS-CoV infected individuals returning from the Middle East.

If transmission does not efficiently occur prior to the onset of symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea), then the probability of secondary cases amongst individuals who travelled in the same transport mode (plane, bus) near to this individual is low. That being said, there haven't been sufficient studies to date addressing the natural behavior of this organism. Information on possible high risk exposures of this individual was not mentioned in the above report, although there are some suggestions that there may have been exposure in the clinical (hospital environment) as this individual is stated to be a health care provider who went to Saudi Arabia to provide health care (see the media report in [2]).

We await further information on the findings of the epidemiologic and laboratory investigations surrounding this case.
