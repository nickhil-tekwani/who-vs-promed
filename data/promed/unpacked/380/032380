The health status of the infected people in Abdelkader Hassani
Hospital in Sidi Bel Abbes province is quite like Hantaan virus
[hantavirus] symptoms, spreading in the early 30s in Asia and Eastern
Europe as a result of poverty in prevailing in Central Asia and a set
of Eastern European countries then, a medical source told El Khabar.
According to the sources, the virus hits peasants living in rural
areas carried by the striped field mouse who contaminate men through
the air or water. Hantaan virus infectious disease symptoms,
characterised mainly by fever and renal failure, are quite like those
hitting Sidi Bel Abbes province citizens.
The Sidi Bel Abbes Health director [refused to give details on the
nature and the origin of this contagion, insisting on the] need to
wait for the final results of medical tests done on 12 Aug 2007, the
date on which the 1st case was reported.
