Colorado River Gastroenteritis Caused by a Norwalk-like virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials have tentatively identified the cause of a
gastrointestinal illness reported by rafters on the Colorado River as a
[Norwalk-like] virus. [The type species of the virus genus "Norwalk-like
viruses", Norwalk virus, was so named because it was first discovered in
Norwalk, Ohio - Mod.CP]. A Norwalk-like virus appears to be the culprit
in the Colorado River outbreak first reported by river guides under a new
rapid reporting system developed after similar outbreaks in 1994 and 2000,
National Park Service spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said on Thu 20 Jun 2002.
Norwalk-like viruses are the most common cause of gastrointestinal illness
in the United States. The virus is easily spread through person-to-person
contact or inadequate sanitation.

Between 1 Jun and 14 Jun 2002, a total of 51 rafters and one hiker in the
Grand Canyon had reported diarrhea and vomiting lasting one to two days.
The number of people with the virus was reduced from 59 after a review of
the cases [see: Gastroenteritis, rafters - USA (Grand Canyon) 20020618.4530].

One problem in pinpointing the exact cause of the outbreak is its symptoms
that are similar to heat exhaustion, Oltrogge said. Two separate medical
evacuations were conducted for people suffering from symptoms similar to
those associated with Norwalk-like virus infection, but caused by
dehydration. Scientists analyzed a single specimen obtained from a portable
toilet used by one of the river-running groups to confirm it was a [sic]
virus. Additional specimens from other affected river groups and
individuals who have suffered from illnesses with the same symptoms are
being analyzed.
