Danger posed by viroid potentially infecting crops
--------------------------------------------------
The threat of hop stunt viroid (HSVd) infecting the UK crop is "a very serious issue", according to the head of the British Hop Association.

[A] hop grower said: "We have requested that plant health passports and phytosanitary certificates are changed to ensure that plant material coming here is free of HSVd."

Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] is carrying out a rapid pest-risk analysis to establish the nature and severity of the threat before introducing control measures. HSVd is already widely distributed globally, including on continental Europe.

[_Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd) is the only species of genus _Hostuviroid_ (family _Pospiviroidae_). It was first described in the 1940s as the causal agent of hop stunt disease in Japan. Since then it has been found worldwide infecting a wide range of both woody and herbaceous plants including citrus, stone fruit species, grapevine, and pomegranate with symptoms ranging from latent to severe in different hosts. Specific sequence variants have been isolated from hop, almond, apricot, citrus, cucumber, grapevine, peach, pear, and plum. Economically important diseases caused by different strains of HSVd include hop stunt, citrus cachexia, cucumber pale fruit, peach dapple, and plum dapple.

Three major phylogenetic groups have been suggested, namely plum-type, hop-type, and citrus-type isolates. Recombinants of these have also been identified. HSVd strains can vary between ca. 297 (hop and grapevine strains) and 303 nucleotides (cucumber strain). HSVd susceptibility may vary widely between host species and cultivars.

Hop stunt disease is caused by the specific hop strains of HSVd, which have been reported to be very variable. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stunting, and loss of plant vigour leading to yield losses. Infection also alters biochemical compounds within the plant that are responsible for flavour development during brewing. The disease was confined to Japan and North Korea, but in 2004 it was discovered in the USA and in 2007 in China. In Europe, hop stunt disease was reported for the 1st time in 2012 from Slovenia (see ProMED-mail post 20120416.1102364). While the hop disease is still restricted to few areas worldwide, HSVd-associated diseases of grapevine, citrus, and stone fruit are much more widespread, and a grapevine origin of the viroid has been suggested (see link below).

Like most viroids, HSVd can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants or cuttings. Disease management may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.

From the report above it appears that HSVd has not been detected in the UK so far on any host. Therefore the call for quarantine measures is definitely warranted and hopefully in time to prevent introductions into the country and damage to national crops.
