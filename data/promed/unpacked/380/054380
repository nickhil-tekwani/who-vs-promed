[This FMD serotype O virus has been, reportedly, spreading throughout China
since the beginning of 2010, affecting swine, bovines (cattle and
buffaloes), and small ruminants (sheep and goats); see map of all reported
foci at <http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988>.

The causative agent, FMDV serotype O, SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage,
initially identified in Thailand and Malaysia, has been identified during
2010 in PR China (Hong Kong SAR), Mongolia, Republic of Korea, Japan, and
Russia (adjacent to China and Mongolia).

According to China's reports to the OIE (an initial notification submitted
on 1 Mar 2010 and 16 follow up reports so far), no vaccination is allowed
while stamping-out policy is applied. The accumulated number of culled
animals includes, as of 9 Oct 2010, 9545 swine in 10 locations, 509 cattle
in 5 locations, and 817 sheep/goats in 3 locations. In addition, 8328
susceptible animals of unspecified species were culled as precautionary
measure in 2 counties neighboring an outbreak (follow up report no 9).

Since this virus is obviously pathogenic to ruminants, refraining from
vaccinating these animals is rather risky, particularly when related to
dairy cattle. More information on the Chinese vaccination policy and its
considerations will be helpful. - Mod.AS
