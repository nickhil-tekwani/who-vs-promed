India: Jaundice back in Jankipuram, claims 3 lives
-----------------------------------------------
Jaundice is back in Jankipuram. This time it is backed by diarrhea
and vomiting. The outbreak has already claimed 3 lives in Ashraynagar
of Sector J. The health department has so far confirmed 2 deaths.
More than 2 dozen patients were undergoing treatment at different
private nursing homes and Bhaorao Devras Hospital. Naresh Kumar of
the locality told the Times of India on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007] that
the outbreak has claimed 3 lives.
Locals attributed the recent spread of disease to a contaminated
water supply. An emergency medical officer at Bhaorao Devras Hospital
said that 6 patients from the locality were admitted to the hospital
on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007]. Chief medical officer Dr KK Singh described
the situation as serious. "We have opened a camp office in the area.
Medicines and chlorine tablets were distributed among the residents," he said.
A team of doctors blamed unhygienic living conditions coupled with
poor sanitation for the outbreak.

[Jankipuram is a district of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar
Pradesh, the most populated of the Indian states. There have been
past episodes of contamination of water supplies and consequent
outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease. In this outbreak in
Jankipuram, the clinical diagnosis of jaundice and the suggestion of
water-supply contamination suggest that the etiologic agent involved
may be hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus, or even leptospiral in
nature. Hepatitis A virus infection does not often result in death,
but hepatitis E virus infection can be fatal. In Nepal to the north,
hepatitis E virus infection has been a recurrent problem (see
ProMED-mail references below). Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
