Kosovo: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever awareness
-------------------------------------------------
Kosovo is experiencing a cyclical outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF), which is endemic to this area. From 26 Apr to 9 Jun 2010 the
National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo (NIPH) has reported a total
of 75 hospitalizations, including 4 deaths, due to CCHF.

There is no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.
People living in endemic regions should avoid areas where there are many
ticks, particularly in the spring and summer. The following safety
precautions are recommended:

- wear light-colored clothing that covers legs and arms;
- if living in infested area, check whole body regularly for ticks; remove
ticks gently but promptly;
- examine clothes regularly for ticks;
- use tick repellents on skin and clothing;
- tuck trousers into socks and keep sleeves rolled down;
- clean areas where food is prepared or served well so as not to leave food
pieces;
- maintain neatness and cleanliness;
- keep pet areas clean and sanitized; and
- check your pets frequently for fleas and ticks, and use flea & tick
collars and shampoos.

CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate.
Fortunately, human illness occurs infrequently. The disease may be more
frequent in local livestock. Ticks may act as a vector between the animal
and humans. The victims of this outbreak have been from rural areas, and
urban areas are typically spared. The cases have been reported from
Malisheve/Malisevo municipality (11 cases), Rahovec/Orahovac municipality
(3 cases), Theranda/Suva Reka municipality (one case), Hani i Elezit/Elez
Han municipality (one case), and Gjakove/Dakovica municipality (one case),
as well as one case from northern Albania.

The NIPH advises there is nothing unusual about this particular outbreak
and the unfortunate loss of life associated with this illness. Outbreaks of
CCHF typically occur at this time of year and often result in a number of
deaths. According to NIPH the areas of highest incidence are rural areas.

A map showing areas of Kosovo where the outbreaks are occurring is attached
to this Warden Message
<https://www.osac.gov/Reports/report.cfm?contentID=118367>, as are
instructions from the United State Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention website on how to remove ticks
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/lyme/Prevention/ld_Prevention_Avoid.htm>.

Signs and symptoms of the disease include: sudden onset of high fever,
headache, backache, and abdominal pain; small hemorrhages of the eyes; and
a type of rash in the mouth and on the trunk of the body.

reported in the previous ProMED-mail report on Wed 9 Jun 2010, but this
