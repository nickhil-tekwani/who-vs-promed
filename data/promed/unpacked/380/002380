Pets in the Eastern Cape will receive free 6-month rabies
vaccinations following the deaths of 2 people and 7 cattle in Mount
Ayliff, the department of agriculture said on Wednesday [17 Sep 2008].

"We have decided to launch a rabies awareness campaign at Cabanza
Village, where 2 villagers were confirmed to be killed by rabies
infection," said Veterinary services head Luba Mrwebi. "The 7 cattle
which died in the area were also confirmed to have been infected with
rabies [virus]."

He said veterinary services would, from 15 to 21 Sep 2008, target
schools where children and the community would be educated on the
dangers of rabies. "The rabies awareness launch would be followed by
free mass vaccination of animals throughout the province. ...
Domestic animals acquired rabies from wild animals, and humans
contract rabies through dog bites," Mrwebi said.

He also warned communities in the area to take precautionary measures
and protect themselves against rabies infection because "rabies is a
deadly disease. Those who have sustained dog bites should immediately
seek treatment at the nearest clinic and follow the full treatment course."

Communities in the province were urged to take their pet animals for
the free vaccinations, which would be performed by the department.
Veterinary technicians would be dispatched to the various localities
where they would man designated spots, said Mrwebi.

[Rabies is endemic in South Africa, and reports in ProMED-mail have
originated most frequently from Eastern Cape province. It is presumed
that the 2 most recent deaths were a consequence of bites by rabid
dogs, in view of the emphasis on vaccination of pet animals.
