Clarification regarding Glanders
Glanders was eliminated from the United States in the 1940s according to
100 Years of Animal Health: 1884-1984, pg. 44, The Associates of the
National Agricultural Library, Inc. 1987.
The causative agent of glanders, _Burkholderia mallei_, (formerly called
_Pseudomonas mallei_), "...is sensitive to many antimicrobials.... (in
horses)" according to Foreign Animal Diseases, 1998, United States Animal
Health Association, p. 250.
The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 1995, p. 300-301, ed. Abram
Benenson, states that "...the most effective agent is TMP-SMX. A favorable
outcome may be expected in most subacute and chronic cases."
