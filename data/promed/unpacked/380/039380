High tick activity in Southern Germany
-----------------------------------
According to several results of tick sampling studies from different places in Southern Germany, numbers of ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) are again at a record level. More than 520 nymphs per 90 minutes sampling activity had been collected during a standardized tick-sampling activity in May this year [2020]. Comparative tick sampling from 2009 to 2017 in the same location gave an average of 242 tick nymphs in May [2020]. Since 2018, extremely high nymphal numbers are recorded from the studied locations with more than 520 ticks per sampling activity in May [2020]. This year (2020) is the 3rd year with consecutive record tick numbers. These high tick numbers have not been observed during the last 9 years, when systematic tick sampling had been started.

In addition, in 2020 in the studied areas, a 3-fold increase of adult ticks in comparison to last year [2019] was observed. In some TBE natural foci even higher absolute numbers of adult ticks than nymphal ticks are found.

This increase in the numbers of adult ticks may have an impact on the risk of infection by tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus. Adult ticks have a 5-10 times higher virus prevalence as nymphal ticks. Therefore, we estimate a higher risk of infection for TBE for this year [2020] in comparison to the years before. This predicted risk assessment seems to be confirmed by the sampling results. So far, 18 tick pools have been tested positive for TBE virus, while at the same time last year [2019] only 5 positive tick pools had been detected. Comparative high tick activities were also found in other regions of Germany and some bordering areas in Austria, Switzerland, and France.

The record tick numbers and change in relation of tick stages with high TBE prevalence rates in ticks impose a much higher risk of TBE infection in inhabitants and visitors of TBE endemic risk areas.

[Occurrence of human TBE cases in Germany and neighboring countries is of significant public health concern, hence, the value of a reliable surveillance of tick population abundance in the coming transmission season. The increase in tick populations, with the associated risk of TBE transmission, calls for public education in order to avoid tick bites. Although the above report does not indicate why tick numbers are high this year (2020), an earlier report from Dr Dobler hypothesized that _I. ricinus_ density is triggered by (1) the fructification of the European beech 2 years before (an important food source for host rodents), (2) the mean annual temperature of the previous year, and (3) the current mean winter temperature (December-February), as a forecast of the annual nymphal tick density.

Although _I. ricinus_ is the major TBE virus vector, in 2016 Dr Dobler and colleagues reported the detection of TBE viral RNA in another hard tick, _Dermacentor reticulatus_ (see ProMED-mail Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany (02): Dermacentor reticulatus, human 20161014.4558823).

Tickborne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where the ticks are abundant.
