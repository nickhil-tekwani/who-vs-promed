I would like to correct the information posted about the African swine fever situation in Cote d'Ivoire July-December 2015.

On 5 Oct 2015, Cote d'Ivoire submitted a final report to OIE that the outbreak that occurred in San Pedro in June to October 2014 was now resolved, one year after the last cases of the disease. That outbreak was a limited event, and all the pigs died or were culled. The only spread out of the city of San Pedro was to a village in the same district where the pigs also died or were culled.

Prior to that introduction, believed to have been caused by exposure of pigs to port waste, as San Pedro is the major port for Cote d'Ivoire, the country had only suffered one previous incursion, an event diagnosed in April 1996 in the commercial capital Abidjan that was resolved by October 1996. Cote d'Ivoire is, therefore, not currently infected and, therefore, not a likely source of infection for Mali. I believe that confusion arose between 2014 and 2015 in the information posted from the OIE WAHIS database.

I would also like to mention that the main reason for needing laboratory confirmation of African swine fever in the event of an outbreak of haemorrhagic disease is to differentiate it from classical swine fever (hog cholera) and other so-called "red diseases" like erysipelas. Atypical disease (or no disease) caused by a low virulent virus would not manifest as a haemorrhagic disease. Disease manifestations resulting from low virulent viruses are well described, especially in literature pertaining to the Iberian Peninsula. They are, as indicated, non-specific and do not include the widespread haemorrhages observed in the acute, severe disease caused by ASF viruses of high virulence.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Mary Louise Penrith for her comment and clarification concerning the sanitary situation of ASF in Cote d'Ivoire.

In June 2014, Cote d'Ivoire reported ASF (see ProMED-mail post 20140828.2730311). Two outbreaks were detected in the department of San Pedro [Bas-Sassandra District]. A total of 1901 cases occurred out of a susceptible population of 5455 pigs. The epidemiological comment in the final report noted that: "Since the end of the sentinelisation period, no deaths of pigs have been observed. Testing of samples taken in the sentinel pigs was negative according to test reports no 219/15/viro 169; no 220/15/viro 170; no 221/15/viro 171; no 222/15/viro 172; no 223/15/viro 173; no 224/15/viro 174; no 225/15/viro 175; no226/15/viro 176."

The event was resolved on 5 Oct 2015. See event summary and final report at http://tinyurl.com/jfowcfx and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=18990, respectively.

For the most recent semi-annual report submitted (reporting period July-December 2015), Cote d'Ivoire reported having ASF as "present but limited to a zone in the country." The country likely reported it for this period as such because the event was not yet officially considered as closed but was considered as continuing during the months of July through October 2015. It is important to note that no new cases of the disease were reported during that period. However, since these 2 2014 ASF outbreaks were not closed out until October 2015, the disease had to technically be considered as present during this period. See 6-monthly report July-December 2015 at http://tinyurl.com/hc6689r. Please refer to Sections 1 and 3 of the 6-monthly report. - Mod.CRD
