[BA] (43), who lives in Elazig, got anthrax from the meat he bought from a butcher 9 days ago. The butcher shop where [BA] -- whose life was turned upside down and was fighting for his life in the hospital -- bought meat was sealed.

[BA] bought the meat from a butcher about 9 days ago, unaware of what was going to happen to him. Instead of his wife cooking the meat that day, [BA] cooked it. After eating the meal with his family, he had wounds on his hands and body. He did not go to the hospital, thinking his wounds were acne. After going to the emergency room, he decided 3 days later to go back to the hospital with the growth of the wound.

Anthrax was detected in [BA] during the examinations performed in the infection department of the Fırat University Hospital. After the patient said that he ate meat, the situation was reported to the Elazig provincial health directorate and the provincial directorate of Agriculture and Forestry. The teams took action, and anthrax was found in the examination of the meat.

Explaining the unfortunate event he experienced, [BA] said, "I bought meat from a butcher in the city center. I didn't buy too much; it was a kilogram [2.2 lbs]. I took the meat I bought home. My children were not at home. I washed the meat with my own hands and then cooked it. I ate it with my son and wife. When I woke up in the morning, a pimple the size of a needle appeared on my left arm. At first I didn't care. I thought maybe it was a thorn or a fly bite. As time passed, the redness and the wound began to grow and swell more. Twenty-four hours after the incident, I went to the emergency department at Fethi Sekin City Hospital. They couldn't do anything in the emergency room; they prescribed antibiotics and ointments to use, and they said I had to come to the polyclinic. I spent the night at home in pain," he said.

Stating that he learned that he had anthrax during the tests and examinations performed at the hospital, [BA] said that his life-threatening condition continues. "If we, as a society, will not trust butchers, should we trust them? An investigation has been launched against the butcher. They sealed the butcher shop. At the moment, my life risk continues, but I am not saved," he said.

After the incident, it was learned that the butcher's shop, which was found to be selling anthrax-containing meat, was sealed.

[Obviously there is still much to be revealed from this apparently singular human case. Cutaneous lesions are common in the people butchering an infected carcass, and that animal had to have come from a herd where the animal, and maybe others, got infected. Hopefully the provincial directorate of Agriculture and Forestry will shortly reveal the results of their investigation. Shutting down the butcher's shop just protects health bureaucrats who had not warned the butchers of the dangers of selling meat from sick animals. Logically the affected livestock holding is within some 20 km [12.4 mi] of Elazig.

Anthrax is enzootic in eastern Turkey and a constant problem, and the previous multiple outbreaks in 2018 were serious, with very significant numbers of livestock deaths. Anthrax is patently a serious human and livestock problem in this country, which is economically and politically stressed. Niche modelling shows that some 75% of the country is at serious risk. Put another way, if a livestock national control and surveillance programme were to be initiated, some 80% of the cattle would have to be vaccinated annually for at least 10 years before targeted area vaccination could be used to tidy up.

"Formerly Mamuretülaziz, or al-'Aziz, Elazig is a city in the Eastern Anatolia region of Turkey, and the administrative center of Elazığ Province."

"Elazığ stretches in a general west-southwest to east-northeast direction, along the line of equal geographic latitude and longitude. The source of the Euphrates River is located in this province."
