From various reliable diplomatic sources in Manila and elsewhere, I am informed that it all started when a carabao (water buffalo) suddenly became lethargic, which persisted for a week, and then died. The animal was eventually slaughtered and eaten by some local citizens. Those who ate the meat developed somewhat cutaneous-like symptoms of anthrax such as skin rashes and sore muscles, and other signs such as stomach pains, headaches, difficulty in breathing, sore throat, and dry cough.

Although these symptoms might suggest anthrax, it was not confirmed in either the humans or the carabao. In relation to the latter, they collected soil samples which were immediately sent to the diagnostic laboratory. The result was negative. Should there be other available tests to confirm the result, they are more than willing to provide samples again...

For the mean time, continuous livestock vaccination efforts were being made to control the possible occurrence of the disease. The veterinary service also employs protocols such as animal movement control and updating of database of animal population. The region conducts regular updating meetings regarding the disease.

Any errors in this are my fault, not of my informants.

[Something odd. Firstly, animal anthrax is normally a hyperacute disease, animals which had been healthy the day before are found dead the next morning. When clinically sick animals are noted, they can recover or die after a short period, not a drawn out week. With humans the skin lesions are not "cutaneous-like", they involve obvious inflamed areas -- not rashes -- with small vesicles and which are not painful but itch; eventually a central ulcer forms which will be black, that is "charbon". I am not a clinician, much less a physician, but it sounds more like "flu".

That the only animal samples were of soil, presumably bloody soil from the butchering site -- if the carabao had died, there was no need to slaughter it -- which suggests that the veterinary service was called in late to belatedly sort out the livestock dimension. Pity. Whenever there is a suspect human case of anthrax, the very 1st action the public health people should do is to call their veterinary colleagues so that they can meet promptly in the field and effectively and efficiently divide up the field investigation, and ensure that the proper samples are collected. Human cases can sometimes be tricky to confirm; the best samples are to extract the bloody oedematous fluid from underneath a skin lesion. The vets can chase down any remaining meat samples, as well as going back to the butcher site/farm of origin to check any carcass parts as well as bloody soil. If the skull is still around, sample the turbinates.

One must remember that human anthrax cannot be prevented by the public health staff. It can only be prevented by veterinarians ensuring that proper livestock disease control procedures are in place, starting with the proper disposal of an infected carcass, as well as an effective reactive livestock vaccination but more importantly a targeted proactive vaccination. If you do not have animal cases, you will not have human cases. Just let the vets do their job. - Mod.MHJ
