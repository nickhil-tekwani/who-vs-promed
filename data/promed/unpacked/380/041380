The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 29 Sep 2018:
- a total of 159 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 127 confirmed and 32 probable;
- of the 127 confirmed, 72 died and 45 have recovered;
- 13 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 1 new confirmed case in Beni died shortly after arriving at the Ebola treatment center (ETC);
- 1 new probable case in Beni, who is a contact of the last confirmed case, died a day earlier and was buried by his family in an unsecured way.

News of the response
Press conference in Beni
------------------------
The coordinator of the response, Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, held a press conference this Sun 30 Sep 2018 in Beni. He returned to the impact of the dead city days [general strike] on the activities of the response:
- The contact follow-up coverage rate decreased from 98 per cent to less than 50 per cent during the general strike.
- There has been a slowdown in active case-finding in health facilities and in the community due to lack of team mobility.
- There has been a slowdown in monitoring activities at ports of entry and a disruption of water supply at some ports of entry.
- There has been no vaccination activity for 3 days and poor follow up of people already vaccinated.
- No samples were collected or analyzed on 25 Sep 2018.
- Failure to respect the principle that all households and health facilities through which positive cases have passed must be disinfected within 24 hours.
- Non-supply of inputs and protective equipment for healthcare providers and patients in facilities through which positive cases have passed.
- Difficulty distributing handwashing kits in schools.
- No awareness activities or psychological support sessions could be organized.

The coordinator insisted that the stigmatization of the population in Beni must be stopped. Contrary to what is often repeated in the media, the population of the city has been very cooperative with the teams of the response. This collaboration is to be commended and encouraged. More and more contacts are voluntarily registering with vaccination teams, patients voluntarily present themselves to the ETC [Ebola treatment center] when they become ill, and bereaved families call emergency teams to proceed with the dignified and secure burial of their close deceased patients.

The cases of resistance in the city of Beni are actually concentrated around 1 or 2 families that caused the spread of the epidemic in Butembo [North Kivu] and Tchomia [Ituri]. This is why it is important for the whole community to be involved in stopping the spread of the disease.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 12 940 people have been vaccinated , including 4193 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3958 in Beni [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 1143 in Katwa [North Kivu], 944 in Butembo [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 230 in Tchomia [Ituri], 220 in Bunia [Ituri], 164 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[The recent ostensible slow rise in number of cases has been encouraging, although a steady state with no new cases would have been even better. But apparently this slow rise may be an under assessment. The coordinator of the response, Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, held a press conference to discuss the impact of the general strike, when control activities were suspended in response to the violent conflict in the area. The lapse in effort for 3 days was serious, but one hopes that with the quick resumption of vaccination, contact tracing, and safe burials last Wed 26 Sep 2018, the impact will be minimal; time will tell. He also reported that the community is actually more cooperative than the reports in the media suggest. That is critical to the success of the effort to control transmission. - Mod.LK
