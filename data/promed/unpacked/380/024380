European foulbrood of honey bees, Norway
----------------------------------------
Information received on 20 Aug 2010 from Dr Keren Bar-Yaacov, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Legislation, Norwegian Food Safety Authority,
Brumunddal, Norway
Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 13 Aug 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 18 Aug 2010
Report date: 20 Aug 2010
Date submitted to OIE: 20 Aug 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1994
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: _M. plutonious_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 3
Location(s): Aust-Agder
1. Amli, District office of Aust-Agder, Regional office of Rogaland and Agder;
2. Tromoy, District office of Aust-Agder, Regional office of Rogaland
and Agder;
3. Froland, District office of Aust-Agder, Regional office of
Rogaland and Agder.

Total animals affected:
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Bees (hives)/ 57/ 34/ 0/ 0/ 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: The apiaries in Tromoy and Amli have the
same owner. Contagious contact cannot be excluded.
The district office is responsible for further epidemiological
investigations and disease control measures. The affected apiaries
are put under restrictions and stamping out of affected hives and
hives within a 100m-radius will be carried out. A restriction zone
will be applied.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country

Measures to be applied: Stamping out, Screening, Zoning, Disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s)
Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: The Norwegian Veterinary School of Science
(National laboratory)
Tests and results:
Species/ Test/ Test date/ Result
Bees/ microscopic examination of larvae/ 18 Aug 2010/ Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The causal organism of European foulbrood of honey bees (EFB) is the
bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_.

The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of
disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign
is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in
their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European
foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which
themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each
active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies
because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable
organism. Recurrences of disease can therefore be expected in subsequent years.

Identification of the agent: Examination, by high-power microscopy,
of suitable preparations of larval remains for the presence of
numerous lanceolate cocci is adequate for most practical purposes,
especially when it is done by experienced individuals.

Traditionally the diagnosis of EFB is done by isolating and
identifying the causative organism. This can be differentiated quite
readily from all other bacteria associated with bees by its
fastidious cultural requirements.

Additional data on EFB diagnosis is available at

American foulbrood (AFB; see 20020723.4842) is caused by the
bacterium _Paenibacillus larvae_. It occurs throughout the world,
similarly affecting the bees' larvae. - Mod.AS]
