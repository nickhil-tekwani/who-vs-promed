From 1 Jan to 8 Apr 2007, the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso
reported 22 255 suspected cases including 1490 deaths (case-fatality
rate, 7 percent). A total of 34 districts are currently over the
epidemic threshold. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens from all affected
areas have tested positive for _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A
by latex test and/or culture.
To date [17 Apr 2007], vaccination campaigns have been completed in
15 districts in which 100 percent of the targeted population of 2.7
million people have been reached. This includes a million people in
the capital, Ouagadougou. Vaccination campaigns are still ongoing in
a further 6 districts. The bivalent vaccine has been secured from The
International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis Control, as well as from the security stockpiles
held by the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso.

A meningitis outbreak that has swept across south Sudan since the
start of 2007 has killed 661 people, a report said on Tue 11 Apr
2007. The joint report by the semi-autonomous south Sudan government
and the World Health Organization said more than 11 000 people had
contracted meningitis since the start of 2007.
Meningitis outbreaks affect Sudan during the dry season, and the
disease has spread more rapidly since a 2005 north-south peace deal
ended 2 decades of civil war, easing movement as the region's health
infrastructure remained in tatters. Hundreds of thousands of south
Sudanese returning home after the peace deal are especially at risk
because they often live in crowded camps where infectious diseases can thrive.
