Staggering cats and Borna virus
Participants at a European Union meeting at Queens' College, Cambridge, UK
(Viruses and Disorders of the Brain, March 22-25) avidly discussed one of the
hottest topics in medical research: viral involvement in chronic nervous-system
diseases and in mental illness.
Prof Hugh Field (Cambridge University, UK) noted that finding traces of viruses
or of viral activity in brains is no proof of viral involvement in
nervous-system
disease. ... reminded the audience of the difficulty of diagnosing and
following the course of many psychiatric illnesses, particularly those which
relapse and remit. Both
warnings might have been intended to deter enthusiasts for one particular
virus -- Borna disease virus (BDV).
Prof Hanns Ludwig (Free University, Berlin) explained why BDV is a good
candidate for causing psychiatric illness: it causes mood changes in
experimentally infected animals, and once it gets into the body it makes
straight for the limbic system. Anna-Lena Lundgren (University of
Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) described an outbreak of staggering
disease in Uppsala's cats caused by BDV. In survivors, the acute illness is
followed by long-term mood alterations. This disease has also been found in
Germany, Japan, and Austria, but only oblique reference was made to the
possibility of cats being a source of human BDV infection. Evidence that BDV
may cause
manic-depressive illness was summarised by Liv Bode (Robert Koch Institut,
Berlin, Germany). A trial of amantadine in this illness is underway -- the
results are expected later this year.
