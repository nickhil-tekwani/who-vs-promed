In Italy, the 1st occurrence of West Nile virus (WNV) infection was
reported in the Tuscany region during the late summer of 1998. In
August 2008, WNV infection reemerged in Italy in areas surrounding
the Po river delta and involving 3 regions: Lombardy, Emilia Romagna
and Veneto. WNV was isolated from blood and organ samples of one
horse, one donkey, one pigeon (_Columba livia_) and 3 magpies (_Pica
pica_). The phylogenetic analysis of the isolates, conducted on 255
bp in the region coding for the E protein, indicates that these
isolates belong to the lineage I among the European strains.
According to the analysis, both the 1998 and 2008 Italian strains as
well as isolates from Romania, Russia, Senegal and Kenya fell in the
same sub-cluster.
