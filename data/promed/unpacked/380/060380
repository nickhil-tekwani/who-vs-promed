New lab joins budgie virus search
---------------------------------
An unnamed international laboratory has been asked to help identify the
virus that has caused deaths in budgie studs across Great Britain. The
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), which is working on the virus at its
Weybridge site, has called in outside help, having so far failed to put a
name to the bug.
A VLA spokesman told Cage & Aviary Birds this week that it had recruited an
international laboratory which "has complementary tools to those at the
VLA". The VLA has been able to isolate the cytopathic (cell-killing) agent
from 5 affected birds, but the virus yield has been too low to allow
traditional identification methods. Techniques tried to date by the VLA
include serological assays, electron microscopy, biological assays, and
molecular techniques, but all have been inconclusive.
The fact that techniques for identifying avian paramyxovirus type 5
(APMV-5) -- which is the prime suspect for the outbreaks -- are not well
developed is not making the scientists' work any easier.
