The Reynosa Livestock Association alerts the agriculture and livestock sectors of possible paralytic bovine rabies, and advises extreme precautions be taken.

Gildardo Lopez Hinojosa, president of the association, said that there is persistent concern that some cases may occur [in the Reynosa area] due to reported outbreaks in the Mendez and Burgos municipalities. "That is where the cases are. In the Palo Honda ejido [community lands] there are some outbreaks of the epidemic," he stated in the interview.

He said that a vaccination campaign against paralytic rabies was initiated in the Mendez municipality, and in the coming week vaccination will be initiated in the southern areas of Reynosa, which has the greatest risk of the disease.

Lopez Hinojosa stated that although no cases have occurred [in the Reynosa area], the livestock sector has been advised to prevent the disease by vaccinating cattle.

He stated that the vaccine is free, financed by the Tamaulipas Regional Livestock Union, and there are specialized veterinarians who will apply the authorized doses [of the vaccine].

[There have been at least 2 outbreaks of bovine paralytic rabies in Tamaulipas state this year (2012). It is prudent to vaccinate the cattle in the Reynosa area since cases are occurring in nearby municipalities currently. The virus causing bovine paralytic rabies is transmitted by _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common vampire bat in the tropics and sub-tropics in the Americas.
