Part of Bwabwata National Park -- where confirmed anthrax cases have killed nearly 110 hippos and 20 buffalo since the start of October 2017 -- has been closed to tourists. "[For the] safety of tourists intending to visit the park, the area in which mortalities are taking place is not open for tourists but is exclusively for wildlife management. However, as a precaution, we urge tourists not to go close to the affected area by any means," said the Environment and Tourism Ministry spokesperson, Romeo Muyunda.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry has also issued an alert to the public and farmers in the surrounding areas of Bwabwata to say the anthrax outbreak has been confirmed.

The destruction of the carcasses has started and will continue where and when practical. Government has also started to procure protective gear for staff members involved in the operation.
