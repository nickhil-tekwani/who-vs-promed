[Not yet available on-line]


Since [13 May 2018], exceptionally high mortality has been reported from several rabbit-keeping facilities, mainly on children's petting farms and in schools throughout the country. We are informed that the mortality has been observed in young and adult rabbits, usually without clinical signs except for apathy and lack of movement during several hours prior to death. The mortality rate is very high in the affected facilities.

The circular includes a request to submit dead rabbits for investigation to the Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan (KVI), instructing the animal holders and the practitioners about the handling of the samples and their submission. The samples will be accepted at KVI 24/7 and will be tested free of charge until diagnosis of the disease is, hopefully, reached. An anamnesis questionnaire is attached.

[According to OIE's Terrestrial Code, 2 infectious diseases of Leporidae are included in the list of OIE's-notifiable diseases: Myxomatosis and Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). Both are officially reportable in Israel. Myxomatosis has never been reported; RHD was reported in July 2006 in central Israel ("Hamerkaz").

Israel's reports to the OIE do not include details on the size of the local domestic (kept) rabbit population; this population may be assumed to be proportionate to rabbit populations in other industrialized countries in the Mediterranean basin.

The current event could have an infectious or non-infectious etiology. Results of the ongoing investigation and the outcome of the event are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
