A new livestock disease causing deformities at birth has been detected in at least 5 European countries, including the Netherlands and Germany, a Dutch agriculture ministry spokesman said Thursday [26 Jan 2012].

"It has been detected on 76 farms in the Netherlands, mainly among sheep, but also goats and cattle," Coen Gelinck said, adding that the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] was also spotted in Germany, Belgium and Britain.

France also reported its 1st case on Thursday [26 Jan 2012].

Named after the German town where it was 1st detected in November 2011, Schmallenberg virus affected 51 German farms, mainly in the North Rhine-Westphalia state, the German Friedrich-Loeffler Institute for animal health research said.

Across the border in eastern France, authorities said Schmallenberg virus had been detected for the 1st time on a sheep farm in Lorraine, and suspected cases elsewhere were being investigated.

The disease, believed to be carried by gnats, causes fever and diarrhoea among adult animals and cannot be transmitted from one animal to another, said Gelinck. There is presently no vaccine for SBV.

The disease, however, can be transmitted to sheep, goats, and cattle embryos, leading to still births or deformities and causing death soon after birth, the spokesman said.

"This is a virus similar to others previously detected in Australia and South America," the spokesman for a Dutch federation representing agriculture, cattle, and flower farmers, Jack Luiten, told AFP. "Until now, there are many indications that the virus cannot be transmitted to humans," Luiten added.

Dutch farmers have been ordered to report all birth deformities to authorities from 20 Dec 2011.

Germany's food, agriculture, and consumer protection ministry said it would, by "late March [2012]," set up a system of mandatory reporting after approval by the German senate.

Earlier this week in Brussels, Germany argued for a similar system to be set up at the European level.

Moscow in mid-January 2012 suspended sheep and goat imports from the Netherlands because of the disease. Dutch meat exports to Russia are regarded as "marginal," Gelinck said.

China and Argentina asked for more information on the virus in mid-January 2012, he added.

[The chief veterinary officer of France, Dr Jean-Luc Angot, published on 4 Jan 2012 a detailed (8 pages) document "note de service DGAL/SDSPA/N2012-8007 du 04 janvier 2012," incorporating a call for alertness and specified instructions for surveillance and sample collection in case of suspected SBV-affected offspring, particularly in northeast France. Although SBV is not a notifiable disease in France, thus its reporting is not obligatory by law, farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to report any suspicion. The document, which also includes a case definition, is available (in French) at http://agriculture.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/DGALN20128007Z.pdf. The only French laboratory designated for SBV diagnosis is the virology department at Maison Alfort.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of France can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/1He9. The departments of Moselle and Meurthe-et-Moselle are in the Lorraine region, northeast France, bordering Belgium and Germany. They can be seen on the map at http://www.trussel.com/maig/image/frdeptb.jpg.

Official confirmation (or otherwise) of the identification of SBV in France will be appreciated. In case affirmative, additional information will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
