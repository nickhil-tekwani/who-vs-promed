Angola: 324 Deaths Attributed to Marburg Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------
As of 8 Aug 2005, a total of 324 people have died of Marburg virus
infection so far in the Uige province of Angola, according to Health
Ministry spokesman Carlos Alberto.
Alberto was quoted by local media as saying, on Mon 8 Aug 2005, that health
officials were keeping 37 people, who have had direct contact with infected
victims, in quarantine, adding that the latest case was recorded last
Monday [8 Aug 2005].
Although an epidemic was not declared by the Ministry of Health and the
World Health Organization (WHO) until March 2005, the 1st case of the
disease was registered in Angola on 13 Oct 2004.
Spreading through contact with bodily fluids, Marburg can kill rapidly, as
there is no vaccine against it. Marburg virus was 1st identified in 1967.
Several African countries, including South Africa and Kenya, have also
experienced [outbreaks of Marburg virus infection in the past]. In the last
known outbreak of Marburg, 123 people were killed in the neighboring
Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000.

[Since the last update released by WHO two weeks ago [28 Jul 2005], the
number of deaths has increased by one only, and the number of people under
surveillance has diminished from 45 to 37. Clearly, the outbreak is almost
over. - Mod.CP]
