Global Ebola vaccine stockpile created By WHO, UNICEF & partners
----------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization, UNICEF, and 2 leading international health and humanitarian civil society organizations announced on Tuesday [12 Jan 2021] the establishment of a global Ebola vaccine stockpile to ensure rapid response to future outbreaks.

Establishment of the stockpile was led by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, which also includes the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). It has received financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The stockpile will allow countries, with the support of humanitarian organizations, to contain future Ebola epidemics by ensuring timely access to vaccines for populations at risk during outbreaks.

The injectable single-dose Ebola vaccine (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP, live) is manufactured by Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) Corp. and developed with financial support from the US government. The European Medicines Agency licensed the Ebola vaccine in November 2019, and the vaccine is now prequalified by WHO, and licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration as well as in 8 African countries.

Before receiving regulatory approval, the vaccine was administered to more than 350 000 people, beginning in Guinea at the end of the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa and then later in the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under a protocol for "compassionate use".

The vaccine, which is recommended by WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization for use in Ebola outbreaks as part of a broader set of outbreak response tools, protects against the Zaire ebolavirus species which is the strain of the virus that has been most commonly implicated in large outbreaks.

Example of solidarity
---------------------
"The COVID-19 pandemic is reminding us of the incredible power of vaccines to save lives from deadly viruses," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, in a statement that accompanied the announcement of the vaccine stockpile.

"Ebola vaccines have made one of the most feared diseases on earth preventable. This new stockpile is an excellent example of solidarity, science, and cooperation between international organizations and the private sector to save lives."

UNICEF is managing the stockpile on behalf of the ICG which, as with stockpiles of cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever vaccines, will be the decision-making body for its allocation and release.

The stockpile is stored in Switzerland and ready to be shipped to countries for emergency response. The decision to allocate the vaccine will be made within 48 hours of receiving a request from a country; vaccines will be made available together with ultra-cold chain packaging by the manufacturer for shipment to countries within 48 hours of the decision. The targeted overall delivery time from the stockpile to countries is 7 days.

"We are proud to be part of this unprecedented effort to help bring potential Ebola outbreaks quickly under control," said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. "We know that when it comes to disease outbreaks, preparedness is key. This Ebola vaccine stockpile is a remarkable achievement -- one that will allow us to deliver vaccines to those who need them the most as quickly as possible."

As Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare and unpredictable, there is no natural market for the vaccine. Vaccines are only secured through the establishment of the stockpile and are available in limited quantities. The Ebola vaccine is reserved for outbreak response to protect people at the highest risk of contracting Ebola -- including healthcare and frontline workers.

"This is an important milestone. Over the past decade alone we have seen Ebola devastate communities in West and Central Africa, always hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest," said IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain. "Through each outbreak, our volunteers have risked their lives to save lives. With this stockpile, it is my hope that the impact of this terrible disease will be dramatically reduced."

"The creation of an Ebola vaccine stockpile under the ICG is a positive step", said Dr Natalie Roberts, Programme Manager, MSF Foundation. "Vaccination is one of the most effective measures to respond to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, and Ebola is no exception. An Ebola vaccine stockpile can increase transparency in the management of existing global stocks and the timely deployment of the vaccine where it's most needed, something MSF has called for during recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo."

An initial 6890 doses are now available for outbreak response with further quantities to be delivered into the stockpile this month and throughout 2021 and beyond. Depending on the rate of vaccine deployment, it could take 2-3 years to reach the SAGE-recommended level of 500 000 doses for the emergency stockpile of Ebola vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, Gavi, and vaccine manufacturers are continuously assessing options to increase vaccine supply should global demand increase.

[This is a milestone in the prevention of a devastating disease that has taken so many lives and in control of outbreaks that will likely occur in the future. Kudos to the scientists, manufacturers, distributors, and all others involved in making this happen. The live vaccine rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP has made Ebola a vaccine-preventable disease. The global Ebola vaccine stockpile could not have happened without the cooperation demonstrated by this international effort.

The experience with the Ebola vaccine has lessons in it for the current vaccine effort to prevent COVID-19. See Wolf J, Bruno S, Eichberg M, et al. Applying lessons from the Ebola vaccine experience for SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemic pathogens. npj Vaccines 5, 51 (2020); https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-0204-7:

Abstract
--------
"The world is experiencing an unprecedented global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of new vaccines and therapeutics is important to achieve long-term prevention and control of the virus. Experience gained in the development of vaccines for Ebolavirus disease provide important lessons in the regulatory, clinical, and manufacturing process that can be applied to SARS-CoV-2 and other epidemic pathogens. This report outlines the main lessons learned by Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck& Co, Inc, Kenilworth, NJ, USA (MSD) during development of an Ebola Zaire vaccine (ERVEBO (R)) and looks ahead to critical lessons beyond vaccine development. It highlights focus areas for public-private partnership and regulatory harmonization that can be directly applied to current vaccine development efforts for SARS-CoV-2, while drawing attention to the need for parallel consideration of issues beyond development that are equally important to achieve global preparedness and response goals."
