Swine fever, classical - Mauritius 20010725.1453

We were rather surprised at the moderator's comments on the posting on
classical swine fever in Mauritius (25 Jul 2001). They are ill-informed and
give a completely false impression of the status of the swine fevers in
Africa. Firstly, the statement that classical swine fever occurs in parts
of Africa is not well supported. It has occurred in Madagascar for a long
time, and vaccination for CSF is carried out periodically in the Republic
of Cape Verde, although the disease has not been confirmed there. We do not
know of any other African countries where this disease has been confirmed
in many decades. In view of the threat that ASF poses to pig production in
Africa, the occurrence of any swine fever is likely to be followed up in
pigs to which veterinary services have access.
Secondly, the statement that African swine fever is "endemic in the African
swine population" is a sweeping statement that is untrue, highly
irresponsible, and potentially damaging to the pig industry in countries
like South Africa and Zimbabwe and others that have highly organized pig
industries and export pork.
The following is the actual situation: African swine fever is endemic in
warthogs in parts of southern and eastern Africa, from which it may be
transmitted via the bites of tampans (_Ornithodoros_ spp.) [ticks to
domestic pigs. Other wild African suids (bush pigs and giant forest hogs)
are susceptible to infection with ASF virus but resistant to its pathogenic
effects. Their role if any in the epidemiology of ASF has not been
demonstrated. There are a few foci in Africa where ASF has become endemic
in domestic pigs, in which the epidemiology of the disease is still poorly
understood. However, in the great majority of African countries, the
disease is epizootic, hence its devastating effects.
The Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has assisted a
number of countries in the region since 1996 with Technical Cooperation
Projects to control and eradicate ASF, and the disease was certainly not
endemic in most of these. A great deal of money is being invested in
controlling ASF in Africa, which would hardly be worthwhile if it was
"endemic in the African swine population"!
We would appreciate it if this statement could be corrected.

[Peter Cowen is travelling at this time and so I am replying for him. His
brief comments might have been better worded, it is true, and we apologize
for any misunderstandings. However, he was correct in referring to "parts"
of Africa being affected with classical swine fever though these -- Cape
Verde & Madagascar -- are away from mainland Africa. As to African swine
fever, I am sympathetic to your objection. Here in the USA we have feral
pigs, a pseudorabies problem, and a major swine industry. People can be
confused. We are grateful for your clarification. However in checking the
OIE HandiStatus figures, their report for 1996-99 is as follows, briefly:
African Swine Fever: OIE HandiStatus 1996 - 1999 (2000 reports are not yet
available)
+: Reported present or known to be present
(): Certain areas only
(199n): Last known reported case
Angola+
Benin+
Botswana+
Cameroon+()
Cape Verde+
Cote d'Ivoire(1996)
Ethiopia (1993)
Kenya (1994)
Madagascar+
Malawi+
Mozambique +
Namibia(1998)
Senegal+
South Africa(1998)
Togo+
Uganda+
Zambia+
Zimbabwe(1992)
Countries not reporting status even once in the 4 years:
Chad, DR Congo, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Sao Tome & Principe, Tanzania (but
note "African swine fever - Tanzania (Dar es Salaam) 20010529.1039") and
Gabon said it didn't know its status but the disease was suspected (?).
Never ever had it (0000 in all four years):
Algeria, Burkino Faso, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Morocco, Reunion,
Sudan, Swaziland, Tunisia.
There is patently a widespread risk of this wildlife disease infecting
domestic swine in many countries in Africa. - Mod.MHJ
