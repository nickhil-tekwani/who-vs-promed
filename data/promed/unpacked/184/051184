A bull on a Madison County ranch has cultured positive for
brucellosis. The brucellosis-infected bull was identified during a
whole herd test, and was subsequently confirmed by cultures performed
at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames,
Iowa.

The ranch is located within the state's Designated Surveillance Area
(DSA), a disease management area in Beaverhead, Gallatin, Madison and
Park counties, with management practices that include Official
Calfhood Vaccination as required by DSA rules and a herd plan.

The bull has been removed from the herd, and the ranch placed under
quarantine. All other animals on the ranch tested negative for the
disease. State veterinarian Dr Marty Zaluski, Montana Department of
Livestock, said discovery of the infected bull is not likely to impact
the state's brucellosis status.

"USDA has de-emphasized state status and now manages brucellosis on a
case-by-case basis," Zaluski said.

An epidemiological investigation should help identify the source of
the disease, Zaluski said. In all 4 of the state's recent brucellosis
incidents, elk, not cattle or bison, were determined to be the likely
source of the infections. Results from genetic fingerprinting should
be available in a couple of weeks.

After going more than 30 years without a case of brucellosis, the
state lost its brucellosis-free status when the disease was found
twice within a 24-month period in 2007 and 2008. The department
responded with the Brucellosis Action Plan and later, the Designated
Surveillance Area, resulting in the fastest ever reinstatement of a
state's brucellosis class-free status.

[USDA has indeed loosened its regulations in the areas that are
impacted by the Greater Yellowstone area, the last remaining
stronghold of brucellosis.

The disease remains serious in USA domestic animals as it can be
passed through the milk. Although this article does not specifically
state it, it is likely this is a beef herd, not a milking herd.

For more information on the disease, readers are encouraged to see the
moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post 20110730.2294.
