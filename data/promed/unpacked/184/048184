Three new cases of equine West Nile virus infection in Virginia
---------------------------------------------------------------
Blood samples from 3 horses in the Tidewater area have tested positive for
West Nile virus (WNV). The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services (VDACS) submitted the samples for testing to the Division of
Consolidated Laboratories in Richmond. After strong positives there, VDACS
sent the samples to the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory in
Ames, Iowa for confirmation. With the 3 new cases, 6 horses in Virginia now
have tested positive for WNV. The first case ever in the state was reported
in September 2001.
The 3 Tidewater horses (2 from the Chesapeake area and one from Wakefield)
appear to be recovering from the infection. These areas often have annual
outbreaks of another mosquito-borne viral encephalitis, eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE). Both WNV and EEE virus are normally maintained in the
wild in birds and transferred from birds to animals and humans by
mosquitoes. Animal owners should consult their veterinarians or the nearest
VDACS Regional Animal Health Laboratory if an animal exhibits any
neurologic signs such as a stumbling gait, facial paralysis, drooping, or
disinterest in the surroundings.
Treatment for an infected horse consists of supportive therapy to prevent
the animal from injuring itself throughout the 2 to 3 weeks of the disease.
A vaccine for WNV recently received conditional approval. Horse owners
should check with their veterinarians for availability.
