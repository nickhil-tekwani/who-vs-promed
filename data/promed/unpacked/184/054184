Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak spreads to Namibia
---------------------------------------------------
Rift Valley fever (RVF), detected in South Africa 3 months ago, has
spread into southern Namibia with cases reported in the Karas and
Hardap regions, the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry said
on Friday [14 May 2010].

Namibia banned the import of South Africa meat and live animals from
that country following the outbreak of the viral disease which
affects wild animals and domestic animals such as cattle and sheep.

Namibia's acting chief veterinary officer Cleopas Bamhare said RVF
cases had been detected and confirmed at 2 farms in the Hardap
region. There is also a suspicious outbreak under investigation in
the Karas region. The Government said it had banned movement of
cattle, sheep and goats in the 2 regions.

"The ministry imposes with immediate effect, the suspension of all
movement of cattle, sheep and goats from, into, within, and through
the 2 regions of Karas and Hardap for one week," Bamhare said in a
statement. RVF is prevalent in east and north Africa [The United
Nations definition of Northern Africa includes Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. RVF has been reported,
only from Sudan and Egypt. The disease is present also in West
Africa. - Mod.AS] In South Africa the outbreak was detected earlier this year.

The South African government has confirmed 186 cases of the viral
fever in humans by 10 May 2010, including 18 deaths in the Free
State, Eastern, Western and Northern Cape as well as the North West Provinces.

RVF is a viral disease in livestock such as cattle, sheep and camels
but can also infect humans through indirect or direct contact with
infected animal blood or organs.

"Therefore all permits that were issued involving the 2 regions have
been suspended. The slaughter of cattle, sheep and goats at export
abattoirs and the sale of animals at auctions have also been
suspended," Bamhare said.

The Government also said it had closed movement of livestock and meat
products at 2 border posts linking Namibia to South Africa,
Noordoewer and Ariamsvlei.

"Noordoewer and Ariamsvlei border posts are now closed to livestock,
including fresh or frozen meat for own consumption. The measures have
been imposed in order to allow time to ascertain the extent of the
outbreak and to open negotiations with trading partners," Bamhare said.

The Government [increased] its surveillance and urged people who have
recently been in contact with sick animals, organs or their body
fluids and are showing signs of RVF sickness to seek medical attention.

[Similarly to South Africa, where reporting RVF in animals (19 Feb
2010) preceded reports on human disease [4 Mar 2010], the Namibian
Veterinary Services seems to have managed detecting and reporting the
start of the epidemic before the appearance of human cases.

The application of the term "no vaccination" in the OIE report may be
misleading; vaccination is not forbidden in Namibia, but has not been
applied by animal breeders, prior to the appearance of the cases,
most probably due to the absence of disease for an extended period.
