[1] Cholera - Sierra Leone

On 18 Jul 2012, the 1st reported case in Freetown came from Marbella, a slum area near the center of town where a high volume of people constantly visit and trade in the busy 24-hour market. The Ministry of Health says they are seeing 40 new cases a day in this area. In Freetown and the surrounding Western Area, 410 cases and 9 deaths have been reported. The fatality rate is at 2 percent.

"The fatality rate is very high," Sierra Leone's Minister of Health, Zainab Bangura, told a press conference on Mon 23 Jul 2012. "It is pretty serious. At the moment, our strategy is to contain it [the disease] and to clean the environment." Bangura said emergency measures were being put in place.

Dr Alemu Wondimagegnehu, Director of the WHO in Sierra Leone, told IRIN this is the biggest outbreak since 2007. "For a population of 6 million, 4000 cases are significant; this is big."

Since January 2012, Sierra Leone has seen 4249 cases of cholera, and 76 people have died from the waterborne disease. Wondimagegnehu said the epidemic has not yet reached its peak. Critics say the Ministry of Health in Sierra Leone was slow to respond to the outbreak, and prevention efforts in the country are weak.

The government has set up 3 emergency centres in hot spots around the city to handle new cases, and all government clinics are providing free treatment for cholera.

But in Marbella, a high-density area that is not accessible by road and is packed with traders and dwellings, many residents do not have access to toilets and live close to each other.

"The situation in Marbella, with lack of sanitation and hygiene, lack of safe drinking water, and the [poor] management of food in the market area, all these are risk factors for [the outbreak] to escalate," Wondimagegnehu said.

There are fears of a possible cholera outbreak within the areas affected by floods in Jos, Plateau state. A medical official of the Federation of Muslim Women Association in Nigeria in the state, Tawa Abdulrahama, on Tue 24 Jul 2012 disclosed that no fewer than 65 persons in various camps were being treated for dysentery and diarrhea. "There are already high cases of cholera among victims of the flood," she said.

The Commissioner for Water Resources and Rural Development, Mallam Idi Waziri, who led a delegation to assess the level of damage done by the flood, said the government would support the victims.

[3] Cholera - Nepal (Far Western Region)

With authorities failing to contain the spread of large numbers of diarrhea cases in Doti since mid-June 2012, health workers today, 22 Jul 2012, confirmed the spread of cholera, saying it might soon become an epidemic if corrective measures are not taken quickly. Local residents have been terrified, and health workers are worried as the infection could not be controlled with their limited resources.

The spread of disease in Durgamandau, Gajari, and Ladagada VDCs (village development committees) continued unabated this week as it could not be timely controlled. Earlier, in places like Bagalek, Kalena, Dipayal Silgadi municipality, Kadama-ndau, and Sanagaun VDCs, where large numbers of patients suffered, the disease showed little signs of improvement as it could not be contained.

8 persons who lost their lives in Doti were initially believed to be cases of diarrhea, but now it was confirmed that they died of cholera after their reports of stool tests came to public knowledge. According to Kumar Pra-sad Dahal of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Kathmandu, among the 17 stool tests from Doti, 5 have been proven to be cholera.

All the governmental and non-governmental organizations have reached the affected areas and have been involved in awareness programs.

Three Taiwanese tourists who traveled to the Philippine resort island of Boracay have been diagnosed with shigellosis, or bacillary dysentery, the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Tue 3 Jul 2012. Food may have been the source of infection, according to a preliminary investigation, said [Taiwan] CDC Deputy Director General Chou Jih-haw.

The patients, who were traveling with 3 different tour groups from 19 to 24 Jun 2012 are suspected to have eaten contaminated food at the same restaurants, he said.

The patients, a 21-year-old female and 2 males aged 34 and 48, had fever and diarrhea at the airport when they arrived home, the deputy director-general said. About 80 other members from the 3 tour groups were monitored for the foodborne disease, he said, and 18 were found with possible symptoms.

There have been 62 confirmed cases of bacillary dysentery in Taiwan in 2012 so far, 54 of which were imported cases from Indonesia, the Philippines, Cambodia, Viet Nam and China, according to the [Taiwan] CDC.
