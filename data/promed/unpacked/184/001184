Authorities in South Africa have so far tested 200 horses for African horse sickness (AHS) since a case of the dangerous disease was reported within the Western Cape's surveillance zone.

The case was detected earlier this month [April 2016] by a private vet in Paarl [Western Cape] through clinical surveillance. The disease, which is normally fatal for horses, is carried and spread by biting midges.

The horse was on a property within the AHS surveillance zone, part of the biosecurity buffer for the AHS free zone from which horses can be exported.

Authorities confirmed on [Tue 26 Apr 2016] that no new cases of AHS had been detected, prompting a review of the containment zone introduced to minimise the risk of the disease spreading.

Minister of Economic Opportunities Alan Winde said: "Movement restrictions are still in force within a smaller containment area surrounding the farm where the case was detected.

"No movement of horses into, out of, through or within the containment area will be allowed without a movement permit from a state veterinarian."

Winde said the vets launched a surveillance programme immediately after the case was reported.

"An initial census and surveillance programme by state vets in the area surrounding the affected property was performed to determine the extent of the outbreak," he said.

"All properties on which horses are kept within 5 km [3 mi] of the index farm were visited and approximately 200 horses sampled. About 90 percent of results have been received to date, all of which have been negative for AHS virus."

Winde said surveillance activities within the containment area were continuing. "Part of this includes investigating the source of the infection, which has not yet been established."

Private veterinarians in the affected area have also been asked to tell state vets of any suspected AHS cases or cases indicative of infectious disease both within the containment area and within the AHS surveillance zone.

Any owner within the AHS surveillance zone detecting illness in horses involving unexplained fever, swelling of the head and neck, and difficulty breathing should report the case to their local state vet as quickly as possible.

Disease report
--------------
South Africa has reported an outbreak of African horse sickness (AHS) in the Western Cape Province. The virus serotype was identified as serotype 1 [see comment]. The affected animal was an 18-month-old colt, one of 10 horses present, and was reported by a private veterinarian; it had demonstrated typical clinical signs but died at the time of the examination. Serotype 1 has been reported previously in outbreaks in 2014 in the Western Cape province. Disease control measures are in place, including movement controls.

Situation assessment
--------------------
Sub Saharan Africa, including South Africa is considered endemic for AHS in the wild equidae population. 9 strains have been identified across sub Saharan Africa and occasional incursions have occurred beyond the traditional epizootic range into the Middle East and Europe, involving strains 4, 6, and 9 . The disease is transmitted by _Culicoides_ midge vectors, in a similar manner to bluetongue disease. Every year, the season for AHS is dependent on the temperature, humidity, and vector density. According to the African Horse Sickness Trust website (which represents industry stakeholders and is responsible for collecting data on AHS), the season began on 1 Feb 2016 and will continue to 30 Jun 2016 (http://www.africanhorsesickness.co.za/), which is slightly earlier than previous years due to persistent high rainfall across the country.

The most recent outbreak is in the (currently suspended) AHS Controlled Zone. The AHS Controlled Zone is divided into 3 areas to protect the "free zone" for equine trade purposes. The protection zone acts as a buffer for the surveillance zone: no active surveillance takes place there, whereas the surveillance zone is an area of active surveillance while the free zone is considered free of AHS. The outbreak is located approximately 10 km [6.2 mi] into the "AHS surveillance zone" and 40 km [24.9 mi] from the "AHS free area".

An AHS Controlled Area has existed in South African legislation since 1997. This was to allow for the export of horses from the legally prescribed and protect AHS Free Zone. The AHS Controlled Area was amended to the current areas in September 2001. This approval is currently suspended as a result of AHS outbreaks in the Western Cape Province (within the AHS surveillance zone) under Commission Implementing Decision 2011/267/EU [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32011D0267&from=EN]. In accordance with EU regulations and OIE guidelines, disease freedom can only be reinstated after a period of 2 years or 2 vector seasons with no evidence of virus circulation. The outbreaks in the surveillance zone in 2014 delayed the re-approval of the area so the country is at present not approved for exports to the EU.

Since 1 Feb 2016, a ban on the direct movement of horses into the Western Cape's AHS Controlled Area Zones has come into effect. The Minister of Economic Opportunities has confirmed that all horses entering the province's AHS Controlled Area would spend 14 days at a quarantine facility. After this period they will be tested to ensure they are free of AHS. The testing will take place at a laboratory approved by the South African National Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The horses will be then able to enter the Western Cape's AHS Controlled Area. A prerequisite for this is that, in accordance with AHS Control Policy, all horses entering the AHS Controlled Area, from an AHS Infected Zone, must have been vaccinated within the past 2 years and not less than 40 days prior to entry.

There are strict controls on exports of horses and their products from any 3rd country to the EU. Under Commission Decisions 2004/211/EC and 1993/197/EEC, South Africa is approved for the permanent import of registered horses, temporary (90 day) import of registered horses, horses for breeding and production, and semen from registered horses only from a small area of the City of Cape Town into the EU. This approval is dependent on surveillance of horses in the surrounding region, specifically the Protection and Free Zones. Registered horses and horses for breeding and production to be exported are required to be pre-export tested and kept in an approved vector free quarantine station prior to movement for a period of 40 days. Horses should also be accompanied by a certificate stating the animal's vaccination and test status.

Equidae originating in this region may move to the EU as temporary imports from a different country after a process of triangulation, whereby the animals move to another approved 3rd country (under 90/426/EEC) under conditions at least as strict as conditions for direct movement to the EU, prior to moving to the EU. That is, equidae should be resident for at least 60 days in an AHS free area; this period covers the incubation period for AHS.

Conclusions
-----------
We consider there would be a negligible risk of introduction of AHS to the UK via legal trade. Should the disease be introduced into the EU we consider there would be a viable vector population in the UK (Culicoides midges) and the risk would be higher.

The risk from illegal or non-compliant imports is difficult to quantify but as the disease has a short incubation period, causes severe clinical signs, and frequently results in death of the infected horse, this is an unlikely scenario. Illegally imported zebras, mules, African, Asian, or European donkeys are all less susceptible to disease and are therefore a greater risk, however again, the possibility of illegal import while difficult to quantify, is thought unlikely.

[The current AHS outbreak in South Africa's Western Cape province reportedly started on 2 Apr 2016 and was confirmed on 7 Apr 2016. An immediate notification was submitted to the OIE on 11 Apr 2016, reporting that the serotyping results were pending. A follow-up report, officially notifying the serotype (which, according to the DEFRA document above, has been found to be AHS-1, similar to cases in earlier years), is expected soon. - Mod.AS
