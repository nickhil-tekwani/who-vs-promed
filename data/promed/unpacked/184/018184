Four people have been hospitalized and 28 others made ill from outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections in 6 provinces caused by exposure to pet hedgehogs, the Public Health Agency of Canada said. According to the agency's investigations, 32 cases of the illness resulted from having direct or indirect contact with the pet beforehand. The outbreak of cases has been reported in 6 provinces: British Columbia (3), Alberta (6), Saskatchewan (1), Ontario (4), Quebec (17) and New Brunswick (1).

Hedgehogs can carry _Salmonella_, so kissing, cuddling or touching them and their environment can put you at risk, the agency says. The health agency noted that 31% of cases occurred in children 10 years of age and younger. It said _Salmonella_ can be especially threatening to children under 5 years of age, so make sure to supervise them around the pet.

Investigators are trying to determine whether there is a common source between the infected hedgehogs and will update as the investigation evolves.

[Other sources confirmed that the serotype involved in this outbreak was Typhimurium, the same as the one linked to hedgehogs in the USA in 2020. A hedgehog is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae, in the eulipotyphlan family Erinaceidae. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera found through parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and in New Zealand by introduction. A number of outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been linked to contact with these animals. - Mod.LL
