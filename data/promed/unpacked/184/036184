Thai Nguyen health authorities have reported an increase in rabies infection after many people were bitten by stray dogs. "This year [2015], 4 people have died due to rabies, including a 3 year old boy. He was attacked and badly injured by a stray dog and died a few days after being treated," Pham Quyet Thang, deputy director of the preventive health center in the Northern Province, said.

The center reported that 3145 people in the province have been bitten by stray dogs between January and March [2015] and that it has repeatedly received reports about stray dogs suspected of being rabid. Thang said local authorities have issued warnings about rabies and set up task forces to kill suspicious-looking stray dogs.

The center has set up 7 stations to provide rabies vaccines. "The treatment cost of VND 1-2 million [USD 46-92] has been a major problem, leading to painful and unwanted consequences," Thang said.

Pham Ngoc Quan, deputy director of the province Animal Health Agency, said people always send samples to his center when they kill a stray dog. "Every sample has tested positive for rabies." Dr Hoang Anh, Thang's boss, said the only way to avoid death after being bitten by a rabid dog is to get vaccinated. "In case of serious and multiple bites, the patient should be treated with a combination of vaccine and serum."

In Viet Nam, more than 60 000 people were bitten by dogs and cats in 2014, of whom 14 died of rabies.

Rabies kills about 55 000 people a year worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, which said children under 15 are the commonest victims. Traditionally, Vietnamese families have raised dogs to guard their homes or for food. According to the General Statistics Office, there are around 10 million dogs in the country.

[Rabies is endemic in Viet Nam. According to the newswire above 3145 people in the province have been bitten by stray dogs between January and March [2015] and 4 have died of rabies. The commonest lyssavirus present is genotype 1 (rabies virus, RABV), with human infections being mostly due to its canine biotype iii.

According to the OIE World Animal Health Information Database, in 2011, Viet Nam indicated an unknown number of dog rabies cases. The following year, 2012, 86 rabies cases in dogs were reported, while 239 651 animals were routinely vaccinated. In 2013, there were 105 dog rabies cases, and 10 895 ring vaccinations (http://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/Rabies_CP_Vietnam_09_2014.pdf).

It is recognized that dog bite incidences originate from an increased number of stray dog population in Viet Nam.
