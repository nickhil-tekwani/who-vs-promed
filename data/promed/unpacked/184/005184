Botulism from home-canned bamboo shoots, Nan Province, Thailand, March 2006
-----------------------------------------------
On 15 Mar 2006, multiple persons with symptoms of nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and dyspnea visited the emergency department at Baan
Luang district hospital in Nan province, Thailand; one person
required mechanical ventilation. A team from the Bureau of
Epidemiology, Department of Disease Control, Thailand Ministry of
Public Health (MOPH) initiated an investigation in collaboration with
the Surveillance and Rapid Response Team from Baan Luang district.
This report summarizes the investigation conducted during 15-26 Mar
2006, which determined that the outbreak was caused by foodborne
botulism from home-canned bamboo shoots and affected 163 rural
villagers who shared a common meal. The last case was identified on
21 Mar 2006; no further cases of foodborne botulism have been
identified in the region.
On 14 Mar 2006, an annual religious rite was observed in Nawaimai
village, Pakaluang subdistrict, Baan Luang district, Nan province.
Villagers from Pakaluang and neighboring subdistricts joined the
event. That day, several persons who attended the festival visited
local health-care providers with symptoms of gastroenteritis.
Personnel from the MOPH Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP)
were notified of a possible foodborne outbreak on 15 Mar 2006.
Illnesses progressed to include bulbar muscle paralysis, with
respiratory depression requiring ventilatory support in 3 patients,
at which time a botulism outbreak was suspected. A quick door-to-door
survey conducted by village volunteers identified 354 villagers who
had attended the event, of whom 200 (56 percent) ate food served at
the event.
A case was defined as one or more symptoms (abdominal pain, colicky
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sweating, dry mouth,
dysphagia, diplopia, ptosis, weakness of extremities, and dyspnea) of
food poisoning in a person who attended the religious rite. Active
case finding among health facilities and communities in the affected
districts was initiated; all provinces were asked to report patients
with similar symptoms. During 15-26 Mar 2006, a total of 163 persons
(82 percent of the 200 persons who ate at the festival) had illness
consistent with the case definition. The median age of ill persons
was 45 years (range: 13-75 years); 113 (69 percent) were female. The
1st patient had illness onset at 2:00 p.m. on 14 Mar 2006, and 87 (53
percent) patients had illness onset on 15 Mar 2006 (Figure 1) [for
figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]. The last patient had illness
onset on 18 Mar 2006.
Of the 163 persons with illness, 141 (86.5 percent) were admitted to
area hospitals. All 141 hospitalized patients and 10 patients treated
as outpatients were systematically queried about their symptoms
(Figure 2). The majority of those patients experienced abdominal pain
(116; 76.8 percent), dry mouth (76; 50.3 percent), and nausea (76;
50.3 percent); some had dysphagia (52; 37.7 percent), vomiting (53;
35.1 percent), diplopia (26; 17.2 percent), ptosis (16; 10.6
percent), and weakness of extremities (14; 9.3 percent). 42 (29.8
percent) of the hospitalized patients required mechanical ventilation.
Local public health officials and FETP epidemiologists interviewed
145 of 200 persons who attended the festival by using a standard
questionnaire to assess food consumed and possible illness. Food
served at the religious rite included home-canned bamboo shoots eaten
with chili and shrimp paste, wax gourds, chicken curry, sticky rice,
water, and ice. Home-canned bamboo shoots were the only item eaten by
100 percent of affected persons, although bamboo shoots were
routinely consumed with the chili and shrimp paste. The bamboo shoots
had been produced locally by a women's group in the village. The
shoots had been processed in 20 liter cans with approximately 13 kg
of shoots per can. A total of 53 cans were produced during September
2005; 46 cans were sold during September 2005 - February 2006,
primarily in the district where they were made. No other recent
reports of similar illness in the area occurred before this outbreak.
The morning of the day of the festival, bamboo shoots from 2 cans had
been combined, washed and sliced into pieces, and placed into plastic
bags before being distributed at lunch. A food preparer reported that
one of the 2 cans of bamboo shoots appeared turbid before mixing, but
the bamboo shoots were not discarded.
On the basis of clinical manifestations of the patients and results
of the epidemiologic investigation, the most probable cause of
illness was botulinum toxin from _Clostridium botulinum_. Samples of
the leftover canned bamboo shoots were cultured by the MOPH
Department of Medical Sciences on 20 Mar 2006 and grew _C. botulinum_
on 24 Mar 2006. On 10 Apr 2006, multiplex polymerase chain reaction
identified toxin type A. Thai and CDC scientists are collaborating to
test patient specimens, including serum, vomitus, and gastric fluid.
Because of the cluster of patients with symptoms consistent with
botulism, the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation,
and the progression of disease in several villagers, MOPH requested
assistance from international partners in obtaining botulism
antitoxin; no local source of antitoxin was available. 20 vials of
heptavalent antitoxin (A-G) were provided by the UK Department of
Health with assistance from the WHO, 50 vials of bivalent antitoxin
(A, B) were donated by CDC, and 23 vials of trivalent antitoxin (A,
B, E) were donated by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases
in Japan. Thailand purchased an additional 10 vials of bivalent
antitoxin (A, B) from a Canadian company. Antitoxin was administered
to patients with the most severe symptoms; 70 vials were administered
on 19 and 20 Mar 2006, and the last of the 93 vials used was
administered on 23 Mar 2006. Although published data suggest that
antitoxin is most effective if administered within the 1st 24 hours
of illness onset (1), botulism antitoxin was administered to patients
later in the course of illness to halt the progression of paralysis
and potentially shorten the duration of illness. A study to assess
the short- and long-term outcomes of a subset of patients is under
way.
On 21 Mar 2006, a team of critical care specialists (pulmonologists,
a neurologist, and a toxicologist) from Bangkok traveled to Nan
province to assess the respiratory care capabilities in the province.
Because patients with severe botulism might remain on a ventilator
for a month or longer, requiring round-the-clock care, 26 patients
were transferred on 22 Mar 2006 by the Thai Air Force to neighboring
provincial hospitals and to tertiary care hospitals in Bangkok for
long-term respiratory care. As of 10 Apr 2006, a total of 25 patients
remained hospitalized, and 9 (36 percent) were still on respirators;
no patients had died.

MMWR Editorial Note:
-------------------------
In 1998, a smaller outbreak of botulism associated with home-canned
bamboo shoots was reported in the same Thai province (2).
Recommendations for home- canned food production were disseminated
widely to all provinces. However, this recurrence 8 years later
indicates the importance of long-term follow up and continuous
inspection and assurance of the quality of food canning.
As a result of this investigation, MOPH recommended increasing
control of home- canned food production in all provinces and
strengthening surveillance for foodborne botulism. The provincial
government prohibited sale of all leftover cans and advised the
population to buy only Thai Food and Drug Administration-approved,
commercially canned food products, to boil home-canned bamboo shoots
for 10 minutes before eating, and to discard cans with defects (e.g.,
dents, swelling, discoloration, rust, or foul smell). Warnings about
the outbreak were issued through local radio stations and the
internet, with educational messages about proper preparation of
bamboo shoots for home canning. On 20 Mar 2006, health officials
collected 21 leftover cans and approximately 550 plastic bags of
bamboo shoots from 3 producers in Baan Luang district. In addition,
provincial health officials are strengthening surveillance activities
for botulism; a notice was sent to all hospitals and district health
centers to urge clinicians and public health professionals to report
any persons with signs or symptoms consistent with botulism. Local
health authorities will continue to monitor persons who ate the
shared meal until all signs of associated illness have resolved.
The current outbreak tested the rapid response capabilities of
several countries. Surveillance and Rapid Response Teams in Thailand,
who are trained to detect and respond to public health emergencies,
were rapidly deployed. A quick assessment identified a large
foodborne outbreak with no malicious intent suspected (3). In
addition, the WHO and CDC rapidly identified and procured sources of
antitoxin. This outbreak response highlights the importance of
communication and collaboration between local health authorities and
international health agencies.
