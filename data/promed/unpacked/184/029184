A parasite spread through fecal matter apparently is to blame for
dozens of dead or very weak mule deer in and around Roundup.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks [FWP] biologists have fielded
numerous reports in recent weeks of mule deer with extreme diarrhea in
and around Roundup. Many of those mule deer have died.

Jennifer Ramsey of Bozeman, FWP's wildlife veterinarian, said
necropsies on several of the dead deer revealed an extreme number of
parasitic trichostrongylid worms and eggs -- enough to seriously
disable deer and kill young animals. Diarrhea caused by the parasites
results in dehydration, emaciation, and anemia, which can be fatal,
particularly to young deer, she said.

The parasitic worms specifically attack ruminants -- or animals with
split hooves and multiple-chambered stomachs, Ramsey said. Those
include deer, elk, antelope, moose, goats, sheep, and cattle. The
parasites occur naturally in such animals and become debilitating or
fatal only when they reach extremely high numbers in an animal's
stomach.

The worms spread between animals through fecal matter, Ramsey said.
They reach fatal concentrations when infected animals eat grass or
browse that is covered with infected fecal matter.

Artificial concentration of deer in and around Roundup is
contributing to the problem as wildlife congregates around scarce food
sources, including livestock feed grounds and places where people have
left food for them, FWP wildlife biologist Jay Newell of Roundup said.
Deer are more susceptible to parasites at this time of year because
they are emerging from a long winter, he said.

While the parasite could spread to livestock, Ramsey said, most
farmers and ranchers routinely treat their herds with a dewormer that
stops the disease. Trichostrongylosis infection in humans, dogs, and
cats is quite rare in the United States and easily treated with
inexpensive medicine, Ramsey said. To catch the parasitic disease, she
said, a person or pet would have to directly consume unwashed
vegetables or water that was contaminated with deer feces. Normal,
reasonable hygiene, such as washing hands, prevents spread of the
parasite to humans, she said.

[The trichostrongilus group of nematodes is quite large, including
such well known culprits as _Haemonchus contortus_; _Trichostrongylus
colubriformis_; _Teladorsagia circumcincta_, and _Ostertagi_ spp. and
_Cooperia_ spp. There are cases in cattle where 'trichostrongylid
nematodes have been particularly difficult in herds of calves, so it
may not be unexpected in cervids.

Often, if the worm burden is high, the copper level is low. Cervids
generally require more copper than domestic cattle. Consequently, if
the animals are marginal on copper, which likely affects the
immunological status, and stressed further with a shortage of
forage/forbs or difficult weather patterns, then copper may be further
reduced in the presence of the nematodes.

Breaking this nematode cycle in the wildlife is not as easy as
breaking it in domestic animals. - Mod.TG]

[Intestinal infection with _Trichostrongylus spp._ can also occur in
humans and is most common in the Middle East. - Mod.LM]
