Sheep and goat plague outbreak in Turkey close to border with Bulgaria
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Veterinary Service announced special measures to prevent
an outbreak of sheep and goat plague, following reports on a focus of
the disease 120 km from Bulgaria's border with Turkey, said Dr. Kiril
Kirov, Director General of the National Veterinary Service, adding
that no official information had been received from Turkey.
This is the 1st time that European Turkey, more specifically, the
town of Kesan in the Edirne region [Thrace], has seen an outbreak of
the disease. The sick animals, and those animals in contact with
them, have been slaughtered. Circle vaccination has been done.
Bulgaria has never registered sheep and goat plague cases.
The National Veterinary Service has banned grazing in a 500-metre
strip along the border with Turkey and within 2 km of the transit
roads between the 2 countries. Veterinarians have to check out sheep
and goats twice a week in the regions of Haskovo, Sliven, and
Bourgas. The mayors of the 3 regions are to update the listing of
small ruminant flocks.
No animals are imported from Turkey into Bulgaria, Kirov said.

[PPR (Peste des petit ruminants), until recently an OIE List A
disease, occurs in most African countries south of the Sahara and
north of the equator, including countries of the Horn of Africa.
Since the late 1980's, the (clinical) disease has gradually spread to
the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, reported by Iran, Iraq,
Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the
United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. A survey in Syria has shown the
existence of PPR infection. The disease spread eastwards; outbreaks
of PPR are now known to be common in India, Nepal, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It causes considerable economic losses,
mortality -- particularly in goats -- sometimes exceeding 50 percent
in infected flocks.
PPR virus type N4, dated 1996, has been sequenced in Turkey. The
presence of the same virus type has been demonstrated in Bangladesh
in 1993, India in 1994-96, Nepal in 1995, Pakistan in 1994, Iran in
1994, Saudi Arabia in 1994, and Israel in 1993, 1994 & 1995. A map,
showing the world distribution of reported PPR outbreaks during 2003,
can be seen at the OIE web-site
<http://oie.int/eng/info/en_presdistribgeo.htm>.
Wildlife does not seem to play a significant role in the epidemiology
of PPR; the disease does not infect humans.
In September 1997, a national research program based on
serosurveillance was launched in Turkey to determine the distribution
of PPR. The disease became notifiable in Turkey in October 1997.
According to Turkey's monthly reports, cases of PPR have been
recorded in sheep and goats in each of the 1st 9 months of 2004,
totaling 30 outbreaks so far. The total number for 2003 was 13. None
of these reported outbreaks occurred in Thrace.
Turkey reported to the OIE that, during 2003, about 656 000
susceptible sheep and goats have been vaccinated with a homologous
PPR vaccine. Reportedly, "zoning" has been added, in 2003, to the
previously applied control measures. It would be helpful to obtain
information on the referred zone (probably Thrace, the European part
of Turkey) and whether the said zone has been regarded, so far, free
of PPR by the authorities.
The Thrace area is regarded as an FMD buffer zone between Turkey and
Europe. For decades, livestock there has been subjected to periodical
testing for FMD, in close cooperation with the European Commission
for FMD. Results of recent serological tests in Thrace for FMD, and
official Turkish confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the Bulgarian
allegations regarding PPR there, are of importance. - Mod.AS].
