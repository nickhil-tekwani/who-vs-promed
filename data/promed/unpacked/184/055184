A trail run near the California coast may have led a woman to contract a horrifying infection with a rare parasitic eye worm.

The woman is only the 2nd person known to have contracted this particular worm, which typically infects cows, according to a new report of the case, published [22 Oct 2019] in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases [see reference 1 below].

The 68-year-old woman lives in Nebraska but spends her winters in California in an area called Carmel Valley. The inland valley located about 13 miles (21 kilometers) from the coast is known for its wineries and hiking trails.

She was there in March 2018 when she felt irritation in her right eye and so flushed the eye with tap water. That's when a 0.5-inch (1.3 centimeters), wriggly roundworm came out. After this discovery, she looked more closely at her eye and saw a 2nd roundworm, which she also removed, the report said.

The next day, the woman went straight to an eye doctor in Monterey, California, who retrieved a 3rd roundworm (also known as a nematode) from the woman's eye and preserved the worm in formaldehyde. The doctor told the woman to continue to flush her eye with distilled water to remove any more worms. She was given a topical medication to prevent any bacterial infections from taking hold.

The preserved worm sample was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where researchers determined that the woman was infected with a species of eye worm called _Thelazia gulosa_. Only one other human case of _T. gulosa_ has ever been reported, in a 26-year-old Oregon woman who became infected in August 2016, Live Science previously reported. The worm usually infects cattle and is carried by certain types of face flies that consume eye secretions.

She added that she distinctly remembers a particular run in Carmel Valley in February 2018 during which she rounded the corner of a steep trail and ran into a swarm of flies, the report said. She remembered "swatting the flies from her face and spitting them out of her mouth," the report said, and this may have been the moment she was infected.

The standard treatment for worms like these is to simply remove them, although in some cases, doctors use an anti-parasitic drug called ivermectin to treat eye worms. In the woman's case, treatment with ivermectin was considered but postponed. Instead, the woman irrigated her eyes for 2 more weeks. After that, her eye irritation went away and no more worms were found, the report said.

Having a 2nd human case of _T. gulosa_ occur within 2 years of the 1st case "suggest[s] that this may represent an emerging zoonotic disease in the United States," the authors of the case study wrote. (A zoonotic disease is one that jumps from animals to people.)

This species of eye worm has been known to infect cows in North American since the 1940s, but it remains unclear why doctors are only now seeing human cases, the report said.

It may be that _T. gulosa_ infections are becoming more common in domestic cows, resulting in "spillover" events in humans, the authors wrote. However, there's no way to officially track _T. gulosa_ cases in cows, so researchers don't know if the infection rate is really increasing.

The authors also note that, in the particular worm they examined from the Nebraska case, they saw eggs developing, "indicating that humans are suitable hosts for the reproduction of _T. gulosa_," they wrote.

The researchers recommended that future studies survey cattle for cases of _T. gulosa_, keeping track of where they are occurring. This data would suggest which regions of the US are more likely to see human infections. Doctors should also continue to look out for human cases of _T. gulosa_.

[Spirurid nematodes in the genus _Thelazia_ are primarily veterinary parasites, but may occasionally infect humans. The majority of zoonotic infections involve _T. callipaeda_ (the Oriental eye worm). _T. californiensis_ (the California eye worm) and _T. gulosa_ (the cattle eyeworm) are less common causative agents (CDC https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/thelaziasis/index.html).

Another nematode occasionally transmitted to humans is _Dirofilaria repens_, a filarial nematode that affects dogs and other carnivores such as cats, wolves, coyotes, foxes, and sea lions, as well as muskrats. It is transmitted by mosquitoes and is common in Russia with sporadic cases in the rest of Europe (2,3).

In conclusion: the case is unusual but not unheard of. It is transmitted by flies and the notion that it is an emerging infection must be based on the assumption that humans are increasingly in contact with the vector. - Mod.EP
