EU report says flu virus isolates still well matched to vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------
The latest technical report on influenza viruses from the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [see item (2) below],
based on 250 specimens received from European countries from February
to June [2011], shows that although the viruses varied genetically,
those that predominate remain quite well matched to the currently
recommended vaccine. Specifically, all 2009 H1N1 virus groups
represented show antigenic similarity to the A/California/7/2009
vaccine virus, and viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage remain
genetically and antigenically similar to the B/Brisbane/60/2008
vaccine virus. Isolates of influenza A/H3N2 and of the B/Yamagata
lineage also continued to be received but neither appeared to fall
outside current vaccine coverage.

ECDC updates its technical document on influenza virus
characterisation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Today [12 Aug 2011], the ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control] published its technical document on influenza virus
characterisation. Since the last influenza virus characterisation
report, 250 virus specimens collected from February to June 2011 have
been received from EU and EU-affiliated countries. More specifically,
influenza A(H1N1)pdm, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B/Victoria- and
B/Yamagata-lineage viruses have been characterised genetically and
antigenically. Some of the findings are:

- Recently isolated A(H1N1)pdm [also designated A(H1N1) 2009] viruses
continue to fall into several genetic groups but all groups show
antigenic similarity to the currently recommended vaccine virus
A/California/7/2009.
- A(H3N2) viruses fall into distinct genetic groups but there is no
consistent correlation of altered antigenicity with any genetic group,
compared with the vaccine virus A/Perth/16/2009.
- Influenza B viruses of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage predominate over
those of the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage. Most of the B/Victoria/2/87
lineage viruses remain genetically and antigenically similar to the
currently recommended vaccine virus B/Brisbane/60/2008.
- The majority of influenza B viruses of the B/Yamagata-lineage are in
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 genetic clade but viruses received from 3
countries with Baltic coastlines fall within a different genetic
clade.

well-matched to the influenza viruses that have been circulating in
Europe during the past winter. - Mod.CP]
