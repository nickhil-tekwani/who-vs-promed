[The L type atypical BSE is one the 3 newer forms that have been
identified by active screening programs for BSE; H type atypical BSE
and atypical Scrapie are also included. The only BSE form proven to
cause disease in humans is the classical BSE which can lead to nVCJD
in humans. None of the other forms have yet been regard as causing
disease in humans, although there might be some zoonotic potential
for the atypical types of BSE, L and H. For more details, please see
the European Food Safety Agency Report: Joint Scientific Opinion on
any possible epidemiological or molecular association between TSEs in
animals and humans at
<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/1945.htm>.

The Netherlands had a case last fall, and a single case in 2008, 2006
and 2005. It is not surprising and in fact, reassuring to see an
occasional case of BSE being picked up by the TSE surveillance
programs in place. We should expect to see several more cases in
different countries over the next years. - Mod.PC]
