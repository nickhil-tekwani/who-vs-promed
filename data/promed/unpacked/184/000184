The [Egyptian] Ministry of Health and Population declared a state of emergency in 36 air, sea and land ports as part of efforts to guard the country against viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), a Tuesday [21 Nov 2017] press statement read.

The ministry has directed the activation of preventive and surveillance systems after news has circulated regarding cases of VHF in the eastern Sudanese city of Kassala. Sudanese press outlets reported last week that VHF cases increased among the population this year [2017] to reach over 70 cases until October [2017].

According to Medhat Qandil, director of the Quarantine Department at the Cairo International Airport, authorities will be screening Sudanese passengers for possible cases of VHF.

Last week, medical sources told Sudanese press that 2 cases of persons suffering from hemorrhagic fever had died at Kassala Hospital about 2 weeks [earlier], bringing the total number of deaths to 3 in one month.

Qandil added that the Marburg virus, a VHF virus, has a case fatality rate of up to 50 per cent. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it can be transmitted to people from animals, mosquitoes and human contact. [Mosquitoes are not involved with Marburg virus transmission but are involved in yellow fever virus transmission, another hemorrhagic disease. - Mod.TY]

For his part, Khaled Megahed, official spokesman of the Health Ministry, told Egypt Today that Egypt is completely safe and has not registered a single VHF case so far. Megahed also added that medication for VHF cases is available and is administered for free if any VHF case is confirmed. He asserted that Egypt takes the necessary precautions and procedures to fortify against plagues and infectious diseases from at least 108 countries.

Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of illnesses caused by 4 families of viruses; these include the Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, and yellow fever viruses. Amr Qandil, head of the Health Ministry's preventive medicine sector, affirmed that Egypt has an impervious epidemiological surveillance system that secures the country against the threat of epidemic and infectious diseases.

Last month [October 2017], the Ugandan Ministry of Health notified WHO of a confirmed outbreak of Marburg virus disease in the Kween district of eastern Uganda. The Ministry of Health officially declared the outbreak in October 2017, when 5 cases were reported.

As described by WHO, VHF viruses are severe and life-threatening viral diseases that are of particular public health importance because they can spread within a hospital setting, have a high case fatality rate, and are difficult to recognize and detect rapidly. VHF viruses have common features of affecting many organs, damaging the blood vessels and affecting the body's ability to regulate itself.

[The previous report stated that 5 haemorrhagic fever patients were being treated at the Kassala hospital on Saturday 4 Nov 2017 and indicated that: "Dozens of other patients are being treated at home after being seen by doctors in their private clinics."

The above report indicates that there are over 70 VHF cases up to October 2017, but does not give the dates within which the cases occurred this year (2017). As noted earlier, it is urgent that the etiological agent(s) responsible for these hemorrhagic fever cases be identified so that surveillance in the areas where the patients acquired their infections can be determined, preventive measures implemented, and community education initiated.

Ebola, Marburg and Lassa fever viruses can be transmitted between an infected and a susceptible individual. Yellow fever virus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and has caused outbreaks in Sudan in the recent past. Other viruses such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever and the bacterium that is the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever should be included in laboratory diagnostic tests. ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information about these cases and their etiology as it becomes available.

There have been undiagnosed outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in the region before. In 2016, there was an outbreak in neighboring South Sudan. Unfortunately, despite the efforts of several reference laboratories, the etiological agent of that South Sudan hemorrhagic fever outbreak was not determined. Several possible viruses were discarded by laboratory tests. In 1999, an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease occurred in the southern part of Sudan due to infections with the bacterium _Borrelia recurrentis_, the cause of louse-borne relapsing fever. - Mod.TY
