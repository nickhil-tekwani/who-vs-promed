Over 8000 people in 15 villages in Kagera region are in dire need of food relief following the outbreak of banana bacterial disease that has destroyed 90 per cent of the banana crop.

Agriculture, Food and Cooperatives deputy minister Adam Malima said the disease was diagnosed for the 1st time [in the country] in September 2005 in Muleba district [of Kagera region; see ProMED-mail post 20070418.1277]. "Right now, the disease has spread in all districts of Kagera region and is also affecting districts in Mara, Mwanza and Kigoma regions."

He also stated that a team of experts will be dispatched in the area to address the problem.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to _Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 per cent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation), use of certified clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen. However, these measures may be difficult to implement with smallholders.

BXW 1st appeared in Uganda in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162) and has been spreading in the region since then. According to the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), it is present in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, DR Congo, and Burundi. In Tanzania, BXW continues to spread since its 1st detection (ProMED-mail posts 20070418.1277 and 20100416.1234), and from the report above, it is not clear what, if any, disease management measures are being implemented in the country.
