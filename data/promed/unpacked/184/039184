Abstract
--------
Objective: To review the evidence on the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 mortality.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, Global Health, and World Health Organization COVID-19 database (preprints).

Eligibility criteria for study selection: Observational and interventional studies that assessed the effectiveness of public health measures in reducing the incidence of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and COVID-19 mortality.

Main outcome measures: The main outcome measure was incidence of COVID-19. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 mortality.

Data synthesis: DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of COVID-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I2 metrics, with 2-tailed P values.

Results: 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a "package of interventions." Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of COVID-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I sq = 12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I sq = 84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I sq = 87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively.

Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing, are associated with reductions in the incidence of COVID-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of COVID-19 vaccination.

[2] Risks associated with contact networks
Date: Wed 17 Nov 2021

https://www.news-medical.net/news/20211117/Effect-of-contact-networks-on-SARS-CoV-2-transmission-and-control.aspx


The emergence of the highly communicable delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has compelled scientists to analyze the risk created by the increased social contacts, primarily in large-scale events as various countries have withdrawn the pandemic restrictions. With the increase in mass immunity against SARS-CoV-2 due to vaccination drives, various countries are moving back to their pre-pandemic life. Various revenue-generating activity settings like conferences, exhibitions, meetings, and cruises pose a high risk of contact rates, leading to an outbreak.

Therefore, the event planners need to have some interventions to safely resume their activities, which also helps policymakers maintain a balance between public health and economic gains. Since there have been reports of the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant infecting vaccinated individuals, many countries are using rapid antigen tests, mask mandates, vaccine certifications, and digital contact tracing devices along with routine vaccination to mitigate viral transmission.

A study recently published on the medRxiv preprint server demonstrated that the social contacts created in different activity settings affect interventions needed to control outbreaks.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, "cruises to nowhere" were the safest alternative to travel in Singapore, where different activities and setting-specific interactions were planned. The researchers collected the contact data from around 1000 crew and 1300 passengers per sailing between November 2020 and 13 Feb 2021 and assessed the subsequent social interaction networks. These contact networks were used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 delta variant outbreaks and analyze the impact of different combinations of interventions and network formulations on transmission in different settings during a large gathering.

Throughout the study, cruises were operating at half the capacity of passengers and crew members. It was also mandatory to maintain a physical distance of at least one meter among different travel groups. The following interventions were included during the study: (i) one-off PCR testing a day before sailing, (ii) rapid antigen testing at the beginning and middle of the event, (iii) mask mandates in possible settings, and (iv) vaccination coverage among participants.

The data from the study show that 25 passengers had a median of 20 unique close contacts per day, and more than 60% of their contact episodes happened in sports or dining areas where mask mandate was not applicable. The researchers observed in simulated outbreaks that rapid antigen tests and large vaccination exposure had a greater impact than the mask obligation alone, representing the significance of combined interventions against the delta variant to minimize the risk of an outbreak.

The researchers observed that mask-free activities and faulty testing protocols could lead to a wide range of contacts with unidentified infectious individuals over a multi-day cruise, leading to a major outbreak in different settings. This social network analysis showed that passengers had several contacts who had a high number of contacts with other individuals.

Above 70% close and casual contacts were noted in food and beverage locations where the risk of infection and transmission was high due to mask-off rules and limited space. Observations from the study showed that none of the interventions analyzed were individually capable of minimizing the outbreak. All the interventions would work together to reduce the risk of infection and transmission.

The model failed to design contact tracing around detected cases. Also, the study did not consider fully asymptomatic infections. Furthermore, the passengers were instructed to carry the contact tracing devices at all times except when involved in water sports which precludes the proper representation of interactions at the water sports areas. However, the impact of this factor is very minimal in the study. Lastly, since the passenger's device may be placed in a 2-meter proximity in a cabin, recording frequent close contact interactions in these settings may not be done perfectly.

Abstract
--------
"The emergence of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 delta variant has created a need to reassess the risk posed by increasing social contacts as countries resume pre-pandemic activities, particularly in the context of resuming large-scale events over multiple days. To examine how social contacts formed in different activity settings influence interventions required to control outbreaks, we combined high-resolution data on contacts among passengers and crew on cruise ships with network transmission models. We found passengers had a median of 20 (IQR 10-36) unique close contacts per day, and over 60% of their contact episodes were made in dining or sports areas where mask wearing is typically limited. In simulated outbreaks, we found that vaccination coverage and rapid antigen tests had a larger effect than mask mandates alone, indicating the importance of combined interventions against delta to reduce event risk in the vaccine era." - Mod.LK]

[3] Healthcare workers
Date: Tue 16 Nov 2021
Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/the-mass-exodus-of-americas-health-care-workers/620713/


About one in 5 healthcare workers has left their job since the pandemic started. This is their story -- and the story of those left behind.

Since COVID-19 first pummeled the USA, Americans have been told to flatten the curve lest hospitals be overwhelmed. But hospitals have been overwhelmed. The nation has avoided the most apocalyptic scenarios, such as ventilators running out by the thousands, but it's still sleepwalked into repeated surges that have overrun the capacity of many hospitals, killed more than 762 000 people, and traumatized countless healthcare workers. "It's like it takes a piece of you every time you walk in," says [AH], a Virginia-based nurse practitioner who left her ICU after watching her grandmother die there in December [2020]. She and others have gotten through the surges on adrenaline and camaraderie, only to realize, once the ICUs are empty, that so too are they.

Some healthcare workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic, while others have been forced to leave because they've contracted long COVID and can no longer work. But many choose to leave, including "people whom I thought would nurse patients until the day they died," Amanda Bettencourt, the president-elect of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, told [the author]. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the healthcare sector has lost nearly half a million workers since February 2020. Morning Consult, a survey research company, says that 18% of healthcare workers have quit since the pandemic began, while 12% have been laid off.

Stories about these departures have been trickling out, but they might portend a bigger exodus. Morning Consult, in the same survey, found that 31% of the remaining healthcare workers have considered leaving their employer, while the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses found that 66% of acute and critical-care nurses have thought about quitting nursing entirely. "We've never seen numbers like that before," Bettencourt told me. Normally, she said, only 20% would even consider leaving their institution, let alone the entire profession. [EC], an emergency physician at Oregon Health and Science University, told [the author] that she now cringes when a colleague approaches her at the end of a shift, because she fears that they'll quietly announce their resignation too. Vineet Arora, who is dean for medical education at University of Chicago Medicine, says that "in meetings with other healthcare leaders, when we go around the room, everyone says, 'We're struggling to retain our workforce.' Nobody says, 'We're fine.'"

When national COVID hospitalizations fell in September and October [2021], it was possible to hope that the healthcare system had already endured the worst of the pandemic. But that decline is now starting to plateau, and in 17 states hospitalizations are rising. And even if the country dodges another surge over the winter, the healthcare system is hemorrhaging from the untreated wounds of the past 2 years. "In my experience, physicians are some of the most resilient people out there," [SR], a primary-care physician who left her job last October [2020], told [the author]. "When this group of people starts leaving en masse, something is very wrong."

[The attrition of healthcare workers is understandable and very sad. Support networks are needed to help them cope with this stressful situation. Time off when needed would likely also help. These individuals are invaluable to hospitals and clinics to provide good treatment of patients. - Mod.LK]
