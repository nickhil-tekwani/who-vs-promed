Abstract
--------
Adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection have been extensively characterized in blood; however, most functions of protective immunity must be accomplished in tissues. Here, we report from examination of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive organ donors (ages 10-74) that CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and B cell memory generated in response to infection is present in bone marrow, spleen, lung, and multiple lymph nodes (LNs) for up to 6 months post-infection. Lungs and lung-associated LNs were the most prevalent sites for SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T and B cells, with significant correlations between circulating and tissue-resident memory T and B cells in all sites.

We further identified SARS-CoV-2-specific germinal centers in the lung-associated LNs up to 6 months post-infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific follicular helper T cells were also abundant in lung-associated LNs and lungs. Together, the results indicate local tissue coordination of cellular and humoral immune memory against SARS-CoV-2 for site-specific protection against future infectious challenges.

Discussion
----------
...Our results directly demonstrate ongoing, persistent GC [germinal centers] responses in LNs following resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection -- including at least one example 6 months post-infection. Despite a report of potentially impaired GC responses in fatal COVID-19 (53), our data show coordinated TFH [virus-specific follicular helper T cells] and GC B cells in the lung-associated LNs to non-fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results provide evidence of ongoing GC reactions following resolution of infection, consistent with reports of prolonged evolution of humoral responses in peripheral blood up to 6 months following SARS-CoV-2 infection (3, 54). GC B cells were detected in donors spanning a broad age range -- from 10-74 years, providing compelling evidence that the ability to establish robust GC responses to novel pathogens can be maintained with age.

These results also indicate ongoing interaction and coordination between T and B cells within LNs, which we also found related to memory populations in the lung. Significant correlations were also found between SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B and T cell populations across tissue sites, consistent with correlations between virus-specific T and B cell responses in peripheral blood of previously infected individuals (1, 7). We also identified potential inverse correlations between frequencies of virus-specific CD8+T cells in the lung and memory B cells in the lung-associated LN, suggesting that lung responses in situ can impact the magnitude or requirement for humoral responses in the associated LN. Together, these findings suggest that dynamic coordination of adaptive immune responses across the body is a feature of antiviral immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

[2] Summer camp

https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2021/10/07/successful-multimodal-covid-control-in-summer-camps/?sh=3b2aa366f8e9


A new report from the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrates how using multiple COVID-19 prevention strategies at 9 US overnight summer camps was highly effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19, even in the wake of the delta variant. Among 7173 campers and staff members at 9 overnight camps between June and August 2021, there were only 9 laboratory-confirmed cases and no secondary infections detected. This is in striking contrast to many other summer camps, that used few mitigations and experienced rapid outbreaks.

This group of summer camps serves as a microcosm for how we can approach effective Covid control nationwide. The CDC report did not attribute the success of this strategy to a single modality, instead, it was the multiple layers of protection that ensured zero secondary transmission of the virus. The success of this multimodal COVID-19 control can serve as a guide for other congregate settings.

The layers of protection used by the summer camps included; vaccination (93% of eligible children were vaccinated), pre-arrival and frequent screening testing (both rapid and PCR), creating social "pods" or cohorts within the camp, masking, physical distancing, and hand hygiene through the use of sanitizing stations.

Pods began as groups of campers and staff members who shared a cabin. Pod residents were allowed to interact with each other without masking or physically distancing. Pods were then gradually merged in stages, growing from one cabin to multiple cabins, to age groups. Through this method, 3 out of 9 camps eventually reached camp-wide pod expansion.

One camp also used wastewater surveillance testing 3 times per week. Wastewater surveillance has been an underused yet cost-effective, non-invasive mass testing strategy throughout the pandemic that can detect virus shed by symptomatic and asymptomatic people alike. A study from the University of California at San Diego demonstrates that wastewater surveillance can detect COVID-19 in a single infected, asymptomatic person living or working in a multi-unit dwelling such as a college campus building. This makes wastewater surveillance a highly effective intervention for congregate living situations.

[Testing wastewater is an efficient tool to monitor COVID and certain other pathogens, on a community scale. See Kirby AE, Walters MS, Jennings WC, et al. Using wastewater surveillance data to support the COVID-19 response -- United States, 2020-2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021;70:1242-1244. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7036a2

"Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Wastewater surveillance measures community infection trends. The accuracy of this surveillance approach is independent of health care-seeking behavior, health care access, or testing capacity. The National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) is a 43-jurisdiction, CDC-coordinated system for SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance.

What is added by this report?
Wastewater surveillance data have been used to deploy clinical testing resources, investigate possible irregularities in traditional surveillance, refine health messaging, and forecast clinical resource needs.

What are the implications for public health practice?
NWSS provides community-level surveillance data that complement traditional surveillance and facilitate earlier, focused health department intervention and support in communities experiencing increasing trends in wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations. Community-level wastewater surveillance data can be leveraged for rapid assessment of emerging threats and preparedness for future pandemics.

...Approximately 40% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, shed virus RNA in their stool (2); therefore, community-level trends in SARS-CoV-2 infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic (2) can be tracked through wastewater testing (3-6). CDC launched the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) in September 2020 to coordinate wastewater surveillance programs implemented by state, tribal, local, and territorial health departments to support the COVID-19 pandemic response."

Wastewater testing could be used to monitor schools and other low incidence group situations, such as camps discussed above. - Mod.LK]

[3] Chilblains (Covid toes)
Date: Wed 6 Oct 2021

Shortly after the pandemic erupted last year, doctors were baffled by a surge of patients, mostly teenagers and young adults, who came in complaining of chilblains -- painful lesions on their toes, and sometimes also on their fingers. The condition came to be called Covid toes. They were seen, like the loss of smell and taste, as yet another strange telltale sign of the disease, even though most of the patients tested negative for coronavirus. Physicians were hard-pressed to explain the association.

The lesions are red or purple in white people, and often purplish or brownish in people of color. They cause painful burning or itching sensations, and sometimes make it difficult for people to wear shoes or walk.

Now a study from France, published in the British Journal of Dermatology, sheds some light on the causes of Covid toes. The research indicates that the lesions may be a side effect of the immune system's shift into high gear in response to exposure to the virus, which can damage cells and tissues in the process. The French researchers analyzed blood samples and skin biopsies from 50 patients who had chilblain-like lesions for the first time in April 2020, and who were referred to St-Louis Hospital in Paris. Slightly more than half of the patients had other symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, like coughing, shortness of breath and loss of smell, but all of them tested negative for the virus on PCR tests. The samples showed high levels of Type 1 interferon, a protein that activates the body's immune system to fight viruses, but which may also cause damage. The researchers also found high levels of an antibody that can inadvertently attack the body's own cells.

Abnormal changes in the linings of the blood vessels may also play a role in the lesions, the study suggests. Although the relationship between coronavirus infection and chilblain-like lesions "is still controversial," the authors wrote, the "peaks of chilblain-like lesions concomitant with peaks of COVID-19 deaths in 2020 strongly suggest that this disorder is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infection."

The explanation for Covid toes is not entirely surprising; one of the hallmark features of the disease is an immune system overreaction called a cytokine storm, which may ultimately cause more illness than the virus itself. German scientists published a paper last year [2020] saying they had found a strong localized interferon-driven response in 3 young men who came in with chilblains. That paper suggested that the men, who tested negative for the coronavirus, may have developed chilblains several weeks after an initial infection caused mild or asymptomatic disease, and that the interferon-driven immune response may have led to early control of the virus and prevented respiratory disease.

Dermatologists say that people with Covid toes generally do well and are unlikely to develop severe Covid, and that the symptoms reflect a healthy immune response to the virus. Dr Esther E Freeman, director of global health dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the new study provides insight into the links between of Covid toes and mild infection. "A lot of the studies around Covid have focused on severe Covid, and mild and moderate disease has often been overlooked," she said. "I tell my patients with Covid toes, 'It's almost like a side effect of your body doing a good job of controlling the virus.'"

The new study suggested that treating Covid toes with local or systemic anti-inflammatory agents may be effective.

Chilblains are cutaneous inflammatory erythematous papules mainly involving fingers and toes, which are thought to be triggered by cold. Most of them are idiopathic, and therefore called seasonal chilblains (SC), but they can be associated with connective tissue disease...

SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be associated with vascular skin symptoms(7) and has been shown to damage capillary endothelium and disrupt the thrombo-protective state of endothelial cells,(8) likely contributing to microvascular thrombosis.(9-11) ...

[The authors' "findings support an activation loop in the skin in CLL, which associates with endothelial alteration and immune infiltration of cytotoxic and type I IFN-polarized cells leading to clinical manifestation." - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 10 countries -- the USA (42 357), UK (34 623), Russia (29 362), Turkey (28 645), India (27 940), Brazil (16 451), Ukraine (15 908), Romania (14 019), Philippines (10 963), and Thailand (10 630) -- reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5437 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 7 Oct 2021 to late 8 Oct 2021). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 27 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 238.34 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.86 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
