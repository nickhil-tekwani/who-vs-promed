Another 63 000 Lahontan cutthroat trout were destroyed at a federal fish
hatchery Saturday after a new outbreak of the disease furunculosis,
prompted last month's killing of 350 000 of the endangered game fish there.
The latest action came after attempts to treat the cutthroat with
antibiotics failed at the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery south of
Gardnerville.
In early February, the hatchery destroyed 350 000 of the fish in an effort
to stop the spread of the disease. Another 80 000 fish had died before the
action.
Biologists had been struggling since November to treat the fish afflicted
with furunculosis, a bacteria [infection caused by bacteria] found
naturally in northern Nevada's watersheds. "We thought we had the disease
handled in February, but apparently some fish didn't take to the
antibiotics the first time and the disease stayed," Randi Thompson,
spokeswoman with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said.
Coupled with the earlier deaths, the disease claimed nearly 500 000 of the
hatchery's fingerling cutthroat in recent months. The action left the
hatchery with virtually no cutthroat until next month's arrival of 1
million eggs from Pyramid Lake, 30 miles northeast of Reno. The hatchery
raises about 600 000 cutthroat for annual release into the region's Pyramid
and Walker lakes and Truckee River.
Saturday's action was taken to help save a crucial brood stock of about 100
Pilot Peak cutthroat. They are kept in separate ponds and have not been
affected by the disease, Thompson said. In all, more than 400 000 cutthroat
were suffocated in recent weeks by an infusion of carbon dioxide pumped
into shallow water-holding tanks. Biologists theorize the bacteria
destroying the fish's organs was carried to the hatchery by birds from the
nearby east fork of the Carson River. Officials plan to begin sterilizing
the hatchery this week to prevent another outbreak of the disease.
The 63 000 carcasses will be taken Monday by Reno Rendering to be turned
into fertilizer and feed, Thompson said. Lahontan cutthroat are listed as a
threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Though protected, they
are allowed to be caught by anglers because of hatchery production programs.

[Furunculosis is caused by _Aeromonas salmonicida_, a nonmotile,
pigment-producing rod originally described as the cause of a septicemic
disease, potentially producing high mortality. In the acute form,
hemorrhages are found in the fins, tail muscles, gills, and internal
organs. In more chronic forms focal areas of swelling, hemorrhage and
tissue necrosis develop in the muscles. These lesions progress to
crateriform abscesses discharging from the skin surface (furuncles).
Liquefactive necrosis occurs in the spleen and kidney. Diagnosis is made by
isolating a pure culture of the organism. Avoidance is the most effective
prevention because _A. salmonicida_ is an obligatory fish pathogen. - Mod.TG]
[The use of fish contaminated with _A. salmonicida_ as feed is of interest.
There is a published report (Frye, F. L., An unusual epizootic of anuran
aeromoniasis, JAVMA 187:1223-4, 1985) of an epizootic of _A. salmonicida_,
normally a pathogen of teleosts, in a colony of African clawed frogs
(_Xenopus laevis_). In this report, the frog colony had been fed several
kilograms of fresh-caught salmon that had been added to the beef
heart-vitamin-mineral mix that was usually fed to the frogs. The salmon was
postulated to be the source of the epizootic. Frogs are commonly infected
with _A. hydrophila_, not _A. salmonicida_. -Man. Ed. DS]
