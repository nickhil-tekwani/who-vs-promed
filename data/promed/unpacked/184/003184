Clinical presentations and outcome of severe acute respiratory
syndrome in children

Hong Kong has been severely affected by severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS). Contact in households and health-care settings is
thought to be important for transmission, putting children at
particular risk. Most data so far, however, have been for adults. We
prospectively followed up the first 10 children with SARS managed
during the early phase of the epidemic in Hong Kong. All the children
had been in close contact with infected adults. Persistent fever,
cough, progressive radiographic changes of chest, and lymphopenia
were noted in all patients. The children were treated with high-dose
ribavirin, oral prednisolone, or intravenous methylprednisolone, with
no short-term adverse effects. 4 teenagers required oxygen therapy
and 2 needed assisted ventilation. None of the younger children
required oxygen supplementation. SARS seems to have a less aggressive
clinical course in younger children than it does in adults and
teenagers.

This short paper is a welcome addition to the growing body of
knowledge on SARS. In looking at the age distributions of reported
SARS cases where available, it is apparent that children appear to be
under-represented.
In the 25 Apr 2003 SARS bulletin produced by the Hong Kong Department
of health (see SARS - worldwide (70): cases 20030425.1013 and data
available at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>) 6 percent of reported cases were
less than 15 years of age, and an additional 11 percent of reported
cases were between 15 and 24 years of age. This observed lower
incidence of SARS in younger age groups may very well indicate that
they exhibit milder clinical illness that is not being recognized as
SARS. This issue awaits a definitive laboratory diagnostic testing
process that will allow for an identification of infected individuals
who may not have clinical illness. At that time, a serosurvey of the
general population will allow for a cross-sectional look at the
proportion of individuals with evidence of infection, by age group
and history of clinical illness during the period of the SARS
outbreak in the area.
In this article/letter, there is mention short-term ribavirin with
steroids as the treatment protocol. Readers are reminded that,
effective yesterday (28 Apr 2003 - see SARS -worldwide (77): cases
20030428.1048 ), Health Canada has withdrawn the use of ribavirin for
the routine treatment of SARS, and the drug will be available only
for use as part of clinical trials. "After reviewing the existing
anecdotal clinical experience with ribavirin, negative results from
in vitro testing with ribavirin against the SARS-related coronavirus,
and knowledge of reports of serious and unexpected adverse drug
reactions, the working group reached a consensus that there is no
data to support the continued use of ribavirin outside of clinical
trials at this time."
