Tularemia is considered endemic in Sweden but occurs usually only as sporadic cases. Some years, such as in 2012 and now 2015, there is a larger outbreak of disease in hares and humans, usually late in the summer season.

Since July this year [2015], an unusually high number of dead mountain hares (_Lepus timidus_) have been noted in the coastal area of northern Sweden, in the counties of Norrbotten and Vasterbotten. In the past month, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (http://www.sva.se) has received over 120 reports of single or multiple dead hares from this area, with a focus around the city of Lulea [map at http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/europe/sweden/].

Ten hares submitted so far to SVA from the area were all positive for tularemia in the PCR-analysis. A high number of human cases of tularemia have also been registered in the same region (ref. Public Health Agency of Sweden).

SVA performs wildlife disease surveillance and has research projects regarding tularemia in wildlife, so the public is encouraged to report sick or dead hares or rodents to SVA. Also, in neighboring areas of northern Finland (Uleaborg area), the veterinary institute EVIRA reports many cases of tularemia (http://www.evira.fi).

[According to Sweden's reports to the OIE, the most recent outbreak of tularemia in domestic animals (rabbits) was recorded in 2006. No information on infections in wild animals (hares) has been reported in the annual reports to the OIE.

During the last 5 years, tularemia has been ranked 3rd among the 10 zoonoses diagnosed in humans, as reported to the OIE, with the following figures (human cases):
2010 - 484; 2011 - 350; 2012 - 590; 2013 - 118; 2014 - 150.

The full list of zoonoses in Sweden for 2014 is presented for comparative assessment (no deaths reported in 2014):

Campylobacteriosis - 8288
Salmonellosis - 2213
Tularemia - 150
Listeriosis - 125
_Escherichia coli_ O157 - 56
Echinococcosis/hydatidosis - 21
Brucellosis - 16
Avian chlamydiosis - 12
Leptospirosis - 6
Q fever - 2
Trichinellosis - 1
Botulism - 1

The following [edited] summary on tularemia in animals is derived from OIE's manual (chapter 2.1.18, updated 2008):

"Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by _Francisella tularensis_. The causative bacterium is a Gram-negative coccoid rod, non-motile and non-spore-forming organism that is an obligate aerobe with optimal growth at 37 C [98.6 F]. It occurs naturally in lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) and in rodents, especially microtine rodents (such as voles, vole rats and muskrats), and beavers. A wide range of other mammals and several species of birds have also been reported to be infected. Among domestic animals, the cat seems to be able to act as a carrier of the bacterium.

Two types of _F. tularensis_ are recognised on the basis of cultural characteristics, epidemiology, and virulence in some hosts. Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _Francisella tularensis subsp. tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs [rabbits & hares] in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits, and most of the isolates ferment glycerol. _Francisella tularensis subsp. palaearctica_ (Type B) occurs mainly in aquatic rodents (beavers, muskrats) in northern North America, and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia. It may be water- or arthropod-borne, is less virulent to humans and rabbits, and does not ferment glycerol.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread by contact with infected animals or environmental fomites, by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.

The disease is characterised by fever, depression and septicaemia. In humans, there may be ulcers or abscesses at the site of inoculation (this is rarely seen in animals), and swelling of the regional lymph nodes. On post-mortem examination, lesions may include caseous necrosis of lymph nodes and multiple greyish-white foci of necrosis in the spleen, liver, bone marrow and lungs. The spleen is usually enlarged. It is important to understand that there is a high risk of direct infection of humans by direct contact with this organism. Special precautions, including the wearing of gloves, masks and eyeshields are, therefore, recommended when handling infective materials. The facility should meet the requirements for Containment Group 3 pathogens."
