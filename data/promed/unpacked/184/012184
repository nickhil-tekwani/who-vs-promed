South Dakota cattle producers are encouraged to include anthrax vaccine in their vaccination program when they turn cattle out to summer pastures this spring [2012], said Dr Russ Daly, SDSU [South Dakota State University] Extension veterinarian, and Dr Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota state veterinarian. "Anthrax is a disease of cattle and other ruminants that results in sudden death in affected animals. It is also a potential human pathogen," said Daly, who also serves as the state public health veterinarian.

While the anthrax risk has been well documented in many parts of South Dakota and anthrax vaccination of cattle is routine in those areas, it is not always possible to predict where cases might occur. For this reason, Daly is encouraging South Dakota producers to use anthrax vaccine in their herds going to summer pastures.

Daly said flooding is an environmental factor that might aid in making the anthrax spores available to cattle. Cattle going onto pastures that have experienced flooding or into areas where anthrax has been documented should especially be candidates for vaccine. "Flooding disrupts the soil, washing up anthrax spores from lower soil levels. These spores then may be deposited on grass or other forage for the cows to eat after the pasture dries up and warm temperatures occur," he said. He said 2011 flooding might increase the risk of cattle coming in contact with anthrax this season. "The flooding experienced by many South Dakota rivers in 2011 created the possibility that anthrax spores that have been hidden for many years may now be made more available to cattle now able to graze those previously flooded areas," Daly said.

During the summer, producers should take the time to check all cattle frequently, Oedekoven said. "Cattle producers need to promptly investigate any unexpected deaths on pasture, whether in cows, bulls, or calves," Oedekoven said. "With anthrax and many other diseases, treatments and preventive measures are available, and prompt action can help prevent excessive losses." If a producer suspects anthrax, Oedekoven said, the case should be reported immediately to local veterinarians or to the state veterinarian at 605-773-3321. "Local veterinarians are excellent sources of information for cattle producers regarding anthrax," Oedekoven said.

[Russ is absolutely correct. Flood water can float spores up from a buried anthrax carcass -- the spores are naturally hydrophobic so the rising water table will push them to the surface. There they can be embedded in the forage rootmass, just waiting to be pulled up and eaten by a grazing cow, or even contaminate the forage itself. Flooding also can wash away buried carcasses and the spores get transported downstream and spread on another pasture.

Year after year experience with the Minnesotan, and North and South Dakotan ranchers is that it is the minority of ranchers who put off vaccinating whose stock comes down during the summer A-season. I always argue that spring vaccinating both protects the livestock and is 'lawyer insurance' against the risk of being taken to court. A common cause for multiple outbreaks is when the rancher with the index outbreak is slow to react or even realise he or she has a problem. Once there are some 5-6 animals moribund with anthrax, there will be a large number of horse flies with bloody mouth parts just looking for their next meal. And the neighbors' stock is just standing there waiting to get infected because of the 1st rancher's slow response. So if you have your stock vaccinated not only will they be protected from the disease but the rancher him/herself will be protected from having to pay his/her neighbors' costs when their stock die from anthrax. A very cheap and effective insurance policy.

While SD outbreaks have been spread widely over the state they are usually in the eastern third of the state. To find South Dakota see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_general_reference_map-2003.pdf and http://healthmap.org/r/1ob8. - Mod.MHJ]
