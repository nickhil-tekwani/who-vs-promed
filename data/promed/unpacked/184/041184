Symptoms of the Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) have been reported for the 1st time in a UK tomato crop. Confirmed by laboratory testing, the outbreak has been reported to the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI). The affected glasshouse has taken the necessary steps to eradicate the virus and has destroyed their crop.

ToBRFV has caused significant issues for growers of tomatoes across Europe and beyond, causing unmarketable fruit. Dr Nikki Harrison, AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board], said: "We are advising the industry to review their production protocols, particularly regarding imports of seed and plants, and crop hygiene.

Tomato is the major host of the virus, but trials have indicated it could also infect sweet peppers [capsicum]. Having monitored the spread of ToBRFV in European crops, AHDB first warned the industry of the potential impact of the virus in March [2019] and urged growers to look out for symptoms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greenhouse tomato plants in the Mediterranean region of Turkey were observed to have leaves with chlorotic mosaic, mottling, rugosity, and occasional narrowing. Necrotic spots were observed on peduncle, calyces, petioles, the fruit was rough with chlorotic and necrotic patches. These symptoms resemble those caused by several different tomato viruses.

Twenty-seven diseased samples from 2 greenhouses (of which approximately 20% of the total area of 0.7 ha [1.73 acres] was diseased) were tested by RT-PCR for _Pepino mosaic virus_, _Tobacco mosaic virus_ (TMV), _Tomato mosaic virus_ (ToMV), and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, results were all negative. A generic primer set was used to detect tomato-infecting tobamoviruses and resulted in a 1052 bp amplicon. The sequence revealed 98.0-98.9% identity to isolates of _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) from Germany, Israel, and Jordan.

Ten plants of a commercial tomato variety, Bandita F1 containing the Tm-22 resistance gene were inoculated with extracts from diseased leaves. All plants developed systemic mosaic symptoms and tested positive for ToBRFV using the tobamovirus-specific primers described above. Amplicons were sequenced to confirm their identity as ToBRFV. The inoculated plants tested negative using RT-PCR specific for ToMV and TMV. This is the 1st report of ToBRFV infecting tomato in Turkey.

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan after a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes occurred there in 2015. Since then, it has been identified in Israel, the Americas (Mexico, USA), in several European countries (including Germany, Italy, Netherlands) and was shown to affect also capsicum crops. It has recently been added to the EPPO (European Plant Protection Organisation) alert list.

ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but they may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic, and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; yellowish mottling, brown spots, and rugosis on fruit making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar, fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100% incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_, TMV) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means (human and insect activities), contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial.

Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade. For some species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species such as _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_, surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560), thus work to assess a potential quarantine risk posed by the new ToBRFV is needed.

The other viruses mentioned in item [2] are _Pepino mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_); _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Tospovirus_); ToMV & TMV (both genus _Tobamovirus_); all of which affect tomato and a range of other solanaceous crops in different regions.
