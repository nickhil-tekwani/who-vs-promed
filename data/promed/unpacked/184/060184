The number of confirmed and suspected cases of _Salmonella paratyphi_ B in
travellers returned from the Antalya region of Turkey (1,2) has now reached
201. Cases have been recognised in several European countries, including 66
in Sweden, 51 in Norway, 34 in Denmark, 21 in Germany, 19 in Finland, and
10 in England. Practically all the cases have stayed in or near the town of
Alanya.
Cases have arisen consistently in the four weeks from 26 July to 22 August
and onset dates range from 13 July to 30 August (figure). Allowing for
delays in case ascertainment, it is too early to conclude that transmission
has ceased. No deaths have been reported, but over 80% of cases about whom
information is available have required admission to hospital.
The [hotel bed capacity for tourists in the Antalya region is around 212
000, of
which 100 000 are in Alanya. In July and August [1999 the numbers of foreign
nationals registered through Antalya airport were 230 000 and 290 000,
respectively, many of whom would have stayed in Alanya. The average monthly
numbers from various European countries included Germany 98 000, England 13
000, France and the Netherlands 11 000 each, Sweden, Austria, and Belgium
10 000 each, Norway 9000, Denmark 7000, and Finland 3000. A further 70 000
a month were from various countries in eastern Europe, principally Russia,
the Ukraine, and Poland.
The source and vehicle of the outbreak remain unknown. It appears that
young adults between the ages of 20 and 29 years are most likely to be
affected, although cases as young as 6 and as old as 69 have been reported.
Early information obtained by an EU team, which is assisting the public
health authorities in Alanya, suggests that the municipal water supply in
general is unlikely to be the source of the outbreak. A case control study
is underway to test whether specific exposures within the town of Alanya
are associated with infection.
Doctors should continue to consider the diagnosis of paratyphoid fever and
arrange for the microbiological examination of specimens from all patients
who present with diarrhoea, septicaemia, or high fever after returning from
Turkey.
