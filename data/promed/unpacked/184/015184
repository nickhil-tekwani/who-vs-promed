The number of flocks infected with the costly viral sheep disease maedi-visna (MV) has doubled in the past 18 years, according to recent figures.

Although rates of MV are still relatively low -- with about 2.8 percent of flocks testing positive for the disease -- the effect it can have on individual flocks and the industry is devastating.

Speaking at last week's [week of 28 Oct 2013] Sheep Breeders Round Table, Lynn Batty from SAC Consulting said MV was becoming more widespread, with particular hotspots in the Scottish Borders and southern England. "We have seen a doubling of the number of flocks infected with MV and clinical cases within flocks. In flocks testing positive for the disease, the percentage of sheep infected has increased from 13 to 24 percent," she said.

It is thought about 109 000 ewes are now infected with MV out of a total of 14.75 million ewes. "It may not sound a lot, but the effect it can have on individual flocks is devastating. And once you get it, it is hard to get rid of," she stressed.

Ms Batty said it could take up to 50 percent of animals in a flock to be infected before any clinical signs of the disease become apparent. "The clinical signs are also not specific, amongst others weight loss, pneumonia, mastitis, arthritis and hind limb paralysis, which is why it often goes undetected."

Ms Batty said she knew of a 1500-Masham [half-breed, dual purpose, long wool] ewe flock where symptoms included single-bearing ewes being in poor body condition, a lower lambing percentage, an increased number of thin ewes and deaths, poor lamb rates due to smaller lambs and lower milk yields, cull ewes that were harder to fatten and an increase in replacement rates.

"When the flock tested for MV we found 4 out of 6 ewes tested positive for MV. This farm suspected they brought the disease in through a bought-in animal about 8 years ago. Clinical signs have only just become visible because this virus has a long incubation period, which is why it can go unnoticed for long periods."

The consequences to this farm have been devastating, with about 20-40 percent loss in productivity at a cost of GBP 30 000 to 50 000 [about USD 48 000 to 80 000] a year. In August 2012 this flock was losing on average one ewe a day, explained Ms Batty.

Ms Batty suggested farmers screen about 12 thin ewes using an antibody test.

Brian Hosie from SAC Consulting said the biggest risk he was aware of was MV-accredited flocks being run alongside non-accredited commercial flocks. "We are seeing about 6 breakdowns a year out of our 2500 members in the MV accreditation programme," he said.

Maedi-visna facts:
- Caused by a highly contagious virus.
- No cure or vaccine and is fatal.
- Symptoms in lambs include increased lamb mortality, decreased growth rates from reduced colostrum intake, reduced fertility and increase in culling rates.
- Symptoms in adults: sheep do not normally show signs until they are adults, as the virus has a long incubation period. The main clinical signs are paralysis, wasting, arthritis and chronic mastitis
- Transmitted by shedding of the virus in milk, colostrum, faeces and respiratory secretions, contaminated water or feed when uninfected sheep are housed or at pasture with infected sheep.

[Maedi-visna (MV) is a persistent lentivirus infection of sheep also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Maedi-visna is an Icelandic name that describes 2 of the clinical syndromes recognised in MV virus (MVV)-infected sheep. "Maedi" means "laboured breathing" and describes the disease associated with a progressive interstitial pneumonitis, and "visna" means "shrinkage" or "wasting," the signs associated with a paralysing meningoencephalitis.

MV is often grouped together with the closely related goat disease caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE), as the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). The diseases, which are not zoonotic, are included in OIE's list in the section "Caprinae diseases" (diseases of sheep and goats), as a common entity, titled "Caprine Arthritis-Encephalitis & Maedi-Visna."

One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces and lung fluids are known to harbour infectious virus. Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised countries, and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats. Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Laboured breathing associated with emaciation caused by progressive pneumonitis is the predominant feature in clinically affected sheep, whereas polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic, but remain persistent carriers of virus and are capable of transmitting infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions.

The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation. Although serology represents the most cost-effective method of diagnosing persistently infected, clinically normal animals, it should be understood that testing errors occur. Virus isolation can be attempted from live clinical or subclinical cases by co-cultivating peripheral blood or milk leukocytes with appropriate ovine or caprine cell cultures.

No vaccines against CAE-MD are available. The above and additional information is available in OIE's Manual, Chapter 2.7.3/4, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.03-04_CAE_MV.pdf.

To control the spread of MV, industrialized countries have set and implemented schemes for MV-free flocks accreditation. For the scheme under implementation in Scotland, see http://www.sruc.ac.uk/download/downloads/id/683/mv_rules_and_conditions. - Mod.AS
