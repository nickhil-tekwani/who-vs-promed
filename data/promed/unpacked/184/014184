An anthrax outbreak in the Upper Hunter Valley of New South Wales has
claimed more than 30 head of cattle and a horse, and appears to be
getting worse. Over the weekend [29-30 Dec 2007] 3 more deaths were
reported, with the outbreak now spreading to 9 properties [4 more
outbreaks since the last report. - Mod.MHJ] All have been locked down
for 41 days.
The Department of Primary Industries does expect the number of deaths
to stabilise, with many local cattle now vaccinated. Keith Miles has
lost 22 cattle, and is hoping the vaccinations kick in soon. "We're
just hoping to stem the deaths," he says. "To go out this morning and
find another 3 head dead and they have to be burned, and that's the
hard part of this, you spend your time vaccinating and then you go
out the rest of the day burning carcasses and it's not just a matter
of going out and setting fire to it, it takes about 3 days of burning
because you have to get rid of the bones to ash."

[If there have been 22 cases on one station (farm), there is going to
be significant fly spread. I hope that they are vaccinating on a
generous radius from affected herds.
Done correctly cows can be burnt in one day, not 3. The trick is to
get them up off the ground so that there is airflow underneath. This
can be done be trenching or raising the carcass using green timber;
some people have been successful placing the carcass on a couple of
hay bales (the circular variety) with some timber and diesel. Burning
from the top down is hard work and routinely takes 3 days using wood
or old tires. - Mod.MHJ]
