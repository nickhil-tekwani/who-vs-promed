Health experts are urging people to take extra care when preparing
bean sprouts after an outbreak of an unusual type of _Salmonella_.
The warning comes after 68 people in England and 15 people in
Scotland tested positive for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Bareilly in recent weeks. The outbreak came to light after routine
testing by a salad producer found the bacteria in bean sprouts.

The Food Standards Agency said the outbreak's source was still
unknown. They have advised that anyone planning to eat bean sprouts
should cook them until steaming hot before consumption.

Dr Joe Kearney, director of the Health Protection Agency in the East
of England, said: "Outbreaks of _Salmonella_ Bareilly are under
investigation in north west England and Scotland and a greater than
expected number of case have been observed in England. We're looking
for possible links between the north west and Scottish outbreaks and
attempting to find potential sources of the national increase. It's
an extensive exercise."
