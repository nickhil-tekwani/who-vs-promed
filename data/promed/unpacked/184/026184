2001/063 - First report of Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus-Israel in
the Bahamas
---------------------------------------------------------------
Symptoms of stunting, curling, marginal chlorosis of leaves, and reduction
of fruit number were observed in tomato crops on the [Bahamian islands of
North Andros in 1996 and in autumn 1997 on Eleuthera. In some fields,
disease incidence reached up to 100%. PCR studies revealed the presence of
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus-Israel (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) in
symptomatic plants. This is the first report of this virus in the Bahamas.
The situation of Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus-Israel in the Bahamas
can be described as follows:
Present: found only in 2 islands (North Andros, Eleuthera).

[According to the authors, the sequences of 2 isolates of the virus, one
from each island, were identical. The Bahamian isolates also shared a small
deletion (28 or 29 nt) with clones from Florida that was not present in
clones from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Israel, Jamaica, Lebanon,
Mexico, or Spain. Because clones from the Bahamas and Florida share an
unusual deletion, they may have been derived from a common source.
Moreover, TYLCV-Is appeared in Florida and the Bahamas at about the same
time. - Mod.DH
