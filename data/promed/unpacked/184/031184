Swine fever detected in north-eastern Bulgaria
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) has been detected in wild boar
in Northeastern Bulgaria. To prevent the spread of this highly contagious
disease, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Mehmed Dikme has designated
buffer zones within a 3 km radius and surveillance zones within a 10 km
radius from 2 places where it has been detected: near Batin, Rousse Region,
and near Ignatievo, Varna Region.
While CSF, or hog cholera, does not cause foodborne illness in people, in
pigs and wild boars, it causes fever, skin lesions, convulsions and usually
death.
Dikme also ordered an emergency meeting of the local epizootics
commissions, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said on Friday [14 Jan
2005]. Any wild boar bagged by hunters in the designated areas in the
following 3 months must be subjected to serological testing. All pig
breeders in the 2 areas are required to have their animals vaccinated. All
bodies of wild boar killed by the virus must be cleared.

[The last notification on CSF in domestic pigs from Bulgaria was sent to
the OIE on 17 May 2004.
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_44.HTM#Sec1> The current case has been
identified in a wild boar. According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health
Code, there is a separate disease-free status for a country or zone
regarded free of CSF in domestic pigs but with infection in the wild pig
population (Article 2.6.7.5.). - Mod.AS]
