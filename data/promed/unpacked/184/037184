[When there are outbreaks close to borders there is always the suspicion that they were related in some way to the transport, legal or illegal, of animals incubating disease possibly brought on by the stress of transportation. From the number affected, 21, and start date, 12 May 2019, any infected stock came first to the farm in Ha-Tseka, and then animals sold to the other holdings in Ha-Teko & Ha-Au. Or from contact on common grazing pastures. - Mod MHJ
