A man has lost his eye after his contact lens became infected with parasite commonly found in tap water.

The 59-year-old man [from Wadebridge, Cornwall], who wore prescribed lenses for 5 years, assumed he had conjunctivitis after waking up with a weepy eye last June [2016]. [When his eye became excruciatingly painful and sensitive to bright light he took himself to an emergency care unit.]

After being initially diagnosed with an ordinary eye infection at Royal Cornwall Hospital Treliske [in Truro] he was given drops only to find 4 weeks later that the condition was far worse than originally thought.

Months of treatment failed to improve his condition and once it was found the infection had travelled to the back of his eyeball the difficult decision was made to remove it.

Forced to stay at home in the dark for weeks, the condition worsened until he was diagnosed with a rare but serious infection, acanthamoeba keratitis, which affects one in 50 000 contact lens wearers. [The free-living amoeba] is commonly found in tap water, rivers and soil.

[Contact lens] users become at risk from infections if they clean their lenses or lens cases in tap water, or if they swim, shower, or bathe while wearing their lenses.

He added: 'I've spoken to quite a few people who wear contact lenses and a couple of them have actually stopped wearing them after hearing what I've gone through. 'I must have had a contaminated finger and rubbed my eye or put them in with a contaminated finger and the [amoeba] harboured in this case.

'I think opticians need to tell people what could happen and that infections are likely; and as in my case, severe infections are rare but they can happen. 'I think people would be extra careful if they had warnings.'

[Although rare, acanthamoeba keratitis is well known in wearers of contact lenses. Several options are available for preventing and treating the infection (recently reviewed: Carrijo-Carvalho LC et al: Therapeutic agents and biocides for ocular infections by free-living amoebae of _Acanthamoeba_ genus. Surv Ophthalmol. 2016. pii: S0039-6257(16)30018-2. doi: 10.1016/j.survophthal.2016.10.009. [Epub ahead of print]; abstract available at http://www.surveyophthalmol.com/article/S0039-6257(16)30018-2/abstract). Prevention is important as pointed out in the text, and rinsing contact lenses or cases in tap water should be avoided. The diagnosis is based on microscopy and PCR of corneal fluid and material. - Mod.EP
