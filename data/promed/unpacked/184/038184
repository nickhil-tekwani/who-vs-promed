For a sickness [malaria] in which 6 cases raise alarm, 130 patients
are enough to declare an emergency. This has been the spread of
malaria so far in Tharparkar district after the rains. Across Sindh
[province], the total is even worse: 11 985.

According to the Sindh Malaria Control Programme, they are worried
enough to dispatch teams immediately. However, strangely enough, when
asked what it was doing in Tharparkar, Sindh health department
officials claimed that although there was an outbreak, there was no
need to panic.

One official explained that after the floods a lot of water had
accumulated in different areas, forcing people to constantly be on the
move. Tharparkar, however, is considered a 'high-risk transmission
zone' as the district has several man-made wells used to store
drinking water. These wells usually become a breeding ground for
mosquitoes.

Sindh Malaria Control Programme director Dr Nahid Jamali told The
Express Tribune that there was no doubt that malaria cases were on the
rise in the province. She added that aggressive fumigation had helped
kill mosquitoes and control the spread of the disease.

On the other hand, the chairperson of the Infection Control Committee
at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), Dr Bushra Jamil, said that
the situation in the cities was quite bad. She added that in order to
stop the spread of the disease it was very important to create
awareness and educate people. "Resurgence of the virus [sic]
constitutes at least 15 to 20 per cent cases as it [the virus] [sic]
remains untraced in the liver," she said. "Certain agents used to
treat the disease, in order to eradicate it from the liver are often
not used in endemic cases, which may lead to a reoccurrence."

A doctor from a private hospital said that they were unable to control
the malaria problem every year because they did not have qualified
professionals who could assess the situation or take preventive
measures.

The lack of available funds has also caused hiccups in delivering
medical aid. According to the spokesperson for the Office Coordination
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Stacey Winston, of the USD 357 million
requested so far only USD 43 million were collected. "This is very
inadequate for the needs of 5.4 million people across Sindh and
Balochistan," she said. The money collected by OCHA is primarily used
for water, food, healthcare, and sanitation.

[Please refer to our comment in ProMED-mail post 20110828.2639
concerning the state of the Pakistani malaria control programme:
"According to WHO's Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean
[EMRO], Pakistan had 1.5 million malaria cases in 2008 (latest
reported year) of which 24 per cent were _Plasmodium falciparum_
(the infection, and a recent estimate from Integrated Regional
Information Networks [IRIN -- a service of the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] found that only about 25 per
cent of cases receive qualified medical care and treatment

"The malaria control programme in Pakistan has struggled to contain
the infection, and a recent estimate from Integrated Regional
Information Networks [IRIN -- a service of the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] found that only about 25 per
cent of cases receive qualified medical care and treatment
(<http://www.irinnews.org/InDepthMain.aspx?InDepthId=10&ReportId=33684&Country=Yes)."

The malaria control program in Pakistan has recently been reviewed
