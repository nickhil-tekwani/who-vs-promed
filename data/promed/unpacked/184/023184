If the previous outbreak, in late July 2014, had been properly dealt with by vaccinating the herd, there should not have been a recurrence after 4 months. The commonest cause for such is that replacement stock were purchased but were not vaccinated on arrival, or were not held in a stable to let the vaccine kick in with protection (7-8 days needed) before the replacements were put out to graze during the day -- being late November they would have been housed overnight because of the cold weather. - Mod.MHJ
