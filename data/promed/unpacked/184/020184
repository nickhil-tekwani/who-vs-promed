A 10-year-old cow in the Netherlands has tested positive for BSE
[bovine spongiform encephalitis], more commonly known as "mad cow"
disease, the 1st such result in more than 2 years, the Dutch
government said on Friday [3 Sep 2010].

The government ministry responsible for food quality said the animal
tested positive for the brain-wasting disease bovine spongiform
encephalopathy at a slaughterhouse.

It was the 1st positive test for BSE in the country since May 2008,
the ministry said in a statement.

A spokesman for the ministry told Reuters the cow's meat was
withdrawn from the food chain after a 1st positive test, while a 2nd
test confirmed the result. All cows sent to slaughter in the country
are tested and held aside for the results before their meat enters the system.

Mad cow disease is of particular concern because it has been known to
cause a related brain-wasting disease in humans who have eaten
contaminated meat. A total of 3 people have died in the Netherlands
from [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after eating meat from a BSE
positive cow. The last reported death was in January 2009.

[The slaughterhouse where this BSE-positive cow has been discovered,
is -- according to the Dutch press -- located in Tilburg (North
Brabant province). The location of the affected farm is not disclosed.

Last year (2009), the number of slaughtered cows, older than 30
months, which were compulsorily tested in Dutch slaughterhouses for
BSE, was about 405 000 -- all with negative results. Suspected cases
are withheld until the receipt of final results from the Central
Veterinary Institute (CVI) in Lelystad. According to CVI, sporadic
cases of BSE may still occur in the Netherlands during the coming
years. - Mod.AS]
