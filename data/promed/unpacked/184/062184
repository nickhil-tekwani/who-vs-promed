FMD update: Temporary Control Zone established in Kent
------------------------------------------------------
This morning a 3 km (2 mi) radius Temporary Control Zone has been put
around one premises in Kent outside of the existing Surveillance Zone
in Surrey.
This precautionary measure follows an inconclusive assessment of
clinical symptoms by Animal Health veterinary staff. The national
movement ban remains in place. In addition, in the Temporary Control
Zone, general licences will not apply for the movement of animals to
slaughter and collection of dead animals from farms.
Debby Reynolds, Chief Veterinary Officer, said: "The containment and
eradication of FMD remains our priority. This is why we have moved
swiftly to put in place a Temporary Control Zone while we investigate
this development in Kent. At this stage disease has not been
confirmed, laboratory results will follow.
"We are in a crucial week for vigilance and planning next steps.
Today's [14 Aug 2007] developments are part of our ongoing
surveillance and testing and I would take this opportunity to
reiterate the need for the highest standards of biosecurity on farms,
and for people to remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions quickly."

A suspected case of foot-and-mouth [disease] on a farm in Kent is
being investigated, the UK's chief veterinary officer has said.
Debby Reynolds said a control zone has been set up around the farm,
which is in the Romney Marshes. Cattle have been tested and results
are awaited.
Dr Reynolds said the case was similar to one in Dorking, Surrey, last
week [6-12 Aug 2007], which turned out to be a false alarm.
Animals at 2 farms in Surrey tested positive for the disease earlier
this month [August 2007], and were culled.
Three cattle at the Kent farm have been tested after "an inconclusive
assessment of clinical symptoms" of the disease.
A 3 km (2 mi) temporary control zone has been put in place around the
premises, which is in the village of St Mary in the Marsh.
Dr Reynolds said the test results were expected by the end of Tuesday
[14 Aug 2007] or early Wednesday [15 Aug 2007].
A spokeswoman for Defra said: "It's not unusual to put a temporary
control zone in place. We're being ultra-cautious at this point.
There's a continuing need for relentless vigilance in response to
foot-and-mouth disease."
The farm is thought to have a herd of 250 dairy cattle.
This is the 1st suspected case outside Surrey during the outbreak.
Minister for the South East Jonathan Shaw said the farmer involved
should be congratulated for his vigilance.
"We have also moved swiftly as we have done throughout this process
and the temporary control zone will allow us to be precautionary
while we wait for the lab results to come back," he said. "There is
no need to panic at this stage."
A spokesman for the National Farmers' Union said he was hopeful the
tests would prove negative.
"This is a case of a very vigilant farmer who's called in vets at the
slightest sign there might be something wrong with his animals," he
added.
