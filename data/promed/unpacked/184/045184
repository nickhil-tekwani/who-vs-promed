Viral haemorrhagic septicemia, Iceland
--------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 23 Oct 2015 from Dr Sigurborg Daoadottir, Chief Veterinary Officer, Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority, Ministry of Industries and Innovation, Selfoss, Iceland

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 16 Sep 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 16 Sep 2015
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hafro Grindavik, Gullbringu [Southern Peninsula region]
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Sep 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: wild
Production system: semi-closed
Total animals affected:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Lumpfish (_Cyclopterus lumpus_) (kg) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 5145 / - / 0 / 5145 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: Lumpfish of wild origin used as brood fish for supposed "cleaner fish" in the future. Virus isolation with BF-2 and EPC cell lines and confirmed with RT-PCR. Sequencing of the amplicon is ongoing at the EU reference laboratory in Denmark.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: The Institute For Experimental Pathology, University of Iceland, KELDUR (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Lumpfish (_Cyclopterus lumpus_) / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 16 Oct 2015 / Positive
Lumpfish (_Cyclopterus lumpus_) / virus sequencing / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from the fact sheet "Viral hemorrhagic septicemia", prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf: "Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is a serious systemic disease of fish. The VHS virus (VHSV) is carried by at least 50 species of marine and freshwater fish. The infection is subclinical in some species, but it is associated with severe disease and high mortality rates in others. Clinical infections are economically important in farmed fish, particularly rainbow trout, turbot, and Japanese flounder. Outbreaks have also been reported in some wild populations, including Pacific herring and pilchard along the Pacific coast of North America.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia affects farmed rainbow trout and some other freshwater species in continental Europe and Japan. VHSV has also been isolated from a variety of wild marine fish in North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and the North American part of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This virus has also been reported from Korea.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is caused by the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV or Egtved virus). This virus is a member of the genus Novirhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae. Currently, the evidence suggests that VHSV contains a single serotype with 3 subtypes. Both marine and freshwater isolates occur. Marine isolates are indistinguishable from freshwater isolates by routine serology.

Genetic analyses suggest that VHSV strains are closely related to other isolates from the same geographic region, rather than being grouped by host species. Genotype I contains traditional European freshwater isolates and isolates of northern European marine origin. Genotype II consists of marine isolates from the Baltic Sea. Genotype III contains viruses from the North Sea, Skagerrak and Kattegat. The North American isolates belong to Genotype IV. Most Japanese and Korean isolates also belong to the North American genotype, but at least one isolate from Japan is in the European group. The genotypes do not correlate with the sero-grouping system.

VSHV strains differ in their virulence for fish species. European freshwater strains cause severe disease in rainbow trout, while North American or northern European marine isolates are usually low pathogenic or not pathogenic for this species. Some marine isolates are pathogenic for turbot and Atlantic cod. The epizootic in the North American Great Lakes region seems to be caused by a new substrain of the North American VHSV genotype. This isolate causes moderate mortality in salmonid species including lake trout, chinook salmon and steelhead trout, as well as warm-water species that were previously thought to be resistant to this disease. Circumstantial evidence suggests that non-virulent VHSV isolates can become virulent.

There is no indication that this disease is a threat to human health."

_Cyclopterus lumpus_, the lumpsucker or lumpfish, is a species of marine fish in the family Cyclopteridae (lumpsuckers). It is the only member of the genus Cyclopterus. It is found over rocky bottoms in the North Atlantic and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean, ranging as far south as Chesapeake Bay (rare south of New Jersey [USA]) on the North American coast and Spain on the European coast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclopterus_lumpus). - Mod.CRD
