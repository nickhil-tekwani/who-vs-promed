Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):
The story states that thousands [4,000 -- Mod CHC] of pigs in Belgium have
been destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease and that up to 11,000
[more?] pigs may have to be destroyed. The outbreak occurred near the town
of Bocholt in northeast Belgium just across the border from an area in the
Netherlands where the disease broke out in February, resulting in the
destruction of 686,000 pigs (FSnet passim ["here and there"]). The article
notes that the outbreak in the Netherlands led to a law providing for the
killing by lethal injection of millions of piglets and a European Union ban
on the export of pigs and pig sperm from Holland.
The article goes on to say that in addition to an export ban on Dutch
pigs, the European Union has a ban on exports of pigs from a region of
northern Spain and that it recently lifted a swine-fever related ban on pig
exports from Germany.
