Laboratory based surveillance of hepatitis C virus infection in England and
Wales between 1992 and 1996 identified injecting drug use as the main route
of transmission in 80% of cases for whom risk factor information was
available and the receipt of blood or blood products in 10%.
Acute hepatitis C infection is rarely symptomatic, which makes its
incidence difficult to measure. Initiatives to reduce needle sharing among
injecting drug users and the screening of blood donations have reduced the
risk of transmission substantially. The PHLS [Public Health Laboratory
Service] is conducting a series of seroprevalence studies that will help to
predict the future morbidity likely to be associated with hepatitis C.

"Hepatitis Deaths Warning" UK Telegraph Online (06/09/98); Hall, Celia
The British Liver Trust said Monday that deaths from hepatitis C will
outnumber those from AIDS by the year 2000. Over 250,000 people in Britain
carry the virus; eight of 10 will manifest symptoms, and one-quarter of
those individuals will develop cirrhosis of the liver. Others who become
ill will develop liver cancer. Often, symptoms of
hepatitis C infection go unnoticed by physicians, with some diagnosing
depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and similar diseases.
Approximately 6,000 people were infected with the virus through tainted
blood in Britain before screens were made available in 1991, and many
others contracted the virus through intravenous drug use.
CDPC Note: This projection may be accurate in Britain, but not globally.

[These 2 reports conflict. If 6,000 people in Britain have been infected
through blood, and they make up 10% of the infected population, then that
population is 60,000, not 250,000. This is not to diminish the seriousness
of the problem, only its extent.
Critics please note: these reports and statistics are from CDR (UK), not
from our esteemed AIDS number-cruncher colleague, Jim Chin, who merely
passed on these reports in his excellent CDPC E-mail Service - Mod.JW]
