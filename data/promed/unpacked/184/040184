[There is no mention of the etiologic agent responsible for these
cases. Given recent previous reports from this area, some are probably
due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections.

There is no mention of vaccination history in this population. -

Japanese encephalitis is back in eastern Uttar Pradesh and has claimed
the lives of over 300 children in the past 2 months alone, health
officials say. The killer disease, an annual hazard for lakhs [100
000s] of people living across the poverty-ridden part of Uttar
Pradesh, is taking 3-4 lives every day. More than 3000 children have
died of the virus since 2006.

"Despite several preventive measures, the virus strikes back every
year during the monsoon season, taking an annual toll of 400-500,"
said KP Kushwaha, head of paediatrics at the BR Medical College in
Gorakhpur, which has become the nodal centre for treatment of the
afflicted. "Since a majority of the cases converge to this medical
college from all disease-prone districts in the neighbourhood, we face
the brunt of the pressure," he said. "Even right now, against a bed
strength of 200, we are treating 470 patients in our wards."

This report, perhaps covering a broader geographic area, indicates
that Japanese encephalitis virus is the only etiological agent
involved. Previous reports speak of an "acute encephalitis syndrome"
with not specified etiology, but with an association with water
suggesting enterovirus infections. No mention is made in this report
of the coverage of JE virus vaccination in the population of the
affected areas of Uttar Pradesh. - Mod.TY]

The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in and around Ranchi has assumed
pandemic proportions, with authorities at Ranchi Institute of Medical
Sciences (RIMS) reporting 12 child deaths since 16 Aug [2011] till
date. Moreover, 36 among the 81 children admitted to the state-run
hospital have been confirmed to be suffering from the mosquito-borne
viral disease. All 36 are children, between the age group of 5-11
years.

Confirming the broad figures of patients under treatment, RIMS
director Tulsi Mahto said, "A total of 81 patients suffering from high
fever came to our hospital. We sent blood samples of 51 suspected
cases to the department of microbiology. Tests confirmed 36 were
Japanese encephalitis [virus or antibody?]-positive. 11 tested
negative and the results of the 4 are awaited."

He added they had adequate medicine stocks, but the severity of the
disease was such that some children succumbed. "We are getting
patients from across the state and are trying to accommodate them. At
the paediatrics and neonatology department, there are 90 beds but
patients inflow is high," Mahto added. AK Sharma, head of department
of paediatrics and neonatology at RIMS, said they had been successful
in saving the lives of most children. "We are doing our best. Till
now, we have been able to save 90 per cent of the patients. In many
cases, people have admitted their children here after visiting private
hospitals," Sharma claimed. "The death toll stood at 12 till Tuesday
[27 Sep 2011]," he added.

Experts say that Japanese encephalitis [virus], caused [transmitted]
by _Culex_ mosquitoes, which breeds in rice fields, marshes,
waterlogged drains, and pig farming regions, is a poor man's disease.

Meanwhile, confirmatory tests will start in the less affected East
Singhbhum district from Tuesday [27 Sep 2011] at Mahatma Gandhi
Memorial Medical College and Hospital. Across the district, 58
suspected cases have been reported at MGM and the premier Tata Main
Hospital. But the district was waiting for Elisa test kits to arrive
from the renowned National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

One kit, able to test 90 cases, arrived on Saturday [24 Sep 2011],
delayed by a few days. Authorities, seeing the situation was under
control, had continued with symptomatic treatment.
