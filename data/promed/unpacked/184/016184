5 more farms test positive for avian flu
-----------------------
After a brief lull, the avian flu is on the march again through Fraser
Valley poultry farms.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says ongoing surveillance efforts have
led to the detection of bird flu on 36 commercial premises. That's up from
31 reported earlier this week.
The agency says it is continuing depopulation efforts on infected farms on
a priority basis. Officials have also slaughtered birds in 10 backyard
flocks where the disease was found.
To date, more than 200 farms have tested negative for avian influenza. Most
chickens and turkeys from those farms are destined for the retail food chain.
The outbreak began in February 2004 in the Abbotsford area. About 19
million birds between Vancouver and Hope are to be slaughtered by late May.
