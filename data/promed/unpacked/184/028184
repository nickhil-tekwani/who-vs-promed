Cowpox as an "emerging" virus disease
-----------------------------------
A quick comment on cowpox epidemiology and its status as an emerging
human disease and the role of smallpox vaccination: It is true that
there have been increased reported cases of human cowpox in recent
decades, but I think that this is most likely to be due to increased
clinician awareness following a number of papers in European medical
journals telling clinicians to be aware of cowpox. This in turn has
come about partly through increased veterinary awareness that cowpox
can cause disease in domestic cats, and, from that, that cats are
liaison hosts for zoonotic transmission.
Several papers published over the last 20 or so years have warned
that with waning herd immunity from smallpox vaccination and/or HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus) infection, cowpox could become, or
could already be, an emerging infection. However, there is little
evidence to suggest that this is really happening. Furthermore, the
successful 'take' of vaccinia virus in vaccinated individuals,
suggests that while smallpox vaccine immunity might reduce the
severity of the infection, it is unlikely to reduce its incidence.
Thus, lack of vaccination is unlikely to [result in] an increase in
its incidence.
The sporadic nature of human cowpox means that when cases are
identified they are often reported: they are interesting and unusual,
and those involved are understandably enthusiastic to warn others
that we might be on the edge of something new. I wonder, though,
whether what we are really seeing with cowpox is not the emergence of
the disease itself but rather the emerging use of the term 'emerging'
associated with the disease.
