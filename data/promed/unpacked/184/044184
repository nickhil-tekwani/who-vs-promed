The 7 districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh slowly recovering from the
deadly onslaught of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus are now faced
with [another virus] -- Human coxsackievirus B. The virus that first
appeared in the region in 2004 in form of 25 "queer cases" of JE at
the Baba Raghav Das Medical College (BRDMC) in Gorakhpur has now
infected at least 245 people, who have been admitted to the same
medical college, reputed pediatrician and Hindu Mahasabha MLA from
Gorakhpur Radha Mohan Das Agrawal told UNI today.
Dr Agrawal said that out of the samples of 50 suspect patients sent
for testing at a lab in the national capital, as many as 15 have
tested positive for this [potentially fatal viral infection]. The
Hindu Mahasabha MLA claims to have visited the BRDMC hospital
recently and exchanged information with acting principal of the
College Dr Rakesh Saxena and pediatrician A K Rathi presently
attending to the patients.
Elaborating further on the encephalitis caused by human
coxsackieviruses, Dr Agrawal said that [infection with this virus had
increased from 25 cases in 2004 to 245 cases in 2005]. Human
coxsackieviruses are enteroviruses that spread by the faecal-oral
route and have an infection rate at least 6 times higher than JE
virus. Whereas JE virus [is prevalent] in piggeries and is spread
through a pig-mosquito-human cycle, human coxsackievirus B [infects
humans and is spread by contact].
Human coxsackievirus B generally infects patients aged below 30 and
unlike JE virus -- which either causes death or permanent disability
-- [can be associated with] multiple organ failure by impairing the
functioning of heart, liver, kidney, trachea, spleen and lungs.
"Coxsackievirus infection could lead to myocarditis, damage to lungs
by pneumonia and pleurodynia, besides affecting [kidneys] in the form
of nephritis," Dr Agrawal added. The symptoms of infection by this
virus ranged from fever, body rashes to softening of muscles, edema
and chest pain, he said.

[In the 8th Report of the ICTV*, the human B coxsackieviruses were
newly classified as members of the species _Human enterovirus B_,
which is included in the genus _Enterovirus_ of the family
_Picornaviridae_; the coxsackieviruses are not related to Japanese
encephalitis virus, which is classified in the family _Flaviviridae_.
The _Human enterovirus B_ species comprises the various human B-type
coxsackievirus plus another 36 related agents, not all of which are
associated with disease. The B-type coxsackieviruses most frequently
associated with encephalitis are B3, B5 and B6. The precise nature of
the disease associated with the outbreak of coxsackievirus B
infection in Uttar Pradesh is not entirely clear from this report.
Further information would be welcome. - Mod.CP]
