SCRUB TYPHUS (4)
================
This is in response to Dr. Stanton Cope's question about whether
scrub typhus should be considered an emerging disease in Thailand
or any part of Southeast Asia. Scrub typhus is endemic in areas
ranging from the coastal portions of North Australia to the whole
of Asia and the Indian subcontinent. These areas, despite the
apparent diversity in habitats, bring together the classic scrub
typhus triad - |Rattus| rats, |Leptotrombidium| mites and
|Rickettsia tsutsugamushi|. There are at least 8 prototype strains
of which 7 are found in Malaysia. A study in in Malaysia in 1984
showed that 19.3% of all febrile illnesses in a rural area in
Malaysia were scrub typhus. At the University Hospital, typhus
fevers are diagnosed by the Weil-Felix as well as by the
immunoperoxidase test. Between 1991-1994, the percentage postives
ranged from 7-20% for scrub typhus and 15-49% for endemic/murine
typhus. Many of the cases are associated with workers in oil palm
estates. Chloramphenicol and tetracycline are effective for
treatment but relapses have been observed in patients treated with
short courses of chloramphenicol but not with tetracycline.
