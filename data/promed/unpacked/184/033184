An uncommon and damaging strain of cucurbit downy mildew has been
seen in Charleston County. The disease can damage crops such as
cantaloupe [rockmelon], cucumber, summer and winter squash, pumpkin,
watermelon, and bottle gourd. The disease is also widespread in the
middle part of the state on cucumber, summer and butternut squash,
according to Anthony Keinath, Clemson University vegetable
pathologist at Coastal Research and Education Center in Charleston.

Keinath said the symptoms on watermelon are different than symptoms
on other cucurbits. Leaf spots on watermelon are dark brown and
irregular in shape. Slight yellowing may be seen around the edges of
the spots or in small patches in other parts of the leaf. Leaves
infected curl inward as the leaves die. Spores are usually found on
the bottom of the leaf, although spores may be formed on top of the
leaf in severe infections. The best time to look for spores is in the
morning before dew has dried. The spores are brownish-purple and the
mold growth is white to colorless.

Keinath suggests looking at the size, shape, and position of leaf
spots to distinguish downy mildew on watermelon from gummy stem
blight, which is the most common leaf disease on watermelon. Leaf
spots of gummy stem blight are larger than individual spots of downy mildew.

Downy mildew kills leaves and vines prematurely, which reduces the
number and size of the fruit but does not cause it to rot. It also
reduces the sugar content of fruits, particularly cantaloupe and
watermelon. "All cucurbit crops in South Carolina are at serious
risk," Keinath said. Crops must be sprayed with fungicides every 5 to
7 days. Keinath suggests that organic growers should use copper
products but also should expect yield loss, because copper is not
completely effective against downy mildew. Home gardeners should
spray with a fungicide or copper products.

[Downy mildew on cucurbits is caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora
cubensis_. Different strains with variable host preferences
(pathovars) seem to exist, and it is not uncommon, for example, for
cucumbers to be severely affected while watermelons nearby are not.
_P. cubensis_ is found worldwide, but it is usually most damaging in
tropical and subtropical areas. By affecting the leaves and thus the
photosynthetic potential of its host it reduces yield and fruit
quality, and it can eventually kill the host plant. It is an obligate
parasite surviving on cultivated or wild cucurbits and is spread by
wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease development can occur over
a wide temperature range under conditions of high humidity. Control
strategies include the use of resistant cultivars and fungicide applications.

The related species _P. humuli_ causes a serious disease of hops.
Downy mildews in other genera affect grapevine, sunflower, and a
number of vegetable crops. Generally, each fungal species is confined
to a number of host species.

Gummy stem blight of watermelon is caused by the fungus _Didymella
bryoniae_. Symptoms are lesions on leaves and stems of seedlings. The
seedling may be girdled by lesions and collapse or be so weakened by
the infection that it is never productive. Gummy stem blight is a
serious problem in regions of high rainfall, and the fungus requires
prolonged moisture to become established. The fungus is seed-borne.
It can become a problem in watermelon transplant glasshouse
facilities where the use of clean seed is essential.
