According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 539 measles cases and 17 outbreaks have been reported in the last 6 months, many of which are a result of parents following the anti-vaccination movement. What the followers don't realize, however, is that their decision affects more than the people in their own houses.

Dr. Pauline Chen recently wrote to The New York Times to share her medical perspective on the return of measles. In the article, Chen points out that unvaccinated children are 35 times more likely to contract the disease than vaccinated children. As a result, they can carry and pass on the disease to those who are too young to have been immunized or those with an already-compromised immune system. She adds, however, that doctors should share some of the blame for the spread.

Chen writes: "Most practicing doctors, myself included, have never cared for a patient with measles. Confronted with a patient suffering from a fever, red eyes, runny nose, cough and blotchy rash, we don't even think of measles, let alone order the dramatic precautions necessary to prevent its spread, like mandating facial masks, isolating patients in rooms equipped with specialized ventilation systems and reporting to appropriate infection control experts."

At the end of the day, however, measles is a preventable disease and should not be spreading as quickly as it has been. While parents have every right to make decisions about their own children's health, Chen believes they also have to think about the harm their choice can have on others.

[It should be remembered that rinderpest virus, a paramyxovirus closely related antigenically to measles virus, has been eradicated globally by compulsory vaccination of cattle, and, like smallpox virus, no longer exists outside of laboratories. The critical difference between measles virus and its relative rinderpest virus is that in the case of rinderpest virus, the host has no opt-out option. - Mod.CP]

The U.S. is witnessing its largest measles outbreak since eliminating the disease in this country in 2000, including a rash of cases in the Kansas City area. Kansas has recorded no cases outside of Johnson County, said Reno County Health Department Director Julia Hulsey, but it's important for the public to be aware and take preventive measures, particularly through vaccination. As of last week, the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases reported 539 confirmed cases in 20 states, including 13 cases in Kansas. At least 17 localities had reported outbreaks, Hulsey said, which is defined as 3 or more confirmed cases. Those 17 locations have accounted for 88 percent of this year's [2014] cases, according to the CDC's website. The majority of the people getting the disease were unvaccinated.

Last year [2013], there were 11 outbreaks in the U.S., but only about 160 total cases were reported. Since 2001, the median annual number of cases in the U.S. was 60, according to the CDC.

What's being called the biggest measles outbreak in more than 2 decades has health officials in West Michigan on high alert. A trip to the Philippines to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan is what ultimately led to the outbreak. The virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), traveled thousands of miles with unvaccinated members of the Amish community back to their homes in Ohio.

With a large Amish population straddling the Michigan-Indiana border, there's a growing concern in Michigan that the disease will make its way into Michigan. Epidemiologists are watching, and the Amish travel back and forth.

We don't have any cases in Michigan yet, but it's very likely that we will see some. It is not uncommon for the Amish to skip out on getting vaccinations. Many children in Amish communities aren't required to get vaccinated due to the fact they don't attend traditional public schools. While the Amish travelers aren't entirely to blame for the outbreak, the CDC shows a drastic increase in measles this year [2014] compared to previous years. In 2013, there were less than 200 cases reported. Already this year, by the end of June 2014, there are 17 outbreaks and 539 people who've caught the virus.

[The Amish are an American Protestant group with around 200 000 members descended from European Anabaptists who came to the USA more than 2 centuries ago to escape persecution. They are best known for their 19th century way of life, in which violent crime clashed with their peaceful existence. Their old-fashioned traditions are what is now called a "lifestyle choice." Amish believe that their religious faith and the way they live are inseparable and interdependent. The Amish originated in Europe after splitting from Mennonite Swiss Brethren in 1692 over the treatment of members who had been found guilty of breaches of doctrine. - Mod.CP]

http://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/02/measles-outbreak-complicates-amish-events/


The nation's largest outbreak [of measles], with 360 cases in rural Ohio, comes before 2 major events. Visitors from around the world to 2 upcoming events in Ohio's Amish country could come away with more than they bargained for, health officials fear, a case of measles from the nation's largest outbreak in 2 decades.

The outbreak, with more than 360 cases, started after Amish travelers to the Philippines contracted measles this year [2014] and returned home to rural Knox County, where it spread thanks to a lower rate of vaccination among the Amish and the difficulty public health authorities had in getting the word out to largely rural communities where phones are few and the internet is nonexistent.

The religion of the Amish doesn't prevent them from seeking vaccinations, but because their children don't attend public schools, vaccinations aren't routine. The Associated Press believes the outbreak is slowing in Ohio thanks to vaccination clinics and door-to-door visits by public health nurses. But Horse Progress Days, an international showcase of horse-drawn equipment scheduled for Friday and Saturday [4-5 Jul 2014], is expected to draw more than 20 000 Amish and others from around the globe. And a large annual auction that raises money to help Amish families pay medical bills for children with birth defects is scheduled for Saturday [5 Jul 2014].

Before widespread vaccination in the U.S. beginning in the 1950s, 450 to 500 people died each year, 48 000 were hospitalized, and nearly 1000 people suffered brain damage or deafness. Though nearly eradicated in the United States, measles remains common in many parts of Asia, the Pacific and Africa. For Amish who aren't vaccinated, Ohio health officials say the reasons include religious objections, unwillingness to shoulder the cost because they don't have health insurance, and not seeing the need for vaccination against a disease that isn't common.

The Abilene-Taylor County Public Health Department has confirmed 2 related cases of measles. One case was reported last week, but now health officials are worried for [other] people that may have been exposed to the illness at the Bonzai Japanese Steak House and Sushi Bar in Abilene. The manager at Bonzai spoke to a KTAB Reporter off camera, saying they were notified by the Health Department on Tue 1 Jul 2014 of the possible exposure. The health department says people may have been exposed between 23-28 Jun 2014. The manager also stated that the Health Department contacted all employees, and they have either been vaccinated or show no measles-like symptoms.

The Epoch Times reported on 1 Jul 2014 a recent outbreak of measles in North Korea's Pyongyang province.

The local authorities have cut access between affected and unaffected areas of the province in efforts to prevent further spread of the epidemic. Local sources said yesterday [30 Jun 2014] that since the beginning of June 2014, there has been an epidemic of measles in Pyongyang, and residents' access was under movement control regulations, and preventative measures were in force.

South Korea's "Chosun Ilbo" reported that the North Korean authorities were screening factories, businesses, schools and other organisations to identify anyone exhibiting signs of measles virus infection -- red spots on the ears, face, neck, arms and torso red spots -- and requiring them to remain at home to receive treatment. Meanwhile, North Korea has cut off access between Pyongyang and adjacent communities. Any movement will require travel documents comprising health certificates and may involve quarantine.

Signs of measles virus infection include pimples, erythema [redness of skin/mucous membranes], and a fever approaching 40 C [104 F].

Supplies of measles vaccine are restricted in North Korea. American Radio Free Asia reported on 25 Jun 2014 that measles in North Korea was spreading rapidly in North Pyongyang's Longchuan County. Measles vaccination is not comprehensive throughout North Korea.

A measles outbreak was declared in a detention facility in Cebu after dozens of inmates tested positive for the contagious infection. Acting Jail Warden Romeo Manansala of the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) said records showed 51 inmates have been infected as of last Wednesday [25 Jun 2014]. Manansala said the 1st suspected cases of measles were identified on 9 Jun 2014. The number increased to more than 20 on 16 Jun 2014.

He added that relatives of inmates are no longer allowed to go beyond the visiting room except for spouses. He also urged the visitors not to bring along children, who are most vulnerable to the measles virus.

There is a significantly increased risk of contracting measles in the Amur region according to the Amur Department of Health.

The epidemiological situation has worsened in the region of Amur, bordering China, where more than 35 000 cases of infectious disease have been registered so far this year [2014], almost 2 times more than the total recorded during the same period in the preceding year.

In 2013 in the 58 regions of Russia, 2339 cases of measles were registered, about half of them children. This year [2014] so far, foci of measles virus infection have been recorded in the Astrakhan and Kursk regions and in the Republic of Dagestan. In the Amur Region since the beginning of the year [2014], there have been 28 cases of measles, mainly among residents of Blagoveshchensk [Blagoveshchensk is a city located on the banks of the Amur River, about 110 km south of the Trans-Siberian Railway, where Chinese and Russians intermingle. - Mod.CP]. The vast majority of the measles cases are unlikely to have been vaccinated.

Measles is a contagious and severe infectious disease that, in the absence of vaccination, affects almost every person regardless of age. The 1st symptoms are similar to the common cold: fever, conjunctivitis, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the mouth and upper respiratory tract, dry cough and runny nose. From the 1st day, a patient is very contagious. After a few days of illness, a rash appears as bright spots. The most common complications of measles are inflammation of the middle ear (otitis media), blindness, pneumonia, inflammation of the lymph nodes, laryngitis, and encephalitis. Particularly at risk are small children and pregnant women.

The most effective means of combating measles is vaccination. Vaccinations are routinely conducted in healthy children twice: at the age of 12 months and again at 6 years.

Persons intending to travel to the countries and regions of Russia, where measles has been recorded, should ensure that they have be vaccinated.

Another 6 people have become ill with measles in the Tyumen Oblast [Region] during the past week. The total from 8 May to 27 Jun 2014 has reached 38 cases, most of whom had not been vaccinated against the infection. Of these cases, 11 were adults aged from 21 to 49 years; 27 were children, including toddlers up to 12 years of age. The Rospotrebnadzor [Russian consumer rights organisation] for the Tyumen Region reported that only 2 of the 38 cases had been vaccinated, but that was 10 years previously.

As of 27 Jun 2014, 2727 cases of measles had been confirmed by laboratory analysis at the Regional Centre for Surveillance of infectious disease in Novosibirsk; 3 isolates have been sent for genotyping to the National Center for Surveillance of Infectious Disease in Moscow. The results are not yet available.

[Previously, in Measles update 23, it was reported that: "Measles 1st appeared in Tyumen 4 years ago. The 1st case in 2014 was detected on 8 May 2014 and by 3 Jun 2014, the total was 26 cases, 8 of whom remain in hospital. Most of the patients were children aged 5 months to 8 years. 24 of the measles cases had not been vaccinated. A total of 1448 contacts, 332 of them children, have been vaccinated. Patients who refused to be hospitalised were observed daily at home by health care workers. Additionally, 62 people received immunoglobulin treatment."

Tyumen is the largest city and the administrative center of Tyumen Oblast (region), Russia. Tyumen was the 1st Russian settlement in Siberia. Founded in 1586 to support Russia's eastward expansion, the city has remained one of the most important industrial and economic centers east of the Ural Mountains.

The Waikato District Health Board's [DHB] Population Health service had 84 confirmed measles cases as of late last week.

Sports, cultural events, school trips and dances have been cancelled or postponed in some Waikato schools after an outbreak of the measles. Five Waikato schools now have confirmed cases of measles, Waikato District Health Board medical officer of health Anita Bell said.

The spread was largely associated with Fraser High School, but also caught in the outbreak were Hamilton Boys' High School, Frankton Primary School, Nga Taiatea Wharekura and Raglan Area School. On its website, Fraser High School said it had cancelled or postponed all sporting, cultural and academic trips for the remainder of term 2. All Fraser sports teams would also no longer participate in sports competitions for the remainder of the term. And all visitors to the school and appointments may be postponed or cancelled for the rest of the term. The School Ball was also postponed until 23 Aug 2014, the website said. A message on Frankton Primary School's website said that the school disco and sports teams events had been cancelled.

Waikato DHB's Population Health service had 84 confirmed measles cases as of late last week. 21 of those cases were household contacts of confirmed cases and had already been placed in quarantine before they were unwell. Six patients had been hospitalised but are now well. Of the 84 cases, 4 had been immunised with 2 documented doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 4 had received no documented dose of MMR.

Population Health was investigating another 15 suspected cases from throughout the city.

Waikato District Health Board's Population Health service has to date (2 Jul 2014) been notified of 95 confirmed measles cases, an increase of 11 since the last update on 27 Jun 2014.

Of the 95 cases, 48 are laboratory confirmed, and the rest are close contacts of a confirmed case with a clinically compatible illness. Almost a quarter of the confirmed cases are household contacts of a confirmed case and were already placed in quarantine before they were unwell.

"Approximately 80 per cent of cases are aged between 10-20 years of age," said Waikato DHB medical officer of health Dr Anita Bell. "The other 20 per cent are aged under 10 years and are close contacts of confirmed cases in quarantine, as they were not vaccinated. Seven cases have been hospitalised but are now well."

Of the 95 cases, only 4 have been immunised with 2 documented doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 4 cases have received one documented dose of MMR (not fully immunised for dates).

Approximately 50 cases with a clinical illness like measles have been investigated and were found not to have measles. Schools with current quarantine management in place are:

Maeroa Intermediate - out of quarantine 11 Jul 2014
Hamilton Boys High - out of quarantine tomorrow, 4 Jul 2014
Frankton Primary - out of quarantine Sat 5 Jul 2014.
