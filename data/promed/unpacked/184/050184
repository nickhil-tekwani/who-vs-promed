The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has reported the detection of the 1st outbreak of anthrax in Extremadura in 2022.

On 13 Jun 2022, the suspicion of deaths of animals with symptoms compatible with anthrax is activated again, in a sheep farm, in the municipality of Navalvillar de Pela, in the veterinary region of Don Benito. The National Reference Laboratory of Santa Fe, Granada, confirmed the disease on 22 Jun 2022.

The farm has a census of adult animals of 447 sheep and 6 goats. Goats, which live with sheep, have not shown symptoms of anthrax. To date [27 Jun 2022], a total of 12 sheep have died, which have been eliminated by deep burial with quicklime on the same farm.

There is no record of people who are affected by this disease. The farm is located in the area affected by anthrax in the fall of 2021 (it is one of the affected municipalities) and did not carry out at the time the vaccination of its personnel that the official veterinary services recommended in the area.

From the date of the suspicion, sanitary measures were adopted to restrict movement, follow-up of new suspected cases, control of the disposal of carcasses and vaccination, which was applied by their farm veterinarian on 20 Jun 2022. Control measures of movements will be maintained until 20 days have elapsed since the completion of vaccination, and no new cases have occurred in the last 15 days on the holding and it is not subject to immobilization as a result of cases on neighboring holdings.

On the other hand, the Animal Health Service of the General Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock has begun sending all farmers of species sensitive to anthrax in risk areas an informative note reminding them of the importance of the application of an adequate vaccination program as the most effective method of controlling the disease.

It is also recalled that, in the case of finding dead animals on land potentially contaminated by the microorganism, performing in situ necropsies is contraindicated to prevent the spread of the agent and infection. "The suspicion must be communicated to the Official Veterinary Services so that they proceed to take samples and eliminate the corpses in biosafety conditions," they point out from the MAPA.

Extremadura has activated the alert after confirming 2 outbreaks of anthrax in farms in the region in less than 2 weeks. They are the 1st notified in the national territory this year [2022] and have been registered in the Badajoz towns of Navalvillar de Pela and Casas de Don Pedro.

A total of 22 sheep have died, 12 in the 1st outbreak and 10 in the 2nd one, although so far the infection has been confirmed in only 15. The Board's Animal Health Service maintains vigilance in case more are detected. There is no evidence that there is any affected person; last year [2021] there was human transmission.

Both farms already had cases of this disease last year [2021] and affected equine and bovine specimens, but they did not proceed to vaccinate the rest of their animals, as they had been required. The regional executive has immobilized one of the farms, that of Navalvillar de Pela, waiting for the animals to be immunized. The other rancher proceeded to initiate vaccination when the outbreak was reported. "The rancher has been told to vaccinate his cattle against this disease, an issue that he should have done last year when he was recommended by the Junta de Extremadura," says Agriculture.

It was on 13 Jun 2022 when the alert was activated, after the 1st sheep specimens died on the Navalvillar de Pela farm. The National Reference Laboratory of Santa Fe (Granada) confirmed the disease on 22 Jun 2022. The farm has 447 sheep and 6 goats. The latter, who live with the former, have not presented symptoms. The deceased sheep have been eliminated by deep burial with quicklime on the same farm. Control measures will be maintained until 20 days have elapsed since the completion of vaccination, and no new cases have occurred in the last 15 days on the farm.

The 2nd outbreak [presumably in Casas de Don Pedro] was confirmed on 29 Jun 2022. In this case, 10 sheep have died, although so far the disease has only been confirmed in 3. They have also been buried with quicklime. The farm has a census of 890 sheep.

As prevention, the Animal Health Service of the General Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock has begun sending all farmers of species sensitive to anthrax in risk areas an informative note reminding them of the importance "of the application of an adequate vaccination program as the most effective method of controlling the disease."

They are also informed that, in the case of finding dead animals on land potentially contaminated by the microorganism, performing in situ necropsies is "contraindicated" to "prevent the spread of the agent and infection." On the contrary, the suspicion must be communicated to the official veterinary services "so that they proceed to take samples and eliminate the carcasses in biosafety conditions."

[The difference in numbers of affected sheep between the earlier report from WOAH/OIE and these reports from the farms themselves is not unexpected in my experience. Governments report what their laboratories have seen, i.e., submitted samples, and not the reality on the farms, which the laboratories and government officials may well be ignorant of. The numbers are official anecdotes, not hard data, but unfortunately this is what appears in government and international databases. Reports of individual sheep deaths are rare unless it is some unusual condition or disease. Individual sheep die. It happens and will be noted by the shepherds but otherwise ignored. In my experience, it is not uncommon for one to 2 dozen sheep to die before help is sought and a diagnosis obtained.

These later news reports confirm that these flocks, on previously infected farms in 2021, had not been vaccinated this year (2022). As hot summer weather will reduce the innate resistance of any animal, it is far wiser to vaccinate in the spring and not leave it until the summer months, when the herding stress and hot weather can kill. Let us hope that the authorities can get other procrastinators in the region to get their livestock vaccinated.

How these sheep became infected is not clear. Yes, there probably was contaminated soil from 2021, but sheep are not vigorous grazers. But if there had been some rain and germination of spores among the grazing roots, that may do the trick. Also there might have been some ewes with latent infections. The coincidence of the 2 flocks makes me think it was rain in the area. In our experience in West Texas, whitetail deer will come down with anthrax 10 days after rain. Sheep are too small to be seen by hungry female tabanid flies. - Mod.MHJ
