The Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul [MS], through its health secretariat [Secretaria de Estado de Saúde; SES/MS], has issued an alert to the health services of the 79 municipalities about the outbreak of mycobacteriosis after aesthetic procedures performed in a health service in Paraguay.

The SES/MS emphasizes that it is dealing with the outbreak in a responsible and careful way and guiding those patients who have undergone procedures to seek, at any symptom, medical attention or a public health unit.

According to the technical alert, so far 11 cases are under investigation, 6 of which are confirmed for _Mycobacterium abscessus_; 3 are Brazilian patients and 3 are Paraguayan. The procedures involved are breast implants, abdominoplasty, and liposuction. The tests demonstrate strains with resistance to several classes of antimicrobials.

The SES/MS highlights that when the cases of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ were identified, the records were communicated to the National Health Surveillance Agency (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária; Anvisa).

_Mycobacterium abscessus_ is normally found in soil and water and does not cause infections in normal healthy individuals. The bacterium, while a common environmental contaminant, is a rare cause of a surgical site infection.

[_Mycobacteroides (formerly _Mycobacterium) abscessus_ is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM). NTM are a grouping of acid-fast bacilli separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html) that differ among themselves on the basis of in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation, and molecular diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _Mycobacteroides chelonae-abscessus_ group and the_Mycolicibacterium [formerly _Mycobacterium] fortuitum_ complex. RGM produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation. More slowly growing NTM include _Mycobacterium marinum_, _M. gordonae_, _M. kansasii_, and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_.

NTM are environmental mycobacteria, found in water and soil, which can form biofilms on the inner surfaces of water distribution systems and are resistant to chlorine (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00190/full), constituting a risk for certain people by microaspiration or by inhalation of aerosols. Water from these systems can also contaminate medications and medical instruments. Outbreaks of infections due to RGM have been related to subcutaneous injection of substances contaminated with the bacterium or through invasive medical procedures employing contaminated equipment or implanted devices. Infection can also occur after accidental injury where the wound is contaminated by soil. In addition, _M. abscessus_ is one of the mycobacteria most often isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. In immunocompromised patients, RGM can also cause disseminated infection.

_M. abscessus_ complex consists of 3 subspecies: _M. abscessus_ subsp. _abscessus_, subspecies _bolletii_, and subspecies _massiliense_. The erm(41) gene, which confers macrolide resistance through methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA, is present in the _M. abscessus_ complex group, but many strains of _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ have a nonfunctional erm(41) gene, and because of this, the rate of macrolide susceptibility is higher in _M. abscessus_ subsp. _massiliense_ than in the other _M. abscessus_ subsp. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4550155/). Because macrolide-resistance can be inducible, strains of _M. abscessus_ initially susceptible can emerge resistant during macrolide therapy. Efflux pumps have also been shown to contribute to macrolide resistance in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.dovepress.com/efflux-pumps-contribute-to-intrinsic-clarithromycin-resistance-in-clin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IDR).

_M. abscessus_ is also highly resistant to most beta-lactam antibiotics, likely due to its bacterial cell wall biochemistry and a broad-spectrum, chromosomally encoded Ambler class A beta-lactamase (BlaMab) that is resistant to the beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate, tazobactam, and sulbactam (https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/69/3/691/784297 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6167491/). Of the beta-lactam subclasses, carbapenems have the greatest activity against _M. abscessus_, and among the carbapenems, imipenem has the most activity (https://jcm.asm.org/content/54/6/1586). Newer non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitors -- avibactam, relebactam (marketed with imipenem), and vaborbactam (marketed with meropenem) -- improve the activity of carbapenems against _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8 and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6395916/). Combinations of different beta-lactam subclasses, such as amoxicillin plus imipenem/relebactam, may be required to fully inhibit peptidoglycan biosynthesis in _M. abscessus_ (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-57844-8).

_M. abscessus_ isolates display in vitro resistance to most oral antibiotics and are generally susceptible to a limited number of parenteral agents, including tigecycline, imipenem, cefoxitin, and amikacin (https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/#toc-1). Current (2020) therapeutic guidelines with respect to pulmonary _M. abscessus_ infection (https://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/nontuberculous-mycobacterial-ntm-diseases/) suggest multidrug therapy that includes at least 3 active drugs in the initial phase of treatment that often include amikacin and a beta-lactam--imipenem or cefoxitin (guided by in vitro susceptibility testing that includes detection of a functional or nonfunctional erm(41) gene). The duration of therapy, usually more than 12 months, depends on disease severity. Macrolides are very active in vitro against _M. abscessus_ strains without a functional erm(41) gene, and evidence supports their use in patients with disease caused by macrolide-susceptible _M. abscessus_. The 2020 ATS/IDSA guidelines also suggest treatment regimens should be designed in collaboration with experts in the management of these complicated infections. - Mod.ML
