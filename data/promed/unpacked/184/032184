Plague Breaks out in Mongolia
-----------------------------
About 200 [cases of plague have been reported during the past 2 days. [The
disease is usually caused by physical contact with marmots in this
landlocked country. Teams of doctors have been rushed to the affected areas
in the Central Aymak (the central province) near Ulan Bator and the
southwestern Archangaj Aymag (the Archangaj province), the
Mongolian-language daily Unen (the Truth) said Tuesday.
Measures, including large-scale vaccinations, have been taken to prevent
the plague from further spreading, according to an official with the Center
for Control and Research of Natural Infectious Diseases in Mongolia.
Enkhtuya, a senior medical expert from the center, said: "Almost 90 percent
of the population in the capital city Ulan Bator and about 60 percent in
the areas close to the city have been inoculated against the disease." No
vehicles or persons are allowed to enter or leave the plague-affected areas
under a curfew order issued after the first cases were reported early Monday.
Enough vaccines imported from Russia are available, said Enkhtuya, who
fears a possible outbreak in other provinces.
The outbreak of what is called here the "marmot plague" is not rare in
Mongolia and occurs almost every year in many parts of the country. Marmots
are wild rodents that can spread plague to human beings if people eat the
meat or are bitten by the animal.
The first persons who fell victim to the plague in the latest outbreak are
from 2 herdsmen families who reportedly ate marmot meat. Meanwhile, the
Civil Defense Authority, the Ministry of Nature and Environment, and the
Ministry of Health are considering a nationwide drive to kill marmots,
which is believed to be the most effective way to prevent outbreaks of the
plague.

[The usual role of fleas in transmission of plague from rodents to humans
is not mentioned in this article. Direct transmission via aerosol or
contact with skin abrasions is possible if humans are butchering marmots. I
recommend that interested persons review the background postings cited
above for the year 2000. - Mod.ES
[It would be appreciated if a reader with data confirming that bites of
marmots have resulted in cases of human plague sends us these data.
Transmission of plague to humans has been reported following both cat bites
and cat scratches. - Man. Ed. DS
