From: "Heidi S. Hoff" <hhoff@crcvms.unl.edu>

In light of concerns about exposure, what precautions are being taken during
the sampling of brain from animals shot by hunters? I do hope that the
wildlife officers are the ones doing the sampling, and that they are double
gloved and wearing masks.
Until we know more about the transmissibility of the prion diseases between
species, erring on the side of extreme caution seems prudent.

[Heidi has presented an excellent question. Is there anyone in the Utah
offices that can tell us what type of precautions you have recommended to
hunters & officers with regard to brain sampling? - Mod.TG
