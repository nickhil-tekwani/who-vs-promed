Mumps outbreak hits young people in Oban, Argyll
------------------------------------------------
Young people in Oban are being advised to ensure they are vaccinated
against mumps after an outbreak in the Scottish west coast town. NHS
[National Health Service] Highland said about 50 cases had been identified,
mainly among teenagers and those in their early 20s. It is believed
returning students and increased social events over the festive period may
have contributed to the spread of the virus.

Mumps is spread through saliva and is transmitted by coughs and sneezes.
Symptoms include swelling on the angle of the jaw on one or both sides of
the face. Often there are several days of earlier symptoms, which could
include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle aches, and loss of appetite.

Doctors have said that teenagers in Oban who have not had all their MMR
[measles, mumps, and rubella triple vaccine] jabs should make sure they are
up to date with vaccination.

[This is a significant outbreak in a small relatively isolated town of
around 8000 inhabitants on the west coast of Scotland. A significant
component of the population are young people who become dispersed for
employment or further education. It is likely that their return for the
Christmas/New Year holiday period has sparked this outbreak. It may also
signify low MMR vaccine coverage locally and may further be a consequence
of the lower immunogenicity of the mumps virus component of the triple vaccine.

Oban can be located on the west coast of Scotland, Argyll and Bute Council
Area, using the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Scotland at
