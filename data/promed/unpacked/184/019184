[1] Africa: vaccination
Date: Fri 14 Jan 2022
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/14/africa-should-now-focus-on-easing-local-vaccine-bottlenecks


Rates of vaccination against COVID-19 are still disappointingly low in Africa, with just around 8% of the continent's population fully vaccinated against the disease, and this average masks large differences between countries. Mauritius and Morocco, for example, already fully vaccinated 72% and 62% of their populations, respectively, but in countries like Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, vaccination rates remain well under 1%.

Since the emergence of the more transmissible omicron variant, the number of COVID-19 infections is on the rise, but the number of deaths still remain relatively low on the continent. Nevertheless, given the known weaknesses of African health sectors, including the limited number of intensive care beds, there are fears that if the omicron variant continues its rapid spread -- or worse, a more transmissible and deadly variant emerges -- Africa could find itself in the middle of an unprecedented public health crisis. Thus, front-loading vaccination appears to be the only available option to prevent a new disaster on the continent.

Unfortunately, due to several interconnected factors, Africa is not expected to reach the global target of 70% vaccination set for mid-2022 until the end of 2024, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Beyond its consequences for the population of the continent, that miss will likely have large and negative spillover effects on the rest of the world in terms of the emergence of new, potentially more harmful variants.

The main reason behind low vaccination rates in Africa has been the low supply. Indeed, high-income countries have been hoarding vaccines, most recently for 3rd "booster" doses, leaving low-income countries, including many in Africa, unable to access enough doses even for their most vulnerable populations and frontline health workers.

The limited shelf life of vaccines -- 3-6 months on average -- also had an effect on vaccination rates in Africa, as it made it highly difficult for vaccine-abundant nations to transfer their excess doses to vaccine-poor nations before they expire.

But vaccine manufacturers around the world are ramping up production, and demand for vaccines is slowly but steadily declining in high-income countries. According to The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, at least 1.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine are currently being produced every month, and the total number of vaccine doses produced is expected to reach 24 billion by June 2022. By that time vaccine supplies will likely outstrip global demand. What all this means is that the supply shortage in Africa will likely come to an end in the near future. This is undoubtedly good news for the continent. But now, African states need to focus their efforts on overcoming local bottlenecks, such as poor logistics, lack of capacity to administer doses, and vaccine hesitancy, which could hinder future vaccination drives.

Failure to address these bottlenecks swiftly and efficiently could result in more and more vaccine doses being returned to manufacturers or destroyed, especially considering the short shelf life of most doses.

The continent has endemic logistical problems. Many of Africa's leading ports, for example, are suffering from high levels of corruption which is already causing significant delays in and adding costs to imports. These problems could also derail the continent's COVID-19 vaccination drives. Furthermore, Africa's cold chain infrastructure is highly insufficient, which is readily causing 50% of the food produced by African countries on average to be wasted. Considering COVID-19 vaccines need to be refrigerated -- some at very low temperatures -- this inadequacy can also pose a threat to vaccination campaigns.

And even if these logistics problems are resolved, most African nations do not currently have the means to put all the doses they are expected to receive in the arms of Africans before they expire. For one thing, there are not nearly enough nurses or other trained health professionals to administer the vaccines. The average number of nurses in sub-Saharan Africa countries is one per 1000 of the population, compared to 10 per 1000 in The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD member countries and 15 per 1000 in North America according to the World Bank. Furthermore, many of these countries also do not have enough syringes for widespread vaccination drives.

Low urbanisation levels in many African countries are also an obstacle to vaccine campaigns. While the urbanisation rate has rapidly increased on the continent over the past few decades, it remains relatively low, making it harder to administer the vaccine to all citizens. Six in 10 sub-Saharan Africans still live in rural areas according to the World Bank. To reach segments of the population in remote areas, Ivory Coast deployed mobile clinics across the country, and Ghana used drones to deliver doses to remote areas. Other African countries should also invest in such initiatives if they want to reach their vaccination targets in time.

On top of these logistical problems, vaccine hesitancy also poses a problem. Reports that the AstraZeneca vaccine can cause blood clots, and the decision by several European countries to not administer this particular vaccine to their citizens, has increased hesitancy on the continent. Moreover, social media platforms, including Facebook, which is synonymous with the internet in many African countries, have become vehicles for COVID-19 vaccine misinformation and led many Africans to become hesitant about taking the vaccine. Many African states failed to respond efficiently to these misinformation campaigns by providing accurate information on vaccines. Regrettably, several respected public figures, including political leaders, also directly contributed to the spread of misinformation and baseless doubts about the safety of vaccines.

As more doses arrive on the continent, domestic bottlenecks will become the main constraints to the vaccination efforts. African leaders, with the support of development institutions, should set clear vaccination plans and invest strategically in improving logistics and digitalising their systems to better track doses. They should also expand and improve their cold chain infrastructures. They should invest in initiatives to ensure doses reach segments of the population in remote areas. To address vaccine hesitancy, politicians, whether in power on not, should partner with popular public figures, such as football players, music stars, and social media influencers, to encourage Africans to get vaccinated. Financial incentives such as conditional cash transfers via mobile phones can also help stimulate vaccination and provide the needed relief to households who have suffered greatly during the pandemic.

[2] Taiwan: cases
Date: Sat 15 Jan 2022
Source: Taipei Times [edited]

The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) yesterday [Fri 14 Jan 2022] reported 11 new local COVID-19 infections, all linked to cases recorded in Taoyuan since Monday [10 Jan 2022] last week, and 57 imported cases.

The domestic cases are 8 males and 3 females, with 2 of them children under the age of 5, the CECC said.

Two involved a man and his mother, who is friends with a member of the Golden Voice Social Club in Taoyuan who tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday [7 Jan 2022] last week, it said. The mother was already in quarantine because of the spread of COVID-19 at the club, Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung, who heads the center, told a news conference.

The new cases also include a man in his 30s, who is the husband of a worker at a factory in Taoyuan where 5 cases have been confirmed. He tested positive after being placed in quarantine with 2 family members, who tested positive on Thursday [13 Jan 2022], Chen said.

The remaining new local cases tested positive after they were listed as close contacts of 13 infected employees of a Union Bank of Taiwan branch in Taoyuan's Jhongli District, the CECC said. Two are family members of bank employees who are in quarantine, and one is an employee's friend, while 3 work at a steak house, and 2 are children who ate at the restaurant at about the same time as several bank employees, the CECC said.

Five of the 11 domestic cases are breakthrough infections: one had a single dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, 3 are unvaccinated -- including the children who are not eligible for the vaccine -- and the status of 2 people was still being investigated, the CECC said.

Genome sequencing showed that a nurse working in the COVID-19 ward of Taipei City Hospital's Renai Branch, who was confirmed as having COVID-19 late on Wednesday [12 Jan 2022], was infected with a different omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 from other domestic cases this year [2022].

The 4 different types of omicron found in 39 domestic cases show that there are 4 chains of the disease spreading in Taiwan, Chen said.

So far this year [2022], Taiwan has recorded 72 domestic cases, all but 6 of whom are linked to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.

Chen said that he is confident that the current wave of infections can be contained, adding that the CECC is not considering a ban on banquets held by companies ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.

The 57 imported cases are people who arrived between 31 Dec [2021] and Thursday [13 Jan 2022], including 28 who arrived on long-haul flights and tested positive at the airport, while 29 who tested positive while in quarantine, Chen said.

Separately, Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je yesterday said that from today, all sports activities in the city, outdoors and indoors, must be conducted while wearing masks.

Drinking, swimming, visiting saunas or spas, or engaging in other water-based activities would be exempt, Ko said.

Referees and athletes are allowed to play without masks in official games if they have received their 2nd COVID-19 vaccination at least 14 days prior, or have already taken a booster shot, he added.

[3] Waning immunity
Date: Thu 13 Jan 2022

Citation: Kwok SLL, Cheng SMS, Leung JNS, et al. Waning antibody levels after COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA Comirnaty and inactivated CoronaVac vaccines in blood donors, Hong Kong, April 2020 to October 2021. Euro Surveill. 2022; 27(2): pii=2101197; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.2.2101197.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong government launched its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination programme on 26 Feb 2021. Vaccination with the mRNA vaccine Comirnaty (BNT162b2 mRNA, BioNTech/Fosun-Pharma, Mainz, Germany/Shanghai, China) and the inactivated CoronaVac vaccine (Sinovac Life Sciences, Beijing, China) is available free of charge for all Hong Kong residents. As at 31 Oct 2021, 9 043 407 doses have been administered, and over 60% (4 425 382) of the eligible population has received 2 vaccine doses. To inform an effective long-term vaccination strategy, it is important to understand waning antibody responses with different vaccines. We present antibody responses over time following vaccination with the Comirnaty vaccine and the CoronaVac vaccine.

Abstract
---------
We observed waning antibody levels in 850 fully vaccinated (at least 14 days passed after 2nd dose) blood donors using ELISA and surrogate virus neutralisation test. The Comirnaty-vaccinated group's (n = 593) antibody levels remained over the ELISA and sVNT positive cut-offs within the 1st 6 months. The CoronaVac-vaccinated group's (n = 257) median antibody levels began to fall below the cut-offs 4 months after vaccination.

Discussion
-----------
There have been limited studies on waning antibody levels following the CoronaVac vaccine, which has been approved for World Health Organization Emergency Use Listing. Although CoronaVac is still under evaluation in the European Union, it is accepted as a proof of vaccination to waive travel restrictions in several European countries. Information on the humoral response of non-mRNA vaccines such as CoronaVac is crucial as these vaccines are widely distributed in low- and middle-income countries. Our results suggest that antibody levels declined over time following both Comirnaty and CoronaVac vaccination. In particular, the CoronaVac vaccinated group's median antibody levels fell below positive cut-offs 4 months after vaccination. Since neutralising antibody levels have been shown to be predictive of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, waning antibody levels with different COVID-19 vaccines should be taken into consideration when designing vaccination programmes.

[4] Persistence of envelope gene sgRNA
Date: Tue 7 Dec 2021
Source: Science Direct [edited]
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221012066


Citation: Davies M, Bramwell LR, Jeffery N, et al. Persistence of clinically relevant levels of SARS-CoV-2 envelope gene subgenomic RNAs in non-immunocompromised individuals. Int Jour Infect Dis. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.312.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
------------
- SARS-CoV-2 activity is difficult to assess with conventional PCR assays.
- Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) may be a better proxy for infectivity.
- Over 10% of COVID-19 patients were sgRNA positive beyond a 10-day period.
- Long-duration sgRNA-positive patients were clinically unremarkable.
- Vulnerable settings may require additional measures to minimize transmission.

Abstract
----------
Objectives
This study aimed to evaluate the associations between COVID-19 severity and active viral load, and to characterize the dynamics of active SARS-CoV-2 clearance in a series of archival samples taken from patients in the 1st wave of COVID-19 infection in the southwest of the UK.

Methods
Subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) and E-gene genomic sequences were measured in a retrospective collection of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive samples from 176 individuals and related to disease severity. Viral clearance dynamics were then assessed in relation to symptom onset and last positive test.

Results
Whilst E-gene sgRNAs declined before E-gene genomic sequences, some individuals retained sgRNA positivity for up to 68 days; 13% of sgRNA-positive cases still exhibited clinically relevant levels of virus after 10 days, with no clinical features previously associated with prolonged viral clearance times.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that potentially active virus can sometimes persist beyond a 10-day period and could pose a potential risk of onward transmission. Where this would pose a serious public health threat, additional mitigation strategies may be necessary to reduce the risk of secondary cases in vulnerable settings.

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN15_1642372124.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN15WORLD7_1642372139.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 32 countries including the USA (501 524), France (324 580), India (272 690), Italy (207 552), Argentina (96 652), Peru (88 825), Australia (83 846), the UK (80 725), Turkey (63 967), Germany (60 916), Israel (54 647), Brazil (48 520), Mexico (47 113), Japan (43 948), Philippines (38 867), Portugal (38 136), Colombia (35 575), the Netherlands (31 853), Belgium (31 678), Kazakhstan (25 904), Canada (22 095), Russia (27 179), Denmark (23 390), Greece (17 447), Austria (16 749), Poland (16 893), Viet Nam (16 378), Ireland (14 555), Serbia (12 559), Czech Republic (13 202), Ukraine (10 569), and Romania (10 062) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6648 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 13 Jan 2022 to late 14 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 74 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 40 of the 74 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and 11 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 27.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 12.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 21.5% increase in daily reported cases and 18.6% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.5 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 326.83 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.55 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
