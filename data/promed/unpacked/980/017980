188 Die of Cholera in Manicaland [Zimbabwe]
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 188 people died of cholera in Manicaland out of 1 963 who were
affected by cholera during the first quarter of this year, a Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare official has said.
Briefing visitors to the Manicaland Agricultural Show recently, an official
at the ministry's stand Mr Evos Makoni said the figures were only for
patients who reported at health institutions for treatment.
"We adopted the theme of 'Cholera: get the facts' this time because we had
a lot of cholera cases this year. A single case is an epidemic to us
because the disease is highly infectious. Cholera or diarrhea cases are
very preventable and the method is simple to follow. It is also very simple
to control."
"We are assuming that the reason why we had a terrible death rate this year
was because sugar, which is needed for the salt and sugar solution needed
for preventing dehydration, was scarce in the country."
Common sources of the disease are raw or poorly cooked fish, seafood, raw
fruits and vegetables, other foods that have been contaminated by cholera
germs during preparation or storage, and drinking water that has been
contaminated by the cholera germs during storage.

Sierra Leone: Cholera Outbreak Kills 2 in Moyamba
---------------------------------------------
No fewer than 2 people have died of a cholera epidemic at Njaagbahun town
in the Kowa chiefdom, Moyamba district. According to [a spokesperson], the
victims included an elderly woman and a young boy.
[This spokesperson] said that 3 others were in critical condition at a
nearby clinic. She regretted that "the outbreak was due to lack of good
drinking water."
"Our boreholes are dry, we have to depend on open wells filled with erosion
water. Attempts to get safe water to drink requires traveling several
kilometers," she lamented. In an emotional tone, she claimed that most of
the cholera victims died by the roadsides, while awaiting transport to
evacuate them to neighbouring towns.

West Vaal Mine Cholera Cases Rise to Eight
----------------------------------------------
At least 8 cases of cholera had been confirmed on 8 Oct 2002 at the west
Vaal mine in Klerksdorp since the outbreak was first reported on Friday, 4
Oct 2002, north west health department spokesman Cornelius Monama said.
All the patients were workers in a particular section of the mine, except
for a West Vaal Mine Hospital nurse, who attended the first patients last
week. Four patients remained hospitalized while the others were being
treated on an out-patient basis, Monama said.
While health department officials had not yet determined the cause of the
outbreak, it is believed the source of the infection could be traced to
underground water in section 9 because general mine water had tested
negative for the bacteria. The department was still awaiting the test results.
There was no danger of the disease spreading to communities beyond the
mine, according to health official Convenience Sebededi. Water from the
surrounding areas flowed into the mine where it was continually recycled.
At no point did it leave the mine, she said.
In a statement the North West health department said extensive surveillance
and monitoring was being undertaken to ensure the bacteria did not spread.
