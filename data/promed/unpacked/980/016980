Health authorities in Bugiri District have dispatched a medical team
to investigate a disease that has killed at least 72 people in the
last month. Officials took the decision after the disease, suspected
to be meningitis, killed half of its victims at [Hamma] Island on
Lake Victoria and Buwongo Village, Buhemba Sub-county on the mainland
within the last week alone.

The district health officer, Isaac Malinga, said the team is expected
to report its findings within 2 days in order to help them plan how
to stem the outbreak. He, however, added that the district is
ill-equipped to fight the disease on its own. "The outbreak has
caught us unprepared but there is hope that the government will
intervene to save the lives of the people once the cause of deaths is
established," he said.

The Buhemba Sub-county Secretary for Health, Mr John Mbiro, said 32
people, most of whom are children, have so far died in his area. He
blamed the deaths on the geographical location of the affected areas,
which are both difficult to reach due to distance from the mainland
and bad roads.

The LC1 [Local Council 1] Chairman of Hamma Island, Mr Amuza Nagheje,
said some of the sick have been transported to Lake Victoria and
Bondo hospitals in western Kenya to receive treatment. He said all
the medical personnel at the only health centre on the island had
deserted the facility.

[The lack of more specifics concerning this outbreak of suspected
meningitis with a 50 percent case fatality rate, where the deaths
have involved mainly children, in a remote region, makes a specific
diagnosis difficult. ProMED-mail awaits further information with interest.
