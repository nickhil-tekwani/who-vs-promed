Bluetongue, Europe - clinical signs in cattle
-----------------------------------------------
The following account (see below) was sent to me, privately, on 16 Oct 2006
by a German beef cattle farmer, following my request for more specific
information regarding clinical signs of bluetongue in European cattle. It
included a combination of firsthand and secondhand information (see comment
about farmers milking cows).
"I am farming beef cattle in Germany, and we are seeing outbreaks of
bluetongue nearly every day.
The 1st cattle around my place showed 1st signs of disease on 21 Aug 2006.
Interestingly, mainly older cattle were/are affected, and 1st signs were
laminitis-like symptoms, dark red colored skin of the udder and swollen,
blood shot eyes. All the cattle I am aware of showed, when presented for
inspection, no fever. Due to the swelling of the tongues, most of the
animals had difficulties foraging, but when brought inside, eating silage
and soft hay wasn't a problem. Lesions of the tongue or muzzle were
occasionally present but disappeared within a couple of days, as did the
lesions on the udders of the animals. Mortality was, at least in our
region, not recorded, and no abortions were experienced.
Cattle were treated symptomatically with [an anti-inflammatory, non-steroid
(AINS), analgesic preparation] and antibiotics.
On average, 10 days after the 1st clinical signs were reported, the cattle
were back to normal health without any signs left and no obvious loss of
weight.
Since the end of September 2006, the virus seems to have become more
aggressive, as the cattle affected during the last couple of days showed
more severe signs of disease; some were not able to eat at all due to edema
of the tongue and the head, and I heard of one cow that couldn't get up
because of laminitis.
Symptoms appear within hours; farmers are milking their cows in the morning
without any suspicious signs, and by midday, the cows show a stiff gait,
which is the 1st sign of disease.
Temperatures this month [October 2006] have been on average 17.8 C, which
is very warm for October. As it is still not clear which species of
_Culicoides_ is involved in transmitting the disease, we have to hold our
breath and wait for the winter. A drop in temperature is forecasted from 21
Oct 2006, so we might see more cases for the next couple of weeks."

[This is a rather detailed and -- seemingly -- careful and thorough
clinical description, generally in line with previous communications. See
the detailed reports from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands presented
during the meeting of EU's Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal
Health (SCoFCAH) held in Brussels on 28 Aug 2006. The reports include,
among other things, pictures demonstrating the clinical signs in bovines
and ovines and additional valuable information, accessible at the following
URLs:
Belgium:

The Netherlands:

Clinicians in the affected countries, as well as those in other countries
where cattle have been reportedly affected by bluetongue or bluetongue-like
syndromes (USA, Morocco, Israel, Bulgaria), are invited to send their own
observations and, if applicable, identifying differences or similarities
with the above clinical descriptions. - Mod.AS]

[According to the above text, the Bulgarian notification refers to the
detection of sero-positive cattle and goats, but (not surprisingly,
considering past experience in Bulgaria) no clinical symptoms observed in
these species. If this is indeed the case, it would be interesting to get
data on the reason for the testing; if it was part of a wide scale
sero-surveillance, its scale, geographic distribution, species involved and
results will be helpful. Since these species are not supposed to have been
vaccinated, the establishment of the serotype involved is feasible and of
importance, requiring sero-neutralization testing. - Mod.AS]

[3] EU ADNS weekly report

EU Animal disease notification system (ADNS)
-----------------------------------------------
According to the 20 Oct 2006 update of table 11 (animal disease situation
per country and per disease), the total number of bluetongue outbreaks
reported by European Union member states during the period 1 Jan 2006 to 20
Oct 2006 was 1044. This includes 8 cases in a newly infected country,
Bulgaria, now added to the 4 northwestern European countries affected earlier.
The following (accumulated) number of outbreaks are reported from each of
the 5 affected EU countries:
Country / No outbreaks (previous week's data) / last date of confirmation
Belgium / 403 (297) / 19 Oct 2006
Bulgaria / 8 (0) / 11 Oct 2006
Germany / 365 (208) / 19 Oct 2006
France / 5 (4) / 13 Oct 2006
Netherlands / 263 (206) / 19 Oct 2006

[329 newly confirmed BT outbreaks have been reported during the week 12-19
Oct 2006, of which 321 are in the 4 affected northwestern EU countries,
namely 106 in Belgium, 157 in Germany, 57 in the Netherlands and one in
France. This is a considerable, accelerating weekly increase. While last
week's increase was particularly underlined in Belgium, this week it is
Germany which demonstrates the most remarkable increase. It is noteworthy
that the (single) new outbreak in France appears after a rather long (since
5 Sep 2006) intermission.
The other 8 "outbreaks" were reported from Bulgaria (see previous item). -
