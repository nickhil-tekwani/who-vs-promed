A highly unusual rabies infection in a donkey has been reported by
health officials in a county of Georgia, in the United States.

Since the start of 2011, the Decatur County Health Department has
investigated 2 positive cases of rabies, including the rare donkey
infection, county environmental health specialist Ansley Johnson
said.

"We know rabies is in the wild animal population, so we are not
surprised to see positive cases now and then," Johnson said. "All
mammals are vulnerable to rabies, including horses, goats, and cattle.
But generally when we see exposures in domestic animals they are in
pet dogs and cats. This is the 1st time we've seen a donkey with
rabies in the district."

The other animal that tested positive for rabies was a raccoon.
Raccoons, bats, foxes, skunks, coyotes, and bobcats are among the
common rabies carriers in Georgia.

"Vaccinating pets and livestock and avoiding contact with wild
animals are the best ways to avoid exposure to the disease," Johnson
said. "Rather than alarming us, these cases should serve as a reminder
of the importance of having pets vaccinated against rabies and making
sure that their vaccinations are up to date."

Prompted by 2 separate cases of family pets that interacted with wild
animals and then tested positive for rabies in north Bryan County, the
Bryan County Health Department issued a reminder to residents to get
pets vaccinated. Neither of the family pets was up-to-date on their
rabies vaccinations and as a result, both were euthanized.

A Fairview Township [York County] woman is being treated for rabies
after she was bitten by a rabid black kitten that ran into her
Springers Lane home.

The rabid feline rushed into the woman's home on 10 Jan 2011, when
the door was open because someone else was entering. The kitten bit
her when she grabbed the cat to remove it, said Holli Senior, press
secretary for the state's Department of Health, which is urging anyone
who had contact with the cat to contact its offices.

"Ironically, after she threw it out the door, it must have run out
into the street and got hit by a car," Senior said. The motorist who
ran over the kitten reported the animal to the Department of Health,
which tested it and found rabies.

The woman is undergoing [post exposure] prophylaxis treatment because
of her exposure.

A stray cat taken in near UNC [University of North Carolina]
Asheville has tested positive for rabies and health officials are
warning anyone who had contact with the cat to see their doctor
immediately.

Buncombe County Department of Health spokeswoman Beverly Levinson
said the small, female, short-haired grey cat with green eyes was
picked up by someone near Weaver Boulevard. The person who picked up
the cat took the animal into the vet after it started acting
strangely. A veterinarian confirmed the cat had rabies.

The person who picked up the cat is being treated. The health
department did not have any additional information about the person.
The department said they don't know if anyone else was exposed.

A raccoon that bit a man in Delray Beach has tested positive for
rabies.

Palm Beach County Health Department spokesman Tim O'Connor said a man
was walking to his truck Tuesday [15 Feb 2011] when the raccoon
scurried from under the truck and bit him on the leg. The man used a
crowbar to fend off the raccoon until Animal Care and Control removed
the animal.

O'Connor said a state laboratory in Lantana concluded Friday [18 Feb
2011] that the raccoon was rabid.

The victim was advised to undergo a series of rabies shots
administered by the Palm Beach County Health Department.

A LaCrosse woman is recovering physically from an attack by a rabid
bobcat, but finding the courage to go outside her house is another
matter. The woman was bitten on the hand on 28 Dec 2010 by the
25-pound [11 kg] bobcat as she put her hands to her neck to protect it
from the springing feline.

The victim has gotten rabies shots and spent 9 days in the hospital
because the wounds became infected. She's on the mend but skittish.

Anthony Dennis, Alachua County Health Department environmental
director, determined that the bobcat had not been in contact with the
victim's husband or with the family's pet cat.

The victim said the bobcat was by a picture window at the front of
the house trying to get the family cat, Simon, which had jumped onto a
wood pile. The husband got a gun while the victim went out the front
door to get Simon, and the bobcat saw her. "He charged at me and
jumped through the air at my neck. I put my hand up to protect myself
and he bit my hand," she said. The bobcat charged again, and the
husband said he used his rifle to keep it off his wife before shooting
it. "It was very aggressive," he said.

"I've been hunting for many years and have never seen anything like
that, ever."

They took the bobcat with them to the emergency room. An officer with
the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission got the bobcat
from them. It was later tested and found to be rabid, forcing the
victim to get a series of rabies shots in addition to the 9 days in
the hospital because of the infection.

[Likely there was a stir in the emergency room when they came in with
a dead bobcat! It is possible that someone at the hospital alerted the
Wildlife Conservation folks.

A bobcat (_Felis rufus_ or _Lynx rufus_) resembles the lynx, but
there are differences. A bobcat is larger than a house, cat, weighing
in at 20-30 pounds or about 9-13 kilograms and about 24 inches or 55-
60 cm at the shoulder. Photos of a bobcat may be seen at

[9] Oral Rabies Vaccination - Texas
Date: Mon 24 Jan 2011
Source: El Paso Times [edited]
<http://www.elpasotimes.com/communities/ci_17177490>


A rabies program for foxes and coyotes aims to create a buffer zone.
The best way to prevent an outbreak is to be proactive against it.
That is the goal of the Oral Rabies Vaccination Program in El Paso,
which is targeting area coyotes and foxes.

Dr Ken Waldrup, a zoonosis control veterinarian with the Texas
Department of State Health Services, is head of the program that
distributed a special bait containing a vaccine that is 75 percent
effective and attractive to coyotes and foxes, last week [week of 17
Jan 2011] in the El Paso area. Of thousands of baits spread out in the
Franklin Mountains and Rio Grande riverbanks, hundreds were circulated
in the Northeast in Hitt Canyon, past Martin Luther King Blvd.

"Normally when we distribute it, we drop it out of an airplane,"
Waldrup said. "Here we are basically throwing it under any cover we
can find."

The bait is a hollow hard shell with an inner plastic pouch that
contains the vaccine. Once bitten, the pouch will break and enough of
the vaccine will enter the animal's mouth and begin replicating.

"They are attracted to the scent and will come get it," Waldrup said.
"It is not like the vaccines a pet can get from a vet, but it is
definitely better than nothing."

The effort, which began 2 years ago, is a preventive measure against
a rabies virus that began in Arizona and spread into southwestern New
Mexico.

"We are trying to create a small buffer zone to prevent what happened
in New Mexico," Waldrup said. "The numbers have gone down in New
Mexico, so this may be the last time we do this in El Paso."

While the vaccine is meant for wild coyotes, foxes, and raccoons, it
will not harm a domestic dog. Waldrup said even though the bait is
safe for dogs, it should not be a used as a substitute for a regular
vaccination. If anyone comes into contact with a bait, they should
leave it where they find it, wash their hands and call 877-722-6725 to
report it.

"Many people don't realize how many foxes and coyotes we have in the
El Paso metropolitan area," he said. "I personally think it's great,
but we have to make sure they are not a threat to us."

[10] Javelina, canine - Arizona

<http://www.kpho.com/news/26916295/detail.html>


Officials in Yavapai county confirmed that a javelina that attacked a
dog Monday [14 Feb 2011] has tested positive for rabies.

Yavapai county sheriff spokesman Dwight D'Evlyn said animal control
officers were called to a home in Walnut Grove to investigate a report
of a javelina attack involving a domestic dog.

D'Evlyn said the family hound dog had been tethered outside the home
when a javelina approached the home. The javelina engaged the dog and
was able to bite the dog's hindquarters. The dog's owner was able to
kill the javelina.

On Thursday [17 Feb 2011], lab reports confirmed the javelina was
rabid, D'Evlyn said. Unfortunately the dog did not have a current
rabies vaccination, and was euthanized.

D'Evlyn said Although the dog's owner was deemed to have minimal
exposure and was not bitten, post exposure vaccinations were
recommended. The owner is currently receiving those treatments.

Animal Control officers suggest removing any outside food source from
unfenced areas of your property. This includes homes with pets located
in densely populated neighborhoods. Also, make sure your pets are up
to date on their rabies vaccinations.

Arizona Game and Fish spokesman Doug Burt said cases of rabid
javelinas are rare in Arizona.

Burt said information from the Arizona Game and Fish website about
contact with javelinas is available at
<http://www.azgfd.gov/w_c/urban_javelina.shtml>.

[Javelina (also called peccaries) are fascinating creatures. They are
extremely family oriented and very, very protective of their family.
Their physiology is fascinating and while they have a nose that
resembles a pig, they are not related to the pig.

A dead raccoon found in the Glen Allen area of northern Henrico
County has tested positive for rabies.

Authorities said a dog came in contact with the raccoon's remains
Wednesday afternoon [16 Feb 2011] in the 5900 block of Rigney Place,
just southwest of Interstate 295's Staples Mill Road interchange.

The remains were sent to the state lab for testing, and the results
Thursday [17 Feb 2011] confirmed the presence of rabies in the
raccoon. The dog that was exposed was current on its rabies
vaccinations and will be quarantined at its owner's home for 45 days.

Warren County Animal Control director Elma Rae Greene said that on
the morning of Thu 10 Feb 2011, Animal Control was contacted by a
homeowner on Beaverdam Road who found a dead raccoon. Greene said that
one of the property owner's 2 dogs was directly exposed to the animal,
and the 2nd dog may have been indirectly exposed.

Greene said that the raccoon could have been on the property
overnight. Animal Control speculates that the animal could have been
attracted to the residence by meat scraps left in the yard and later
died after another animal attack or due to rabies infection.

Because of the potential of rabies infection, the Oine property
owner's dogs were taken by Animal Control to be isolated at the county
animal shelter until the raccoon could be tested for rabies. Tests on
the raccoon were positive.

Greene explained that isolation is a routine precaution to prevent
additional exposure to the deadly disease, though both of the property
owner's dogs were up-to-date on their rabies vaccines. They stayed at
the animal shelter overnight, and were able to go home after being
revaccinated. "I was so happy to be able to send these dogs back
home," Greene said. "This is why we vaccinate our animals."

In a case such as this, the shelter charges the pet owner USD 6 per
animal for a rabies vaccination and USD 10 per animal for overnight
care. Greene said that if unvaccinated dogs and cats come in contact
with rabid animals, they must either be quarantined for 6 months at
the owner's expense or humanely euthanized.

Animal control rabies vaccinators can make field calls to provide
rabies vaccinations for owners, hunt clubs, and kennels with 10 or
more dogs and/or cats. To schedule an appointment, call (252)
257-6137.
