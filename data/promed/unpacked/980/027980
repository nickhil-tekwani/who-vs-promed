[2] USA: reorganization
Date: Wed 20 Jul 2022 3:41 PM EDT

The Biden administration is reorganizing the federal health department to create an independent division that would lead the nation's pandemic response, amid frustrations with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The move elevates a roughly 1000-person team -- known as the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, or ASPR -- into a separate division, charged with coordinating the nation's response to health emergencies, according to 7 people briefed on the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment.

The reorganization allows the division "to mobilize a coordinated national response more quickly and stably during future disasters and emergencies while equipping us with greater hiring and contracting capabilities," Dawn O'Connell, who leads ASPR and would run the new division, wrote staff on Wednesday afternoon [20 Jul 2022]. The emailed memo was shared with The Washington Post.

The creation of the new Administration of Strategic Preparedness and Response, which is expected to be phased in over 2 years, comes at a time of growing concern about the federal government's ability to respond to health emergencies -- whether a once-in-a-century pandemic driven by a novel virus like SARS-CoV-2, or an outbreak of a long-identified pathogen such as monkeypox, which has established treatments and vaccines.

[The current COVID-19 and monkeypox outbreaks should provide examples on which to base the structure needed to detect, monitor, and respond swiftly and accurately given the highly decentralized health system that exists in the USA. It is not clear from the report above that such an integrated system exists or is being proposed. - Mod.TY]

Public Health Ontario is reporting 230 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the province, most of which are located in Toronto. The tally as of Monday [17 Jul 2022] has risen by 74 cases from the 156 confirmed as of 11 Jul 2022.

The agency's latest report says the cases are largely in southern Ontario, with 172 cases in Toronto, as well as one each in Sudbury and North Bay. One of the confirmed cases is a female -- recorded last week [week of 11 Jul 2022] -- and the rest of the people affected are male, with an average age of 37.

Most cases are among men who report intimate contact with men but say anyone can get monkeypox. The report says 9 people have been hospitalized with the illness and one person has been in intensive care. There are also 8 probable monkeypox cases in Ontario, all in men between the ages of 31 and 69.

[5] UK: contact tracing guidance

Monkeypox contact tracing guidance: classification of contacts and advice for vaccination and follow up
---------------------------------------------------------------
This guidance provides principles for risk assessment and follow-up of contacts of confirmed, symptomatic monkeypox cases. The infectious period is taken to be from the onset of prodromal symptoms until the complete resolution of symptoms.

Public health professionals should take into account the extent of lesions at the time of exposure, as the risk will be higher if there are widespread uncovered lesions on uncovered areas (for example, hands or face) or if the case was displaying respiratory symptoms at the time of contact compared with a small number of localised genital lesions.

Further information on monkeypox is available at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/monkeypox.

Specific advice on vaccination with MVA-BN reinforcing dose (booster) recommendations based on prior smallpox vaccine history is available in Table 2 in the Recommendations for the use of pre and post-exposure vaccination during a monkeypox incident [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-vaccination].

[Specific information is provided in the table at the source URL above in the following areas:
- Exposure risk
- Description
- Example scenarios
- Public health advice
- Recommendation for PPE
- Information sheets
