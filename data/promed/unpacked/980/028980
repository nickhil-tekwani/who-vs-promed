A spike in whooping cough [pertussis] cases may have been caused by a new strain of the bacterium that is [more] resistant to existing vaccines, new research suggests. In 2011, the number of diagnosed whooping cough cases in Australia rose to 38 000, the highest since records began in 1991.

A team of Australian scientists studied samples taken from patients in 4 states and found the new strain of the bacterium now accounts for 84 percent of whooping cough cases. Among the recent victims was a 5-week-old baby boy who died in an Adelaide hospital 18 months ago. Adults can get whooping cough as well.

Professor Lyn Gilbert, who is the director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology at Sydney's Westmead Hospital, says the strain is breaking through the protection of vaccines. "What we suspect, although it's circumstantial evidence at this stage, is that one of the reasons that there has been a significant increase in Australia and many other countries in the last few years is that this strain is not affected as much by the vaccine as the older strains were," she said. "So that it's been able to break through the protection offered by the vaccines."

Doctor Jeremy McAnulty from New South Wales Health says that does not mean people should not be vaccinated. "Before vaccinations against whooping cough it was a major killer, there were hundreds of deaths," he said. He says even where the vaccine does not prevent the bacteria, it still reduces its severity.

[Dr Gilbert and her colleagues have just published their findings (Octavia S, Sintchenko V, Gilbert GL, et al: Newly emerging clones of _Bordetella pertussis_ carrying prn2 and ptxP3 alleles implicated in Australian pertussis epidemic in 2008-2010. J Infect Dis 2012; 205: 1220-24; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22416243) suggesting that acellular pertussis vaccines seem to select for _B. pertussis_ clones carrying antigens that differ from those in the vaccine. It is not clear if these breakthroughs in immunization would have or will occur from use of the whole cell vaccine, which is still used in some countries. - Mod.LL
