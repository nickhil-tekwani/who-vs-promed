United States to stockpile smallpox vaccine
-------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) signed a
contract on Wednesday to buy 155 million doses of vaccine from a British
company, preparing for the possibility that terrorists might try to spread
the highly contagious disease. The contract with Acambis Inc. is supposed
to bring the United States' stockpile to 286 million doses of the vaccine
by the end of next year, promising protection for every American. But there
are no plans to resume the routine vaccinations of Americans that ended in
1972, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson said, because the vaccine can be given 4
days after exposure to smallpox and still offer protection, and because it
can cause some rare but deadly side effects.
Smallpox hasn't occurred in the United States since 1949 and was declared
eradicated worldwide in 1980. But the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta and a Moscow laboratory hold stocks of the virus, and
bioterrorism experts worry that samples could fall into the hands of
terrorists and be used as a weapon. Experts believe such a smallpox attack
is unlikely, but it could overwhelm communities were it to occur. The virus
is highly contagious, and nearly a third of its victims die. "The risk does
exist and we must be prepared," Thompson said. "Obtaining the vaccine
represents an important insurance policy," added Dr DA Henderson, who led
the global campaign that eliminated smallpox and is now Thompson's top
bioterrorism adviser. "It's simply a prudent thing to do at this point in
time." But the risk of a smallpox attack is not significant enough to
justify the risks associated with the vaccine, he said.
About 3 in every 1 million people vaccinated would get encephalitis, which
can cause permanent brain damage or death. Another 250 among the total
population vaccinated would get a smallpox-like rash that also can be fatal
if not properly treated. And experts estimate that if every American were
vaccinated against smallpox, about 400 people would die from the vaccine.
"It causes more complications than any vaccine we now have," Henderson said.
Should smallpox reappear, a federal response plan calls for isolating the
patient and then vaccinating those in close contact with him or her. The
[US government already has 15.4 million doses of smallpox vaccine on hand,
and officials are prepared to dilute each one to create 5 doses, bringing
the total to 77 million. Researchers are studying whether each dose could
be further diluted, to get 10 doses from each one. In either case, the
diluted vaccine would be used only if the new doses had not yet been
delivered, or if they ran out, said Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.
An additional 54 million doses have been ordered from Acambis already and
are expected to be delivered next year. The new contract will bring another
155 million doses, which are expected by late fall 2002. They will cost the
government $428 million, or $2.76 per dose. That's less than the $509
million that the Bush administration has asked from Congress to pay for the
new vaccine. The initial budget request assumed that the government would
need to buy 250 million doses, but new research has found that the existing
vaccine can safely be diluted, meaning much less new vaccine is needed.
To make the newest batch of vaccine, Acambis has teamed with Baxter
International, which will begin brewing doses immediately at an undisclosed
European factory, Acambis spokeswoman Lyndsay Wright said. Acambis' own
manufacturing will begin soon at a factory in Cambridge, Massachusetts, she
said. After the vaccine is manufactured, it must be tested in clinical
trials and then approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA
promised an expedited review but vowed not to lower its standards.

[It appears that most of the currently available vaccine production
capacity will be required to create this stockpile. It is possible,
however, that a bioterrorist attack may be initiated elsewhere in the
world. Will the United States government be prepared to release vaccine for
use beyond the boundaries of the USA to contain any such outbreak? - Mod.CP
