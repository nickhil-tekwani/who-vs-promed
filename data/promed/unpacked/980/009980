Drug laden cowpats are threatening the survival of one of Britain's most
endangered species of bat, it is claimed, because the pats no longer
contain the rich supply of dung beetles and other insects that are an
important source of food for the greater horseshoe bat [Bat News, the
newsletter of the Bat Conservation Trust].
A vital component of the bats' diet is one species of dung beetle,
_Aphodius rufipes_, which favours fresh pats. As many as one hundred beetle
larvae, providing many meals for infant bats when they hatch and fly, can
be found developing in a single pat.
David Appleton, working on behalf of the environmental group English
Nature, recently toured farms in the West Country close to the maternal
roosts of bats trying to persuade farmers not to use wormers based on the
avermectin group of chemicals - which are believed to be causing the
damage. Apparently avermectin renders the pats lethal for beetle larvae for
up to 120 days. Mr Appleton told Bat News: "The female dung beetles can lay
their eggs on it but the young die."
It is estimated that there are only about 4,000 greater horseshoe bats left
in Britain, mainly in the West Country.
