----------------------------------------------------------------------
What constitutes the imposed 2 month quarantine? And why 2 months? How
many of the 56 cases were from cats? Like the Moderator, one is
worried as to what measures can truly be effective vis a vis feline
areas as it seems, though not stated, that the area could be
overpopulated with stray or feral cats. A quarantine that successfully
prevents rabies transmission is indeed laudable and worthy of
replication elsewhere in the world where stray cat populations remain
uncontrolled and a potential risk for rabies.
