[In 2006 small hive beetle infestation (_Aethina tumida_) was added to the OIE list of notifiable diseases. However, this is the 1st instance of a Member country of the European Union officially reporting the occurrence of this disease. See OIE's WAHID database section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: For further details, select the disease, region/country and choose time period)

In 2013, following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the risk of entry of _Aethina tumida_ (small hive beetle, SHB) and _Tropilaelaps_ spp. in the European Union (EU) and the identification and evaluation of risk reduction options. The following information is part of the summary of this risk analysis:

"The SHB is a bee-brood scavenger of _Apis mellifera_ (honey bee), _Bombus_ spp. (bumble bee) and _Melliponini_ (stingless bees). Mature larvae leave the hive and burrow in soil to pupate. This coleopteran is a flying, free-living predator that can survive and reproduce on a variety of ripe fruits, but not on vegetables, plants, or flowers. Adult SHB can detect airborne volatiles produced by _A. mellifera_ and _Bombus_ spp. and thereby can be attracted to the odours of bees and bee products that have come into contact with bees. The pest is native to Africa but has spread to North America and Australia during the past 20 years. The larval stage of the pest is destructive to a bee population, whereas the adults have little impact. The larvae burrow through combs, eat honey and pollen, kill bee brood, and defecate in honey, which subsequently ferments.

A qualitative risk assessment was performed taking into account current legislation but excluding the implementation of risk reduction options. Risk reduction options were assessed separately from the risk assessment. This approach allowed the assessment of the worst case scenario for each risk factor within a well-defined (legal) framework. The methodology used in this scientific opinion was adapted from a pest risk assessment for entry used in the field of plant health. Risk pathways were identified and scoring of the risk factors (assuming the worst case) was done by expert elicitation supported by the literature where possible, and an overall risk score for each pathway was obtained using a combination matrix that is used in the animal health risk assessment field. The identification and evaluation of risk reduction options was performed separately from the risk assessment for entry. After identifying possible risk reduction options on entry, each option was evaluated by scoring its effectiveness and technical feasibility and estimating the uncertainty of these scores.

Four risk questions were addressed:
- The risk of introduction, limited to entry, of SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ into the EU through importation from 3rd countries of live queen bees, queen bumble bees (_Bombus_ spp.), bumble bee colonies and bee products destined to be used in apiculture.

- The risk of introduction of the SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ into the EU from neighbouring countries, especially through the natural movements of live bees and of the SHB.

- The risk of introduction of SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ into the EU through importation from 3rd countries of products other than bee products (such as fruits, vegetables, other possible vectors and fomites, etc.)

- The risk-mitigating factors that have proven to be or that could potentially be effective in ensuring safe international trade as regards the transmission of SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ in bees and their products.

Although the risk reduction options were individually evaluated, it is clear that the risk of pest entry via most risk pathways will be further reduced when different risk reduction options are applied throughout the pathway. The likely options are mainly included in the current EU legislation or mentioned in World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) guidelines. However, the risk pathway 'accidental import of bees' requires special attention since it is associated with high risk for both SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ entry and no likely risk reduction option can be applied.

Based on the results of the pest risk assessment and the evaluation of risk reduction options, the AHAW Panel identified a need for validated rapid detection methods for SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ and a need for handling and sampling of imported bees in an insect-proof environment at the designated place of final destination. Education and training of people involved in beekeeping, or trade in or transport of bees, by improving awareness, skills and expertise, could help to monitor the distribution of SHB and _Tropilaelaps_ in 3rd countries and to prevent entry of both pests into the risk assessment area. It is recommended that research be carried out to ascertain the risk of SHB entry via products such as ripe fruits and soil associated with plants as well as the harmful effects of _Tropilaelaps_ infestation. At present, there are only limited data available on the harmful effects of _Tropilaelaps_ infestation and the current view is at least partially based on extrapolations from _Varroa_ infestations."
