Two patients have, according to this story, tested positive for
vancomycin-resistant enterococci in the General site of the Ottawa
Hospital. The 2 patients were identified during routine screening by the
hospital. The patients occupy beds in a 28-bed hematology/oncology ward. No
additional patients will be admitted to the ward until such time as all
patients on the ward have been tested. Visitors have been limited to 2 per
patient and over the age of 16. The ward has been thoroughly cleaned to
eradicate the organism from any surfaces, such as bed rails and
countertops. All staff are following contact precautions to contain the
spread of the outbreak.
