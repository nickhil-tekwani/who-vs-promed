The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) reported at least
3 rabies-related deaths in the 1st quarter of this year [2010].
Jocelyn Tabotabo, DOH-7 nurse coordinator for rabies prevention and
control program, said they did not expect the number of rabies cases
to rise because they were conducting interventions.

"The [population] was already educated. People were told to go to the
local health center to seek treatment if they were bitten by dogs or
cats instead of seeing a "tandok" [folk medicine done by placing a
deer horn over the wound] doctor or applying vinegar and garlic to the
wound," she said during the Association of Government Information
Officers forum last Wednesday [24 Mar 2010] at the DOH-7 conference
room.

The deaths were recorded in Carmen town and Toledo City in Cebu
province and Mabinay town in Negros Oriental.

Tabotabo said that last year [2009], the DOH-7 recorded a total of 16
000 rabies cases, 12 of whom died. 90 percent of the cases were caused
by dog bites while the [remaining] 10 percent by cat bites. Tabotabo
said half of the victims were school children, aged 15 and below.
Tabotabo said there are 24 bite centers in Central Visayas that can
provide at least 2 doses of the required four anti-rabies vaccines.
"Wash the wound immediately with soap and water, then apply a tincture
of iodine," she advised.

[It would be useful to have an indication of the proportion of the 16
000 exposed persons in 2009 who received 2, 3, or 4 doses of vaccine
or no post-exposure treatment. Were any of the fatal cases this year
(2010) or in 2009 recipients of vaccine? Further information would be
welcomed.
