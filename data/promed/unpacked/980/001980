It was reported on November 6, 1997 that the WHO had dispatched 2
consultants to Jayapura to investigate an outbreak of tuberculosis and
pneumonia in the most eastern Irian Jaya province. The investigation was
initiated because of an usually high incidence of 155 reported tuberculosis
cases in the area, which has only 3-5 thousand residents. Villages
affected are located near Lake Sentani, Demta, Sarmi, Tanah, Merah, Merauke
and along the Mamberamo River.
ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information about this situation.
Send reports to promed@usa.healthnet.org.
