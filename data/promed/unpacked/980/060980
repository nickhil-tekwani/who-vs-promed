Pedigree recalls dog food
----------------------------
The United States dog food maker Pedigree expanded the recall of its
product from Taiwan to 9 other Asian countries on Thursday after Thailand
and the Philippines also reported dogs dying from kidney failure.
The expanded recall comes one day after Pedigree inspectors found mildew on
2 kinds of ingredients for Pedigree dry dog food in its Thailand plant.
"We ordered the Thailand plant to stop production after we began to suspect
that there might be a link between dogs' kidney failure and Pedigree dry
food," its Taiwan distributor Eiffem Foods Taiwan said in a statement.
The voluntary recall applies to Pedigree dry dog food, Whiskas dry cat
food, Pedigree Dog's Delight Ringo, Pedigree Dog's Delight Tasty Bone, and
Pedigree Puppy Biscuit dog treats, all made in Thailand.
The products were sold in Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Thailand, Singapore, and Viet Nam. Kitekat dry sold in Thailand and
Malaysia as well as Cesar Duo sold in Taiwan and South Korea are also to be
withdrawn, the statement said. The recall also covers products in Japan
and Hong Kong.
The company began recalling its dry dog food in Taiwan on 8 Mar 2004
after hundreds of dogs -- mostly puppies -- died from kidney failure. Some
dog owners suspected the current batch of Pedigree -- from Thailand --
might have been contaminated.
"Our investigation has not confirmed a direct link between this finding and
a reported increase in renal disease among dogs in Taiwan, Thailand and the
Philippines. Veterinarians have not reported such problems with cats," the
statement added.
Pedigree denied the charge, but put up NT$1m to help authorities and health
officials find out the cause of the dogs' deaths.

[Kidney failure may be the reason the animals are dying, but the initiating
factor of the renal disease has not been determined. It may be an
unintentional toxin -- such as ochratoxin -- that has been incorporated
into the dog food. If anyone has authoritative information on the cause of
the renal failure, ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving that information.
