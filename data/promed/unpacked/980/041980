Kingston University [London, UK] students have been urged to attend
emergency immunisation clinics this week, after 20 suspected cases of
mumps were reported in the last month. Already, 5 students have been
diagnosed with the highly contagious virus, which causes swelling of
the neck and face, fever and earache, as well as deafness and severe
abdominal pain in more serious cases.

In males over 12, it can lead to inflammation of the testicles and --
in rare cases -- sterility. More cases at the university are
suspected, leading to fears of a repeat of the last scare there in
2005, when 548 vulnerable staff and students were given emergency vaccinations.

The university has already sent a warning email to all campus-goers
highlighting the risks of mumps and detailing how they can get
protected at campus drop-in clinics.

Dr Paul Crook, consultant in communicable disease control at the
South-west London Health Protection Unit, said: "We are working
closely with Kingston University to help prevent further cases of
mumps. We strongly recommend that students at the university who have
not been immunised with 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella
vaccine] take this opportunity to ensure they are adequately
protected from the virus."

Gill Deane, head of the university's health and counselling service,
said: "We take the health of our students and staff very seriously
and are confident that the steps we are taking working with the
health protection unit will minimise the impact of the illness on campus.

"About 140 vaccinations have now been given and we would urge any
students who have not been immunised to get in touch with their GP,
or attend one of the drop-in immunisation sessions."

[The majority of these cases are likely to be students who for
whatever reason were not vaccinated in childhood, or received only
one of the 2 doses of MMR vaccine necessary to provide complete immunity.
