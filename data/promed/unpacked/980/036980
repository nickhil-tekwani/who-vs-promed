Avian influenza tests complete On wild northern pintail ducks in Montana
-----------------------------------------------
The United States Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Interior (DOI)
today [8 Oct 2006] announced final test results, which confirm that a low
pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus was found in samples collected last
month from wild northern pintail ducks in Montana. This type of avian
influenza has been detected several times in wild birds in North America
and poses no risk to human health.
The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the
presence of low pathogenic H5N3 avian influenza through virus isolation in
2 of the 16 samples collected from wild pintails in Cascade County,
Montana. Initial screening results announced on 21 Sep 2006 indicated that
H5 and N1 subtypes might be present in the collected samples, but further
testing was necessary to confirm the H and N subtypes as well as pathogenicity.
The initial rapid screening tests are highly sensitive and can detect
active and inactive viruses in samples. Varieties of this test can screen
for the presence of all strains of avian influenza virus. Because these
rapid screening tests are highly sensitive, it is not uncommon to have
positive results for a specific subtype on the initial screen test and yet
not be able to isolate a virus of that subtype. This was the case for the
N1 subtype in this sample, which tested as a weak positive in the initial
screen test. During confirmatory testing, an N1 subtype was not isolated,
but instead an N3 was found. As previously announced, genetic testing ruled
out the possibility that the samples carried the highly pathogenic strain
of H5N1 avian influenza that is circulating overseas.
Low pathogenic strains of avian influenza occur naturally in wild birds and
typically cause only minor sickness or no noticeable signs of disease in
birds. In most cases, they cause no signs of infection or only minor
symptoms in birds. These strains are common in the US and around the world.
Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses are very different from the more
severe highly pathogenic H5N1 circulating in parts of Asia, Europe and
Africa. Highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza spread rapidly and are
often fatal to chickens and turkeys.
The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working collaboratively
with States and academic institutions to sample wild birds throughout the
US for the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza.

[This is a nice confirmation, which reaffirms that surveillance is working.
We are glad that this is the low pathogenic variety, and reassured by the
increased surveillance. - Mod.TG]
