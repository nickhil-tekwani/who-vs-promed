More _E. coli_ milkshake cases
------------------------------
The Calgary Health Region (CHR) is reporting another 2 cases of
_Escherichia coli_ infection. A total of 15 people have contracted the
bacterium after drinking marshmallow milkshakes at Peters' Drive-In. The
drinks were consumed during a 3-day period starting 23 Apr 2005.
Health officials say the incubation period for _E. coli_ is 10 days.
Because many people don't go to the doctor right away, the CHR says more
cases are possible.
A teenage girl remains in hospital in fair to serious condition after
drinking one of the shakes. The restaurant closed for a day to sanitize and
disinfect equipment.
The illness has been traced back to a Peters' employee who prepared the
marshmallow mix.

[This posting adds to the total number of reported cases and states that
the source was an employee [thanks to sharp-eyed readers Nelson Fok, of
Environmental Public Health, Capital Health, Edmonton, Alberta and Craig
Harris of Michigan State University for pointing out that that our earlier
posting also mentioned the employee. - Mod.SH]. Presumably, he or she was
infected and through inadequate hand washing contaminated the milkshake
material. Asymptomatic infection with _E. coli_ O157:H7 does occur but is
thought to be uncommon. - Mod.LL]
