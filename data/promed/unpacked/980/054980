According to health officials, 13 people in the area have gotten ill from _Escherichia coli_ [infection] connected to the Cleveland County Fair. Initial test results from local doctors' offices have labeled the cases as "probable", said Chris Dobbins, Gaston County health director. Samples have been sent to the state health department to confirm the initial results.

Gaston County residents make up 4 of the 13 cases. 8 have been identified in Cleveland County and 1 from Lincoln, all still with the commonality of the fair in Shelby that took place from 26 Sep to 7 Oct 2012. The ages of those infected range from 2 to 51.

The most serious case appears to be that of a 12 year old Gaston County boy who was admitted into Gaston Memorial Hospital 3 Oct 2012 and later transferred to Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte.

Initial reports had people speculating as to whether the outbreak came from fair food or touching animals in the 5 petting zoos. The state lab released information Thursday [11 Oct 2012] that zeroed in on a cause. All 13 cases are being investigated, and 2 have been confirmed as having an _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection. Such bacterium is found in the feces of animals such as cattle, sheep, and goats.

Finding that common thread hasn't been easy, according to Cleveland County health director Dorothea Wyant. Wyant said that it's clear the cases stemmed from the fair. But not all of the patients participated in the same activities. A common area could be the only common denominator necessary -- people failing to wash their hands, according to state health director Laura Gerald. If people touch contaminated material, food or animals, they can transfer the bacteria from their hands to their mouths or to others.

Most carriers don't show symptoms for a few days. It can take 10 days for symptoms to surface. Those symptoms can be as mild as diarrhea but can become life threatening. Most people get better within 5 to 7 days.

"In some cases in young children, this infection can lead to serious complications, so parents should not send sick children to day care or to school to avoid passing it on to others," Gerald said. None of the patients from Cleveland County had to be hospitalized. All of Gaston's cases were, though the 12 year old boy has endured the most serious illness.

Fair organizers got the proper inspections for the petting zoos, according to Wyant. Fair director Calvin Hastings told The Gazette in an earlier interview that patrons could use any of 9 hand washing stations, and signs were in place urging people to use them.
