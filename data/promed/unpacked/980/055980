[Wisconsin] State Department of Health Services officials say raw milk served at a potluck team meal likely caused an outbreak of illness among Durand (WI) High School football players and coaches in [September 2014]. The outbreak affected 38 members of the football team, managers and coaching staff who attended a team dinner on 18 Sep 2014. Testing performed at the State Lab of Hygiene and area labs and clinics confirmed that the illness was caused by _Campylobacter jejuni_.

As part of the investigation, state DHS officials interviewed all of the football team members and coaching staff to assess illnesses and ask questions about activities, foods, water sources, and possible causes of the illness. They discovered the consumption of raw milk was the only common factor among them that could cause the illness. The team meal and drinks were provided by a group of team parents, said Heidi Stewart, health officer at the Pepin County Health Department. Stewart said she could not confirm whether those who drank it knew they were drinking raw milk.

Raw milk and raw milk products can contain harmful bacteria, including campylobacter, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. From 1998 to 2011, 148 outbreaks due to consumption of raw milk or raw milk products reported to CDC resulted in 2384 illnesses, 284 hospitalizations, and 2 deaths.

Whether or not people can drink raw milk is up to state legislators, Stewart said. "The raw milk controversy is really an issue for our legislature to sort through and determine what is best for public health in general," Stewart said. "I think in this particular situation, it is very unfortunate that a large number of individuals did suffer a related illness with the consumption."

Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection staff collected cow manure specimens and State Lab of Hygiene test results show the bacterium that caused diarrheal illness among individuals who drank the unpasteurized milk was the same strain found on the farm that supplied the raw milk. Stewart said the name of the farm is not being released.

Durand school district superintendent Greg Doverspike said he's grateful students have recovered from the illness, which resulted in the delay of a football game. "As a district, we're just happy that the kids and everybody is feeling better," he said.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 per cent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 per cent) involved cheese (42 per cent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 per cent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, campylobacter was responsible for 54 per cent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 per cent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 per cent), _Brucella_ spp (4 per cent), listeria (4 per cent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 per cent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 per cent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

It is a violation of federal law enforced by the FDA to sell raw milk packaged for consumer use across state lines (interstate commerce). But each state regulates the sale of raw milk within the state (intrastate), and some states, such as Pennsylvania, allow it to be sold. This means that in some states, dairy operations may sell it to local retail food stores or to consumers directly from the farm or at agricultural fairs or other community events, depending on the state law.

In states that prohibit intrastate sales of raw milk, some people have tried to circumvent the law by "cow sharing" or "cow leasing". They pay a fee to a farmer to lease or purchase part of a cow in exchange for raw milk, claiming that they are not actually buying the milk since they are part owners of the cow. Wisconsin banned cow-leasing programs after 75 people became infected with _Campylobacter jejuni_ bacteria in 2001 from drinking unpasteurized milk obtained through such a program.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk .

Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
