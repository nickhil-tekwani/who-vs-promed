Dr Kenneth Banks, director of Environmental Services for City of Denton [Texas], responded on 6 Jun 2016, saying that he had received the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] information on 2 Jun 2016 and planned to brief his city council and publish a news release on 7 Jun 2016, at which time I could share these results.

The CDC results showed that the _Aedes trivittatus_ mosquito collected 3 May 2016 in Denton with the detected California serogroup viruses was confirmed to contain Trivittatus virus. According to CDC's ArboCat, "Trivittatus virus shares antigens with the other 12 registered members of the California serogroup. This group now contains 2 complexes including the California complex and the Guaroa complex. Trivittatus virus has been antigenically classified as a distinct virus type within the California complex."

The city also states in their news release that all trapping events since 3 May 2016 have tested negative for California serogroup viruses. They conclude that this finding is an isolated incident and likely related to wildlife disease [infections. The virus may not produce clinical disease in its wildlife reservoir hosts. - Mod.TY].

The City of Denton news release goes on to provide the following information for its population:
"All viruses in the CAL group are generally spread between wildlife and mosquitoes. Humans are not thought to be involved in the transmission cycle, as they do not circulate sufficient amounts of virus in the blood stream to infect a mosquito and the disease cannot be spread from person to person. Although it is possible for Trivittatus virus to be transmitted to humans via mosquitoes, symptomatic human diseases from this virus are extremely rare; so rare, in fact, that national or regional statistics do not appear to be available. Evidence for human cases is extremely sparse."

[The picture of this isolate is now complete. The species of the mosquito from which the virus was isolated was reported by Christie Hughes, in a previous post, and now she has passed along the identity of the virus. Fortunately, the identity of the virus is Trivittatus virus and not La Crosse virus, another California serogroup virus of public health importance in North America. - Mod.TY
