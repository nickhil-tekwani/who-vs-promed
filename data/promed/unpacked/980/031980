The Los Angeles County Public Health Department is investigating a possible cluster of syphilis [cases] among adult film industry performers, officials said on Friday afternoon [17 Aug 2012].

The department has received reports of at least 5 possible cases in the past week, said Peter Kerndt, director of the county's sexually transmitted disease programs. The county plans to follow up with the affected individuals to ensure that they have been properly treated and to determine who else may have been infected. Public health workers are also attempting to find out the original source of the recent cluster.

"Whenever there is a cluster like that it may be the tip of the iceberg," Kerndt said. "It is a concern. It is a serious health risk to workers in this industry." Kerndt added that it was "not a surprise that from time to time this would occur" in the industry. Between 2010 and 2011, there was an increase in syphilis cases throughout Los Angeles County, Kerndt said.

[The following has been extracted from moderator ML's comments in a recent ProMED-mail post Syphilis - Hungary: (Budapest) adult film industry, RFI 20120810.1238237:

In 2004, the CDC reported an outbreak of work-related human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the heterosexual segment of the adult film industry in Los Angeles, California (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5437a3.htm). At that time, a male performer who had tested HIV negative only 3 days earlier infected 3 of 14 female performers. This outbreak drew attention to the serious risk for sexually transmitted disease (STD) infections in this industry and the need for employing all available safeguards to reduce transmission of HIV and other STDs, such as syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B, chlamydial or trichomonal infection, or diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route.

This CDC report said that at that time there were an estimated 200 adult film production companies in Los Angeles County, employing approximately 6000 workers, of whom 1200 were workers who engaged in direct work-related sexual contact (Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation, unpublished data, 2005). California is the only state in the US where the filming of pornography is explicitly legal (http://www.forbes.com/2009/12/22/safe-sex-adult-film-industry-opinions-contributors-hart.html), and Los Angeles County is the largest center for adult film production worldwide (http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126).

The workers in the adult film industry have multiple sex partners during short periods with whom they engage in frequent and often prolonged sexual acts. The risk for HIV/STD transmission is great because the production companies in the heterosexual segment of this industry generally did not require condom use for any type of sexual act. In addition to actors, employees in this industry at risk of becoming infected include people who clean up after scenes and people who assist in developing scenes, whether or not they are shown on film. If any sharps, such as razor blades or wires, are used (for shaving, piercing, etc.), they pose a particular risk for spreading infection because they can puncture the skin.

The CDC report says many producers and workers in the heterosexual segment of the adult film industry were to participate in a voluntary program of periodic HIV and STD testing, with results shared among workers and producers. However, screening alone is not adequate to prevent transmission of HIV or other STDs because infected persons can transmit these diseases for a period before their infection can be diagnosed. In addition, the cost of health services was borne by the workers themselves, which could cause some workers to reduce HIV and STD screening or avoid or delay pursuing vaccination for hepatitis B virus (HBV).

In this report, the CDC says that during June 2000-December 2001, before voluntary monthly STD screening was instituted, prevalences of chlamydial infection and gonorrhea among heterosexual adult film industry workers in California were 5.5 per cent for males and 7.7 per cent for females for chlamydial infection and 2.0 per cent for both males and females for gonorrhea (Kodagoda D, et al: STD screening of actors in the adult film industry: alternative testing opportunities to detect and treat STDs. Poster no. P140. Presented at the National STD Prevention Conference, San Diego, CA; 2002.). By comparison, an analysis of a nationally representative sample of young adults aged 18-26 years during April 2001-May 2002 revealed the prevalence of chlamydial infection among males and females to be 3.7 per cent and 4.7 per cent, respectively, and, similarly, the prevalence of gonorrhea to be 0.4 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively (Miller WC, Ford CA, Morris M, et al: Prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections among young adults in the United States. JAMA 2004; 18: 2229-36).

The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health requires employers, including the adult film industry, to provide a safe and healthful workplace for employees, and pay the costs of their health and safety program (California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health. Notice to employees and employers in the adult film industry. 2004. Available at http://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/AdultFilmIndustry.html). Protections include measures such as simulation and use of condoms and other barriers where needed to prevent exposure. Other provisions include employee training and vaccination for hepatitis B virus. However, enforcement of the workplace standards is now the issue (http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126#pmed-0040126-b021).

The current news report above fails to indicate what policies or procedures, if any, are currently in place or enforced in the Los Angeles adult film industry to provide a safe and healthful workplace for their employees. Also, we are not informed if screening of employees for HIV infection or STDs other than syphilis was done, or if screening of the sex partners of the employees has taken place in view of the syphilis outbreak.
