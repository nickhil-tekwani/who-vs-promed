The General Direction for Cattle Raising (DIGEGA, according to its Spanish initials), through its Avian Disease Division, detected an outbreak of mildly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 subtype in a farm in Espaillat province, which is currently under control. The internationally established protocols are being used [This would be low pathogenicity influenza H5N2. - Mod.TG].

Dr. Bolivar Toribio, General Manager for Cattle Raising, reported the virus outbreak is under control. A team including personnel from the Avian Disease Division, the Epidemiology Division, and the Northern Regional area of DIGEGA is maintaining the outbreak under control. He also said the affected farm is on quarantine, with continuous epidemiological surveillance.

"The professional personnel in charge for controlling and eradicating the outbreak is very well trained, and since the very 1st report on 9 Oct 2017, all necessary actions have been taken, according to the recommended protocols for such sanitary situations," he emphasized.

Amongst the measures taken for eradicating the outbreak, birds and their eggs will be eliminated. Also, surveillance and monitoring actions have been implemented in a 5-km area around the center of the outbreak, including epidemiological surveillance and maintaining the quarantine.

With respect to the risk for transmission to humans, a spokesperson from DIGEGA said that the avian influenza H5N2 virus does not represent any danger. "It is important to clarify that the mildly pathogenic H5N2 virus is not transmitted to humans because of eating poultry", said Dr. Lissette Gomez, Animal Sanitation Manager in DIGEGA.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) received a technical report from health authorities of the Dominican Republic, after the outbreak was confirmed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory (LAVECEN) and the National Veterinary Services Laboratories from the USA, which is the OIE reference laboratory for the Dominican Republic. Currently, nearly 70 countries have reported the presence of avian influenza in poultry.

["AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock.

"Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness" (https://goo.gl/nzis8z).

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"A facility having been diagnosed with this virus needs a thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Proper and thorough cleaning and disinfecting starts with removal of organic material such as litter and bedding. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents." - Mods.TG/CRD
