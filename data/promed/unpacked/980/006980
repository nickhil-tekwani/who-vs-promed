[On 4 Feb 2017, Israel reported an outbreak of FMD serotype O in HaDarom District. The event was declared resolved on 7 Mar 2017. The event summary and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22775. - Mod.CRD

Aramsha (Arab el-Aramshe) is a Bedouin village in the western Galilee, situated just 1 km (0.62 mi) from the Lebanese border (map at http://tinyurl.com/l32y7q3). The local-breed, grazing beef type cattle is mostly kept outdoors. This village has been exposed to introduced infectious diseases from adjacent Lebanon several times in the past, including a rinderpest event in 1983.

It will be interesting to note the vaccination history of the affected cattle and their age distribution. Serotyping is anticipated urgently. - Mod.AS]
