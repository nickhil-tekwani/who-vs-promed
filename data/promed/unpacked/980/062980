A man in Baldwin County, Georgia has died following a Lone Star tick bite that infected him with the Heartland Virus, Georgia Outdoor News reports. Officials have not identified the man, but they did confirm that the tick-borne virus is relatively new to the state.

The only ticks known to carry the virus are Lone Star ticks, which are native to the eastern U.S. and are faster and more aggressive than other tick species. They can be found in wooded areas and along the edges of meadows and streams during the springtime through early fall, but they are especially active from mid-March through late June.

In order to gauge the risk that these ticks pose to humans, researchers at Emory University and the University of Georgia sampled nearly 10 000 Lone Star ticks from the central part of the state last summer [2021]. They found that roughly one in 2000 ticks carried the Heartland Virus.

This relatively low incidence [prevalence] rate is cold comfort for hunters, hikers, campers, anglers, and others, however, as the CDC says there are currently no vaccines or medications available to treat the virus. And while infections do not always prove deadly, Emory University Associate Professor Gonzalo Vazquez-Prokopec told GON that "for those individuals with some health conditions, [the virus] can be lethal."

Symptoms of Heartland Virus include fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and muscle or joint pain, according to the CDC. Tracing the source of the virus can be difficult because it can take up to 2 weeks for symptoms to appear after an infected tick bite. Lone Star ticks are also known to carry alpha-gal disease which can make its victims allergic to mammal meat (like beef, pork, and venison).

[Heartland virus had been detected previously in Lone Star ticks (_Amblyomma americanum_) in Georgia (see reference below). The above report is the 1st one reporting a human case in that state, this time, unfortunately, a fatal one. The report does not provide the date of the man's death nor if there was a history of a recognized tick bite.

Heartland virus is more widely disseminated than in the states where human cases have been documented. There is evidence of its presence in wildlife in a broader area. As noted previously, a variety of wild mammals may serve as hosts of the virus. A team at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found signs that the Heartland virus is circulating in deer, raccoons, coyotes, and moose in 13 states, from Texas to North Carolina and Florida to Maine. In that study, the serum of 1428 animals was tested, and 103 animals were seropositive, including 55 deer, 33 raccoons, 11 coyotes, and 4 moose (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2110.150380). Another study found antibodies against virus nucleoproteins in 10-18% of samples from cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk in 24 Minnesota counties. These studies do not prove that these species are capable of infecting ticks, but it does indicate that there was enough virus replication to elicit an antibody response.
