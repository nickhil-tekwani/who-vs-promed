A ferret survey is being undertaken in the Mt Cargill area, near Dunedin, after last year's [2015] bovine Tb outbreak.

Four herds of cattle and deer were identified as infected with Tb. In a recent update, TB free southern South Island programme manager Brent Rohloff said work had been progressing well.

OSPRI [Operational Solutions for Primary Industries] was using a combination of herd Tb testing, controls on animal movement for infected herds, and survey and control of wild animals to eradicate Tb from the area.

As Tb had been found in 6 possums and one ferret, further surveillance work was needed to determine the extent of the infection in local wildlife.

The ferret survey, undertaken by a TB free contractor, was expected to be finished by the end of this month [May 2016].

Ferrets scavenged Tb-infected possums and could become infected with the disease, which made them "extremely important'' indicators of whether Tb was present in an area. Trapping was being used for the survey, and carcasses would be sent for postmortem examination.

Further possum control and surveys would be done during this year and next year [2016-17].

The infected herds were subject to an ongoing intensive Tb testing programme until they were free of the disease.

[The situation with possums in New Zealand is similar to the situation with badgers in the UK. These animals are resident reservoirs of TB.

As New Zealand seeks to control the TB population, looking at the prevalence and spread through other susceptible populations may be a good approach to understanding how far the disease has spread in certain areas. It may provide a tool to predict which farms of bovines may soon be seen suffering from the disease.

Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a slow, insidious disease that can have a nasty grip on a herd before it is ever located.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacterial aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present.

Although the disease (TB) is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is likely to be small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. Practically speaking, the producer and family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in a process that the bacteria will not survive.

Also, most places have a meat inspection process to prevent diseased or suspect diseased animals from entering the human food chain.

Using possums and ferrets to understand disease dissemination seems reasonable, but the deer component seems a more complicated factor. - Mod.TG
