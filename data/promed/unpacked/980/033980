An Indonesian woman from the popular tourist resort of Bali has died
of bird flu, a health ministry official said on Wednesday [22 Aug
2007], the 2nd confirmed death from the H5N1 virus on the island.
Joko Suyono of the Ministry's bird flu centre in Jakarta said the
woman, who died on Tuesday [21 Aug 2007] in a hospital in Bali's
capital Denpasar, tested positive for H5N1 after a 2nd test.
The woman, a 28-year-old poultry trader, had suffered from high fever
and breathing problems before being hospitalized near her village of
Tanah Lot on Saturday [18 Aug 2007]. Tanah Lot, on the southwestern
part of Bali, is popular with tourists for its postcard sunset view
and a temple that sits on an outcropping of rock in the ocean.
A 29-year-old Indonesian woman from west Bali died more than a week
ago of bird flu, the 1st confirmed death in the resort, the centre of
Indonesia's tourism industry. Bali, a predominantly Hindu island in
mostly Muslim Indonesia, is starting to recover after suicide bombers
killed 20 people in October 2005. The attacks came after more than
200 died in night club bombings in late 2002. The island regularly
hosts large international conventions and is due to hold an important
U.N. climate change conference in December 2007, which about 10 000
people are expected to attend.
Authorities have culled thousands of chickens and put in place a
transport ban on moving fowl since tests confirmed the 1st human
death on the island last week. Contact with sick fowl is the most
common way for humans to contract the disease.
Indonesia has had 105 confirmed human cases from bird flu, out of
which 84 have been fatal, the highest for any country in the world.
Excluding the latest death, there have been 321 cases and 194 deaths
globally, World Health Organization data shows.
