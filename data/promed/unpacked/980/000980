Egyptian girl has bird flu, 2nd case this season
------------------------------------------------
An Egyptian girl of 21 months has contracted bird flu [avian A/H5N1
influenza virus] and is in hospital in a stable condition, a health
ministry official said on Monday [12 Jan 2009].

She is the 52nd human case of bird flu in Egypt and the 2nd of this winter
[2008/2009] season. The girl showed the 1st symptoms on Friday [9 Jan 2009]
and was admitted to a specialist hospital on Saturday [10 Jan 2009], said
assistant health minister Nasr el-Sayed, quoted by the state news agency MENA.

The other Egyptian to contract the deadly virus this year [2008], a woman
near the southern town of Assiut, died on 15 Dec 2008. From the 52 human
cases in Egypt over almost 3 years, 23 have died, but the number of cases
seems to be diminishing.

The girl, from the village of Kerdasa on the western edge of Cairo [in the
6th October Governorate], had been in contact with infected birds and
showed the usual 1st symptoms -- a high temperature, vomiting, and
diarrhea, Sayed said. She is receiving the antiviral drug Tamiflu
[oseltamivir], which has proven effective against bird flu if treatment
starts early.

Since the 1st case in 2003 there have been 248 human deaths globally from
the H5N1 strain of bird flu and at least 394 confirmed cases of infection.
Egypt has had more cases than any country outside Asia.

A 21 month old girl has bird flu in Egypt
-----------------------------------------
Dr Al-Nasr, assistant secretary of the health ministry for population
affairs, preventive medicine, and primary care stated that a 21 month old
girl [from 6th October governorate] became ill on Fri 10 Jan 2009 and was
admitted to hospital on Saturday. Her symptoms included high temperature,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Dr Nasr said that the patient received Tamiflu
[oseltamivir] treatment once she was diagnosed as a probable case of bird
flu. She remains in a stable condition.

Adly Hussein, governor of [neighbouring Al Qalyubiyah governorate] has
decided to stop the operation of 71 poultry farms in the province for a
period of 6 months and their owners are to be fined due to lack of
implementation of decisions to prevent the smuggling of poultry and to
allow the inspection teams to follow up preventive measures to control bird
flu.

[None of these 3 reports states that the diagnosis of avian influenza has
been confirmed by laboratory testing. That is necessary to confirm that
this is indeed the 52nd human case.
