2 Missouri veterans are infected with hepatitis B, 2 are hepatitis C positive
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Veteran's Administration (VA) today released the latest results
of tests taken by dental patients at the John Cochran VA Hospital in
St. Louis, Missouri. As of Wed 28 Jul 2010, the VA confirms 2
positive results for hepatitis B and 2 positive results for hepatitis
C. The data [were] presented at a Congressional hearing this morning.

Late last month, the VA reported 1812 patients may have been exposed
to hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infections due to improper sterilization methods at its Cochran
Dental Clinic. An inspection revealed the procedure was in place for
a little over a year at the facility.

The VA said it notified 1769 veterans about the issue, and is working
with homeless coordinators to reach veterans with no known home
address. The VA said 1598 responded to the disclosure by calling for
an appointment for testing. Some veterans opted to have their blood
drawn by a private lab of their choosing at the VA's expense. The VA
reported 13 veterans declined testing or an appointment.

The infections may or may not be related to dental equipment issues
at the Cochran clinic. The VA said it is performing more extensive
testing to determine the time period and possible source of the
infections. The VA said it will provide all related health care at no
cost to the infected veterans.

[Nosocomial transmission of blood-borne infections, particularly
those involving dental procedures, are rare in the United States. It
is not clear from this report that the transmission of infection has
been due to medial negligence, or to some other factor. Further
information would be welcomed.
