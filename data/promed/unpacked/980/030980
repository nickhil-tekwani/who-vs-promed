The Centre for Health Protection has identified a case of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae in a 76-year-old man with underlying illness. He lives in Foshan on the Mainland [China]. He fell ill on 23 Jul 2012 and was admitted to a hospital in Foshan.

He was transferred to Hong Kong and admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital on 4 Aug 2012, and then moved to United Christian Hospital on 10 Sep 2012. He is now stable. He tested positive for NDM-1 carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae.

This is the 12th case of NDM-1 carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae detected in Hong Kong.

[Originating in India, NDM-1 containing bacteria have spread to other parts of the world. As reported in the 25 Jun 2010 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010;59:750), during the 1st half of 2010, 3 isolates of _Enterobacteriaceae_, an _E. coli_, a _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and an _Enterobacter cloacae_, were identified at CDC to carry NDM-1, which confers resistance to all beta-lactams except aztreonam (a monobactam) and were also resistant to aztreonam. All 3 isolates were from patients who received recent medical care in India.

Yong and colleagues (Yong D, Toleman MA, Giske CG, et al.: Characterization of a new metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla-NCm-1, and novel erythromycin esterase gene carried on a unique genetic structure in _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ sequence type 14 from India. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009;53: 5046-54) found that the plasmid carrying NDM-1 also carries several other resistance genes and appears to easily transmit itself to other organisms. The authors state that "the dissemination of this plasmid among clinical bacteria would be a nightmare scenario."

This NDM-1 gene cassette of wide-spectrum antimicrobial resistance appears to have developed in the Indian subcontinent, where the use of antimicrobial agents is quite poorly controlled. Organisms carrying this resistance combination have already been introduced into western Europe, the USA and Canada. The best methods of control are rapid recognition by standard microbiologic/nucleic acid methodology in patients having the appropriate medical/travel history and aggressive hand washing techniques.

The amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA will no doubt serve as an efficient multiplier of these isolates, just as intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly related to the lack of control of antimicrobial usage in intensive care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER physicians who often react with a lack of wisdom and "cookbook" protocols instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, the physicians do not even see the products of their unwise labors.

Of note, an on-line published paper which is in press currently (Hranjec T, Rosenberger LH, Swenson B, et l: Aggressive versus conservative initiation of antimicrobial treatment in critically ill surgical patients with suspected intensive-care-unit-acquired infection: a quasi-experimental, before and after observational cohort study. Lancet Infect Dis http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(12)70208-6) suggests that aggressive empiric therapy may not be preferred. Despite the difficulties in design of such studies, the authors found that the odds ratio for the risk of mortality in the aggressive therapy group compared to the conservative therapy group was 2.5.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures, not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is recognized -- that is, using these agents only when rational, in combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and meaningful improvement in a patient's life -- the medical community will continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic options will exist. - Mod.LL
