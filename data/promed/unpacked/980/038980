["The World Health Organization will convene an emergency committee on Thursday next week (23 Jun 2022) to assess whether the monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern. That is the highest level of warning issued by the UN agency, which currently applies only to the COVID-19 pandemic and polio.

"There have been 1600 confirmed and 1500 suspected cases of monkeypox this year (2022) and 72 deaths, WHO said, in 39 countries, including those where the virus usually spreads.
(https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-set-decide-if-monkeypox-represents-health-emergency-2022-06-14/)

In a 14 Jun 2022 ECDC/WHO joint technical report (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/ecdc-and-who-publish-joint-technical-report-navigating-monkeypox-during-summer-season) they state, "as monkeypox cases rise, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have today published a technical report to provide advice for health authorities and event organisers for the upcoming summer.

"With more than 700 monkeypox cases identified across Europe, and many public events attracting large numbers of citizens from across the continent, the report Joint ECDC-WHO considerations for public health authorities: navigating monkeypox during the Summer Season shows how public health authorities can focus on prevention messaging to promote good public health practices rather than closing venues.

"Risk communication and community engagement are key in this outbreak response and enable public health authorities to ensure at-risk or affected communities can make informed decisions in order to protect their health. After-event communication should focus on the need of those potentially infected to contact health and social care providers should any symptoms arise subsequently.

"ECDC Director Andrea Ammon said:
"Now that summer season has arrived and people across Europe are travelling more and enjoying themselves, they should remember to take appropriate steps to protect their health. We have published this guidance for national health authorities to engage with event organisers and community groups, to ensure people are aware of the risks and symptoms of monkeypox. If you have rashes, ulcers, or blisters anywhere on your body, or fever, headache, and muscle aches, we strongly advise you to speak to your health care provider and get examined for monkeypox. Until you have sought the advice of a health provider and know that you are well, we urge you to take a break from visiting gatherings, venues, or events and avoid close contacts."

"The guidance suggests that communication around events should focus on prevention messaging and good public health practices. Organisers of events should adapt and share key messages on their websites, social media accounts, and event applications in order to raise awareness of potential risks, along with the promotion of good hygiene practices, and ensure facilities are cleaned regularly.

"ECDC has also published Navigating monkeypox: considerations for gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/navigating-monkeypox-considerations-gay-and-bisexual-men-and-msm) which has been produced in collaboration with community organisations. Although this information addresses the group that has been most affected by the current outbreak to date -- gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men -- it applies to anyone who may be exposed to monkeypox infection."

[3] Mexico (Jalisco): suspected

https://worldakkam.com/two-more-suspicious-cases-of-monkeypox-reported-in-puerto-vallarta/775516/


The Jalisco State Health Office (SSJ) announced on Saturday [11 Jun 2022] that 2 cases of suspected monkeypox were reported in the state.

These 2 cases occurred in Puerto Vallarta, and authorities have installed modules to inform and assist people with symptoms.

The 1st case of the virus was detected in a foreign male from the United States on 7 Jun 2022. After traveling to Germany, he went to his home in Texas and on 27 May 2022 to Puerto Vallarta [Jalisco, Mexico], where he went to various gay pride celebrations. Among them, a party at Mantamar Beach Club.

The suspected case reported today [11 Jun 2022] is a 40-year-old man from Toronto, Canada, who lives in Puerto Vallarta. He was at the beach club from 17 May to 4 Jun 2022.

By 7 Jun [2022], he began to show symptoms of papules and itching. It started in the head, the back of the chest, and the lower extremities. With this in mind, he was instructed to remain isolated for 21 days.

The 2nd case is a 23-year-old woman who is a resident of Zapopan and has interacted with foreigners. She began with symptoms similar to the 1st case on 31 May 2022, in addition to fever, myalgia, and joint pain.

In both cases, samples were taken and the results are still pending at the Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference Institute (InDRE).

The 1st case in Jalisco, considered zero patient, was a man in Dallas, Texas, whose symptoms began on 30 May [2022]. He has coughs, chills, myalgia, and pustular lesions on the face, neck, and trunk. After going to a hospital in Puerto Vallarta for advice, he was asked to undergo a test to check and isolate monkeypox, he refused and fled the hospital.

After a positive case of monkeypox was confirmed by Texas health authorities and the United States notified Jalisco authorities, the Ministry of Health called people who attended the Mantamar Beach Club party where the 1st case attended. From 27 May to 4 Jun 2022, the same days that human-to-others transmission can occur.

For this reason, SSJ has stepped up measures for disease detection and timely care in corporate health units.

https://cultmtl.com/2022/06/the-monkeypox-outbreak-in-montreal-is-being-linked-to-a-super-spreader-event-in-april/


There are currently 126 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the greater Montreal area, and a total of 132 in the province of Quebec.

In a press conference yesterday [14 Jun 2022], Montreal public health director Dr Mylène Drouin and Quebec interim public health director Dr Luc Boileau confirmed that all the monkeypox cases in Montreal are in men aged 20 to 63, most of them men who had sex with other men. The outbreak has been traced back to a super-spreader event in late April [2022] where there were a number of anonymous contacts, which has made the outbreak difficult to trace.

While the vast majority of cases have not been severe, 3 men were briefly hospitalized. Over 3000 doses of the smallpox vaccine -- which is effective against monkeypox -- have been administered to those close to the infected. The city has 25 000 doses ready for the target population. Even among those who've contracted monkeypox, getting the vaccine within 4 to 14 days of infection can reduce the severity of the virus [infection].

The primary symptoms of monkeypox are painful lesions around the mouth and genitals, which may be preceded or accompanied by fever, night sweats, joint or muscle pain, swollen glands, and headaches.

Montreal public health officials first addressed the emergence of monkeypox in the city in a press conference on 19 May 2022. The 1st case of monkeypox in Montreal was reported on 12 May 2022, with symptoms 1st appearing on 29 Apr 2022, and is connected to a case in the US. Monkeypox is not an STD [sexually transmitted disease] but is typically spread among sexual partners and people who live together. There had previously been cases in the UK, Spain, and Portugal, and cases have also emerged in the US.

Drouin said last month [May 2022] that the monkeypox virus is spread by close personal contact and droplets, but is not airborne, so while steps are being taken to stop the spread, there is no need for panic. It is extremely unlikely that there would be the kind of community spread in public places that occurs with COVID-19, she said.

Reporting the virus is not mandatory, but Drouin suggested consulting a doctor if symptoms appear. Isolation at home was initially said to not be necessary but is now recommended, as is wearing a mask and covering lesions to prevent transmission. While the literature on the virus suggests monitoring symptoms for 21 days, the majority of cases in Montreal have not lasted nearly that long.

Venezuela has detected its 1st case of monkeypox in a traveler coming from Spain as stated this Sunday [12 Jun 2022] by the Ministry of Health in an announcement.

"By means of an epidemiological fence, the 1st suspected case of monkeypox was detected in the Simon Bolivar International Airport in Maiquetia (24 km [15 mi] from Caracas)" the document stated.

"The patient, who arrived in the country from Madrid, Spain, had contact with 2 infected individuals in Barcelona in that European city. He was immediately isolated, relevant examinations were done, samples taken with positive results, and he is in stable health condition", was added.

The Health Ministry did not provide details about the infected person.

The state of Minas Gerais is investigating a 2nd suspected case of monkeypox. The case was registered in Ituiutaba. The 1st suspected case in Minas is being investigated in Uberlândia.

According to the Minas Gerais State Health Department (SES-MG), the agency received, in the early evening of Monday (13 Jun 2022), the notification of this suspected case of the disease verified in Ituiutaba. The secretariat was informed by the Pontal City Hall this Sunday (12 Jun 2022]).

The state has not yet released details about the suspected case in Ituiutaba. There is currently no information about the patient's age and occupation. But it has already been reported by the Ituiutaba City Hall that it is a man, who presented some of the symptoms of the disease and sought care last Sunday (12 Jun 2022).

The Municipal Health Department said that the patient is in good health and is in isolation at home, being monitored by the Department of Health Surveillance.

The 1st suspected case of monkeypox in Minas, registered in Uberlândia and which is being investigated by SES-MG, was a patient who was hospitalized at the Uberlândia Medical Center (UMC) hospital and who died in the last week.

The patient was a 41-year-old criminal police officer who lived in Araguari and worked in Uberlândia. According to the Center for Strategic Information on Health Surveillance (CIEVS-Minas), suspected cases of the disease reported in Uberlândia and Ituiutaba have no history of displacement or travel abroad.

It was also informed that, in both cases, among the close contacts of both -- who are being monitored --, there is still no symptomatic case of the disease.

The SES-MG advised that samples from the patients of the 2 suspected cases verified in the state were to be collected for analysis by the Ezequiel Dias Foundation (Funed). The samples were collected and sent to the Foundation.

The 1st case of monkeypox in the country was confirmed last Thursday (9 Jun 2022). He is a 41-year-old resident of São Paulo (capital), who recently traveled to Spain. He is hospitalized at the Instituto de Infectologia Emílio Ribas, in good clinical condition.

This Saturday (11 Jun 2022), the São Paulo State Department of Health confirmed the 2nd case of monkeypox in Brazil. This is a 29-year-old man who traveled to Europe in recent weeks and is isolated at his home in Vinhedo, in the interior of São Paulo.

A 3rd case of the disease was also confirmed this weekend [11-12 Jun 2022]. This is a patient in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

[The Uberlândia case is reported to have died. The report does not state explicitly that the death was due to monkeypox (MPX) virus infection or if there were any underlying medical conditions or secondary infections. If this is a death from MPX virus infection, it is the 1st report of an MPX death in non-endemic countries that ProMED has received.

The West African MPX virus clade, the clade that is circulating in this outbreak, has a 1% case fatality rate reported in Africa but obviously is much lower among the hundreds of cases occurring outside of Africa currently. - Mod.TY]

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 52 additional cases of monkeypox in England, one additional case in Scotland, and one in Wales. This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 524, as of 14 Jun 2022.

There are currently 504 confirmed cases in England, 13 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland, and 5 in Wales.

Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently, most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with men.

Contact a sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters and you've been either:
- in close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they've not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks.
- to West or Central Africa in the past 3 weeks.

In the Netherlands, 60 have tested positive for the monkeypox virus in recent weeks, according to the latest tally on Thursday [9 Jun 2022]. The week before, the count stood at 40 cases. All known patients so far are men who have sex with other men, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said on Thursday [9 Jun 2022].

Some of the infections can be traced back to an outbreak at the Belgian fetish festival Darklands. However, health authorities emphasize that anyone can get monkeypox after close contact with someone who is infected.

The virus, which originated in Africa, has been making rounds in mainly European countries for several weeks now. On 20 May 2022, it was reported for the 1st time that someone in the Netherlands had contracted the disease.

People can contract the virus through close skin contact with someone who carries it. In addition to characteristic bumps on the skin, patients may experience fever, headache, back pain, and swollen lymph nodes. The course of the disease is usually quite mild, but with complications, the condition can be fatal.

ref: Noe S, Zange S, Seilmaier M, et al. Clinical and virological features of first human monkeypox cases in Germany [preprint, not peer reviewed by a journal]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In May 2022, human monkeypox infections including human-to-human transmission were reported in a multi-country outbreak in Europe and North America. With the 1st 2 German cases, we are providing clinical and virological findings, including the detection of monkeypox virus DNA in blood and semen. It is important to raise awareness among health professionals of the rapid and correct identification and diagnosis of this disease, which is probably still under-reported in Europe.

We describe the 1st 2 cases of monkeypox (MPX) infections in Germany to highlight the importance of recent developments for health professionals worldwide and to share further observations related to human-to-human transmission in these cases. MPX is an orthopoxvirus infection that, with the exception of a few imported cases in the past, was previously thought to be endemic only in West and Central African countries. Beginning in 2018, the United Kingdom (UK) Health Security Agency has reported several imported cases associated with travellers from these countries. One case reported on 7 May 2022, had a travel history to Nigeria. However, the 2 other cases within a family reported on 13 May 2022, neither had a travel history nor an epidemiological link to the previous case. On 17 May 2022, 4 additional UK cases were reported involving individuals who described themselves as belonging to the group of men who have sex with men (MSM). Subsequent testing for monkeypox virus (MPXV) in symptomatic MSM patients reporting to sexual health and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics in the UK and elsewhere revealed an increasing number of confirmed MPX cases in Europe.

[Finding monkeypox virus DNA in semen raises the question if infectious virus is present. If it is, it raises the possibility of transmission during sexual intercourse. Interestingly, a 15 Jun 2022 report in Reuters states that "in recent days, scientists say they have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany, including a lab-tested sample that suggested the virus found in the semen of a single patient was capable of infecting another person and replicating.

"The World Health Organisation is looking into reports that the monkeypox virus is present in the semen of patients, exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted, a WHO official said on Wednesday [15 Jun 2022].

[11] WHO: vaccine and vaccination guidance
Date Tue 14 Jun 2022
Source: WHO publication [edited]
https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-mpx-immunization-2022.1


Vaccines and immunization for monkeypox: Interim guidance, 14 Jun 2022
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the global outbreak response for monkeypox is to control the outbreak and to effectively use public health measures to prevent onward spread of the disease. Judicious use of vaccines can support this response. This interim guidance provides the 1st WHO recommendations on use of vaccines for monkeypox. They will be updated as information becomes available.

General
- Monkeypox is an infectious disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). This double-stranded DNA virus is a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus in the Poxviridae family, related to the virus which caused smallpox (eradicated in 1980).
- Control of monkeypox outbreaks primarily relies on public health measures including surveillance, contact-tracing, isolation, and care of patients. While smallpox vaccines are expected to provide some protection against monkeypox, clinical data are limited.
- Most interim vaccination recommendations provided here concern off-label use.

Vaccines
- Some countries have maintained strategic supplies of older smallpox vaccines from the Smallpox Eradication Programme (SEP) which concluded in 1980. These 1st-generation vaccines held in national reserves are not recommended for monkeypox at this time, as they do not meet current safety and manufacturing standards.
- Many years of research have led to development of new and safer (2nd- and 3rd-generation) vaccines for smallpox, some of which may be useful for monkeypox and one of which (MVA-BN) has been approved for prevention of monkeypox.
- The supply of newer vaccines is limited and access strategies are under discussion.

Summary of interim recommendations
- Based on currently assessed risks and benefits and regardless of vaccine supply, mass vaccination is not required nor recommended for monkeypox at this time.
- Human-to-human spread of monkeypox can be controlled by public health measures including early case-finding, diagnosis, and care, isolation, and contact tracing.
- All decisions around immunization with smallpox or monkeypox vaccines should be by shared clinical decision-making, based on a joint assessment of risks and benefits, between a health care provider and prospective vaccinee, on a case-by-case basis.
- Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): For contacts of cases, PEP is recommended with an appropriate 2nd- or 3rd-generation vaccine, ideally within 4 days of 1st exposure (and up to 14 days in the absence of symptoms), to prevent onset of disease.
- Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): PrEP is recommended for health workers at high risk of exposure, laboratory personnel working with orthopoxviruses, clinical laboratory personnel performing diagnostic testing for monkeypox, and outbreak response team members as may be designated by national public health authorities.

[A 14 Jun 2022 report states that the European Union has said it "has purchased almost 110 000 vaccine doses to help tackle the monkeypox outbreak and would share them out among the bloc's members. The jabs, made by Danish firm Bavarian Nordic, are currently authorised for use in the EU against smallpox, but officials say they will also work against the monkeypox virus."
