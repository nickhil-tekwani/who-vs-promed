Cholera in the Americas -- situation summary
--------------------------------------------
Cuba
----
The last confirmed case of cholera in Cuba was notified by the Canada International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point in January 2015. The case was an individual with history of travel to Cuba.

Dominican Republic
------------------
In the Dominican Republic, 597 suspected cholera cases were registered in 2014, including 10 deaths. In comparison with 2013, this represents a 69.5 per cent reduction in the number of cases and 76 per cent reduction in the number of deaths.

Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 5 [3 Jan-6 Feb] of 2015, there were 99 suspected cholera cases registered, including 6 deaths. This represents an increase of more than double the cases observed for the same period of 2014. The largest proportion of cases in 2015, were registered in the National District, Pedernales, Santiago, and Santo Domingo.

Since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) to EW 5 [6 Feb] of 2015, there were 32 171 suspected cholera cases, including 484 deaths, registered in the Dominican Republic.

Haiti
-----
In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) through 21 Feb 2015 (EW 7 of 2015), there were 731 880 cholera cases, including 416 757 hospitalizations, with a 57 per cent cumulative hospitalization rate and 8741 related deaths recorded. The national cumulative fatality rate remains 1.2 per cent.

From EW 1 to EW 7 of 2015 [3 Jan-20 Feb 2015], there were 7225 cholera cases, including 5794 hospitalizations, with a hospitalization rate of 80 per cent, and 86 deaths. The number of cases and deaths registered in 2015 are higher than those recorded in the same period of 2014 and of 2012.

Mexico
------
In Mexico, in 2014, there were 14 cholera cases registered in 2 states: Hidalgo (13) and Queretaro (1). Since the start of 2015, there were no new cholera cases registered.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that [it was found that] cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
