Iran's health ministry on Sunday [8 Mar 2020] reported 49 new deaths from the COVID-19 disease, the highest toll within 24 hours since the start of the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] outbreak in the country. "At least 194 of our compatriots who fell sick with the COVID-19 illness have passed away," Iranian health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference.

The outbreak of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 in Iran is one of the deadliest outside of China, where the virus originated late last year [2019]. Jahanpour added that 743 new infections were also confirmed within the past 24 hours, bringing the number of cases to 6566 spread across all of Iran's 31 provinces.

With 1805 infections, the capital Tehran remains part of the province with the most cases, the spokesman added.

Braced for a somber Nowruz [Iranian New Year]
---------------------------------------------
Reporting from Tehran, FRANCE 24's Reza Sayah said Iranians have been coping as best they can as the country faces yet another crisis. "The overwhelming majority of people we're seeing here in Iran are dealing with this outbreak in a civil and cooperative way. Sure they're concerned, but they're helping one and another, they're taking precautionary measures, they're not going out to social gatherings, they're doing the best they can in a civil manner," said Sayah.

Iran has imposed travel restrictions on 15 provinces, said Sayah. Schools and universities have been closed until the end of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, celebrations in early April [2020]. "In less than 2 weeks, it's Nowruz, perhaps the biggest and most popular national holiday when Iranians get together and socialise with family and friends," said Sayaf. "That's not going to happen the way it usually does, and that's another hit to this country that has seen many crises over the past couple of years."

Outside Tehran, the situation in the provinces continued to deteriorate, with Jahanpour saying 685 cases were detected in and around Qom, the holy Shiite city south of Tehran where the country's 1st cases were reported. He said the number of cases was also "rising quickly" in Isfahan, a popular tourist destination, where there were now 564 people sick with the virus.

Iran Air suspends flights to Europe
-----------------------------------
Iran Air announced on Sunday [8 Mar 2020] the suspension of all its flights to Europe until further notice. According to several specialised sites, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banned on [3 Feb 2020] Iran Air aircraft from European airspace, namely an Airbus A321-200 and 2 Airbus A330-200 that had not undergone necessary upgrades for authorisation to fly in Europe. Sweden on [2 Mar 2020] announced it was temporarily suspending the flight permits of Iran Air on the advice of health officials who said Tehran was "not in control" of the novel coronavirus outbreak on its soil. The Iranian carrier operates flights to multiple European destinations including Paris, London, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Rome.

Saudi Arabia locks down predominantly Shiite eastern province
-------------------------------------------------------------
Across the Persian Gulf, Iran's archfoe Saudi Arabia imposed a temporary lockdown on its eastern Qatif province, home to the kingdom's marginalised Shiite population, to prevent the spread of the virus. Saudi authorities on Sunday [8 Mar 2020] said 11 coronavirus cases had been recorded in the eastern province. "Given that all 11 recorded positive cases of the new coronavirus are from Qatif ... it has been decided ... to temporarily suspend entry and exit from Qatif," the Saudi interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. The move risks stirring resentment in Qatif, which has been a flashpoint between the Sunni-dominated Saudi government and minority Shiites in the country who have complained of discrimination, charges the government denies. Saudi authorities have previously said those infected have either been to Iran or interacted with people who visited the Islamic Republic, home to major Shiite holy sites.

[The public health world is watching Italy to see if they are successful in implementing these new rules, and to see if the implementation of these rules will have an impact on disease transmission. I suspect many of the European countries are weighing the pros and cons of implementing similar measures.

The Chinese appeared to have successfully slowed transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Is it feasible and will it work outside of China? - Mod.MPP]

[6] Cruise ships: US State Department warns against cruise ship travel
Date: Sun 8 Mar 2020 10:54 PM EDT

State Department warns Americans against cruise ship travel during coronavirus outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The State Department warned Sunday [8 Mar 2020] that US citizens, particularly those who have underlying medical issues, should not go on cruises due to the heightened risk of contracting the coronavirus on board. The announcement followed mounting pressure on the multi-billion dollar industry after American passengers aboard two Princess Cruises ships became infected with covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, within the past 2 months. Hundreds of travelers have been turned away at multiple ports and subject to lengthy quarantine periods.

Yet the news came as a shock to some industry experts, who expected additional precautions on ships rather than a blanket advisory against cruise travel. Previously, US officials had only gone as far as saying that senior citizens and people with health conditions should avoid cruising. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading up the Trump administration's response to the virus, met with industry leaders Saturday [8 Mar 2020] in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to determine "what more we can do together to protect the American people." "American people value our cruise line industry; it brings great joy and great entertainment value for Americans," he said, according to the Miami Herald. "We want to ensure Americans can continue to enjoy the opportunities of the cruise line industry."

Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Pence, told The Washington Post on Sunday [8 Mar 2020] that the new guidance was "a recommendation made by health professionals that the White House of course adopted."

Reuters reported on Friday [6 Mar 2020] that the US was considering measures to discourage cruising, including advising all or some Americans to temporarily avoid taking cruises or potentially creating travel restrictions related to cruises. In a statement released the same day, the Cruise Lines International Association called any effort to curtail cruising "unreasonable" and detrimental to the economy, adding that the industry supports more than 421,000 American jobs and contributed almost USD 53 billion to the US economy in 2018.

"With the proactive measures in place by the cruise industry based on prevailing guidance from global health authorities, restricting cruising is unreasonable and will have long-lasting detrimental effects on the US economy well beyond the travel and tourism industry," the group said. On Sunday [8 Mar 2020], about an hour before the State Department tweeted out its advisory, the cruise association added in a tweet that it has "committed to do even more to protect our guests, our crew and the communities where we sail," adding "more stringent boarding procedures," more medical resources on board and screening people's temperatures as they embark.

The State Department directive, posted on Twitter just before 4 p.m., warned Americans of the risks of taking cruises amid the outbreak, noting that other countries with strict screening procedures had stopped passengers from disembarking or quarantined them. 328 Americans aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in January [2020] and February [2020] were evacuated and isolated for 2 weeks after being stranded on it for weeks. 700 passengers became infected in a ship-wide pandemic; 7 died.

Another Princess Cruises ship, the Grand Princess, was being held in waters off San Francisco on Sunday [8 Mar 2020], with the coronavirus detected among nearly half of the passengers initially tested. Those results raised concerns that, as had happened on the Diamond Princess, the virus could be spreading among the 3533 people aboard.

"While the US government has evacuated some cruise ship passengers in recent weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for US citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities," said the announcement from the State Department, which did immediately not respond to The Washington Post's requests for further information.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a similar directive Sunday [8 Mar 2020], recommending that travelers -- particularly those with underlying health issues -- "defer all cruise ship travel worldwide." The agency added that cruise passengers are at a higher risk of person-to-person spread of the coronavirus.

A spokesman for Carnival Corp., which owns Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and others, noted in a statement to The Post on Sunday [8 Mar 2020] that the company's brands had "enhanced their health screening protocols," including conducting thermal scans and temperature checks prior to boarding and on board. "We are currently in discussions with the CDC, World Health Organization and other health officials, and we met as a cruise industry Saturday, [7 Mar 2020], with US Vice President Mike Pence on an aggressive industry-wide response plan," wrote the spokesman, Roger Frizzell. "The health and safety of our guests and crew is our highest priority, and cruising remains one of the most attractive vacation options available." He added: "While advisories have been issued, no restrictions are in place for those who choose to take a cruise."

The Cruise Lines International Association said in a statement that it was "staying focused on the development of an aggressive, responsive plan as agreed to during the meeting with the Vice President yesterday, which will go beyond the significantly enhanced protocols already in place." Stewart Chiron, an industry expert who bills himself as "The Cruise Guy" and offers cruise discounts and tips, said he hadn't seen anything like the advisory in 30 years of observing and talking about the cruise business. After the meeting with Pence, he had anticipated changes on ships, such as increased coronavirus kits on board or denial of travel for people from certain areas heavily affected by the virus.

But Sunday's [8 Mar 2020] recommendation against an entire form of travel has stunned the industry as a dramatic escalation, he said. He accused officials of "trying to make the uninformed public feel better that the government is doing something" and pointed to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's struggle to roll out widespread testing for coronavirus. Mike Driscoll, the editor-in-chief of Cruise Week, said he too was taken aback by Sunday's [8 Mar 2020] news, noting that company leaders were set to meet again with government officials on Tuesday [10 Mar 2020] to discuss ways they could address concerns. "It's just a little jarring to have that on the heels of something that's saying it's okay... we're working on something," Driscoll told The Post.

He's confident some will keep cruising. But people pay attention when, say, the State Department issues a warning against visiting a certain country, he said. Travel agents he talked to Sunday all had the same message about the advisory: "This is huge."

[Given the experiences we've seen with the Diamond Princess, the Grand Princess, the Nile River cruise ship, learning that crew from the Diamond Princess was shifted to work on other ships, and the observation that individuals (passengers) have boarded ships with mild symptoms, and then progressed on to have a full clinical picture with pneumonia, it does appear that for the time being, cruising may not be the healthiest vacation to take, especially for those older than 60 years of age, and/or with pre-existing co-morbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, history of malignancies on chemotherapy, and the list goes on.

In another media report, it is mentioned that "the new CDC guidance also warns the elderly and those with underlying health problems to avoid non-essential travel such as long plane trips." (https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/08/cdc-warns-plane-trips-cruises-coronavirus-124153). - Mod.MPP]

Note: Numbers include both domestic and repatriated cases.
*The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

**** "Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status
***** Egypt is classified as "Imported cases only" with the exception of a Nile Cruise ship currently in Egyptian international waters that is experiencing local transmission.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 102. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the European region, 7 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 15 countries (including 4 territories) from the Americas region, and 6 countries from the African region. 53 countries/territories are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Cambodia, Austria, Hungary, Peru and Brazil newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission and clusters of cases was also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess) and the cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 24 727 including 484 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
