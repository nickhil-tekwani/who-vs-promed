Bird flu resurfaces in Laos but type not yet known
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu has been found in about 2500 chickens who died on a farm
near the Laotian capital of Vientiane last week, but the type of flu
has not been determined yet, a Laotian official said Thursday [27 Jul 2006].
Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman Yong Chanthalansy confirmed a report
on the website of the Vientiane Times newspaper that the Lao
government's National Infectious Disease Prevention and Control
Committee on 18 Jul 2006 had confirmed that the chickens died of bird flu.
The results of laboratory tests to determine whether it was the
virulent H5N1 virus were expected in a week or 2, he told The
Associated Press by phone.
The committee's statement said 2580 chickens were found dead at the
farm in Xaythany district, 25 km (15 miles) south of Vientiane,
according to the newspaper. It said the same farm experienced a bird
flu outbreak in 2004.
After the chickens' deaths, agriculture officials culled about 6000
more birds at the farm.
Yong said the government has stepped up surveillance and control
measures, including disseminating information to people on how to
prevent the spread of bird flu and tightening control for imported
poultry products.
Laos has reported no human deaths from the virus, though neighboring
Thailand this week reported its 15th human fatality.
In May 2006, the Lao government announced that H5N1 bird flu had been
found in a single free-range duck at a backyard farm 20 km (12 miles)
from Vientiane. Previous to that, its last confirmed case had been in
early 2004.
In October last year [2005], the United States announced it was
granting USD 3.4 million (2.7 million euros) in aid for impoverished
Laos to fend off the disease.

Xaythany is south of Vientiane, adjacent to the Thai border; see map at

Laos's 1st -- and, so far, last -- report to the OIE on avian
influenza was sent on 27 Jan 2004. It referred to the identification
of avian influenza virus subtype H5 in one layer farm in the village
of Nonsavang, close to Vientiane. Earlier rumors attributed the
mortalities to an outbreak of fowl cholera (similar to the HPAI
history in Thailand). See
<ftp://ftp.oie.int/infos_san_archives/eng/2004/en_040130v17n05.pdf>.
According to unofficial information, there has been an additional
HPAI case in Laos: a duck found infected in a backyard farm 20 km (12
miles) south of Vientiane in February 2006 (20060518.1394).
Allegedly, the infection did not spread.
For background information on the HPAI situation in Laos, derived
from an FAO report of January 2005, see the commentary in the above posting.
Confirmation and further details of the current outbreak are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
