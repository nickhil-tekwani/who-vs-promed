Every 100th Sverdlovsk citizen suffered from a tick bite from the start of the season.

As of 11 Jul [2022], 44 202 people, including 7808 children under 17 years old, suffered from tick bites in the Sverdlovsk region.

As reported in Uralinformburo, the average in the region was 1058 victims per 100 000 people, which is 1.35 times higher than the same period in 2021 and higher than the long-term average.

Most often, ticks attack people in the Slobodo-Turinsky and Baikalovsky districts; Pyshminsky, Talitsky, and Tugulymsky urban districts; Degtyarsk, Talitsa, Upper Tura and Tagil, Irbit and Kamensk-Uralsky.

In Yekaterinburg, 14 990 victims were registered (34% of the total).

With a preliminary diagnosis of tick-borne viral encephalitis, 265 people were hospitalized (+50% compared to last year [2021], including 58 minors. Tick-borne infection was confirmed in 30 adults and 7 children.

522 people (+10%), including 114 children, are in clinics with suspicion of tick-borne ixodid borreliosis. The diagnosis was confirmed in 161 adults and 19 children.

Among 27 406 ticks examined in laboratories, every 100th (348 samples) turned out to be carriers of encephalitis. Among 26 195 tests for borreliosis, 10 915 were positive (41.7%). In 551 cases, monocytic ehrlichiosis was detected, and in 153 cases, granulocytic anaplasmosis.

Rospotrebnadzor reminds that the most reliable protection against tick-borne encephalitis is vaccination. Vaccination is carried out all year round. To date, 144 195 people have been vaccinated, and another 276 304 have been revaccinated.

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus infections in Russia are common. This is the season of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia, and tick bites are very common in Sverdlovsk this year (2022). With a preliminary diagnosis of tick-borne viral encephalitis, 265 people were hospitalized, of which 30 adults and 7 children have been confirmed with TBE. No mention was made in the above report if the TBE virus infected individuals had been vaccinated although it does indicate that, to date, 144 195 people have been vaccinated, and another 276 304 have been revaccinated.

The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. It is curious that no vaccination of people resident in or visiting the areas of high tick abundance is mentioned (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/tickborne-encephalitis).

"The Sverdlovsk Oblast is a federal subject of Russia located in the Ural Federal District. Its administrative center is the city of Yekaterinburg, formerly known as Sverdlovsk. Its population is 4 297 747" [as of 2010]. - Mod.TY
