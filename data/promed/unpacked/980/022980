Assam State Zoo began preparing to vaccinate its rhinos and all other
ruminant mammals against anthrax for the 1st time after receiving
confirmation about the contagious _Bacillus anthracis_ somewhere on its
sprawling campus. Clinical tests at the College of Veterinary Sciences in
Khanapara confirmed what was feared: that an "acute" case of anthrax caused
the sudden death of a 30 year old rhino, Jon, in the early hours of 22 Jan
2008.

On receiving the report yesterday [29 Jan 2007], the committee of experts
that was constituted to oversee preventive measures contacted the Institute
of Veterinary Biologicals, also in Khanapara, to suggest the dose of
anthrax vaccine appropriate for different species of mammals. "There are
different doses for different animals. One must know the right dose to be
administered for it to be effective," a member of the committee said.

The Khanapara institute stocks the anthrax vaccine. The divisional forest
officer in charge of the zoo, Narayan Mahanta, said the anthrax death might
have been caused either by ingestion or inhalation. Since there is no way
of knowing whether the spore-forming bacteria is still around, vaccination
is the only way out. Mahanta said the committee of experts suggested
vaccination of all animals in and around the zoo, with the focus on
ruminant mammals such as cattle, sheep, buffaloes and goats. "We
implemented a series of preventive measures after the rhino died. We were
only waiting to find out whether it was anthrax that caused the death
before taking the final step of vaccinating animals."

On whether anthrax may have already spread beyond the zoo, the DFO said
there was no reason to panic. Jon led a charmed life until anthrax killed
him. In August 2005, suspected poachers tried to electrocute the rhino in
his enclosure at the zoo. Had it not been for a police team that had
entered the zoo to look for fleeing militants just when the poachers were
at work, Jon would have been electrocuted and his horn taken away. He was
brought to the zoo from Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in 1980.

The death of the rhinoceros due to anthrax has been confirmed. In a report
submitted by the Microbiology Department of Guwahati College of Veterinary
Sciences, it has been confirmed that the death of the 30 year old
rhinoceros in Guwahati zoo on 22 Jan 2008 was due to anthrax.

A specialist committee consisting of veterinary doctors, pathologists and
microbiologists is now monitoring all the preventive measures. The disease
has been successfully contained, and there is no further spread of the
disease in other animals.

[Not being certain of the standard dose for sterne vaccine -- as in
practice, different doses are traditionally used for certain species, such
as llamas and goats -- I asked Randall Berrier, D/Veterinary Services,
Colorado Serum Company, which produces the sterne vaccine for North
America. His reply follows. - Mod.MHJ]

We always have a dose range of between 4 - 6 million spores/1 ml for every
serial we produce. From what I have read, the minimum immunizing dose is 2
million. Other producers of the sterne strain have various dose ranges
(i.e. 1/2 cc, 1 cc etc [cc equates to mL]) based on spore concentration, I
suppose. I can only tell you for sure what we do. We recommend the 1-cc
dose for everything, but Australia uses our vaccine, and they give their
small ruminants 1/2 cc.

Llamas are risky for adverse reactions, as are miniature horses (we found
this out in the summer of 2006 in Canada), and younger foals (<4 months of
age) can be risky. Goats can get edema disease from the vaccine, but I
think this happens more when people vaccinate them in the axillary space
[Some advise vaccinating goats in their tail. - Mod.MHJ]. We use goats here
for our safety tests for every serial of anthrax spore vaccine, and they
get twice the dose for this test (1 cc SQ on each side of the thorax), and
I have never seen a problem in these goats other than a mild, transient
lump. I think the full dose of the sterne spores can be more risky for
adverse reactions in the smaller animals (foals, miniature horses, goats,
etc.). I think that a full dose (4 - 6 million) should be adequate for a
rhino, especially if they get a booster 2 - 3 weeks later (I have heard
secondhand that the anamnestic-humoral response from the booster is very
good). I think the different dose ranges for different animals is based
more on safety concerns for the smaller animals than anything else.

[Spread via inhalation is limited to wool and hair mills under normal
circumstances. Plus, if an aerosol cloud had been released, deaths would
not have been limited to this single rhino bull. Other animals and species
would have been afflicted. But such would also be implied if a feed or
forage had been contaminated, a puzzler well worth investigating if it is
to be prevented from happening again. The zoo was lucky that they lost just
this one animal, even though it was much loved Jon. Let us hope that in
death he retained his horn.

Thanks to Satadal and Randall for jumping in, and to Brent for finding the
initial article. - Mod.MHJ]
