[Earlier this month I heard of an anthrax death among bison in South Dakota.
Sam Holland has provided confirmation. - Mod.MHJ]

I do not have the field VMO's report yet, but via phone conversation with
him yesterday evening , this is the same small buffalo herd in Jerauld
county South Dakota that had losses last year. The herd was vaccinated and
boostered in August of 2001 but was not boostered in the spring of 2002.
And on 20 Jun 2002 the owner reported he lost one adult female, confirmed 24
Jun 2002 as anthrax. The herd was boostered with anthrax vaccine on 25 Jun
2002. As of the evening of 27 Jun 2002 no further losses have been
observed.

[Not revaccinating is, unfortunately, a very common mistake by ranchers
dealing with anthrax. A proportion believe that doing it once at the time of
the first outbreak is sufficient for future protection. But no. Stock should
be revaccinated for at least 3 years. In our studies in Louisiana we are
finding it much easier than we expected to find _Bacillus anthracis_ in soil
where an animal has died in the previous 12 months. So it doesn't surprise
me that this ranch had another case. Of course not vaccinating is another
major factor in the persistence of livestock anthrax. The value of that dead
bison would have paid for about one hundred years of annual herd
vaccinations.
Sam's information is greatly appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
