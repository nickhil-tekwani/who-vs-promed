Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?

Data on epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of monkeypox in persons aged ≤ 12 years (children) and adolescents during the ongoing 2022 monkeypox outbreak are limited.

What is added by this report?

During 17 May - 24 Sep 2022, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections in children and adolescents aged < 18 years were rare, representing 0.3% of all U.S. cases; none resulted in critical illness or death. Younger children typically acquired MPXV infection after skin-to-skin contact with a household member with monkeypox during caregiving activities; adolescents were most frequently exposed through male-to-male sexual contact.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Additional monkeypox cases in children and adolescents might be prevented through strengthened vaccination efforts and education around preventive measures and sexual health.

Discussion

MPXV infections in children and adolescents during 17 May-24 Sep 2022, constituted a small percentage (0.3%) of total U.S. monkeypox cases, and no children or adolescents with monkeypox received ICU-level care or died. However, consistent with disparities observed during the ongoing monkeypox epidemic (3), which are likely related to longstanding inequities in the social determinants of health,*** monkeypox in children and adolescents occurred disproportionately among Black and Hispanic children and adolescents compared with U.S. race and ethnicity percentage distributions of persons aged <18 years.††† This finding underscores the continued need for public health efforts to ensure equitable access to monkeypox vaccination, testing, treatment, and information about prevention measures. Similar to findings reported from Spain (1), exposure characteristics differed between younger children and adolescents: younger children most often acquired infection after direct skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver or household member known to have monkeypox, whereas exposure characteristics among adolescents were similar to those most commonly reported among adults (i.e., sexual contact) (3). Adults with monkeypox who interact with children in the household setting should follow transmission prevention guidelines, which outline measures to prevent the spread of monkeypox in households (4), and caregivers who are symptomatic and believe they might have been exposed should try to limit skin-to-skin contact with children, including by covering lesions. In addition, health care providers caring for sexually active adolescents, particularly males who have male-to-male sexual contact, should consider offering vaccination, should provide education on prevention of monkeypox, and should provide testing for HIV and other STIs (5).

Limited data, based on infections involving Clade I MPXV rather than the Clade IIb virus causing the current epidemic, suggested that children aged < 8 years might be at higher risk for severe disease than are older persons (6,7). However, the clinical signs and symptoms reported in children and adolescents in this report were broadly similar to findings from Spain and U.S. national surveillance data for cases overall (1,3), with most children experiencing a mild-to-moderate clinical course. Clinicians caring for children and adolescents should be aware of available clinical guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of monkeypox and of the potential for severe disease, particularly in persons with profound immunocompromise (e.g., those with advanced HIV disease or undergoing chemotherapy for cancer) (8).

No secondary transmission was identified during instances when children attended school or a child care facility while symptomatic, although incomplete case ascertainment and reporting might have limited detection of such events. The absence of known secondary transmission in schools and child care facilities despite the presence of symptomatic persons in these settings suggests that widespread child-to-child transmission might be unlikely. Regardless of age, contacts of persons with monkeypox should be monitored, and JYNNEOS vaccination postexposure prophylaxis should be considered based on an exposure risk assessment and individual risk for severe disease (7,9).

This analysis found that monkeypox in children and adolescents aged < 18 years has been rare during the current outbreak and most infections were not severe. Public health messaging should emphasize transmission prevention guidelines for persons with monkeypox who interact with newborns, infants, and children in household settings (4,9). In addition, health care providers caring for sexually active adolescents, particularly male adolescents who have male-to-male sexual contact, should encourage vaccination for eligible persons and should provide testing for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Matthew R. Golden, M.D., M.P.H., and Judith N. Wasserheit, M.D., M.P.H. Monkeypox -- A Sobering Sentinel for Pandemic Preparedness and Sexual Health System Capacity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between May and mid-October, 2022, clinicians diagnosed more than 72 000 cases of monkeypox in 102 countries that aren't typically affected by the virus.1 This new pandemic has strained public health and health care systems already battered by COVID-19. It has also highlighted lessons learned -- and sometimes ignored -- from HIV and COVID-19 and has illustrated the inadequacy of sexual health infrastructure and pandemic preparedness in the United States.

In the current pandemic, we strongly believe monkeypox should be considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI).2 The virus can be isolated from semen and rectal and oral fluids, and most patients have presented with anogenital or oropharyngeal lesions, frequently in association with HIV or other STIs.2,3 Whether to categorize monkeypox as an STI has been a controversial question. Although recent monkeypox epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa have been characterized by genital ulcers in some patients and a shift in the affected population from children to young adults, little attention has been focused on sexual transmission, despite calls from African investigators to explore this issue.4 The virus is also transmissible through nonsexual contact with lesions, possibly through contact with the mucosa of infected persons without lesions, and, much less commonly, through fomites and perhaps respiratory secretions.

The common tendency to categorize infections as either STIs or not STIs is overly simplistic. Many common STIs can be transmitted through nonsexual contact, and people with some STIs, such as syphilis, commonly present with nongenital lesions. Human papillomavirus, HIV, herpes, syphilis, and potentially gonorrhea are transmissible through modes of contact other than vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Conversely, many infections that aren't typically classified as STIs can be transmitted through sex (e.g., shigella, Zika, and Ebola). The current monkeypox pandemic probably wouldn't have occurred in the absence of sexual transmission -- unlike the recent Ebola or Zika epidemics, for example -- and people can substantially reduce their risk of monkeypox by changing their sexual behavior. We therefore believe it's appropriate to consider monkeypox an STI while acknowledging that not every case is sexually transmitted and not every monkeypox epidemic is driven primarily by sex.

Monkeypox-related public health communications have proven similarly controversial. The current pandemic is concentrated among men who have sex with men (MSM), including those who have HIV or are using preexposure prophylaxis for HIV. Among U.S. cases for which data are available, 98% have been in people assigned male sex at birth, and 93% have been in gay or bisexual men.5 Some public health officials and community representatives have expressed concern that communications highlighting the concentration of monkeypox in this population are stigmatizing. This fear is well founded, given widespread discrimination against MSM. Both the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics, however, have demonstrated the necessity of providing the public with clear and accurate information, which equips people and communities at increased risk to protect themselves. Moreover, the commitment to providing complete, accurate information in partnership with affected communities is essential to maintaining the public's trust. The fight against HIV was shaped by leaders in the MSM community who demanded truth and transparency. We believe the monkeypox pandemic similarly demands clear communication. Scientists should also be humble and communicate uncertainty. We don't know how this pandemic will evolve. Monkeypox could expand to other populations, including women from marginalized groups, or become endemic. The public needs to know about these possibilities and their implications.

Lessons from COVID-19 have informed the monkeypox response. Early in the monkeypox pandemic, access to care was limited by inadequate supplies of tests and vaccines, burdensome approval processes for testing, and onerous paperwork requirements to obtain treatment. Progress in addressing these problems has been rapid. Commercial laboratories scaled up monkeypox PCR testing, and federal agencies reduced the barriers to tecovirimat access. Many regions have strengthened components of their public health systems in the wake of COVID-19. Surveillance systems are better; communication within health departments and among health departments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care organizations, and the public has improved; many health care organizations are better prepared for public health emergencies; and infrastructure for managing and administering vaccines is stronger. Although the U.S. monkeypox vaccine supply was initially inadequate, scale-up of intradermal immunizations, which require smaller quantities of vaccine than subcutaneous injections, has expanded the effective supply.

Other lessons haven't been learned. Pandemics have increased in frequency, severity, and scale, yet public- and private-sector institutions remain inadequately prepared for them. Research shows that the effects of pandemics typically concentrate over time in vulnerable and marginalized populations, thereby amplifying inequities. U.S. monkeypox cases have increasingly been concentrated among Black and Latinx people, yet the United States hasn't adequately invested in developing and implementing innovative strategies for reaching these groups early -- the wise approach from economic, political, moral, and disease-control perspectives. Moreover, it's clear that the best biomedical tools, such as vaccines and antivirals, must be implemented alongside policies and programs that help people reduce their risk and use these tools effectively. Yet policymakers and communities are often slow to adopt these interventions.

Research and experience also show that protecting Americans requires supporting pandemic prevention and control in low- and middle-income countries, where most pandemic pathogens emerge. But the United States has done little to strengthen surveillance systems and provide equitable access to monkeypox (and COVID-19) testing, treatment, and vaccines in such countries. Although high-quality data are necessary to inform clinical and public health decision making, the United States hasn't done enough to integrate research efforts with pandemic preparedness and response -- a conclusion supported by the lack of definitive efficacy data for both the JYNNEOS vaccine and tecovirimat, the primary biomedical interventions for monkeypox.

Finally, the U.S. monkeypox response has been hampered by inadequate public health infrastructure. Public health agencies don't have sources of funding that can be deployed rapidly in an emergency for case investigation, contact tracing, disease surveillance, community vaccination events, and related activities. Emergency response requires an adequately resourced, stable, well-trained public health workforce that can be activated rapidly.

The new pandemic has also highlighted the inadequacy of the country's sexual health infrastructure. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the 3 most common reportable diseases in the United States were STIs. STIs resulted in nearly USD 16 billion in direct medical costs in 2018. In King County, our sexual health clinic -- the only one in the state -- is the largest clinical site for diagnosing and treating monkeypox in Washington State. We rapidly scaled up vaccination activities to immunize approximately 350 patients per day, nearly all of them MSM or transgender people. Many sexual health clinics throughout the country have taken similar initiatives. But many cities have virtually no specialty sexual health services. This gap has implications that extend beyond monkeypox. It undermines our ability to address rapidly increasing rates of congenital syphilis in the United States and prevents us from fully capitalizing on scientific advances to control HIV.

Sexual health clinics are essential, but effective STI control requires integrating public health systems and approaches, the wider health care system, and the efforts of affected communities. Although women and children bear the brunt of long-term consequences from STIs, infections such as HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and monkeypox disproportionately affect MSM and transgender people. Addressing this disparity requires systematically asking all patients about their gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual behavior; recording this information in fields that can be queried in secure electronic health records; and using the resulting data to provide high-quality STI care, including delivery of vaccines, testing, treatment, and preexposure prophylaxis to people who need them. It also requires engaging with communities to reach Black and Latinx MSM and forming partnerships to develop outreach activities and clinical infrastructure that meet the needs of the most affected populations.

The number of new monkeypox cases in the United States and many other countries is now decreasing. But it's too early to declare victory. Public- and private-sector leaders must also learn from this new pandemic. Coming on the heels of COVID-19 and more than 40 years of HIV-control efforts, the monkeypox pandemic is another sentinel event that highlights the urgent need to build and sustain public health and clinical infrastructure that strengthens pandemic prevention and response and enables us to confront the growing STI epidemics effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective: To analyse the transmission dynamics of the monkeypox outbreak in the UK, declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in July 2022.

Design: Contact tracing study, linking data on case-contact pairs and on probable exposure dates.

Setting: Case questionnaires from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), United Kingdom.

Participants: 2746 people with polymerase chain reaction confirmed monkeypox virus in the UK between 6 May and 1 Aug 2022.

Main outcome measures: The incubation period and serial interval of a monkeypox infection using 2 bayesian time delay models -- one corrected for interval censoring (ICC -- interval censoring corrected) and one corrected for interval censoring, right truncation, and epidemic phase bias (ICRTC -- interval censoring right truncation corrected). Growth rates of cases by reporting date, when monkeypox virus was confirmed and reported to UKHSA, were estimated using generalised additive models.

Results: The mean age of participants was 37.8 years and 95% reported being gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (1160 out of 1213 reporting). The mean incubation period was estimated to be 7.6 days (95% credible interval 6.5 to 9.9) using the ICC model and 7.8 days (6.6 to 9.2) using the ICRTC model. The estimated mean serial interval was 8.0 days (95% credible interval 6.5 to 9.8) using the ICC model and 9.5 days (7.4 to 12.3) using the ICRTC model. Although the mean serial interval was longer than the incubation period for both models, short serial intervals were more common than short incubation periods, with the 25th centile and the median of the serial interval shorter than the incubation period. For the ICC and ICRTC models, the corresponding estimates ranged from 1.8 days (95% credible interval 1.5 to 1.8) to 1.6 days (1.4 to 1.6) shorter at the 25th centile and 1.6 days (1.5 to 1.7) to 0.8 days (0.3 to 1.2) shorter at the median. 10 out of 13 linked patients had documented pre-symptomatic transmission. Doubling times of cases declined from 9.07 days (95% confidence interval 12.63 to 7.08) on 6 May 2022, when the 1st case of monkeypox was reported in the UK, to a halving time of 29 days (95% confidence interval 38.02 to 23.44) on 1 Aug 2022.

Conclusions: Analysis of the instantaneous growth rate of monkeypox incidence indicates that the epidemic peaked in the UK as of 9 Jul 2022 and then started to decline. Short serial intervals were more common than short incubation periods suggesting considerable pre-symptomatic transmission, which was validated through linked patient level records. For patients who could be linked through personally identifiable data, 4 days was the maximum time that transmission was detected before symptoms manifested. An isolation period of 16 to 23 days would be required to detect 95% of people with a potential infection. The 95th centile of the serial interval was between 23 and 41 days, suggesting long infectious periods.

[The occurrence of transmissible monkeypox virus 4 days prior to the appearance of symptoms complicates tracing and means MSM may not be aware that their partners are infectious, complicating prevention.
