[According to ProMED-mail post 20040319.0766 "DNR has long advocated good
hygiene by hunters, including the wearing of rubber gloves when handling
deer. Several years ago, CWD was diagnosed in wild, free-ranging deer and
elk primarily in northeastern Colorado, southeastern Wyoming, Nebraska,
Montana,Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Saskatchewan, and Alberta."]
Dr. Pybus has already commented about Alberta, but the record for the US
still needs to be set straight.
CWD has only been found in captive elk herds in Montana, Oklahoma and
Kansas. As yet, it has not been found in free-ranging deer or elk in those
3 states.
