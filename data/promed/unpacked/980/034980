The Upper West Region has recorded 3 yellow fever [YF] cases this year
[2011] with one each in Wa Municipality, Jirapa and Wa East Districts,
Dr Richard Wodah, Medical Director of Saint Joseph's Hospital at
Jirapa has announced. Consequently, a district mass immunisation
programme has been drawn especially for children above one year.

Dr Wodah made this known at Duori, when the Rotary Club of Windsor in
Canada presented delivery packs valued at GHS 900 Ghana [Cedi; 556
USD] to the local health post. He said the region has for the past 6
years recorded no cases of yellow fever and expressed worry about the
development. Dr Wodah said recording as many 3 cases of the disease
was disturbing news to the Regional Health Directorate.

He called on the people to sleep under mosquito nets and also mobilise
all children, especially those above one year to be immunised.

[There was a YF outbreak in the Jirapa district in 2005, with one
confirmed and 10 suspected cases at that time (see ProMED-mail
archives cited below). Sporadic YF cases and outbreaks occur in West
Africa where it is endemic, with the attendant risk of the sylvan
(forest) cycle becoming an urban or suburban epidemic if continuous
vaccination programs are not carried out to maintain immunity in the
population. One hopes that the vaccination campaign mentioned in the
above report is implemented quickly.
