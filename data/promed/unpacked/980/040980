Eradication of EBL virus successful
-----------------------------------
New Zealand dairy herds are free of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), a
contagious viral disease, following a national eradication campaign.

Campaign
--------
In 1996, the disease was eradicated in British dairy herds, and one year
later the campaign in New Zealand was started. It was run by farmer
cooperative, Livestock Improvement (LIC), without any intervention from the
authorities.

Herd infection rates were almost 10 per cent in 1997 and appeared below 0.1
per cent by 2005. Millions of milk samples were screened each year. And
last year [2008] not an EBL-infected dairy herd was detected.

Enzootic bovine leukosis
------------------------
EBL disease is spread by contact with contaminated blood and can cause
fatal lymphosarcoma. There is no evidence of it infecting other species
than cattle or sheep.

Export
------
Biosecurity officials used the results of the internationally recognized
control program for export certification of cattle, semen, and embryos.

Beef herds
----------
A LIC spokesman said that no systematic testing was done on beef herds, and
that natural-mating beef bulls brought into dairy herds remain a potential
risk to EBL-free dairy herds.

[Enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) is also called bovine leukemia virus (BLV)
and is caused by a retrovirus. It can cause fatal malignant cancers in some
animals, but generally results in major economic losses.

Generally the disease is found in the Pacific countries of Australia, New
Zealand, Guam, and the French Polynesian islands.

While about 70 per cent of infected animals do not seem to show clinical
signs, even when having the disease, those that do develop clinical signs
are generally between 4 and 8 years old. There are various clinical signs,
sometimes referencing the organ system involved, but more often they are
general and non specific, such as weight loss with or without reduced
appetite, decreased milk yield, fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, enlargement of
many of the lymph nodes, anemia, paresis of the rear limbs, and
paradoxically, even constipation. When tumors do develop, the animal
progressively loses condition and often dies.

There is a calf form of the disease affecting those animals less than 6
months with generalized lymphadenopathy. In calves 6-8 months old thymic
tumors may extend into the thorax. Those calves developing only skin tumors
generally survive, whereas these others often do not survive.

The disease may be transmitted during parturition through infected cells
being transferred to the neonate. The disease may also be transmitted
iatrogenically by the use of contaminated needles, equipment, and even
rectal exams without a change of gloves between animals. Insects,
especially tabanids, can transmit the virus. Infected embryos and semen may
also transmit the disease, but these seem to be less frequent methods of
transmission.

The disease may be eradicated by testing and removal of the reactors, which
may be what New Zealand has done. They deserve a hearty congratulations for
eradicating this disease! - Mod.TG
