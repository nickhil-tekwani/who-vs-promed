Uganda's Health Ministry said on Wednesday [25 May 2011] that the
Ebola outbreak in the country is under control, since there is no new
confirmed case after the index case on 6 May 2011, according to the
Xinhua [News Agency]. The Ministry in a statement issued here
[Kampala] said that since the 1st case, a 12-year-old girl who died on
6 May 2011, other suspected cases have turned out to be negative.

"The ministry assures the general public that the outbreak is under
control as seen in the absence of new confirmed cases. The public is
requested to report any suspected cases to the nearest health unit,"
the statement said.

The ministry said that a total of 21 people have been tested at the
Uganda Virus Institute Entebbe and all proved negative. It said that
experts are continuing to monitor the 25 people who were in contact
with the 12-year-old victim to see whether they will develop signs of
ebolavirus infection. These contacts on Wednesday [25 May 2011]
completed 18 days of follow-up and have 3 more days [before they can
be considered to be ebolavirus-free].

The ministry said that other suspected cases reported in the Western
District of Kasese and the epicenter [in] Luweero district [Central
Region] continue to be monitored. Two isolation units have been set up
in Luweero [Central Region and another in Kasese [Western Region].

Ebolavirus is highly contagious and causes a range of symptoms
including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, generalized pain or malaise and,
in many cases, internal and external bleeding. Mortality rates of
Ebola fever are extremely high, with the human case-fatality rate
ranging from 50 percent to 89 percent, depending on viral subtype.

The last outbreak in Uganda was in late 2007 in the Western district
of Bundibugyo. It claimed 37 lives out of the 148 infected.

[This new statement originating from the Ugandan Ministry of Health
now reveals that only one case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever has been
confirmed. The victim was the 12-year-old girl in Luwero district who
died on 6 May 2001. None of the other suspected cases of ebolavirus
infection previously reported in the Luwero District of Uganda's
Central Region have been confirmed, nor have any of the suspected
cases in the Kasese District in the Western Region of Uganda. It must
be assumed now that the 2nd supposedly confirmed victim, a mortuary
attendant at the Bombo Military Hospital who had close contact with
the index case, did indeed die of malaria as initially reported.

The absence of secondary cases is surprising, as the infecting virus
has been identified as Sudan ebolavirus. Although some ebolaviruses
such as Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus have been relatively benign, Sudan
ebolavirus has been particularly virulent and lethal. Characterisation
of the genome of the Luwera isolate may be instructive in this
respect.
