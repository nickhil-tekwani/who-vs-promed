Fresh cases of bird flu have been detected in 2 Murshidabad villages,
weeks after the Bengal government said culling operations were over
and lifted the state-wide ban on selling chickens and ducks.

District magistrate Subir Bhadra confirmed tonight that samples sent
to the National Animal Research Laboratory in Bhopal from the 2
villages, Nayamukundapur and Bothra, had tested positive.

Bhadra said about 60 rapid response teams would be trained tomorrow
[9 Mar 2008] so they could start culling chickens and ducks in the
affected areas from Monday [10 Mar 2008] morning.

The samples were sent 3 days back after 600 chickens died in
Nayamukundapur in Raghunathgunj Block II, about 50 km from
Behrampore, and over 300 perished in Bothra in Murshidabad-Jiagunj
block, about 20 km from the district headquarters.

In Calcutta, animal resource development minister Anisur Rahman said
he had heard about the fresh outbreak.

"We didn't carry out culling operations in 2 freshly affected blocks
of Murshidabad in January [2008] when bird flu 1st hit Bengal. We
shall begin culling there in full swing from Monday [10 Mar 2008]."

The minister said he would visit the affected blocks tomorrow or on
Monday [10 Mar 2008] after briefing the chief minister. "The
situation is indeed worrisome," he added.

The state government had ordered culling operations from mid-January
2008 after 16 of Bengal's 19 districts were found to have been
affected by the deadly H5N1 strain of avian influenza.

Nearly 40 lakh [4 000 000] chickens and ducks were culled up to 5 Feb
2008. The administration lifted the ban on sales of chickens and
ducks 7 days later, though mop-up operations are still on in pockets.

On 22 Feb 2008, the government resumed culling in Murshidabad and
Birbhum after a central government report said the job was incomplete
in parts of the 2 districts.

An official in Murshidabad, about 220 km from Calcutta, said the
administration launched a campaign tonight over loudspeakers, asking
people to cooperate and hand over their poultry when culling teams
visit their homes on Monday [10 Mar 2008].

Fresh cases of bird flu were confirmed in a middle West Bengal
district on Sat [8 Mar 2008], almost a month after roughly 4 million
birds were culled to combat India's worst ever outbreak of the deadly
avian influenza.

"We have received confirmation of bird flu (the deadly H5N1 strain)
in 2 villages of Murshidabad district. The 2 villages are
Nayamukundapur in Raghunathgunj Block II and Dohapara village in
Murshidabad-Jiagunj block," Murshidabad district [map at
<http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&tab=wl>]
magistrate Subir Bhadra said.

The 2 areas -- where about 900 poultry birds died in the past week --
are about 300 km from Kolkata. Bhadra said the samples that were
recently sent to the National Animal Research Laboratory in Bhopal
from the 2 villages had tested positive. He said about 60 rapid
response teams would start culling chickens and ducks in the affected
areas soonest. "The preparations are on. [We] might start culling
from Sunday evening or Monday [10 Mar 2008] morning," he said.

In Kolkata, West Bengal Animal Resource Development (ARD) Minister
Anisur Rahman said he had heard about the fresh outbreak and that
culling would start Sunday [9 Mar 2008] itself. "The areas from where
the reports came are not new areas. We will start culling Sunday," he
said. Rahman said about 4 million birds were culled up until
mid-February 2008 since the outbreak was confirmed on 15 Jan 2008.

Early February 2008, it was hoped that the worst bird flu crisis ever
was over after the completion of culling. The ban on sale and
consumption of poultry products and meat was also lifted from 13 of
the 19 West Bengal districts where the flu raged. The West Bengal
government in early February 2008 had allayed fears of human
infection in the avian flu-hit state, after all the 19 people in the
state whose blood samples were sent to central laboratories had
tested negative.

In West Bengal, the H5N1 virus that causes avian influenza had hit
parts of 13 out of 19 districts. About 1.8 million people stay in the
affected areas, Rahman had said.

Bird flu was confirmed in West Bengal on 15 Jan 2008. The affected
districts were South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly, Birbhum, South
Dinajpur, Murshidabad, Nadia, Burdwan, Bankura, Malda, Cooch Behar,
Purulia and West Midnapore.

In neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a long border with West
Bengal, bird flu had affected 29 of the 64 districts. The outbreak in
that country was announced on 3 Jan 2008.

[India's refraining from stamping-out the 2 Murshidabad outbreaks in
January 2008, as candidly revealed by Minister Anisur Rahman (see
item 1 above), may have cost dearly but, luckily, so far without
(noticeable) human health implications.

India's last OIE follow-up report on the outbreaks in West Bengal
(OIE Ref. 6783) was submitted on 9 Feb 2008. A new follow-up report
is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
