Igembe Deputy County Commissioner (DCC) James Kosgei has cautioned area residents against consuming uninspected meat during this festive season. Mr. Kosgei issued the warning following the deaths of 4 people in Nyambene after consuming uninspected meat suspected to be infected with the deadly disease anthrax. "During this festive season, a lot of slaughtering takes place both in designated abattoirs and in homesteads, but both should seek the services of relevant veterinary offices before consuming the meat, else we may be faced with serious issues since anthrax is a deadly disease," said the DCC.

[For the location of Nyambene, go to https://www.google.com/maps/@0.2347034,37.8737783,10z and zoom out. It is in the center of North Meru district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meru_North_District).

Wise advice by the Igembe DCC James Kosgei. It is that time of year when meat is needed for family celebrations, and caution is forgotten. If there were 4 deaths from anthrax (presumably gastroenteric anthrax because it is more lethal and gives less warning), we can safely presume that there are 1 to 2 dozen people with skin lesions from handling this infected meat. And if there was one person dead dead from anthrax, there will have been others in the same and neighbouring villages. It's that time of year. - Mod.MHJ
