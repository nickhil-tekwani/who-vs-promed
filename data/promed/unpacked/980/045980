Indonesia's health minister said on Friday [21 Oct 2022] the number of children who had died from acute kidney injury (AKI) rose to 133 from the previously reported 99.

The deaths were among a total of 241 cases in 22 provinces, Budi Gunadi Sadikin said, adding that most patients were children under the age of 5.

Budi on Thursday [20 Oct 2022] said some medicinal syrups available in Indonesia contained ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, ingredients that have been linked to fatal AKI in children.

Indonesia has temporarily banned sales and prescription of all syrup-based medications and formed an expert team comprised of local health and paediatrics officials and World Health Organization (WHO) representatives to look into the AKI spike among children.

The country's food and drug agency has also named 5 locally made products that contained excessive levels of ethylene glycol and has ordered the producers to pull them out of circulation and destroy all remaining batches.

[Earlier articles stated that "diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol are used as a cheaper alternative in some pharmaceutical products to glycerin, a solvent or thickening agent in many cough syrups."

This issue of a substitution of diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol has been found in Indonesia, India, Gambia, and possibly other countries we are unaware of.

I wonder if those who chose to use these "cheaper alternatives" knew they were toxic and deadly, or bothered to check if those substitutes were toxic. I wonder whether it all came down to a lower cost in manufacturing, and more profit.

It is really hard to look at making a little extra money over the lives of people, and especially children. This affects the parents and siblings of those victims forever.

Perhaps those involved will be held accountable. If there are more of these products in other regions, we hope they can be tracked down and removed from the market before others suffer kidney failure, pain, illness, and death. - Mod.TG

It is worth noting the diethylene glycol (DEG), along with triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol, can be byproducts of ethylene glycol production. Finding both ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as contaminants in the same product likely indicates unpurified ethylene glycol as the culprit rather than the addition of the two chemicals separately. Although DEG is less toxic than ethylene glycol it still requires treatment with an ADH competitive inhibitor such as fomepizole. DEG is commonly found in automobile brake fluid due to its high boiling point. - Mod.JH
