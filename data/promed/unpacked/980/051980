Over the weekend, COVID-19 cases continued to surge across the United States, with Florida experiencing record daily highs of new cases and hospitalizations. The current surge of virus activity is due to the highly transmissible delta (B1617.2) variant.

Yesterday [Sun 1 Aug 2021] the US reported 25 141 new COVID-19 cases, and 71 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. In total, America has confirmed 35 020 438 COVID-19 cases, including 613 254 deaths. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 78 472, according to data from the Washington Post. New daily cases rose 54.2% over the past week, while deaths rose by 31.6% and hospitalizations by 42.2%.

The outbreak is concentrated in areas with low vaccination coverage. Today Jeff Zients, the head of the White House COVID-19 response said 1 in 3 cases nationwide occurred in Florida or Texas this week. The 7-day average of new daily cases is now higher than the peak of last summer.

"While we desperately want to be done with the pandemic, COVID-19 is not done with us," Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said at a White House briefing. "Our battle must last longer. This is hard, this is heavy, we are in this together."

Florida sets new records
-----------------------
In Florida, hospitalizations are now catching up after a month of increasing cases. The state had 10 207 people hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 yesterday [Sun 1 Aug 2021], the highest number the state has reported since the pandemic began, according to the Associated Press. Florida is now leading the nation in per capita hospitalizations for COVID-19. https://apnews.com/article/business-health-florida-coronavirus-pandemic-7ca97f0d685ab25559cf9b51cfc077eb

The state's previous record was 23 Jul 2020, well before COVID-19 vaccines, when 10 170 Floridians were hospitalized. Florida is now averaging 1525 adult hospitalizations a day, and 35 daily pediatric hospitalizations. On [Sat 31 Jul 2021] the state recorded 21 683 new cases of COVID-19, the state's highest one-day total since the start of the pandemic, the AP said.

Despite the rise in case activity, Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order this weekend banning schools from issuing mask mandates. In the mandate, DeSantis said it is unclear from the science if masks protect children from the virus and said it is a parent's choice to determine if a student should be masked.

Nation's biggest retailers revisit masks
----------------------------------------
Target, Kroger, and Walmart are once again revisiting mask policies in light of the delta surge. Kroger and Target stopped short of requiring masks upon entry for customers, but said they were highly recommended. Target also said employees in communities with high transmission must once again wear masks. Walmart also announced a similar policy for employees. Walmart also said it will require all home office workers as well as management-level staff members who travel to be vaccinated by [4 Oct 2021].

As more businesses start to consider vaccination mandates, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is under increasing pressure to grant full approval to COVID-19 vaccines according to the Wall Street Journal. https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-under-pressure-to-grant-full-approval-to-covid-19-vaccines-11627810202

And the mayors of 2 of the nation's biggest cities, Chicago and New York, are urging residents to get vaccinated and voluntarily wear a mask indoors but will not issue mask mandates.

Breakthrough infections in vaccinated account for less than 1% of cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Using data from CDC, a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis now suggests less than 1% of fully vaccinated people are experiencing breakthrough infections. https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/covid-19-vaccine-breakthrough-cases-data-from-the-states/

As of [26 Jul 2021], CDC recorded 6239 hospitalizations and 1263 deaths among vaccinated people. This means less than 0.004% of fully vaccinated people had a breakthrough case that required hospitalization, and less than 0.001% of fully vaccinated people died from breakthrough infections. The news is reassuring after a report last week from CDC, which showed vaccinated people vacationing in Massachusetts were part of an outbreak of COVID-19 cases and were as infectious as unvaccinated people.

Also late last week, CDC published safety data concerning the use of the Pfizer vaccine among 12-17 year olds. As of [16 Jul 2021], 8.9 million US children aged 12-17 had received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and CDC received 9246 reports in this age group. According to CDC, 90.7% of these were for non-serious adverse events and 9.3% were for serious adverse events, including myocarditis (4.3%).

["One-third of all US Covid-19 cases reported in the past week were in just 2 states -- Florida and Texas -- according to White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients. ... 7 states with the lowest vaccination rates represent just about 8-1/2% of the US population, but account for more than 17% of cases, and 1 in 3 cases nationwide occurred in Florida and Texas, this past week," Zients said."

"In the past 2 weeks, daily case rates have gone up 4-fold, according to Dr Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.

"The increase comes as the Delta variant spreads and the percentage of fully vaccinated Americans hovers around 49.7%, according to CDC. Hospitals are once again filling up with patients as the virus tears through the unvaccinated population. There are still about 90 million eligible Americans who are unvaccinated," Zients said. "And we need them to do their part, roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. Each and every shot matters." (from https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html)

Until the proportion of vaccinated individuals increases or they become immunized by natural infection, we will not get through this pandemic. These unvaccinated individuals are risking the public health of their communities. Too many lives are at stake. - Mod.LK]

Still in the grips of COVID-19 surges mainly fueled by the delta (B1617.2) variant, Thailand and Vietnam extended lockdowns and other measures for the worst-hit parts of the countries.

Thailand's government yesterday added 16 more provinces to the maximum red zone area and extended COVID measures in Bangkok and 28 other provinces by 2 weeks, according to the Bangkok Post. The measures include a night curfew and restrictions on travel between provinces. https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2158203/govt-extends-lockdown

Infections in Bangkok, which account for about 39% of the country's cases, are slowing some, but rates are increasing in other provinces due to the more transmissible delta variant, officials said. Yesterday [Sun 1 Aug 2021] the country reported 18 027 cases, along with 133 more deaths.

In Vietnam, officials extended strict measures in Ho Chi Minh City and other cities and provinces in the south for 2 more weeks, according to Reuters. They said the goal is to create a protective belt around Ho Chi Minh City to prevent the virus from spreading further. https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/vietnam-extend-lockdown-throughout-southern-region-covid-cases-soar-2021-07-31/ For now, Vietnam's second biggest city is the country's epicenter, making up 64% of its cases.

Meanwhile, Indonesia's health ministry said the country appears to have passed its peak, according to Reuters. Overall cases have declined from about 50 000 a day to 30 000 a day, but health officials are still worried because test positivity remains high. They add that the delta variant could also spread to the country's more remote areas that have less healthcare capacity, a pattern seen in India's massive outbreak. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-indonesia/indonesias-second-virus-wave-has-peaked-says-health-minister-idUSKBN2F30I6 Government officials have said they hope to reopen the economy by September [2021], depending on vaccine uptake, contact tracing, and treatment.

[3] Obesity

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/study-severe-covid-higher-viral-loads-immune-response-linked-obesity


Among US Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries diagnosed as having COVID-19, obesity was independently and strongly associated with hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, higher viral load, and an altered immune response, according to a prospective study late last week in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. [see comment below. - Mod.LK]

A team led by researchers from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, used logistic regression models to compare the viral loads and immune responses in obese and non-obese patients at 7 military treatment sites, stratified by hospitalization. Patients were included if they had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 or had a recent high-risk exposure to the virus.

Underweight or normal body mass index (BMI) was considered less than 24.8 kg/m2, overweight was 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, obese was 30 to 34.9 kg/m2, and severely obese was 35 kg/m2 and higher.

Of 511 COVID-19 patients, 24% were obese, and 14% were severely obese. Obesity was tied to hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.91) and need for supplemental oxygen (aOR, 3.39). Over 3-quarters of COVID-19 cases occurred in overweight participants. Among outpatients, those who were severely obese had higher viral loads and greater peak anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations.

The researchers noted that the increased viral loads in obese outpatients were not observed in inpatients. "It is unknown whether this reflects antiviral drug use in inpatients or sampling of inpatient illness relatively later in their course of illness when viral loads may be expected to fall more precipitously," they wrote.

The study sample was 64.2% male, 62% were 18 to 44 years old, 51.5% were active-duty military, and 48.6% were dependents or retired military. Of all participants, 25% were hospitalized, ranging from 14% in normal or underweight patients to 52% in those with severe obesity.

Mechanisms likely multifactorial
--------------------------------
Average BMI was higher in inpatients than in outpatients and in those who required oxygen therapy than in those who didn't. As many as 35% of enrollees had one or more underlying illnesses, ranging from 25% in underweight or normal participants to 68% in those with severe obesity. The most common underlying diseases were high blood pressure (20.1%) and diabetes (12%), and both were increasingly common with higher obesity categories.

"In a population of MHS beneficiaries, obesity was strongly correlated with COVID-19 severity, viral load, and antibody response, suggesting the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity may be mediated by increased viral load in those with a higher body mass index," the authors concluded.

The researchers said the mechanisms behind the strong link between obesity and severe COVID-19 are probably multifactorial and may include impaired cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, and thrombotic function, amplified or dysregulated immune responses that lead to more viral replication and a greater inflammatory immune response, and higher levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which allow SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells.

Future COVID-19 studies should examine the role of inflammatory biomarkers and innate immunity (for example, natural killer cells, memory T cells) in obese patients, obesity-related insulin resistance, microbiome derangement, and mechanisms such as excess soft tissue in the upper respiratory tract that obstructs the airway, the authors concluded.

More antibodies not necessarily better
--------------------------------------
In an editorial in the same journal, authors from the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis said the study results raise questions that merit further study.

Such questions include whether differences in viral load and antibody production can be demonstrated in other populations, whether the more robust IgG response in obesity is related to greater viral exposure, and what the elevated viral load in obese outpatients means in terms of viral transmissibility. "If the viral load differences found in this study are also seen for emerging variants with higher transmission rates, such as the delta variant, the effect could be multiplicative," they wrote.

Another important question is whether higher anti-spike protein antibody levels in obese patients translate to better or more enduring immunity. "There is an open question about whether the antibodies produced by obese patients are as efficient at neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 compared to antibodies produced by non-obese patients," Lewis and colleagues said. "More does not necessarily mean better antibodies."

Overall, they wrote, the study's suggestion that obese patients have altered host-pathogen interactions is an important one. "Increasing our understanding of how obesity leads to more severe COVID-19 disease may shed some new light on mechanisms of anti-viral immunity, how metabolic diseases such as obesity influence immune system function, and potentially reveal approaches to identify patients most at risk of requiring hospitalization or more advanced care," they wrote.

Abstract
Background
The mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and COVID-19 severity remain unclear. After verifying that obesity was a correlate of severe COVID-19 in US Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries, we compared immunological and virological phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both obese and non-obese participants.

Methods
COVID-19-infected MHS beneficiaries were enrolled, and anthropometric, clinical, and demographic data were collected. We compared the SARS-CoV-2 peak IgG humoral response and RT-PCR viral load in obese and non-obese patients, stratified by hospitalization, utilizing logistic regression models.

Results
511 COVID-19 patients were analyzed, among whom 24% were obese and 14% severely-obese. Obesity was independently associated with hospitalization (aOR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.15-3.18) and need for oxygen therapy (aOR = 3.39, 95% CI = 1.61-7.11). In outpatients, severely-obese had a log10 (1.89) higher N1 genome equivalents (GE)/reaction and log10 (2.62) higher N2 GE/reaction than non-obese (p = 0.03 and p under 0.001, respectively). We noted a correlation between BMI and peak anti-spike protein IgG in inpatients and outpatients (coefficient = 5.48, p under 0.001).

Conclusions
Obesity is a strong correlate of COVID-19 severity in MHS beneficiaries. These findings offer new pathophysiological insights into the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 severity.

Discussion
Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, including higher levels of IL-6 [48, 49]. Investigation of inflammatory cytokine biomarkers (for example IL-6, TNF-α, CRP), adipokines, innate immunity such as natural killer cells, memory T cells, macrophages, and inflammasome signaling would allow us to understand complex pathophysiology of obesity and severe COVID-19 [48, 50]. Further studies are also needed to explore the role of obesity-associated insulin resistance and microbiome derangement in COVID-19 outcomes.

Other putative mechanisms that may explain the association between obesity and disease severity that were observed in this study could include excess soft tissue in the upper respiratory tract that results in obstruction of the airway [22], or decreased diaphragm contractility and poor pulmonary mechanics that result in hypoxia or contribute to type II respiratory failure which may complicate the outcomes of some severe COVID-19 cases [23]. Such physiological pathways are more challenging to measure but could drive future studies in this [48] and other populations at risk of COVID-19.

[4] Rapid tests
Date: Mon 2 Aug 2021
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/health-law-and-business/frequent-covid-tests-urged-to-help-curb-spread-of-delta-variant


The highly contagious delta variant has prompted some infectious disease physicians to call for ramped-up COVID-19 testing to prevent infected, vaccinated people from spreading the virus unknowingly.

"We need a lot more testing. And we need to think about how to scale up testing in an effective way," Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean and epidemiologist at Emory University, said. "Identifying people before they infect others, I think it's critically important."

CDC on [Fri 30 Jul 2021] released findings that people infected with the delta variant in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, carried similarly high loads of SARS-CoV-2, regardless of whether they were vaccinated. The agency revised its guidelines to recommend that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas of high or substantial transmission, and that they get tested 3 to 5 days after potential or suspected exposure to COVID-19. Some physicians say more frequent testing would be helpful even if they haven't had contact with an infectious person.

Denmark, the UK, Germany, and many other countries have distributed rapid home tests widely so their residents can know in 20 minutes or less whether they're infectious and should stay home, Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, said. "This has been the biggest missing component of our total strategy in the United States," he said.

Abbott Laboratories makes an at-home test called BinaxNOW that's easy to use and available at CVS, Walgreens, Amazon, and other major retailers. But at USD 24 for a 2-pack, Topol said it's too costly for people to use everyday to determine if they should go to school, work, or elsewhere. "That's a good test. It's just that it's ridiculously expensive," he said.

"In an ideal world, everyone would be testing multiple times a week until vaccination rates improve, but that is clearly not feasible and would be rejected by many on cultural/ideological grounds," said Christopher Brooke, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois, who supports CDC's new testing guidelines.

The first steps toward at-home COVID-19 testing in the US go back to May 2020, when the FDA authorized tests with the option of using home-collected saliva samples. The government should have picked some of the best tests and made hundreds of millions available, Topol said. "In January [2021]we didn't know there was going to be a delta. We should have assumed the worst. And now we were seeing that and we're not ready. We're caught flat footed," he said.

New guidelines
--------------
Testing in the US dropped dramatically in the spring as more people became vaccinated, according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker. But almost every state has seen an increase as the delta variant has led to surges, particularly in areas where the vaccination rate is low. Previously, CDC didn't recommend testing "if a fully vaccinated individual (assuming they are not a healthcare worker) remained asymptomatic after an exposure," Kimberly E Hanson, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Utah who co-authored the Infectious Diseases Society of America's testing guidelines, said in an email. Under the new recommendations, fully vaccinated people can still refrain from routine screening testing when feasible, she said. For the time being, vaccinated individuals probably only need to test if they have a known exposure, are symptomatic, or are going into a high-risk setting, Brooke said. "This is more important where virus is more prevalent but I can't provide a magic number in terms of case frequencies."

Del Rio said the frequency at which someone should get tested will depend on what someone is doing and their risk level. "If I'm going to go on vacation with my young kids who may have been out partying, I may decide before I go and spend time with them that maybe we'll get tested before we go," he said.

Not unusual
-----------
The COVID-19 vaccines were designed to protect against illness and death -- not infection -- so the possibility of vaccinated people getting the disease was well-known long before the delta variant arrived. Vaccinated people are less likely to get sick compared to those who are unvaccinated. Nearly all of the new hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people.

"This was an unexpected benefit and a bit of a surprise that they would work that well in the nose where the gradient between the serum and tissue is much higher," Barney S Graham, deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Vaccine Research Center, said at a recent National Academy of Sciences event. "So this is not an unusual thing for people to be infected after a vaccine designed to protect the lung," he said.

Before delta emerged, evidence clearly indicated that vaccinated people are much less likely to transmit COVID-19 if infected, Brooke said. But the latest CDC data suggests vaccination may be less effective at reducing viral shedding when delta is involved--meaning there's a greater risk vaccinated people may transmit the virus to others.

"What you're seeing now is as virus variants drift a little further away from the original strain, we are having some people who were vaccinated develop symptomatic infection. And what that means in almost every case is that they're developing the sniffles," Graham said.

Based on that, Brooke said it's "totally reasonable to recommend that vaccinated individuals get tested if they have been exposed and step up the use of [non-pharmaceutical interventions] such as mask wearing."

Testing recommendations are likely to change, however, depending on future variants and the prevalence of community spread. "Vaccination remains highly effective at preventing severe disease, hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 including with the delta variant," Hanson said. "However, the Cape Cod outbreak did show that it is possible for vaccinated individuals to develop symptomatic infection with the delta variant, after vaccination."

[Rapid testing before entering crowded events, schools, flights makes a lot of sense, especially now that asking for proof of vaccination clearly is not sufficient. Since the delta variant can be transmitted by both immunized and naive individuals, it is important for everyone to wear masks in indoor venues, but rapid tests in such circumstances where the virus can be rapidly spread would be even more effective. At USD 24 per test, this is not feasible, but according to Eric Topol, director and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif, countries such as Denmark and Germany have worked out how to facilitate rapid assays on a regular basis.
