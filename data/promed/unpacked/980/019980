No public health risk despite bird flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
There is no risk to public health, despite the outbreak of a bird flu case in Cork, the department of agriculture has said.

Latest test results show that the strain found last week [week of 26 Mar 2011] in samples from pheasants near to Clonakilty, are a low pathogenic version of the virus.

Experts had already ruled out the possibility that the birds had contracted the H5N1 strain of the disease.

A statement from the department read: "The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has announced that final laboratory test results confirm that the avian influenza virus found last week in samples from pheasants in a flock of game birds on a premises near Clonakilty in Cork are, as expected, a low pathogenic strain of the virus and there is no risk to public health as a result.

"In addition, laboratory results from a broiler flock in the same area tested negative for Avian Influenza indicating that the virus has not spread."

It is the 1st time bird flu has been detected in Ireland in 14 years.

[An earlier newswire, kindly forwarded by ProMED-mail reporter Mary Marshall (thanks Mary!), mentioned the identification of the AI virus involved in the pheasants' infection as a low-pathogenic H5 strain. Final, full definition of the neuraminidase (N) subtype involved is anticipated. As there is the risk of an H5 or H7 virus of low virulence becoming virulent by mutation, all H5 and H7 viruses have been identified as notifiable avian influenza (NAI) AI viruses. - Mod.AS]
