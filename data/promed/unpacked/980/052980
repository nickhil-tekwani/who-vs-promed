The Kasauli-based [Himachal Pradesh state, India] Central Research Institute (CRI) has scaled down its production of various anti-sera following strict animal protection laws. These have laid down specific norms for keeping horses, whose blood is used in the manufacture of these life-saving anti-sera, including adhering to specific dimension of cages for each animal. This has forced the institute to reduce its in-house horses number from the earlier 200 to about 90, thus adversely affecting the production of anti-sera which are much in demand.

Anti-serum is a product derived from blood of horse which can be used to activate the immune system of someone who has been exposed to a pathogen or toxin so that the immune system can eliminate it. Anti-sera are used as one line of defence in a treatment plan.

Other norms such as keeping horses of younger age and ensuring that these are not abandoned after they attain a certain age have also forced the institute to reduce its number. This has hit the manufacturing of anti-sera despite its overwhelming demand across the country.

Institute director Dr Sunil Gupta said since members of the ethics committee had pointed out that the animal enclosures should be in accordance with the norms laid down by the animal welfare board, the institute staff was forced to scale down the number of horses. He said the institute had manufactured 40 000 vials of anti-rabies serum, 12 000 vials of anti-venom serum and 3000 vials of diphtheria in the current fiscal [year?] while demand for more was pouring in.

The institute is also facing other problems such as shortage of staff, including veterinary officers. This is also acting as a handicap as, in the absence of a specialist, only limited animals could be taken care of. The institute has been supplying anti-sera to Haryana, Punjab, Delhi, Chandigarh as well as Himachal [Pradesh]. With the government hospitals failing to stock anti-sera, several patients who were bitten by a rabid dog in Solan [Himachal Pradesh state] a few days ago had to rush to the CRI to get [their] dose; and though the regional hospital did take 40 vials of the anti-serum later, officials feel it is insufficient to deal with the rising cases of dog bite, and accordingly hospitals should keep adequate stocks of this drug. This was a pointer towards its shortage in the government hospitals.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Omesh Kumar Bharti for drawing attention to this unfortunate situation, which among other things draws attention to travellers to the need to obtain protective vaccination prior to travel to the more rural regions of India.

Vaccines administered prior to rabies exposure to stimulate the body to produce its own protective rabies antiserum, are prepared from virus grown in in vitro cell cultures, purified and chemically inactivated to produce a non-infectious source of antigen. The preceding press report describes the production of anti-rabies serum in vivo in horses, which is being curtailed on the basis of cost and animal rights issues. The following extract from a WHO article puts the situation in perspective (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/09-021209/en/):

"Roughly 36 per cent of the world's rabies deaths occur in India each year, most of those when children come into contact with infected dogs. In collaboration with key partners, India's federal government is working with other countries to tackle the problem. Dr Rajendra Singh, a senior doctor at Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Disease Hospital in Delhi, India, knows a thing or 2 about despair. And regret. He sees it every day in the faces of the parents who bring their children to him for treatment. The children are infected with the rabies virus, and most of them arrive too late. 'Families come from far away,' says Singh. 'They don't know that past a certain point rabies is 100 per cent fatal. Once they learn the truth, their 1st reaction is to go into a state of denial. A week ago, we had a family who started waving currency notes. They wanted us to save their son at any cost.'

"Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans through the infected saliva of a range of animals. But most human deaths follow a bite by, or exposure to, an infected dog. Between 30 per cent and 60 per cent of the victims of dog bites are children under the age of 15 in countries where rabies is endemic. The Maharishi Valmiki is the only hospital in the city of Delhi that treats rabies patients, many of whom are poor and uneducated and most of whom are children and young people. Like Pinkish Kumar, a 5 year old from a Delhi slum, who was brought to the hospital complaining that he was unable to swallow water. Fear of water or hydrophobia is one of the disease's tell-tale symptoms. Pinkish had been bitten by a dog. He died 3 days later.

"World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for post-exposure treatment divide rabies exposure into 3 categories: category I -- and least serious -- when the victim has been touching or feeding infected animals, but shows no skin lesions; category II, when the victim has received minor scratches without bleeding or has been licked by an infected animal on broken skin; and category III, when the victim has received one or more bites, scratches or licks on broken skin or has had other contact with infected mucus.

"Exposure to bats, whatever the nature of the contact, falls under category III, and the victim is treated accordingly. Anti-rabies vaccine is recommended for category II and III, while anti-rabies immunoglobulin -- a liquid or freeze-dried preparation containing rabies antibodies extracted from plasma -- should be given for category III contact, or to people with weakened immune systems. Not only is rabies treatable if caught early enough: the virus carried by the dog population is also controllable. 'The basic principles of dog rabies control are relatively simple. It is necessary to vaccinate 70 per cent of the total dog population in a short period of time, maintain that immune coverage and protect the area from spillover through control of dog movement from affected adjacent areas,' says Dr Francois-Xavier Meslin, a team leader in WHO's department of neglected tropical diseases.

"Things become a little more complicated when the dog population gets out of hand, as is certainly the case in many parts of rural India. Estimates vary, but some put the Indian dog population as high as 25 million. Rounding up and vaccinating that many dogs is not just a technical challenge, it is a test of community spirit and, ultimately, political will. Says Meslin: 'The most important success factors are high-level political commitment, dedicated and knowledgeable national staff championing the project inside and outside the country and good community involvement.'

"Indeed, experts say that the main constraint to rabies elimination in India is the lack of coordination and the lack of a comprehensive national programme. They agree that since India shares borders with 6 countries that are all rabies endemic, it is essential that India's rabies control efforts are coordinated regionally. Other Asian countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, have made progress by taking a nationally coordinated approach, but there are signs of improvement in India.

"On the treatment front, where cost and efficacy have been issues in the past, India has moved away from nerve-tissue based vaccinations of the kind 1st developed by French 19th-century scientist Louis Pasteur to adopt modern cell-based vaccines. Nerve-tissue based vaccination required painful injections into the abdomen with a large bore needle, while cell-based vaccines are comparable to flu shots in terms of pain and side-effects. The federal government has also adopted national guidelines in favour of intradermal vaccination, where a smaller quantity of vaccine is injected into the outer layer of the skin and costs 60-80 percent less than the USD 40-50 paid for intramuscular vaccination. This is an important consideration in contexts where the cost of treatment is met in part -- if not fully -- by the patient. Eight out of India's 28 states and 7 federally administered Union Territories have announced plans to introduce intradermal regimens this year. Finally, according to government statistics, India is currently producing just under 15 million doses of human rabies vaccine and just over half a million vials of equine rabies immunoglobulin annually -- quantities that meet the national requirement.

"WHO/Patralekha ChatterjeeDelhi-based Sonadi Charitable Trust has joined the municipal campaign to help control the canine population by vaccinating and sterilizing dogs. Launched in collaboration with WHO, the pilot also aims to ensure that anti-rabies vaccines and anti-rabies serum are available and to boost the ability of hospitals and health centres to diagnose cases. A significant part of the pilot is close cooperation with the national animal husbandry department and partners in other sectors.

"'Over the past year, a core group of 1500 doctors and nurses has been trained,' says Dr Veena Mittal, joint director and head of the zoonosis division at the NCDC, adding that the NCDC is also working to ensure availability of vaccine and human rabies immunoglobulin in the pilot project areas. Mittal says that the NCDC is working closely with the municipal corporations of the 5 cities involved in the pilot project to strengthen their diagnostic capacities and to develop testing facilities for surveillance purposes. As a result, attendance at anti-rabies clinics and the use of immunoglobulin have both increased." - Mod.CP
