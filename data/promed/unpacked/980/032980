WHY WORRY ABOUT THESE DISEASES?
===============================

What do BSE, a prion disease of cattle, karnal bunt, a fungal disease of
wheat, and biological warfare (BW) have to do with each other?
No-one is claiming that either of those agricultural diseases have been
deliberately introduced into the UK or USA, respectively, but nevertheless
the economic impact on the British -- and European -- beef industry is
enormous, and the potential economic impact of the wheat disease on the US
and elsewhere, if it is not eradicated, could also be severe.

Consider also the the fact that in many developing countries, agriculture,
and even transportation, depends on horse, mule and donkey-power. Any
epidemic of an exotic disease killing equids in large numbers could have
drastic consequences for the economy.
The above illustrates why some primarily agricultural countries fear BW
attacks on their crops or livestock more than any direct threat to their
human populations.
This is mentioned in order to remind ProMED-mail readers of two things:
1) the threat of BW extends beyond anti-human agents; and
2) emerging diseases affecting livestock and staple foods are as much a
threat to human health as human pathogens.
These are two reasons why ProMED-mail extends its coverage to emerging
animal and plant diseases.
