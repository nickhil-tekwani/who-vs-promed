A range of pre-prepared Indian foods from the "Mrs Unis" brand have been recalled by the Food Standards Agency [FSA] following concerns over the Edinburgh-based company's procedures to control _Clostridium botulinum_- the bacterium which causes botulism.

The brand, headed by veteran businesswoman Shaheen Unis, dubbed "Scotland's curry queen", was ordered to withdraw a range of atmosphere packed' products, including 6 different types of pakora, from sale as a "precautionary measure". The FSA said that there was "not enough evidence" to show that the products are safe to eat, warning that the process controls at the company's factory at the Peffermill industrial estate, which provides foods for the retail, catering and wholesale market, were not effective in their ability to prevent the growth and toxin production of the bacterium.

"The effectiveness of process controls that could potentially affect the safety of modified atmosphere packed products produced by Mrs Unis Spicy Foods cannot be demonstrated satisfactorily," said The FSA. "The issue relates to ensuring sufficient controlling factors to prevent the growth and toxin production of the bacterium known as _Clostridium botulinum_. This may cause a serious form of food poisoning called botulism. There is not enough evidence to show that the products are safe. This means the company is recalling batches of its products as a precautionary measure."

Packs of Chicken Pakora Bites, Chicken Pakora Strips, and Chicken Tikka Bites, with a 'use by' date of 24 Mar 2015 have been recalled, along with Haggis, Onion and Vegetable Pakoras, as well as Onion Bhajis, with the same date. A further 3 products, a pack of 6 Vegetable Pakora, 6 Mini Onion Bhajees, and a Snack Pack -- all with the use by date of 8 Apr 2015 are also being recalled.

The FSA added: "Mrs Unis Spicy Foods has recalled all affected batches. Point-of-sale notices are being produced for businesses supplied with affected batches. No other Mrs Unis Spicy Foods products are known to be affected. Consumers are advised not to consume these products. Instead, any product should be returned to the store from where it was bought or should be disposed."

Ian Daglish, spokesman for Mrs Unis, said the company had since reduced sell-by dates on the products to 10 days from around 15 days as a precaution to ensure that bacteria is not allowed to grow. "When producing food for the public domain, you have to be very careful," he said. "So we are being cautious in recalling these products."

[The distribution range of the recalled food is not stated. Pakora, also called pakodi, is a south Asian fried snack originally from India that is called bhajee (or bhaji) in the south of the country.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
