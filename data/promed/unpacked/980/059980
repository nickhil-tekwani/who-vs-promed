[re: ProMED-mail Nematode infection - UK: (Wales) post transplant, fatal, RFI 20141116.2958314]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The pictures posted on the BBC were taken from previous case reports of _Halicephalobus gingivalis_ meningoencephalitis (Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2013; 88(6):1062-4; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/88/6/1062.long).

I have some questions regarding the case:

1. Are there any eggs visible in the tissue? _H. gingivalis_ replicates parthenogenetically [development of an egg without fertilization] and only female worms have been seen in invasive cases.

2. Which organs were involved? _H. gingivalis_ is a neurotropic nematode. Presence of eggs and rhabditoid larvae in the brain is quite suggestive. Morphologic features are well described by Anderson (Parasite. 1998; 5(3): 255-61; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9772725). Renal involvement has not been described in human cases of _H. gingivalis_ so far.

3. Is there any more information regarding the morphology of the nematode?
The filariform larvae (invasive) of _Strongyloides_ have a notched tail and without a rhabditoid oesophagus, in contrast to _H. gingivalis_.

4. Has a molecular test (LSU rDNA sequencing) been performed to confirm the case?

5. Has strongyloides serology been performed?
