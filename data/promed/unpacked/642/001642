A West Australian has been hospitalised with the rare, but life-threatening meningococcal disease, the Health Department has revealed. Authorities were alerted to the case on Friday [22 Apr 2022], only describing the patient as "an elderly person" who is infected with the disease's serogroup Y variant. It is the 5th confirmed infection of the disease -- which is fatal in about 5% to 10% of cases -- to be recorded in the State [Western Australia (WA)] so far this year [2022]. A total of 10 cases were reported in WA in 2021.

Meningococcal is an uncommon, life-threatening illness that is caused by a bacterial blood infection that can also line the spinal cord and brain. Health officials said the disease can also target a person's throat, lungs, and larger joints. It spreads from person to person in rare occasions and may cause severe symptoms including high fevers, nausea and body pains. The disease may inflict sufferers with long-term complications such as limb amputations, brain damage or hearing loss.

"The bacterium is present in droplets discharged from the nose and throat when coughing or sneezing but is not spread by saliva and does not survive more than a few seconds in the environment," a WA Health statement said. [False statement; see below. - Mod.ML]

"Meningococcal bacteria are carried harmlessly in the back of the nose and throat by about 10% to 20% of the population at any one time. Very rarely, the bacteria invade the bloodstream or tissues and cause serious infections. Sometimes -- but not always -- symptoms may be accompanied by the appearance of a spotty red-purple rash that looks like small bleeding points beneath the skin or bruises."

WA Health has renewed its calls for West Australians to check their vaccinations status for meningococcal.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans: there are no other animal reservoirs. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat in up to 5%-10% of a population without causing symptoms; the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. _N. meningitidis_ is spread from person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions, including saliva (e.g., coughing or kissing) (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/causes-transmission.html). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

Meningococci lose viability on desiccation in the environment, but survival in the environment has been reported for up to 168 hours on most surfaces, which raise the question of whether meningococci can be transferred from person to person indirectly via fomites contaminated with oropharyngeal secretions containing meningococci (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340262/).

IMD (meningitis and sepsis) is usually due to one of 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y). However, _Neisseria meningitidis_ shows considerable genetic diversity, owing to the ability of meningococci for transformation and horizontal gene exchange, presumably with co-colonizing strains in the human nasopharynx. Gene exchange can lead to constant diversification of meningococcal populations during clonal spread. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal complexes, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). Capsular switching can occur, leading a clone to change from one capsular polysaccharide serogroup to another. Capsular switching enables meningococci to escape from the host's immune defenses against the original serogroup.

IMD occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools, and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications -- for example, eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).

We are told that the serogroup Y caused IMD in the latest of the 5 patients that have occurred so far this year (2022) in Western Australia, but we are not told of the serogroups of the 4 other cases. If the serogroups differ, the cases are unlikely related to one another. However, the identification of meningococcal isolates with similar genetic markers but expressing different capsular polysaccharides in outbreaks of IMD has suggested that meningococcal clones can switch the type of capsule they express (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8990198/).

More information on this cluster of cases of IMD in Western Australia from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Western Australia, covering the entire western third of Australia, is mostly arid, with its population being concentrated in the fertile southwest corner and its capital, Perth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia). - Mod.ML
