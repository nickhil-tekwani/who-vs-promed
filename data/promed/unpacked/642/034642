Export Restrictions for Live Animals and Animal Products
------------------------------------------
This afternoon the European Commission brought into force a Decision which
restricts exports of live animals and animal products from the United
Kingdom to other Member States of the European Union.
At 11:00 tonight a UK statutory instrument will come into force which will
give effect to the Commission Decision. The full text of the UK statutory
instrument will be placed on this website tomorrow morning. But for now, we
present below a summary of the main points of the Commission Decision.
The Decision prohibits exports to other Member States of: live animals of
the porcine, bovine, ovine and caprine species, and other biungulates;
fresh meat of the porcine, bovine, ovine and caprine species, and other
biungulates, obtained on or after 1 Feb 2001; meat products of animals of
the porcine, bovine, ovine and caprine species, and other biungulates,
unless they meet certain specified conditions; milk, unless it has been
subjected to certain specified treatments; milk products produced on or
after 1 Feb 2001, unless it has been subjected to certain treatments;
semen, ova and embryos of the porcine, bovine, ovine and caprine species,
and other biungulates, with the exception of frozen bovine semen and
embryos produced before 1 Feb 2001; hides and skins of the porcine, bovine,
ovine and caprine species, and other biungulates, unless they were produced
before 1 Feb 2001, or conform to certain specified requirements; any other
animal products of the porcine, bovine, ovine and caprine species, and
other biungulates, unless they have been subjected to certain specified
heat treatments (excluding unprocessed sheep wool and ruminant hair which
is securely enclosed in packaging and dry).
Where the above refers to 'specified conditions' or some similar term, the
Commission Decision sets out additional certification requirements in order
for products to be traded. Full details of these conditions and the
certification requirements will be provided tomorrow.

British farmers are bracing themselves for yet another industry crisis
after the nation's first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 20 years.
The European Commission has banned all British milk, meat and livestock
exports following the discovery of an outbreak at an abattoir near
Brentwood, Essex, on Wednesday.
The commission says the situation required "reinforcing the control
measures" already taken by Britain and would be reviewed on 27 Feb 2001.
Authorities have surrounded 5 farms with 5-mile animal movement exclusion
areas in an effort to restrict the disease to the abattoir.
The government said a total of 300 pigs and 60 cattle had been killed at
the Cheale Meats slaughterhouse and an adjacent farm owned by the same
family. The other farms include one in Great Horwood, Buckinghamshire, one
in Freshwater Bay in the Isle of Wight, and another in Yorkshire after one
of the infected pigs was discovered to have been delivered from a market in
Selby. [there is a map on the web site above Restrictions were also
placed around a farm near Stroud, Gloucestershire, following another
suspected outbreak.
Officials said none of the animals involved had been imported into Britain.
Chief veterinary officer Jim Scudamore said investigators were working
tirelessly to identify where the disease started.
Although Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) can be passed from farm to farm
through the air, there is also the possibility the animals caught the
disease from one of the transporters used to make deliveries to the Essex
abattoir.
Mr Scudamore said the strain of the disease had been identified "type O,"
with tests suggesting it is similar to the strain which caused outbreaks in
Japan, Korea, Mongolia and Russia.
The United States, Ireland, and South Korea also banned pig imports from
Britain.
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said extra resources were being deployed to
act swiftly against the outbreak. He said all farmers who had no choice but
to slaughter livestock affected by the disease would be compensated at the
full market value for each animal. "I cannot promise that these measures
will not be prolonged," he said. "I apologise if what we appear to be doing
seems heavy-handed but it is absolutely essential."
The National Farmers' Union said the temporary ban on exports could be
disastrous for its members but it was a "necessary evil" to control the
disease. Mike Sheldon, owner of the Great Horwood farm, said news of the
disease was "devastating." "We have had veterinarians here throughout the
day inspecting our pigs and so far they have said there are no symptoms of
the disease among our animals," he said. "Although I am delighted so far
the outbreak seems not to have originated here, it is devastating news for
the abattoir in Essex and any pig farmers whose animals are suffering with
the disease. I feel extremely sorry for them."
Paul Cheale, director of Cheale Meats, where the outbreak was identified,
said the abattoir was "co-operating fully" with the UK Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).
The [UK's Food Standards Agency [FSA said the disease posed no threat to
food safety and the export ban was aimed at stamping out the spread of FMD.
A spokesman said: "The veterinary advice we have received is [that
transmission to humans is extremely rare, but may be possible if they are
in close physical contact with an infected animal. But the disease cannot
be caught by humans eating meat or drinking pasteurized milk."
This is the latest blow to Britain's beleaguered farmers, following last
year's outbreak of classical swine fever, which led to the slaughter of 12
000 pigs and a temporary ban on the export of live pigs and pig semen.
FMD is a highly infectious viral disease which can affect cattle, pigs,
sheep and goats, and is characterized by lameness and the development of
blisters in the mouth, causing increased salivation. Death is not usual but
animals cease gaining weight and production in dairy cattle falls.
The last major outbreak in Britain was in 1967, while the most recent
outbreak in the EU took place in Greece last year.

[Type O FMDv is found worldwide. It is clear from the latest report that
the subtype is known, and is a common one; more information is still needed.
It is unclear whether vesiculated animals have been found at all 4 sites.
Initially the sick animals were at the abattoir only and the 2 source herds
were unaffected. If that stands up, the animals would have been infected en
route, perhaps by sharing a contaminated, inadequately cleaned cattle truck.
If the former (i.e. dirty truck/lorry), there are other sick herds awaiting
discovery.
For those uninformed on this viral infection, pigs show fewer symptoms but
put out greater than 4 log units more virus than cattle. Therefore there
could be secondary cattle outbreaks. - Mods.MHJ/TG
