Queensland Health has sent letters to parents in a western Queensland
community about an outbreak of gastroenteritis.

The department's public health unit says a number of cases have been
reported in Barcaldine and Longreach, and it is believed they are
being caused by a virus.

Longreach Hospital medical superintendent Dr John Douyere says it is
highly infectious. "The recommendation is that children should not
return to school or day care facilities until they've recovered from
diarrhoea and vomiting for at least 48 hours," he said. "Children are
still infectious for some time after they are clinically better and
after they've stopped vomiting, so if we want to break the cycle of
this illness and stop the spread of it, it is one of the best
strategies that we can use. There's been a significant change in
gastroenteritis in children since the introduction of the rotavirus
vaccine. This particular current gastroenteritis that we are seeing is
thought to be not due to rotavirus. There are a number of other
viruses that can cause it. The public health team are currently
testing samples from people in Barcaldine."

[The apparent short duration of the symptoms of the gastroenteritis
experienced by the children suggests that the outbreaks are due to
norovirus infection. Infection by a rotavirus is less likely if
rotavirus vaccine is being administered in Queensland. However,
current rotavirus vaccines do not protect against all rotavirus
genotypes. Norovirus gastroenteritis is characterised by abrupt onset
and short duration of illness, and is, therefore, the likely
diagnosis. On the other hand, it might not be restricted to school
attendees, and families would be equally vulnerable. Information on
confirmation of the diagnosis would be welcomed.
