Ghana's Chief Director in the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Samuel K.
Dapaah, on Friday urged pig farmers to respect the ban on the movement,
slaughtering and sale of pigs following an outbreak of African swine fever
in Accra.
He said if farmers, traders and consumers of pigs did not comply with the
directives to contain the disease, it could wipe out 500 000 pigs in the
metropolis, at a cost of about 150 billion cedis (1 USD = 2589 C).
Dapaah told the GNA that steps should be taken so as not to lose everything
before action is taken. "The disease is as dreadful as AIDS is in human
beings and it spreads faster than AIDS."
Farmers at a news conference at which the ban was announced by the
Metropolitan Director of Food and Agriculture, Daniel Sackey, expressed
their distress at being restrained from selling their healthy-looking pigs.
The viral disease has reportedly killed 700 pigs in certain parts of the
city with an unspecified number infected.
Sackey asked farmers to report any infection to agricultural extension
agents, veterinary officers, district chief executives and assembly members
for prompt action to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The
first sign of the disease is the rise in the temperature of the animal from
38.5 or 39.5 to 40.5 or 42 degrees Celsius within 5 to 15 days.
The pigs stop eating, become listless with uncoordinated movements and
become paralyzed. Other signs are the change of the white-pink color to
dark blue, coughing, breathing with difficulty, diarrhea and discharges
from the eyes.
"The farmer gets to his stall to find 4 to 10 pigs dead to be followed
within 4 to 10 days with the death of all his pigs. The virus which is very
dangerous can be found in all fluids of the body," Sackey said.
Though the disease is not transferable to people, there can be mechanical
carriers and spread it to healthy pigs.
Cooked pork can harbor the virus for an hour, while frozen chops can keep
it for about 10 years, he added.
Sackey said the sick and dead pigs must be destroyed under the supervision
of veterinary staff and their stalls should be disinfected.
As to why the ban extends to healthy-looking pigs, experts explained some
affected animals may not show signs for a long time, but they can infect
others when they are moved around.
Punishment for defaulters under the Accra metropolitan assembly by-laws is
a fine of 200 000 cedis and the confiscation and destruction of the animals
involved.
Neighboring countries like Ivory Coast, Benin, Togo and Nigeria have
suffered great losses in the past few years, prompting the Food and
Agricultural Organization to initiate a project to prevent its spread to
Ghana last year.
In line with this, several education programs on good hygienic farm
practices were organized for farmers, whilst surveillance was mounted at
the country's entry points.
Scientists say they are still working to find a cure or drugs for
treatment, and vaccines.

[African sine fever (ASF) is a highly contagious hemorrhagic disease of
pigs that produces a wide range of clinical signs and lesions.
ASF virus is maintained in Africa by a natural cycle of transmission
between wart hogs (_Pacochoerus aethiopicus_) and the soft tick vector
(_Ornighodorus moubata_), which inhabits wart hog burrows and from which it
is unlikely ever to be eliminated.
The spread of virus from the wildlife reservoirs to domestic pigs can be
either by the bite of an infected soft tick or by ingestion of wart hog
tissues.
Virulent viruses produce acute disease, and all body fluids and tissues
contain large amounts of infectious virus form the onset of clinical
disease until death. Pigs infected with less virulent isolates can transmit
virus to susceptible pigs up to 1 month after infection; blood is
infectious up to 6 weeks, and transmission can occur if blood is shed.
Pigs usually become infected via the oronasal route by direct contact with
infected pigs or by ingestion of waste food containing unprocessed pig meat
or pig meat products. The primary route of infection is the upper
respiratory tract, and virus replicates in the tonsil and lymph nodes
draining the head and neck; generalized infection rapidly follows via the
bloodstream. High concentrations of virus are then present in all tissues.
The factors that produce the hemorrhagic lesions are not defined but the
severe disruptions to the blood clotting mechanism play a major role. Virus
is excreted mainly from the upper respiratory tract and is present in
secretions and excretions containing blood.
There is no treatment, all attempts to develop a vaccine have been
unsuccessful, thus far. Pigs that recover from the infection with less
virulent viral isolates are resistant to challenge with viruses of a
different genotype in the absence of neutralizing antibody.
All successful eradication programs have involved the rapid diagnosis,
slaughter, and disposal of all animals on infected premises. Zoosanitary
measures must be applied and include control of movement and treatment of
waste food. - Mod.TG
