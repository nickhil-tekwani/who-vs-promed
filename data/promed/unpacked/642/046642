On 6 Oct 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of the 1st confirmed autochthonous case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Spain. This case represents the 1st human-to-human transmission of EVD outside Africa.

The case is a female healthcare worker with no travel history to West Africa but who participated in the medical care of an EVD case in a Spanish citizen, who had been infected in Sierra Leone and evacuated to Madrid, Spain on 22 Sep 2014 and who died on 25 Sep 2014. She was in contact with the repatriated EVD case twice; on 24 and 25 Sep 2014. On both occasions she is reported to have worn appropriate personal protection equipment (PPE).

Following the Spanish national protocol for EVD cases, the healthcare worker was considered a low risk contact and monitored accordingly. The female case developed a fever on 29 Sep 2014 and was admitted into isolation on 6 Oct 2014 at Alcorcon Hospital in Madrid. The case was then transferred to La Paz-Carlos III Hospital in Madrid and is being treated under isolation. Samples were collected and sent for testing to the National Reference Laboratory on 6 Oct 2014. Results were positive for Ebola virus on the same day.

The Spanish public health authorities are conducting an investigation to elucidate the mode of transmission. Identification of close contacts for daily monitoring for 21 days after exposure is underway for the recent case and is continuing for contacts of the Spanish citizen who was treated in Spain.

As for all countries reporting EVD cases, future WHO updates on EVD in Spain will not be posted on the Disease Outbreak News. Further information will be available in WHO's Ebola situation reports which provide regular updates on the WHO response: http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions to be applied by countries except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. Contacts do not include properly protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.

3 more health workers quarantined in Spain
------------------------------------------
The health of a Spanish nurse with Ebola worsened on Thursday [9 Oct 2014] as one of the doctors who initially treated her at a local hospital said the protective suit he wore while attending her was ineffective. Dr Juan Manuel Parra complained that the protective suit he was given to treat [the nurse] had sleeves which were too short for him, leaving his bare skin exposed.

The health of [the nurse], the 1st person known to have caught Ebola outside of Africa, has deteriorated, according to the Madrid hospital where she is being treated....

Officials said that they would disinfect [her] home on Thursday [9 Oct 2014], a day after her dog Excalibur was removed from the property and put down as a precautionary measure, despite furious protests by animal rights activists.... -- more

[Sad comment. Exposed skin should always be covered, at least by tape. From another report, German Ramirez, the doctor attending her, said the nurse may have contracted the virus when she was taking off her protective equipment. He said he had spoken to her several times and she had suggested she may have touched her face with her gloves while taking off her protective suit. He added that health professionals were supervised whenever they were taking off or putting on their protective equipment. What does her supervisor say? - Mod.JW]

Australian nurse, returning from Sierra Leone, tested for Ebola
---------------------------------------------------------------
An Australian nurse who worked for the International Red Cross in Sierra Leone treating patients suffering from Ebola has developed a fever and been admitted to a hospital in Cairns, in northeast Australia. The chief health officer for the state of Queensland, Dr. Jeannette Young, said on Thursday [9 Oct 2014] that the woman had returned over the weekend from a month of work in Sierra Leone. She landed in Brisbane, the state's capital and most populous city, and then traveled to her home in Cairns. "Importantly, she has reported that while in Sierra Leone strict personal protective equipment, or PPE, procedures were followed at all times and were not breached at any stage," Dr. Young said in a statement issued by the state government's Health Department.... -- more

[4] Canada: Ebola screening on arrival
Date: Thu 9 Oct 2014
From: Ronald K. St. John, MD, MPH <ronaldstjohn@gmail.com> [edited]


Today, 9 Oct 2014, Health Canada announced that it would increase screening measures at unspecified points of entry to identify travellers who might be bringing Ebola from the affected West African countries. Other than targeted temperature screens, the details of these measures are not revealed.

However, one can guess what they might be since there are only 3 screening measures that can be implemented at a point of entry.
- 1st, a questionnaire about any symptoms and their country of origin can be mandatory for arriving passengers.
- 2nd, a so-called thermal scanning machine can be installed to try to detect arriving passengers who might have a fever.
- 3rd, someone like an authorized quarantine officer can assess any passenger who is actually ill on arrival on the spot. (This measure had been in place in Canada since the SARS epidemic.)

Here is the challenge. We will try to find a few people who might have Ebola among the huge number of people entering Canada by air alone. How big is this number? According to Statistics Canada, in July this year [2014] there were 2.6 million passengers arriving on Air Canada and Westjet across the country. In June, the number was 2.3 million; in other words, a very large number of people month after month come to Canada (http://www.statcan.gc.ca). At Toronto [Ontario]'s Pearson Airport, there are approximately 86 000 passengers in and out of this airport every day (http://www.torontopearson.com/en/Airport_Fact). Finding that one infected person among all these people is the proverbial "needle in a haystack."

Memories are sometimes short. We have already tried this in Canada during SARS in 2003. Here are the data:

- A questionnaire with 3 questions was mandatory for all incoming passengers. A total of 678 000 questionnaires were filled out, and 2478 people answered yes to one or more of the questions. A specially trained nurse referred each one of these people for in-depth questioning and temperature measurement. The result? None of the 2478 people had SARS.
- Thermal scanning machines were installed in the 6 major airports that handle approximately 94-96 percent of all international arrivals. The results from the Toronto and Vancouver airports? Among the 468 000 people who were screened, 95 were referred to a nurse for further assessment. None of these people actually had an elevated temperature, and all were cleared.

The total cost for implementing these procedures was approximately CAD 17 million [about USD 15.2 million] over a period of approximately 9 months.

What are the take away messages from the SARS experience?

1. Finding the "needle in the haystack" is very difficult. There is a mathematical/epidemiological reason why this is so. Suffice it to say that a passenger with Ebola who arrives in Canada will be a rare event, and the screening measures that are available will not detect it.
2. Screening incoming passengers for an infectious disease is very costly given the limited measures available.
3. Passengers can be perfectly well on arrival but be incubating an infectious disease. Such was the case with the Ebola-infected man in Texas [USA]. The available measures will not detect someone who is incubating the illness.
4. Since border screening is ineffective, we need to recognize that the point of entry for a dangerous infectious disease will be a Canadian hospital. This is where a person who becomes ill after arrival will go for treatment. This is where appropriate screening must take place to identify anyone with a serious infectious disease.
5. Screening at the point of departure (exit screening) in the affected countries is likely to be more effective and less costly than screening of passengers at point of entry (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Ebola-Sierra%20Leone-Liberia-Guinea-Nigeria-23-09-2014-rapid-risk-assessment.pdf).

[Re: "Screening at the point of departure (exit screening) in the affected countries is likely to be more effective and less costly...." Only if supervised (by internationals). Need to check batteries of scanners and query low readings, ambient temperatures, etc. No way to detect if the traveller has taken a febrifuge. Could check hand baggage for opened containers or foil strips of aspirin etc. -- but not foolproof.

On the other hand, public health can't trust arriving passenger contact declarations of addresses/phone numbers and promises to self-test temperatures twice a day for 21 days -- even with a strong incentive to turn oneself in to get early treatment (improving survival rate) because of implications for quarantine of family, etc. - Mod.JW]

[Reply by Ron:]
I agree fully with your comments. During SARS, we discussed the very pitfalls you list. In fact, I was totally surprised that anyone ever answered "yes" to our questionnaire since it meant considerable loss of time in a "secondary assessment". If they had known this, then they might have taken some Tylenol and answered "no" to everything, as you point out. Then there was the expense of translation since we targeted flights from Asia, and on and on with a huge amount of logistical details. I had some interesting discussions with airport managers regarding thermal scanners!

Your commentary will clearly reinforce what we know. You just can't stop ID at the borders, unless you stop all airlines. Remember 9/11? Within hours of the event, both Canada and the USA closed their air space with huge logistic and economic problems. I had to help 45 000 Americans who got stranded in the eastern provinces when their planes had to land somewhere. Just not feasible to do this kind of thing anymore.

[5] USA: airport cleaners strike

Ebola scare: LaGuardia on strike, 58 percent of Americans want to ban flights from W. Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Airplane cabin cleaning crews at New York's LaGuardia International Airport began a 24-hour strike on Wednesday [8 Oct 2014], citing, in part, possible exposure to the Ebola virus. Meanwhile, a poll found most Americans want flights banned from Ebola-ravaged areas.

Around 200 Air Serv employees who work on domestic flights to LaGuardia began their strike on Wednesday evening. The group is seeking to unionize, and they said health and safety issues on the job -- including exposure to blood, feces, and vomit without protective gear -- are the main reasons. They are also concerned about possible exposure to the Ebola virus, which claimed its 1st victim in the United States on Wednesday. Cabin cleaners per plane at LaGuardia have been reduced by up to half, and the time to clean planes has been cut down to as little as 5 minutes, workers said, as reported by CBS New York....

A new poll found a majority of Americans want flights banned from West African nations, where the latest Ebola outbreak is centered. 58 percent of Americans supported the flight ban, according to a poll conducted in a collaboration between NBC News and SurveyMonkey; 20 percent of respondents did not support a travel ban from the likes of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. As of earlier this week, neither the World Health Organization nor the White House endorsed an all-out travel ban to the US from affected nations.... -- more
