The feed poisoning in blue foxes in Finland was caused by botulinum toxin.
The type of toxin will be confirmed by additional tests in few days.
Currently feed and feed stuffs are being tested in order to identify which
ones contain the toxin.
An estimated 50 000 blue foxes in about 60 farms were affected in this
outbreak [with about 25% mortality according to the previous post -- see
ref. below. - Mod.JW].
This is the first case of botulism in blue foxes in Finland.

and typing of the causative botulism toxin in this major outbreak will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
