[Ref: L Perez-Vicente et al: First report of Asian rust of soybean
caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ in Cuba. BSPP New Disease Reports,
vol. 20: September 2009-January 2010]

Soybean (_Glycine max_) is of increasing importance in Cuban
agriculture. Two species of rust attacking soybean, _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_ and _P. meibomiae_, have been identified elsewhere. A
severe _Phakopsora_ sp. rust outbreak in soybean occurred in September
2006, and since then, minor outbreaks in legumes and beans (_Phaseolus
vulgaris_) have also occurred. In April 2009, a severe rust outbreak
in soybean developed, leading to the complete defoliation of 2 50 ha
fields in Matanzas province.

First symptoms in the field consisted of yellowing of the lower leaves
of plants leading to defoliation and early maturation (Fig. 1A, B).
Symptoms on the upper side of leaves consisted of yellow spots that
turned brown then necrotic, surrounded by wide yellow areas (Fig. 2A,
B). Uredinia developed on the undersides of the leaves. Paraphyses
were cylindrical to clavate and uredinospores sessile (Fig. 3A, B).

A positive reaction was obtained when sap from rust-affected leaves
was tested with a specific antibody to _P. pachyrhizi_. Real-time PCR
was conducted for the diagnosis of each species. The results confirmed
the presence of both _P. pachyrhizi_ and _P. meibomiae_ causing mixed
infections within the same plant, although higher concentrations of
DNA of _P. pachyrhizi_ were noted, presumably due to the faster
growing and more aggressive nature of this species. _P. meibomiae_ was
previously reported in Cuba in 1926, but there were no further records
of its presence in soybeans and other legumes since this time.

This is the 1st report of _P. pachyrhizi_ attacking soybeans in Cuba
and the confirmation by advanced diagnostic procedures of the presence
of _P. meibomiae_.

[Leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ can result in yield losses of soybean crops of
up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia and Africa and spreading in
the Americas, but data are lacking on its establishment in Europe.
Besides soybean, over 30 other species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can
also be affected and may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Spores are spread locally by splashing rain, or by wind over long
distances. Several epidemic cycles may occur in one cropping season.
Fungicides may be used in disease management, but timing of
applications is considered important. Partially resistant soybean
lines are available. However, new fungal strains with increased
virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging.

While the related species _P. meibomiae_ is also found in South
America and the Caribbean causing similar symptoms, this species is
less virulent and considered of lesser economic significance.
