[1] Indonesia: homegrown vaccine
Date: Wed 9 Feb 2022
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/9/indonesia-starts-testing-homegrown-covid-vaccine-on-humans


Indonesia has begun testing a homegrown COVID-19 vaccine on humans after getting the green light from the drug regulator, as the country faces a rising wave of cases. Research on the "Merah Putih" ("Red White") vaccine -- named after the colors of the Indonesian national flag -- is led by Airlangga University and Biotis Pharmaceutical Indonesia. The project has suffered delays since starting in 2020, but authorities are now hoping to authorize its use by the middle of 2022 if the trials are successful.

Health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said the drug, set to be rolled out in the latter stages of Indonesia's vaccination campaign, could be donated to other nations, as a booster jab or as a vaccine for children aged 3 to 6. "I have discussed this matter with the president and he has agreed to use this vaccine as a donation to countries in need," Sadikin said on [Wed 9 Feb 2022] at a launch event for the human trials in Surabaya.

The 1st and 2nd phases of the clinical trials will involve 90 and 405 adult volunteers respectively.

The Merah Putih vaccine has been granted a "halal" certification from the Indonesian Ulema Council, the Muslim majority nation's top religious clerical body, according to the dean of Airlangga University Mohammad Nasih. "We hope with this halal certification, the public confidence to use this vaccine will be higher," Nasih told reporters.

Indonesia has approved 13 vaccines and boosters but has primarily used the Chinese-made jabs, and has struggled to procure enough doses for its population of more than 270 million people. The Indonesian government has stressed the importance of developing and manufacturing national vaccines since the beginning of the pandemic.

Indonesia was ravaged by COVID-19 in July last year [2021] as the delta variant swept the country. Daily cases declined significantly at the end of the year [2021] but the spread of omicron recently brought the country back to 30 000 confirmed cases a day.

In total, South East Asia's largest economy has reported more than 4.5 million confirmed cases with nearly 145 000 deaths. Vaccination rollout is also relatively slow with about 48% of the population vaccinated with 2 jabs and only 5 million with a booster shot.

[According to https://www.bernama.com/en/general/news_covid-19.php?id=1994184, the vaccine -- based on inactivated virus -- has already been tested in genetically engineered mice and is now being tested in monkeys.

"Indonesia will soon start human clinical trials of its home-grown COVID-19 vaccine Merah Putih, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported according to the Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM). Jointly being developed by Airlangga University (Unair) and PT Biotis Pharmaceutical Indonesia, the vaccine has been given the go-ahead by BPOM for further development and clinical trials. Speaking at a press conference on Wed 9 Feb 2022, the head of BPOM Penny K Lukito said among the 6 domestic institutions and universities participating in developing the Merah Putih vaccine, Airlangga University (Unair) has made the most progress. After undergoing pre-clinical testing on genetically modified mice, the inactivated virus vaccine is currently undergoing testing on monkeys.

"Penny pledged that BPOM will continue to support and monitor Unair and PT Biotis Pharmaceuticals Indonesia so that the vaccine is produced in accordance with international standards."]

[2] Case numbers and more

Global COVID cases top 400 million as levels decline again
----------------------------------------------------------
The global COVID-19 total has passed the 400 million mark early into the 3rd year of the pandemic, with cases last week declining in the world's 4th and biggest surge, fueled by the more transmissible omicron variant.

However, deaths--known to be a lagging indicator--continue to rise, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [Tue 8 Feb 2022] in its latest weekly update on the pandemic. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---8-february-2022]

Dramatic jump in Middle East
----------------------------
Cases declined 17% last week compared with the week before, with the world adding 19 million new cases. The only part of the world where cases are still rising is WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region, where the biggest jumps were reported by Iran, Jordan, and the Palestinian Territory.

At a briefing today [Wed 9 Feb 2022], the head of the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region office, Ahmed Al-Mandhari, said cases in the region have dramatically jumped over the past 6 weeks, with deaths rising over the past 3 weeks. [http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/who-regional-directors-statement-on-covid-9-february-2022.html] He added that the rise in deaths is lower than in previous waves and that vaccines are providing protection against severe illness and death. About 35% of people in the region are fully vaccinated, but coverage varies widely among countries, ranging from 1% -- 94%. "Once again, inequity is a hallmark of this pandemic," he said. "And while vaccines remain a critical tool, our success requires a comprehensive approach with governments and communities at the heart of the response."

The world's rise in deaths--up 7% last week--was driven mainly by increases in South East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with levels holding steady in other parts of the world.

Japan restrictions, ACT Accelerator, global pandemic agreement
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Japan today announced that it would extend COVID-19 restrictions in Tokyo and 12 prefectures for 3 more weeks to battle its omicron surge, which has led to record cases and deaths, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-extend-virus-quasi-emergency-13-regions-until-march-6-nhk-2022-02-09/]

- World leaders today launched a campaign to address a USD 16 billion funding gap for the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, an effort led by WHO and its partners to develop and more equitably share COVID-19 tools, including tests, treatments, and vaccines. The push also includes USD 6.8 billion to help countries take steps to end the pandemic, such as further rollout of vaccines and testing.

- The European Union is pressing a global agreement to prevent a new pandemic, with steps such as banning wildlife markets and countries receiving new incentives for reporting new viruses or variants, according to Reuters. Negotiators began meeting today, with a preliminary agreement expected in August [2022].

[The report from Reuters that "The European Union is pressing a global agreement to prevent a new pandemic, with steps such as banning wildlife markets and countries receiving new incentives for reporting new viruses or variants" is very welcome news for many reasons. Preventing dissemination of pathogens infecting wildlife is certainly at the top of the list, but equally important is wildlife conservation and preservation of species, as well as humane treatment of animals. - Mod.LK]

[3] Proposed EU global agreement
Date: Wed 9 Feb 2022

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/exclusive-eu-wants-pandemic-treaty-ban-wildlife-markets-reward-virus-detection-2022-02-09/


International negotiators will meet for the first time on [Wed 9 Feb 2022] to prepare talks for a potential treaty, said an official, who is not authorized to speak to media and so declined to be named. The aim is to reach a preliminary agreement by August [2022].

However, Brussels has so far struggled to get full backing for a new treaty from the United States and other major countries, some of which want any agreement to be non-binding. A spokesperson for Charles Michel, the president of the European Council who in November 2020 proposed a new treaty on pandemics, said he had no fresh comment on the matter. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to the most widely accepted theory, the COVID-19 pandemic began with the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from an animal to humans in a wildlife market in China. Although Beijing was initially praised by WHO for notifying it quickly of the new virus, the United States in particular has accused China of holding back information about the likely origins of the outbreak.

Among measures the EU wants to be included in the treaty is a gradual shutdown of wildlife markets, the EU official said. The European Commission, that is expected to negotiate on behalf of EU states, said that its mandate had not been agreed yet by EU governments and concrete proposals to other international negotiators will be made at a later stage. The EU wants to introduce legally-binding obligations to prevent and report new virus outbreaks, the EU's draft negotiating mandate seen by Reuters says, without spelling out precise proposals. Incentives for countries to report new viruses are also seen as crucial to help with speedy detection and avoid cover-ups, the official said.

Last year [2021], southern African nations were hit with punishing flight restrictions after they identified the omicron coronavirus variant, which some fear could deter reporting of future outbreaks if incentives are not attractive enough.

Vaccines for virus alerts
-----------------------
The official said incentives could include guaranteed access to medicines and vaccines developed against new viruses, which poorer nations have struggled to obtain quickly during the COVID-19 pandemic as wealthier states rushed to secure supplies. States that detect and report a new virus could also receive immediate support, which might involve shipments of medical equipment from a global stockpile.

Talks will be chaired by delegates from 6 countries, representing the world's main regions - Japan, the Netherlands, Brazil, South Africa, Egypt and Thailand, officials said.

Brazil, which will represent northern and southern American countries, favors a non-binding treaty. If an agreement is reached, the treaty is expected to be signed in [May 2024].

As part of an overhaul of global health rules, countries are also negotiating tweaks to the International Health Regulations, a set of global rules to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The United States wants to strengthen rules to boost transparency and grant WHO quick access to outbreak sites, 2 sources following the discussions told Reuters.

[4] CDC: mask guidance
Date: Wed 9 Feb 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/02/cdc-head-says-covid-19-mask-guidance-stands-now


CDC head says COVID-19 mask guidance stands, for now
----------------------------------------------------
Today, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency is working on updating and evaluating its mask guidance, but said COVID-19 transmission and hospitalization rates were still high throughout the [United States], and the recommendation of masking in indoor settings regardless of vaccination status remains in place. "We are working on that guidance. We are working on following the trends for the moment," she said during a White Hour press briefing. "We are encouraged by current trends, but we are not there yet."

Massachusetts, NY drop mask mandates
------------------------------------

Today [Wed 9 Feb 2022], Massachusetts and New York state joined other blue states (inclined to vote Democrat) in the north east in announcing they would let mask mandates in indoor settings (New York) and schools (Massachusetts) expire in the coming weeks. Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker said he would let the state's school mask requirement expire on [Mon 28 Feb 2022].

New York governor Kathy Hochul said mandates on both masks and vaccine requirements in businesses would expire tomorrow. "Numbers are coming down, and it is time to adapt," she said. Hochul said for now there will be no changes to New York's mask requirements in schools, and officials in Los Angeles County said yesterday [Tue 8 Feb 2022] that they also have no immediate plans to drop their school mask mandate, ABC News reports. [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id=82716467#82757106]

But according to current guidance from CDC, people in more than 3200 US counties, or 99% of the country, should still be wearing masks indoors regardless of their vaccination status, NBC News reports.

[CDC issued its latest masking guidance in July 2021 during the delta variant surge. The guidance has remained since then, and CDC's director, Dr Rochelle Walensky, said last week that hospitalization and death rates were key factors in the continuing recommendations. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/states-are-beginning-lift-mask-mandates-cdc-data-suggests-it-n1288792

It seems like it is time to reassess mask guidance since the world is now dealing with the omicron variants rather than delta and it is 8 months since the guidance currently in effect was issued. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 50 countries -- The Netherlands (466 915), the USA (268 200), Germany (238 410), France (235 267), Brazil (183 533), Russia (183 103), Turkey (108 563), Japan (97 946), Italy (81 669), UK (67 316), India (67 070), Spain (62 839), The Denmark (51 858), South Korea (49 567), Poland (46 872), Israel (29 955), Switzerland (28 963), Iran (39 085), Ukraine (38 257), Czech Republic (37 777), Romania (36 269), Chile (34 253), Portugal (34 023), Romania (27 346), Argentina (27 252), Austria (38 309), Australia (13 781), Indonesia (46 843), Austria (27 087), Georgia (25 161), Norway (25 086), Mexico (24 898), Poland (24 404), Vietnam (23 956), Ukraine (23 778), Jordan (21 977), Vietnam (21 909), Peru (21 057), Slovakia (20 582), Greece (19 616), Belgium (19 057), Sweden (18 182), Malaysia (17 134), Thailand (14 822), Hungary (13 932), Serbia (12 532), Lithuania(11 983), Latvia (11 835), Canada (11 509), and Singapore (10 314) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 13 833 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 7 Feb 2022 to late 8 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 90 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 90 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 14 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 18.6%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 37.2% decrease in daily reported cases and a 3.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 3.11 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours, with cumulative reports now exceeding 403.65 million cases and 5.79 million deaths. Despite some decrease in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
