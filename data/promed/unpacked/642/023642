A possible fatal case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in Bariloche [Rio Negro province] is being investigated. A 35-year-old man died yesterday [19 Mar 2014] in a private medical care center in the city. Because of the clinical picture he presented, it is suspected that he died of [a] hantavirus [infection; hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. Information about results of tests on is awaited from the Malbran Institute on the samples sent to confirm or discard the hypothesis [tentative diagnosis].

The young man came to the Sanatorio San Carlos this past Monday [17 Mar 2014] with a worrisome symptom of fever, for which the medical group decided that he should be admitted. Finally, he died yesterday afternoon [19 Mar 2014].

The epidemiology area of the zone hospital informed ANB that they became aware of the situation on Tuesday [18 Mar 2014]. They reported that hospital personnel when to the medical care center where the young man was to "carry out pertinent evaluations."

The Sanatorio San Carlos confirmed the death and ratified the suspicion that this was a case of hantavirus [pulmonary synbdrome]. Given this, they await the results of the tests done on the samples that were sent to the Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires. This information, that will confirm or discard the presumed diagnosis, will be available in about 15 days, according to their statement.

The victim lived in Bariloche but apparently had been camping in past days in the El Manso area, so one of the possibilities is that he was infected there. Nonetheless, hospital [staff] remarked that if the hypothesis [tentative diagnosis] is confirmed, they will deepen their inquires in order to establish if risk factors such as the presence of rodents exist in his home or in places that he frequented.

[There have been sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the western Argentine provinces along the Andes Mountains. Although the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this region have not been specified, it most likely is Andes virus. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio/oligoryzomys_longicaudatus.jpg.
