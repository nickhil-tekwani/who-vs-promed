Second Horse Confirmed West Nile Virus-positive; 4 More Under Test
------------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Bob Odom confirmed on Tue 18 Sep
2001 that a second horse in Vermilion Parish had tested positive for
West Nile virus. It's the fourth known case of West Nile virus in
Louisiana. The first case was diagnosed in a dead blue jay found near
Kenner in Jefferson Parish. The second was discovered 2 weeks ago in a
horse in Vermilion Parish, and the third was a crow found in Metairie,
also in Jefferson Parish.
Within the past 5 days, 3 other Southern states, Tennessee, North
Carolina and Mississippi, have confirmed their first known cases of
West Nile virus.
According to the Odom, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and
Forestry is waiting for results on an additional 4 horses tested for
West Nile virus. Two of the horses are in Vermilion Parish, one is in
Iberia Parish, and the other is in Evangeline Parish.
"We are continuing our efforts to inform horse owners that West Nile
virus is here in the state, and the only way they can protect their
horses is by vaccinating," Odom said. Earlier this month, some horse
owners complained there was not enough vaccine available, or their
veterinarian had run out. Odom said more vaccine should be available
soon from the manufacturer. State Veterinarian Maxwell Lea said high
demand and current conditions for air shipping play a big role in
vaccine availability.
