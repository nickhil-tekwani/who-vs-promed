The veterinary profession is being urged to be on red alert for rabbit viral haemorrhagic disease (RVHD) type 2 after an outbreak killed 6 rabbits.

Tameside Veterinary Clinic in Ashton-under-Lyne is calling for owners to vaccinate their pets against the virulent strain of RVHD after 5 rabbits died and a 6th had to be euthanised.

The latest victims belonged to Pennine Pen Animal Rescue in Oldham, where staff have been left "devastated" from the death of 6 out of 10 rabbits.

Often symptomless, the disease has killed hundreds of rabbits across the UK and can spread by direct contact with infected wild rabbits, or indirectly via urine or faeces found in hay and straw bedding.

Tameside senior vet Loren Shearing has vaccinated the surviving 4 rabbits at Pennine Pen Animal Rescue. Dr Shearing said: "One of the rabbits at the charity died then, 2 days later, one more died and had haemorrhaged from its rectum, which raised suspicions. Another 3 died and, when I went to vaccinate them, another looked very unwell, so we euthanised it. The others were all fine and lively before a sudden death. The rabbit pen is closed off and members of the public can't handle the rabbits, so the only thing we can link it to is hay bales from a local farm, which could have urine or faeces in from an infected rabbit."

Dr Shearing added: "RVHD2 is a silent killer and can be very distressing for owners who find their pets have died suddenly for no apparent reason."

"It is extremely important rabbit owners have their pets vaccinated annually against RVHD and myxomatosis before a second vaccination to combat RVHD2."

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways:
- Rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations.
- Death from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically, this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective.
- Only following post-mortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths.
- In mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the UK.
- Although RHD-2 is less virulent than RHD-1, its difficult early diagnosis means it is more challenging given rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period of time without any visible signs of infection. Hence diagnosis of RHD-2 presents a new challenge for the UK.

RHD-2 is a genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1 , and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.
