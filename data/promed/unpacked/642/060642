Successful Treatment of Acute Hepatitis C Virus
-----------------------------------------------
[Because of its potential clinical implications, the following paper has
been published online early. It will appear in the 15 Nov 2001 issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine under the title: Treatment of Acute
Hepatitis C with Interferon Alfa-2b, by Elmar Jaeckel, M.D., Markus
Cornberg, M.D., Heiner Wedemeyer, M.D., Teresa Santantonio, M.D., Julika
Mayer, M.D., Myrga Zankel, D.V.M., Giuseppe Pastore, M.D., Manfred
Dietrich, M.D., Christian Trautwein, M.D., Michael P. Manns, M.D., and the
German Acute Hepatitis C Therapy Group. The Abstract of this paper is
reproduced below. - Mod.CP
Background: In people who are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV)
chronic infection often develops and is difficult to eradicate. We sought
to determine whether treatment during the acute phase could prevent the
development of chronic infection.
Methods: Between 1998 and 2001, we identified 44 patients throughout
Germany who had acute hepatitis C. Patients received 5 million U of
interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously daily for 4 weeks and then 3 times per
week for another 20 weeks. Serum HCV RNA levels were measured before and
during therapy and 24 weeks after the end of therapy.
Results: The mean age of the 44 patients was 36 years; 25 were women. A
total of 9 became infected with HCV through intravenous drug use, 14
through a needle-stick injury, 7 through medical procedures, and 10 through
sexual contact; the mode of infection could not be determined in 4. The
average time from infection to the first signs or symptoms of hepatitis was
54 days, and the average time from infection until the start of therapy was
89 days. At the end of both therapy and follow-up, 42 of the 43 patients
who have completed follow-up (98 percent) had undetectable levels of HCV
RNA in serum and normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels. Levels of
HCV RNA became undetectable after an average of 3.2 weeks of treatment.
Therapy was well tolerated in all but one patient, who stopped therapy
after 12 weeks because of side effects.
Conclusions: Treatment of acute hepatitis C with interferon alfa-2b
prevents chronic infection.

this rule exceptionally when rapid dissemination of information may
alleviate suffering, and ProMED-mail is happy to respond. - Mod.CP
