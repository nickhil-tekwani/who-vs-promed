U.S alerting thousands of possible hepatitis virus
The U.S. government has begun the first phase in notifying hundreds of
thousands of people who may have been accidentally infected with the
hepatitis C virus during blood transfusions. Letters will be mailed to
those who received transfusions from blood donors who have since tested
positive for the virus, which affects four million Americans.

People who received blood before June 1992, when the most reliable
screening test was instituted, are at risk. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne
viral infection that can lead to sometimes fatal chronic liver damage.
"I think we are very concerned about this disease. We think it truly
represents an epidemic," Surgeon General David Satcher told "ABC's Good
Morning America" Wednesday.
Satcher defended the government mass mailing that some experts think may
create unnecessary anxiety. "People deserve to know what we know in terms
of the risks if they've received blood from a person with hepatitis C.
Also, I think there are some things that we can do in terms of treatment,
even though we don't have a cure. The treatment is improving every day," he
said. "We have delayed doing this until, number one, we were fairly certain
about the accuracy of the test, and we did not want to falsely alarm
individuals and families," Satcher added.
Screening tests for the virus were implemented after 1990, greatly reducing
the risk of transfusion-borne viral transmission. Experts believe the
chance of such transmission today is between 1-in-10,000 and 1-in-100,000.
Last year, a government panel composed of liver experts and medical
ethicists estimated that 290,000 people may have contracted the potentially
serious liver infection during pre-1990 transfusions.
