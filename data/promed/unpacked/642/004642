Dear Colleagues,

Two articles published this past week explore the etiology of the ongoing outbreak of an emerging disease. They have underscored for me the importance of community and communication.

First recognized in Saudi Arabia last September (2012) and later named MERS-CoV (for Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus), the outbreak was caused by a novel coronavirus remarkably similar to the agent of SARS. While MERS-CoV has not traveled as rapidly or as widely as SARS did, the virus apparently can spread to ill patients in the hospital, and to close contacts like hospital staff and family members who were otherwise in good health. A detailed investigation of a healthcare-related MERS-CoV outbreak published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine determined the time it takes for a person to get sick after being exposed to the virus: a median of 5.2 days.

Also in the past week, researchers at the University of Bonn (Germany) Medical Center writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases suggest that the new coronavirus may have emerged and circulated unnoticed earlier than previously thought. Their genetic analysis indicates that the virus most likely first appeared in mid- 2011.

ProMED-mail first reported the novel coronavirus in early September 2012, publishing a message from a scientist -- and ProMED subscriber -- involved in what was then considered the 1st case. Since that 1st posting, ProMED has kept its readers informed through at least 83 updates and new reports. This is just one instance among thousands each year in which ProMED serves a vital role by providing a worldwide community of infectious disease practitioners with news, information, and analysis that can help readers prevent infections, illness, and fatalities. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, ProMED keeps you well informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other source covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. No other source provides it free of charge.

But why is ProMED free? The International Society for Infectious Disease (ISID) supports the service and makes it available without cost to ensure that news and information about emerging infectious diseases is disseminated as widely as possible. While many of the clinicians, scientists, and public health practitioners who use ProMED could afford to subscribe to this information resource, many could not. ISID is committed to making sure that everyone who needs ProMED can receive it without restriction. ProMED is published every day and every day a global network of infectious disease experts vets the news and information and provides insightful analysis and commentary. Providing this level and quality of service is expensive, however. Fully a third of ProMED-mail's annual budget must be covered through the generosity of its readers. If you are among those who are able to afford to support ProMED, please help keep ProMED unbiased, unfettered, and free. If you believe that communication and community among the world's infectious disease experts is important, please consider a donation to ProMED.

Based on currently available information, MERS-CoV seems to lead to death at a worrisomely high rate -- more than half of the confirmed cases have been fatal (40 deaths out of 77 laboratory confirmed infections). But, it is likely that mild cases have gone undetected and that the disease is not as deadly as it now appears. Just this past week there is evidence that there have been asymptomatic infections confirmed in Saudi Arabia (and reported on ProMED). As always, ProMED will communicate timely, accurate, and reliable information to help the global infectious disease community recognize, understand, and react to global outbreaks. I -- and many of your colleagues -- think this is important. That is why we've already given to support ProMED and ensure the free exchange of infectious disease news and information. Won't you please join us?

To those who have already given, thank you! To those who "keep meaning to give" -- please stop procrastinating! To those who assume it will take too long, I promise an online donation will take you less than 6 minutes. Finally, to those who think they can't afford it, please think again. Everybody's contribution, no matter how small, is important -- please help!


Sincerely,

Marjorie Pollack, MD
