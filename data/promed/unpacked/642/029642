Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) is one of the most economically important diseases of tomatoes. There are known to be 3 strains present on UK crops. Fruit infected with multiple strains of the virus experience more severe symptoms. As a result, steps must be taken to ensure, even where infection has already been confirmed, that no additional strains are brought in. Severe infections can have significant economic impact, with one nursery estimating that the disease caused around GBP 400 000 [about USD 516 300] of crop loss in 6 ha [about 15 acres] of the variety Piccolo.

Growers can help by following new biosecurity recommendations. Intensive cleanup, thorough composting of crop debris and a review of source waters will significantly reduce the chances of the virus being viable. The risk from root pieces in the soil appears to be very small.

Gracie Emeny, AHDB [Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board], said, "The molecular assays refined in [AHDB funded] research allowed the discrimination between strains in order to increase understanding of symptom severity and further examine disease persistence, leading to important control methods for growers."

[_Pepino mosaic virus_ (PepMV, genus _Potexvirus_) was first identified on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in South America. It is spreading in the Americas and Europe and has also been reported from a few locations in Asia and Africa. PepMV can also infect potato and aubergine (eggplant), but serious symptoms appear to occur only in tomato. Symptoms may include blotches and scarification on fruit, as well as mottling, distortion, and necrosis on leaves and young shoots. The virus can cause significant economic losses, especially in glasshouse tomatoes, due mainly to reduction of fruit quality. PepMV has been added to the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

PepMV spreads very rapidly and is highly contagious. Specific insect vectors have not been identified. The virus is transmitted by mechanical means (including contaminated tools, human and insect activities, plant-to-plant contact), grafting, and with infected plant material (including insufficiently cleaned seed batches containing contaminated plant debris). True seed transmission (that is, via the embryo rather than the seed coat) is uncommon in potexviruses and appears unlikely for PepMV, but more studies are needed. Disease management is usually focused on phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of tools) and use of certified clean seed and tomato explants.

Different strains of the virus exist for pepino and tomato. It has been reported in coinfection with _Potato virus S_ (genus _Carlavirus_) and _Tomato torrado virus_ (genus _Torradovirus_). Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of the interactions with these and possibly other viruses on crop damage.
