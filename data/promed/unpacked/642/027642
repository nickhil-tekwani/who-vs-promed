An epidemic of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus [disease], which
began in early June [2011] in Congo's capital Brazzaville, has spread
to the neighbouring Pool region, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO).

Between 1-23 Jun [2011], there were 7014 cases in Brazzaville and 460
in Pool, but no deaths, according to the WHO. In Pool, which endured a
series of civil wars between 1998 and 2003, damaging the local health
infrastructure, only the towns of Goma Tse Tse and Kinkala, the
regional capital, are affected.

In Brazzaville, the disease is concentrated in southern districts,
including Makelekele and Bacongo.

The disease's symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue
and rash, and are similar to those of dengue fever. There is no known
cure; treatment consists of relieving the symptoms.

"Today we find that chikungunya is a problem for the city," Alexis
Elira Dokekias, director-general of health, told IRIN. "There are
patients who complain of chikungunya [virus infection] symptoms, but
do not show up in hospitals. These are hard to track... What is
encouraging is the fact that we have not seen any deaths. Patients who
show up are treated properly because the drugs are available."

Health Ministry specialists have identified the [_Aedes] aegypti_ and
[_Ae.] albopictus_ mosquito species as being responsible for the
outbreak [virus transmission]. Chikungunya [virus] was 1st confirmed
after an analysis of samples by the Franceville laboratory in Gabon.

To counter the disease, the authorities are urging people to clean up
possible breeding sites such as old containers, tyres or empty cans.
The spraying of insecticides to kill the mosquitoes would begin "next
week," said Dokekias.

[This appears to be an explosive epidemic of chikungunya virus
infection. The 13 Jun 2011 ProMED post (archive no. 20110625.1942)
indicated that there were close to 900 cases. In the above report, the
figure has jumped to 7074 in just 2 weeks, including 460 cases in a
new area. One hopes that the cleanup campaign will reduce the vector
mosquito population and slow or halt this outbreak.
