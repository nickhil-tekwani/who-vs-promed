----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background information on tick-borne encephalitis in France was abstracted from Gideon (http://www.GideonOnline.com) and the Gideon e-book series [1,2]. Primary references are available from the author.

The 1st case of TBE in France was reported in 1968. Approximately 30 cases were reported during 1968 to 1997 (virtually all from Alsace); and 64 cases (0 fatal) were reported in the Alsace region [Grand Est region] during 1968 to 2005. 54 cases were confirmed nationwide during 2013 to 2016 -- 48 autochthonous (including 43 in the Alsace region and 5 in the Alpine region) and 6 imported.

Cases were reported from Faverges [Haute-Savoie department, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region] and Grenoble [Isère department, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region] in 2002, the Bordeaux area [Gironde department, Nouvelle-Aquitaine region] in 2006, and Strasbourg [Bas-Rhin department, Grand Est region] in 2016 (publication year).

Although rates in France are relatively low in comparison to those of other Western European countries, the yearly incidence of TBE almost tripled between 2014 to 2016 (see graphs at https://www.gideononline.com/2017/10/26/tick-borne-encephalitis-france/)

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 1996 / individuals in eastern France / 8 percent
- 1996 / individuals in Lorraine / 1.6 percent
- 2008 (publication year) / workers exposed to tick bites in eastern France / 3.4 percent

[TBE virus has been circulating in France for some time. The graph accessible at the URL mentioned above clearly shows a spike in cases from one in 2013 to 29 in 2016, the highest case number since 1968, the 1st year shown on the graph. Occurrence of TBE cases in France in the past few years is not surprising because the virus is widely distributed across Europe with many cases reported in Germany and Switzerland recently.
