The local Health Unit is seeing an increase in the number of cases of hepatitis A in the South River, Sundridge and Burk's Falls areas and so is planning clinics to vaccinate to help stop the spread.

Hepatitis A is a virus that affects the liver, usually spread by eating or drinking something contaminated with the feces of someone with the virus. A partner with hepatitis A can also spread the virus through sexual activities or through sharing drug use equipment. At this time, there is no identified link between the cases of hepatitis A in the area says a news release from the Health Unit.

People are encouraged to protect themselves through good hand hygiene after using the bathroom, changing diapers, handling animals, and before preparing or eating food.

"Vaccination is the best way to prevent the infection," explains Elizabeth Mete, Manager of the Vaccine Preventable Diseases Program. As a result, the Health Unit will be holding 2 vaccine clinics, where people can receive one dose of the vaccine for free.
