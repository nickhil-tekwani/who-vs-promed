An update of the surveillance system for dengue and chikungunya in
the French department at risk for an emergence of those 2 arboviruses
has been recently published on ProMED-mail's website (archive number
20110708-2062). As mentioned, only one confirmed case of chikungunya
infection has been reported in the surveyed area since the beginning
of the 2011 surveillance campaign. As the origin of this case was not
specified, the question of a possible infection acquired locally has
been raised in the comment.

Recently we reported on an imported case of chikungunya in France
diagnosed in a person returning from the Republic of Congo
(ProMED-mail 20110617.2011). That patient arrived and was hospitalized
in the French region infected by _Aedes albopictus_ (Alpes
Maritimes).

Autochthonous transmission of chikungunya virus occurred in France in
2010 but no new locally acquired infection has been recorded since
October 2010. It can be assumed that the local transmission cycle
initiated in 2010 has been broken down at least in part as a
consequence of vector control measures.

In response to the ProMED-mail posting entitled "Chikungunya (16):
France", dated 6 Jul 2011, we would like to bring the following
details to your attention.

Chikungunya and dengue viruses (respectively CHIKV and DENV) are
tropical arboviruses NOT currently circulating in Metropolitan
France.

However, in 2006, the expanding establishment of the mosquito _Aedes
albopictus_ (potentially a vector of both viruses) in the South-East
of Metropolitan France has led the French health authorities to set up
and implement a specific and multidisciplinary anti-dissemination
(risk management) plan addressing both diseases, from May to October,
annually, during the vector's seasonal activity.

Enhanced epidemiological surveillance is implemented in the 6
Mediterranean districts where the tiger mosquito is currently durably
established (that is, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, Alpes-Maritimes,
Bouches-du-Rhone, Corse-du-sud, Haute-Corse, and Var). The objectives
of enhanced surveillance are:
- surveillance of imported cases, to prevent disease transmission
(risk assessment and selected vector control);
- early detection of 1st autochthonous cases, to control transmission
(guide vector control and other PH measures); and
- trends monitoring (by gender and age groups, at district, regional
and national levels).

In September 2010, the enhanced surveillance system allowed for the
early detection of respectively 2 autochthonous cases of dengue in
Nice (Alpes-Maritimes) and 2 autochthonous cases of chikungunya in
Frejus (Var). The coordinated public health response allowed very
efficiently management of these 1st emergences. Amidst some intense
active case finding operations, high densities of vectors and
important tourism activity at the time, no additional autochthonous
cases were subsequently diagnosed in Metropolitan France, and no
locally-acquired infection has been exported to foreign countries.

As of 1 Jul 2011 (since May 2011):
- 139 clinically suspected cases (of both diseases) have been
notified to regional health authorities concerned (ARS PACA and ARS
Corse). All reported suspected cases are systematically investigated
-- travel history, period of potential viremia, serology and/or
RT-PCR, etc. On average, 81 per cent of these are autochthonous
suspect cases -- that is, not reporting any recent history of exposure
to areas of the world where CHIKV and/or DENV are circulating, the
remaining 19 per cent being imported suspect cases.
- Out of the 139 suspect cases notified, 5 dengue cases and 1 case of
chikungunya have so far been confirmed by the National Reference
Centre (laboratory). All are imported cases.

chikungunya and dengue in Metropolitan France are available at the

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Grandadam and Souares for clarifying the
status of the chikungunya case reported in ProMED-mail archive number 20110708.2062 (and the dengue cases not reported in that post), and
providing information about the vigorous surveillance and vector
control efforts being carried out in Metropolitan France in those
areas where _Ae. albopictus_ is present. It was not clear in the
original report whether the chikungunya and dengue cases were locally
acquired or imported. Now we know that all were imported.
Establishment of _Ae. albopictus_ and its expansion is a significant
cause for concern and justifies the timely response of the public
health agencies in France to avoid the risk of ongoing virus
transmission.
