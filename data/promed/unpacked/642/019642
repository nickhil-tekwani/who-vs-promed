Possible Under-Reporting of nvCJD Deaths in the UK
--------------------------------------------------
LONDON: A report in the London Times states that the number of people dying
from [new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) could be greater than
believed because doctors are fearful of carrying out post-mortem
examinations following high-profile hospital scandals.
Dr. Roland Salmon of the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre in
Cardiff said that doctors were increasingly reluctant to demand post-mortem
examinations following the cases at Bristol and Alder Hey [Liverpool
hospitals where thousands of organs were removed from the bodies of babies
and young children without their parents' knowledge [or consent.
He said that this meant some nvCJD deaths could be going 'half-diagnosed.'
"People might die of dementia but we might not know what the cause of that
dementia might be. Is it Alzheimer's disease or is it nvCJD? Cases could be
accumulating, particularly among the elderly, and we have no way of knowing."
The Times report stated that there have been 87 probable or confirmed cases
of nvCJD in Britain to date. nvCJD is the human form of mad cow disease or
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy.

[The diagnosis of nvCJD in an elderly man, reported previously, was the
first indication that the outbreak of this new disease might not be
confined to younger age groups. The high frequency of dementias in the
elderly would mask the occurrence of nvCJD, particularly where there is
reluctance to undertake post-mortem examination. - Mod.CP
