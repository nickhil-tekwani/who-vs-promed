Australia's first case of "airport malaria" has been reported, a man who got
the disease
after being bitten by a mosquito that apparently hitched a ride into
Queensland on an international flight.
This came from a report in the Medical Journal of Australia by Dr. Grant
Jenkin, the registrar of the Royal Melbourne Hospital infectious diseases
service.

[Airport malaria cases have been turning up all over the world in recent
years. They include 2 cases linked to the "Red Lion" pub near Heathrow, a
favorite aircrew stopver place. Perhaps one of our Australian subscribers
can give us further details of this new case, including the probable country
of origin and the type of malaria? - Mod.JW]
