Nigeria: Malaria Tops List of Causes of Deaths in Bayelsa
------------------------------------------------
The Bayelsa State Ministry of Health has identified malaria as the lead cause of 210 deaths recorded in the state in 2011. Director of Public Health in the ministry, Dr. Wakiente Omubo said the report was obtained from various hospitals and health centres in the state.

Out of the 210 cases of deaths that occurred in about 35 different diseases under the public health sector surveillance, malaria was said to have led the pack with 102 deaths in 2011.

It was followed closely with 33 deaths from AIDS-related illnesses, while other deaths were recorded from typhoid fever, diahorea, diabetes and tuberculosis.

Speaking on behalf of the Director, the state's Epidemiologist, Dr. Abisoye Oyeyemi said the figures were not a true reflection of all the deaths that occurred from 40 communicable and non-communicable diseases in the state.

This, according to him, is because the statistics available were drawn from hospitals alone. He maintained that there are areas in the state that are not within the reach of the ministry's surveillance team. Oyeyemi said due to lack of access to health facilities and poverty rate in some areas, certain deaths were not captured because they were not reported. He added that only six unconfirmed cases of cholera were reported in the state last year.

[Malaria is endemic in Nigeria, and it is not possible from the report to know whether the cited figures is an increase or decrease compared to previous years. If it is an increase it would be interesting to have information on the use of impregnated bed nets and the availability of appropriate drugs for treatment like artemisinin combinations.
