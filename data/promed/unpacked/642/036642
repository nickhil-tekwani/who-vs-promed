Continued increase in mumps in universities 2008/2009
-----------------------------------------------------
As reported previously [1], the number of mumps cases notified in
England and Wales increased in early 2009 and has continued to
increase during March. Outbreaks have been reported from several
universities and colleges. A similar increase has been reported from
the Republic of Ireland [2].

A large epidemic of mumps affecting university students 1st occurred
in the academic year 2004/5 [3] and continued into 2005/6, declining
in 2006/7 and 2007/8. During the final quarter of 2008, 695 cases of
mumps were confirmed compared to 447 in the previous quarter [4]. So
far in 2009, 998 cases of mumps with onset in January or February
have been confirmed mumps IgM or RNA positive in England and Wales.
This compares to 322, 274, and 1173 cases in the same periods of
2008, 2007, and 2006 respectively. During 2009, cases have been
confirmed in all English regions and Wales with high numbers from the
South West (204), South East (180), and North West (162) regions. For
the remaining regions the number of cases confirmed was as follows:
Yorkshire and Humberside (115), London (86), East of England (81),
West Midlands (64), East Midlands (48), North East (30), and Wales
(27). The genotype currently circulating is a G5, the same strain
that has been circulating over the past 5 years and responsible for
outbreaks in other parts of Europe [5,6].

[These data are illustrated in the original text by a figure showing
the 5 week moving average of mumps notifications, England and Wales
2003-2009. - Mod.CP]

Reason for the increase
-----------------------
The previous epidemic was attributed to a cohort of young adults,
born between 1981 and 1990, who were at increased risk of mumps.
These individuals were born before the implementation of the routine
2-dose MMR programme and had therefore either received no MMR
vaccine, or only one dose. As control of mumps was excellent after
1990, this group remained susceptible until they entered the
university or college setting, when transmission of mumps was
facilitated. During 2008, 1403 (57 percent) of the confirmed cases
were in those born between 1981 and 1990 . [Data illustrated by a
figure in the original text. - Mod.CP]

Despite this clear picture, the reason why the numbers of cases have
increased in this academic year, after remaining lower in both 2006/7
and 2007/8 is not entirely clear. One explanation may be that, since
the widespread transmission in 2005/6, 3 new cohorts of students have
entered college and therefore another susceptible pool has been
re-established in this setting.

In the previous epidemic, although the vaccinated cohorts were
largely protected from mumps, cases were confirmed in vaccinated
individuals. By the 2008/9 academic year, most students would have
been eligible for one or 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella),
and so a higher proportion of vaccine failures are expected amongst
the cases. Initial reports are consistent with this observation.

In 2004-5, analysis of protection from vaccination showed that,
although individual protection from vaccination was high, there was
evidence of declining protection over time, particularly in those who
had only received one dose of vaccine [7]. Investigations during
university outbreaks in the United States, where vaccine coverage for
2 doses has been in place for longer, also suggested that waning
protection may have contributed [8]. Secondary vaccine failure may
therefore also explain a proportion of cases.

Surveillance and control
------------------------
Continued surveillance, including confirmation of the diagnosis, is
important for ensuring accurate epidemiological data. In persons who
have been previously vaccinated, the serological diagnosis of mumps
can be difficult as the IgM response may be delayed and reach lower
levels. For rapid diagnosis, an oral fluid taken in the 1st 14 days
of illness is preferred as this can be tested for both IgM
(Immunoglobulin M) and viral RNA (ribonucleic acid). If this is not
possible then parallel serum and throat swab or paired serum samples
can be collected.

In 2005 and 2006, the incident team for the national mumps outbreak
recommended that the priorities were to ensure that systems were in
place to ensure that those entering university were fully vaccinated
with MMR in the future. This included ensuring that pupils attending
for the Year 10 booster and university entrants from 2005 onwards had
received 2 doses of MMR.

The team also concluded that university vaccination campaigns in
particular are likely to achieve low uptake and are unlikely to stop
outbreaks. The offer of individual vaccination, however, should be
available to students who are unvaccinated or have received only one
dose of MMR. Approaches being taken in individual universities this
year have included using text messaging and university computer
networks to alert students to these recommendations.

[The extent and intensity of the mumps epidemic in the current
academic year is surprising in view of the decline of mumps in
university students during both 2006/2007 and 2007/2008, subsequent to
the major outbreak in 2005/2006. As suggested above, it may be that
since 2005/2006 3 new cohorts of students have entered colleges and
universities and established a new pool of susceptibles.

Efforts to increase awareness of the risk of exposure to mumps
infection among university students must be continued. - Mod.CP]

[Mumps in male college students may lead to orchitis (inflammation of
the testes) and sterility, a good selling point for taking the
vaccine. - Mod.JW]
