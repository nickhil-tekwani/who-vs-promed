Equine influenza Â­- latest lab test results do not resolve suspect case
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The status of the suspect horse in Tasmania's north west remains unclear,
following the latest lab test result. The result of the 2nd lab test
carried out at Geelong this morning [12 Oct 2007] is negative. This means
that there are 2 test results from Department of Primary Industries and
Water's (DPIW) Mt Pleasant laboratories that are positive and 2 from the
Animal Health laboratories at Geelong that are negative.

DPIW's biosecurity manager, Alex Schaap, said that the conflicting results
between the 2 laboratories need to be resolved before equine influenza can
be confirmed or ruled out in this case: "We have taken fresh samples from
the suspect horse and they will be extensively tested -- both here in
Tasmania and on the mainland. In the meantime, we have started contacting
the owners of horses that have had some contact with this horse. If this is
a case of equine influenza, we would expect some of these others horses to
be showing some signs of the disease by now. We have inspected the suspect
horse again this morning.

"Its condition has changed little since yesterday and the clinical signs,
while consistent with equine influenza, remain mild. The total ban on all
horse movements within Tasmania will remain until we are in a better
position to know whether this is, or is not, equine influenza.

"We will continue to treat this case as highly suspicious until we have
sound evidence to the contrary. We will review the standstill tomorrow
morning when we expect to have information regarding the health status of
any contact horses.

"We hope to be able to announce a decision regarding Sunday racing at that
time. We are well aware that the lockdown will cause difficulty for horse
owners and that the racing industry is especially anxious about this
weekend's events.

"I can assure them all that we will ease the standstill as soon as we can
do so safely. In the meantime, I ask that horse owners be patient and
understand that this standstill is absolutely necessary at this stage.

"It is most important that every horse owner complies. No horse is allowed
off its current property until further notice. Tasmania Police are out on
the roads enforcing the ban on horse movements," Mr Schaap said.

Questions remain over Tasmanian horse in equine flu scare
---------------------------------------------------------
Scores remain tied in test results on a horse in Tasmania as the state
remains under a biosecurity lockdown. All horse movements are banned as
state officials work to break the 2-2 deadlock in positive and negative
tests. Fears have eased slightly, with the 2 results from 1 lab both
proving negative, but another laboratory has returned positive tests.

The lockdown will remain in place until biosecurity staff are satisfied the
respiratory illness in the horse is not equine flu. Signs in the horse are
not severe and biosecurity staff are contacting other horses known to have
been in contact with the sick animal in recent days. Given the highly
contagious nature of the disease, each hour that passes without further
reports of sick horses only improves the odds of the sick horse being free
of the disease.
In New South Wales and Queensland, the number of infected properties
continue to climb. There are 4259 such properties in NSW, with 407 labelled
"dangerous contact" and 462 officially "suspect." Queensland had 1014
infected properties as of yesterday, an increase of 67 on the day before.
The recognized infected area now covers 2354 square kilometres [908.88
square miles]. Vaccination programs are continuing in both states.

The NSW Department of Primary Industries is seeking to identify horses
currently unaffected by the disease within the purple and red zones, with
plans to vaccinate these animals. Horse owners with unaffected animals in
the zones are asked to fill out a survey at
<http://www.surveymaster.com/AHIC/Q1.asp>.

NSW biosecurity officials say the priorities for vaccination are in the
following order:
* horses in buffer zones and adjacent to higher risk areas. This program is
well under way.
* uninfected horses in the purple zone.
* high performance horses and special categories such as Olympic horses,
Riding for the Disabled, race horses and breeding stallions in the green,
amber, and red zones. This will be subject to vaccine availability.
* then, again if vaccine numbers allow, other horses in the green, amber
and red zones that will need to enter the purple zone for thoroughbred or
harness racing.

In other news:
* The 2 horses that were tested for flu in Rockhamptom have returned
negative results.
* Tests on horses in Mackay have also proved negative.

[There are a number of reasons why results may be different between the 2
laboratories. Neither of these articles indicates what samples were taken,
how they were handled or what tests were used. There is sometimes a
difference in specificity and sensitivity depending on the platform of the
test.
