Up to 1000 tonnes of Agria variety ware potatoes have been imported into the UK and supplied as uncertified seed tubers in eastern England. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (Apha) said it was aware of at least one operator attempting to circumvent plant health rules. They will pursue robust action against growers who plant illegal potato seed, as well as their suppliers, for breaching biosecurity. They are carrying out general and targeted surveillance to ensure compliance. Farmers should ensure any seed stocks are properly certified and from a reputable source.

Defra (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) said pests and diseases known to occur in Europe -- such as ring rot, brown rot, and zebra chip -- pose a serious threat to the British potato industry. Some operators are importing ware potatoes, particularly of varieties that are unavailable or difficult to grow, as seed tubers. The biosecurity risk of such practices cannot be overstated.

[Farm saved or other uncertified potato seed tubers are known to carry a serious biosecurity risk. They pose a threat to crop production and have frequently been reported as sources of disease outbreaks in different countries. Use of certified pathogen-free planting stock is considered vital for all cultivated species, to prevent incursions of both new pathogens and additional, potentially more severe strains of pathogens already present in an area.

The diseases mentioned above are:
1. Bacterial ring rot, caused by _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ with up to 50% yield losses; many solanaceous species (such as tomato, aubergine) are also susceptible.
2. Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt), caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas); yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting.
3. Zebra chip, caused by _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum; the pathogen has also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops and some crops in the family Apiaceae (such as carrots).

For more information on these diseases see previous ProMED posts in the archives.
