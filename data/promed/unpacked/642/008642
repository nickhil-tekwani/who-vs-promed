Scientists are investigating a mysterious outbreak of deformities
among flying fox bats in far north Queensland. Animal carers on the
Atherton Tableland, west of Cairns, have reported an unusually high
incidence of flying foxes being born with cleft palates, rendering
them unable to eat.
Jenny Maclean, who runs an animal hospital at Tolga, 50km south-west
of Cairns, said the outbreak had hit the spectacled flying fox
species, common in north Queensland. The affliction had been detected
at three bat colonies on the tableland.
"It has been discovered because we go into the colonies twice a day
to check for flying foxes with tick paralysis," Ms Maclean said. "It
may well be happening down on the coast, at the colonies in and
around Cairns, but because people don't go into them regularly, it
hasn't been detected."
Ms Maclean said the babies had been rejected by their mothers and
were found lying on the forest floor. More than 50 affected babies
had been found in the three colonies in recent weeks. Normally, only
about three babies suffered such deformities at a single colony in a
year.
The babies have been put to death and will be sent to the University
of Queensland in Brisbane for examination by scientists. The outbreak
is also being investigated by Queensland's environment and primary
industries departments. Flying fox researcher Hugh Spencer, of the
Tropical Research Centre at Cape Tribulation, said the cause of the
outbreak was a mystery. But he believed it might have been caused by
flying foxes eating the wrong foods because their habitats had been
cleared.
[A "sudden" appearance of a normally infrequent condition can result
from a number of events both biological and observational. Habitat
clearing can result not only in a redistribution of diet but also in
a change in exposure to various possible teratogens. Any comments
would be welcome - Mod.MHJ]
