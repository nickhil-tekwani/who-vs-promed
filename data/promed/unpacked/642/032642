For the 3rd time since 2005, researchers have parsed data from an _E. coli_ O157: H7 outbreak traced to raw milk gouda cheese. For the 3rd time, they have concluded the "60-day rule" isn't long enough to ensure dangerous bacteria in unpasteurized gouda have died. This time around the scientists did more than publish the information, though. They are telling the government that the 1950s-vintage 60-day rule needs to be revisited because it is obsolete when viewed under 21st century microscopes.

The antiquated rule "assumed that any pathogens present would die off over time in an environment of low pH, low water activity, and high salt and the presence of competitive microflora in the cheese," according to the most recent research report. "However, these assumptions were made before _E. coli_ O157: H7, _Listeria monocytogenes_, and _Salmonella_ were recognized as common foodborne pathogens and before evidence had accumulated regarding the ability of these pathogens to tolerate these conditions.

"Hard and semihard cheeses have long been considered a lower risk to public health than soft and semisoft cheeses, but further evaluation is warranted for Gouda cheese in particular, given recurrent outbreaks associated with this semihard variety."

Two of the outbreaks referenced in the research published in the February 2018 edition of the Journal of Food Protection [see reference below] occurred in Canada, in 2002-03 and 2013. The 1st sickened at least 13 people. The 2013 outbreak sickened 29 people with 1 death. The 3rd outbreak was in 2010, with 41 people across the southwestern USA confirmed with _E. coli_ O157: H7 infections. All 3 outbreaks were traced to gouda cheese made with unpasteurized, raw milk.

Outbreak investigations revealed live _E. coli_ O157: H7 present in unopened gouda samples that were well past the 60-day aging requirement, according to the most recent research by scientists from numerous federal and provincial public health agencies in Canada.

Raw milk gouda tested during the investigation of the 2013 outbreak showed live _E. coli_ present 306 days after it was produced.

"This finding is consistent with those from other outbreaks and microbiological studies of artificially contaminated cheeses that have revealed that pathogenic bacteria, including _E. coli_ O157: H7, can survive in various varieties of cheese through production and the subsequent aging and storage periods at levels sufficient to cause human illness," the Canadian research team reports in this month's edition of the Journal.

The scientists also looked at the manufacturing practices at the cheese production facilities and found they were operating within the applicable laws and regulations.

"... no major deviations in cheese production and subsequent handling were noted in the outbreak presented herein or in the _E. coli_ O157: H7 infection outbreak attributed to raw milk Gouda cheese in Canada in 2002. The implicated cheeses were produced in accordance with regulated microbiological and aging requirements."

Consequently, the scientists report, if _E. coli_ is present in the raw milk used to make the cheese, it does not die during the minimum 60-day aging period. Instead, the potentially deadly pathogen can survive for 5 times that long in large enough numbers to cause infections in people who eat it.

Abstract
--------
Between 12 Jul and 29 Sep 2013, 29 individuals in 5 Canadian provinces became ill following infection with the same strain of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 as defined by molecular typing results. 5 case patients were hospitalized, and 1 died. 26 case patients (90 percent) reported eating Gouda cheese originating from a dairy plant in British Columbia. All of the 22 case patients with sufficient product details available reported consuming Gouda cheese made with raw milk; this cheese had been produced between March and July 2013 and was aged for a minimum of 60 days. The outbreak strain was isolated from the implicated Gouda cheese, including 1 core sample obtained from an intact cheese wheel 83 days after production. The findings indicate that raw milk was the primary source of the _E. coli_ O157:H7, which persisted through production and the minimum 60-day aging period. This outbreak is the 3rd caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7 traced to Gouda cheese made with raw milk in North America. These findings provide further evidence that a 60-day ripening period cannot ensure die-off of pathogens that might be present in raw milk Gouda cheese after production and have triggered an evaluation of processing conditions, physicochemical parameters, and options to mitigate the risk of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection associated with raw milk Gouda cheese produced in Canada.

ProMED posted on this outbreak (E. coli EHEC - Canada (09): cheese, O157, more cases 20130924.1964974) with my commentary as follows:

The issue of the safety of 60+ day aged raw milk cheeses related to EHEC is important to readdress:

In the USA, the FDA has established (FDA 21 CFR Part 133 http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?cfrpart=133) that unpasteurized milk cheese that is aged for 60 days or more at a temperature greater than 35 deg F (2 deg C) creates conditions able to eradicate milkborne pathogens. These observations followed epidemics of typhoid fever caused by cheddar cheese made from raw milk in the 1940s and survival data on _Brucella abortus_ in cheddar led to the 60 day curing period in the USA (1,2).

Reitsma (3) reported, however, that EHEC (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_) could survive the manufacture and curing of cheese, and using a 5-strain inoculum, others (4) confirmed that the 60 day aging was inadequate to eliminate EHEC. Confirming these experimental findings, several outbreaks of EHEC have been reported related to aged raw milk cheeses (5,6). The physiological responses of EHEC (7) as measured by stress responses to acid, osmotic pressure, and heat shock seem to contribute to the survival of EHEC during raw milk production.
