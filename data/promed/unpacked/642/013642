USDA Amends Karnal Bunt Regulations to Allow Alternative Treatments for Seed
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has amended the Karnal bunt regulations
based on new data concerning effective treatments for this fungal disease
of wheat. Three alternative treatments for seed originating from a
regulated area that will be planted within a regulated area have been
approved. This action will reduce the regulatory burden on wheat growers
and other affected persons in the regulated area.
USDA has concluded that removing certain restrictions would not pose a
significant risk of spreading Karnal bunt, said Alfred S. Elder, acting
deputy administrator for plant protection and quarantine with the Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, a part of USDA's marketing and
regulatory programs mission area. Under current treatment regulations, seed
for planting in regulated areas must be treated with a combination of two
fungicides. This treatment was based on information available at the time
of the publication of the final rule on Oct. 4, 1996. However, based on
new information USDA is amending the regulations to allow three different
single fungicide treatments using either Carboxin thiram or
entacholronitrobenzene. Seed for planting in regulated areas may now be
treated with either fungicide.
Karnal bunt is caused by the smut fungus _Tilletia indica_ and is most
commonly spread through the movement of infected seed.
