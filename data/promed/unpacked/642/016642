Cases of visceral leishmaniasis on the rise in Al Qadarif state,
eastern Sudan
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of visceral leishmaniasis, or kala azar, in Gedaref [Al
Qadarif] state, have increased to more than 5550 cases. The total
number of deaths is now more than 142 a year, increasing by 10 to 15
deaths a month, and medical sources fear that the disease is turning
into a pandemic.

Medical sources familiar with Gedaref (Al Qadarif) state preferred to
withhold the name of the newspaper printing the information on the
campaign, saying they are classified sources. The campaign aims at
eradicating the [sand] flies that transmit the disease by the end of
May [2011], and is estimated to cost 71 000 [Sudanese] pounds [about
USD [27 000].

Er Rahad [in North Kurdufan state] is one of the areas hardest hit by
the disease, with 80 percent of the state of Gedaref's [Al Qadarif's]
total.

[The article] reports that the campaign will start with the
environmental sanitation situation, the eradication of stray dogs who
are [the redservoir of the disease], along with a campaign to cut
trees that create breeding areas for the [sand] flies.

[Translator notes:
Er Rahad is a town in North Kurdufan state in central Sudan, 30
kilometres [18.6 mi] south of El Obeid.
The state of Al Qadarif is right on the eastern border of the Sudan
with Ethiopia. - Corr.SB]

[_Leishmania_ is transmitted by the sandfly _Phlebotomus_ spp. The
state of Gedaref (Al Qadarif) is known as a highly endemic area for
_Leishmania_. A previous study from 1997-2000 found 658 cases of
visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in a population of about 4000 people
(Lambert M et al: The sandfly fauna in the visceral-leishmaniasis
focus of Gedaref, in the Atbara-River area of eastern Sudan. Ann Trop
Med Parasitol. 2002; 96(6): 631-6; abstract available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396326). The study also
reported that "_Phlebotomus orientalis_ could be responsible for the
indoor transmission of the parasites causing the local VL between
humans and between humans and local dogs (which have been found
infected by some of the _Leishmania zymodemes_ found in humans)."
