From: Dr. Richard H. Evans <snaver@home.com>

As Dr. Quall has pointed out [Rabies, raccoon - Canada (Ontario) (04), the
choice of the term "Old Dog Encephalitis"-like was probably inappropriate
in describing the "chronic" form of Canine Distemper (CD) in raccoons. I
meant it to described a similarity (-like) and not a specific disease entity.
In examining thousands of CDV infected raccoon brains from spontaneous and
experimental cases, I distinguish for lack of better terms, the following
classifications. I must point out that like all classifications these are
somewhat arbitrary and overlapping certainly does occur both clinically and
histopathologically.
1) "acute", fulminating CD (death usually follows fulminating disease
within about 2 weeks, commonly seen in raccoons under 6-14 weeks of age)
2) "chronic" CD (insidious but progressive course of disease over 4-8 week
period, commonly seen in raccoons 20 weeks of age or older, it may also
occur when acute cases appear to "recover or stabilize" but actually shift
to a slowly progressive pattern)
3) "Old Dog Encephalitis" - ODE (mature onset of a chronic neurological
disease with alternating periods of some degree of apparent recovery and
relapse that may span several years)
Experimentally, I found that raccoons with "acute" disease had moderate to
marked demyelination as well as neuronal degeneration, varying degrees of
gliosis and common often multiple inclusion bodies (both intracytoplasmic
and intranuclear). "Chronic" cases were typified by demyelination and
lymphoplasmacytic (+/-meningo- and/or myelo-) encephalitis. Cases I
described as ODE have inflammatory demyelinating lesions, in contradiction
to what Dr. Quall states are the characteristic lesions of ODE, but in
accordance with the findings of Axthelm and Krakowka and others. I think
this point illustrates the problems with the labels we place on the various
manifestations of a complex disease that often strays from the conceived norm.
Dr. Quall notes and I certainly agree with him that Old Dog Encephalitis is
a CNS (Central Nervous System) inflammatory disease of mature dogs.
Further, he is indeed right that Drs. Axthelm and Krakowka have added very
convincing evidence for CDV as the culprit. I am especially intrigued by
their statements that ODE evolved de novo in dogs subclinically infected
with a neurovirulent strain of CDV (R252) and their suggestion that it is a
replication-defective form. The stuff that gets an old pathologist like me
rather excited.

[Good Job guys! Dr. Qualls and Dr. Evans have been very informative and
this discussion is both appropiate and appreciated. I look forward to your
continued input. But until we have more information out of Canada, this
thread is cut. - Mod.TG
