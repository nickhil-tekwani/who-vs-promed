A 50-year-old man died after a presumed intoxication occurred yesterday, [Tue 24 Apr 2018], in the province of Huancabamba (Piura region). He and 23 other people allegedly consumed contaminated food in a restaurant in the Salalá sector.

According to Radio Cutivalú de Piura, a total of 24 people from the company JJC - Mayo arrived at the health center of Huancabamba with vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. The doctor Félix Raymundo Ruiz Valera indicated that everything started at 8:15 p.m. when the workers arrived with very serious symptoms. However, Ruiz said, the decreased, a native of Breña - Lima, arrived in a pre-mortem state, that is to say, disoriented, with a blue-ash skin and almost imperceptible pulse.

Staff from the Huancabamba health center reported that some patients indicated that the alleged cause of poisoning was the fish they ate at a restaurant in the Salalá sector, in Carmen de la Frontera, at around noon. As part of the 1st investigations of the case, a piece has already been sent by the health center of Huancabamba to the laboratory of the Regional Health Directorate of Piura.

[The illnesses seem to have been manifest with vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain but it is not stated whether fever was present and how long after the lunch did symptoms develop. At the longest, a 7-8 hour incubation period appears to have occurred. Short incubation periods are generally related to the ingestion of preformed toxins, such as those produced by _Staphylococcus aureus_. The mortality from staphylococcal food poisoning is quite low and it is not usually associated with fish ingestion. Two of the more classical fish related foodborne illnesses are scombroid and ciguatera.

Scombroid is an illness manifesting as an allergy-like illness due to the ingestion of fish containing high levels of histamine from poor temperature control in storage of the fish. Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), thought to be the most commonly reported natural marine toxin related illness globally, is caused by the ingestion of finfish containing the toxins, ciguatoxins, which are produced by dinoflagellates of the genus _Gambierdiscus_. The toxins are tasteless, colorless, odorless and heat and acid stable and are not prevented by any particular storage, preparation or cooking methods. Typical ciguatoxic fish can be barracuda, grouper, and snapper.

CFP causes gastrointestinal symptoms that usually begin within 6-12 hours of ingestion and subsequent neurologic symptoms including numbness and tingling, muscle aches, dizziness and the characteristic cold allodynia (hot/cold reversal where touching cold surfaces produces a burning sensation). The neurological symptoms may be delayed for a day or so but cardiac symptoms and signs generally occur early including low blood pressure and slow heart rate which can lead to death. CFP is a distinct possibility here and ProMED would appreciate more information regarding these cases.

A good review on CFP is Friedman MA, Fernandez M, Backer LC, et al: An updated review of ciguatera fish poisoning: clinical, epidemiological, environmental, and public health management. Mar Drugs 2017;15:72; doi:10.3390/md15030072.
