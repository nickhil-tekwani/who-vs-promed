German government officials say 2 more people have died of a
bacterial outbreak allegedly caused by contaminated Spanish cucumbers,
bringing the number of deaths to 9.

German news agency DAPD reported that 2 more women died Saturday [28
May 2011], and almost 300 are sick with hemolytic uremic syndrome, or
HUS, in recent days. HUS is a rare complication arising from an
infection most commonly associated with _E. coli_, a bacterium found
in undercooked beef or contaminated food.

German officials have said they found 3 cucumbers from Spain with the
bacterium, and they are currently probing whether the cucumbers were
contaminated with _E. coli_ when they were shipped from southern
Spain, or whether they went bad during shipment or while being handled
in Germany.

[As the numbers of cases and deaths grow, ProMED awaits more
definitive information regarding the specifics of the contamination of
the cucumbers, that is, how and where. Additionally, it may well be
the case that this isolate is more virulent by producing more toxin or
having other virulence factors, since it is already unusual given its
serotype, the lack of the eae gene, and its poly-resistance to
antimicrobial agents (although the infection is NOT treated with
antimicrobials, as it tends to become more severe). This latter point
could play a role if the patients were undiagnosed and treated with
antimicrobials. - Mod.LL]
