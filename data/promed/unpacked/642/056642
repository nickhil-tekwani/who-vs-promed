News
-----
A total of 6 people from Mambasa cured of Ebola virus disease out of the Komanda ETC in Ituri.
- The ETC in Komanda, Ituri province, released on [Thu 26 Sep 2019] 6 people who were cured of Ebola virus disease, all from Mambasa;
- For the director of the Komanda ETC, Claude Banga Lonema, this treatment center receives patients from the Nyakunde and Komanda health zones, as well as from Mambasa well before the construction of its ETC, which has become functional for almost a week;
- For the director of the ETC of Komanda, Dr. Claude Banga Lonema, all these recovered cases are the work of a whole team, including medical and paramedical staff, psychosocial teams, nutritionists, hygienists, and guards, to whom he is grateful for all their efforts in this day-to-day treatment center, as well as dedication and their apostolate;
- The coordinator of the Subcommittee on Response and chief medical officer of the Komanda health zone, Dr. Faustin Singo Ngozo, said on this occasion that the success [fighting] Ebola virus disease is an asset for everyone in the response. This success must be shared because if surveillance does not work, there will always be notification of deaths. The presence of recovered patients from the Komanda ETC shows that epidemiological surveillance has been successful in detecting cases in a timely manner and has enabled the care physicians to have sufficient time to treat these patients. To this end, he recommended mutual support among all the teams in the response to push him out of the way to harm the epidemic, which he said has lasted too long, to continue working with the same momentum. He also asked the 6 recovered patients to help the response in sensitizing everyone in his respective environment. Military healing, he said, is a resource that can educate his colleagues to end this epidemic;
- Among the Mambasa survivors who were discharged from the Komanda ETC were an 8-year-old girl, a man in uniform in the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the village chief of Makoko II, a village in strong resistance. The latter 2 promised to raise awareness about Ebola virus disease in their respective communities;
- This triumphant release of the 6 recovered patients of Mambasa, an area where there is still resistance against EVD, was made in the presence of the few partners, namely, the delegates of WHO and UNICEF;
- Started with a prayer, this ceremony also ended with prayer and a family photo of the recovered patients and the teams of the response committed in this ETC;
- Immediately after their exits from the ETC of Komanda, the recovered patients were accompanied by the teams of the response to Mambasa, their respective health zone, where a festive atmosphere awaited them;
-The Komanda ETC is located in the Mangiva health area, in the village of Makayanga in the health zone of Komanda, 100 km (62 mi) from the health zone of Mambasa.

Vaccination
------------
- Ring vaccination expanded around 2 confirmed cases in Mataba health area in Kalunguta, North Kivu. Two more vaccination rings, in the same health zone, are waiting to be opened in Lisasa and Kabasha health zones;
- Since the start of vaccination on [8 Aug 2018], 228 430 people have been vaccinated;
- The only vaccine to be used in this epidemic is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical company Merck, after approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 20 May 2018.

Monitoring entry points
------------------------
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the total number of travelers checked (temperature rise) at the sanitary control points is 98 818 462;
- To date, a total of 111 entry points (PoE) and sanitary control points (PoCs) have been set up in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri to protect the country's major cities and prevent the spread of the epidemic in neighboring countries.

[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/26-september-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this week with 29 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from [18-24 Sep 2019] versus 57 in the previous week. This decrease in the number of cases should be interpreted with caution, as operational and security challenges in certain health zones make it difficult to undertake case detection and response functions.

There has been a recent increase in localized security or community-related incidents in several areas of operation. About 1/3 of community incidents from August 2019, to date, occurred in Mambasa health zone. To strengthen the participation and engagement of local communities in this area, a WHO team of social scientists and community engagement, risk communication, and health promotion experts was set up to implement the Strategic Response Plan 4 (SRP4) approach and strategy together with La Commission Communication de Risque et Engagement Communautaire (CREC) sub-commission. The recent major security incident in Lwemba, within Mandima health zone, has halted response activities for the past 9 days. This has limited contact tracing efforts, with 169 and 162 contacts lost to follow up in Lwemba and Mambasa, respectively.

During the past 21 days (from 4-24 Sep 2019), a total of 126 confirmed cases were reported from 13 health zones (see Table 1, Figure 2 at the source URL), with the majority of cases from Mambasa (25%, n = 31), Mandima (18%, n = 23), and Kalunguta (16%, n = 20) health zones. Musienene health zone cleared 21 days without a new confirmed case of EVD.

As of 24 Sep 2019, a total of 3175 EVD cases were reported, including 3063 confirmed and 112 probable cases, of which 2122 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1778) were female, 28% (902) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (161) were health workers.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo health authorities have endorsed the use of a 2nd investigational Ebola vaccine with at-risk populations in areas that do not have active EVD transmission. Regular vaccination activities in EVD-affected areas will continue. The Merck/MSD vaccine will continue to be provided to all people at high risk of Ebola infection, including those who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have Ebola, all contacts of contacts, and others determined to be at high risk of contracting Ebola. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be deployed by a consortium, including the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of the Congo National Institute for Biomedical Research, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), MSF Epicentre, United Kingdom Public Health Rapid Support Team, Wellcome Trust, and Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. The Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale will coordinate the data safety and monitoring board.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of 26 Sep 2019, close to USD 60 million has been received by WHO, with further funds committed or pledged. Currently available funds will close the financing gap just up until the end of October 2019. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found here (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding).

- Wed 25 Sep 2019. New cases, insecurity
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/ebola-cases-continue-slow-rise-security-problems-persist
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The number of Ebola cases continues to slowly rise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, with 4 more cases reported today [25 Sep 2019], as global health officials released their latest overview of needs to prevent more spread to the DRC's neighbors through the end of the year [2019].

In other developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest detailed situation report yesterday [24 Sep 2019] that pockets of insecurity continue to hamper the response.

According to the WHO's online dashboard today [25 Sep 2019], the 4 new cases lift the outbreak total to 3175 cases. Investigators are still following up on 445 suspected infections.

One more patient died from Ebola, putting the fatality count at 2119.

Meanwhile, the latest daily update from the DRC's multisector Ebola committee (CMRE) had a few details about 2 cases reported yesterday [24 Sep 2019], noting that they were both from Oicha in North Kivu province.

In the latest situation report, the WHO said security incidents in affected areas are still impacting all parts of the response, including safe and dignified burials, vaccination, contact tracing, and case reporting. For example, it said a major incident last week in Lwemba, which is in Mandima health zone, is still hampering response activities in the area.

"Overall, these incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities, especially in the high-risk areas that may not currently be affected," the WHO said.

The WHO still recommends interpreting weekly fluctuations in case numbers with caution, emphasizing that a single incident has the potential to change the course of the outbreak. It warned that after a week with no response operations in Lwemba, a surge of cases could be reported in the weeks ahead when activities resume.

On a positive note, no new confirmed cases have been reported in areas where robust public health efforts have gained traction, showing that the approaches need to continue, the WHO said.

In a note to the media today [25 Sep 2019], the WHO said United Nation (UN) emergency relief coordinator Mark Lowcock and WHO health emergencies program director Mike Ryan, MD, launched the UN regional Ebola preparedness plan, which plots out the needs and requirements from July through December [2019].

The report sums up urgent activities and funding needed to prevent Ebola from spreading beyond the DRC.

The 34-page overview includes elements from national plans of 9 countries in the region. Though financial donations and other contributions by nations and groups have been a key factor in the progress so far, much more is needed. The overall price tag for the end of the year is USD 66 million.

The priority 1 countries are near where cases have been reported that have areas of large-scale movements of goods and people across borders. They are Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda. The priority 2 countries -- all [the] rest that neighbor the DRC -- are Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Tanzania, and Zambia.

Regional Ebola Preparedness Overview of Needs and Requirements, July-December 2019

Executive summary

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is dealing with the world's 2nd-largest outbreak of Ebola. As of the end of August 2019, more than 3000 cases of Ebola had been recorded, including over 2000 deaths.

The DRC shares its borders with 9 countries, and there is regular cross-border movement of people, goods, and services in the region. Combined with weaknesses in national health systems, the 9 neighbouring countries are at very high risk for an Ebola outbreak.

This risk has become evident in recent months. In June 2019, 3 members of a family from the DRC crossed the border into Uganda; all 3 subsequently died of Ebola. In July 2019, an Ebola case was reported in the DRC near the border with South Sudan, and another was confirmed in Goma, after arriving from Butembo, a previous epicentre. In August 2019, cases were confirmed in a 3rd province of DRC, South Kivu, near the border with Burundi.

In reflection of the growing risks and based on the advice of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Ebola outbreak in the DRC a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 17 Jul 2019.

To assist the DRC's 9 neighbours with advancing critical preparedness measures, the United Nations has developed this Regional Ebola Preparedness: Overview of Needs and Requirements, July-December 2019. The regional overview serves as a complement to the Integrated Strategy to Respond to Ebola Virus: Ituri and North Kivu provinces for the DRC, covering the same period. Together, the 2 documents present the full scope of actions and funding required to respond to the current Ebola outbreak in the DRC, to prevent it from spreading further, and to drive the response towards zero cases. The generous financial and in-kind contributions provided by national and international partners to the many actors working in support of Ebola preparedness has been a key factor in the progress made thus far.

The 9 countries included in this regional overview are categorized into 2 groups, based on risk level:
- Priority 1 (based on proximity to areas where cases have been reported and large-scale movement of goods and people across borders): Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda
- Priority 2 (all other countries neighbouring the DRC): Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo (RoC), Tanzania, and Zambia

This document presents a consolidated summary of urgent activities required to advance preparedness, as elaborated in each country's national plan, with a particular focus on Priority 1 countries. It presents the estimated requirements, needs, and gaps for each of the Priority 1 countries and a summary for Priority 2 countries, as aligned for the period of July to December 2019.

Ebola Virus Disease Democratic Republic of Congo: External Situation Report 60/ 2019

In the past week, from 16-22 Sep 2019, 39 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases, with an additional 22 deaths, have been reported from 9 health zones in 3 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Pockets of insecurity in the affected areas, along with localised security incidents, continue to hinder response activities, including safe and dignified burials (SDB), vaccination, contact tracing, and case reporting. For instance, a recent major security incident in Lwemba, within Mandima health zone, is still preventing response activities in this area. Overall, these incidents underscore the need for continued and proactive engagement and sensitizing of local communities, especially in the high-risk areas that may not currently be affected. In the 21 days from 2-22 Sep 2019, 45 health areas in 13 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 129 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Mambasa (25%, n=32 cases), Mandima (19%, n=25 cases), Kalunguta (17%, n=22 cases), and Beni (11%, n=14 cases).

As of 22 Sep 2019, a total of 3168 EVD cases were reported, including 3057 confirmed and 111 probable cases, of which 2118 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age data, 56% (1772) were female, 28% (900) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (160) were healthcare workers.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo health authorities have endorsed the use of a 2nd investigational Ebola vaccine with at-risk populations in areas that do not have active EVD transmission. Regular vaccination activities in EVD-affected areas will continue.

Ebola: Media input has also enabled communities in North Kivu to take ownership of the response to the epidemic

The number of new cases of the Ebola outbreak has dropped on the ground in North Kivu province. This is also thanks to the involvement of the media in raising awareness of the population on the danger of the disease. Indeed, since the appearance of the 10th epidemic in August 2018 in Beni, the response teams have mobilized the media to help educate communities on prevention measures.

A synergy of journalists has been created to produce programs and magazines focused on Ebola, in spite of the particular security, socioeconomic, and health contexts in which their media organizations operate.

"I feel comfortable when I take my camera, and I will do a report on Ebola. I feel like I'm helping to save a soul who was dying from this disease somewhere because of a lack of information," says Hope Channel TV journalist Yvonne Kapinga.

The president of the National Press Union of Congo (UNPC), North Kivu branch, Rosalie Zawadi says that the roles of the media have also helped prevent rumors of any kind about this deadly epidemic. "Rumors were too prevalent about this disease. Media professionals have helped to make it clear that Ebola is a fast-healed disease if we go to the ETC (Ebola treatment center) quickly, and the community quickly adopted the response," she says.

The interim governor of North Kivu, Jean-Bosco Sebishimbo, also acknowledges the contribution of the media to reduce community resistance to Ebola response teams. "It is through diversified broadcasts bringing everyone to subscribe to the program against Ebola that we continue to record satisfactory results," he says.

It is within this context that a collective of community radio and television stations of North Kivu (CORACON), which benefits from the support of the English organization Free Press unlimited, equipped the community media with working tools (computers, dictaphones) on Thursday [26 Sep 2019].

"We have provided each of our 33 radio partners with work tools for the production of awareness programs. Emissions that inform the public in real time about the right attitudes to take in the process of fighting Ebola virus disease, "says Innocent Pendakazi, chairman of the board of CORACON.

From the rostrum of the 74th UN General Assembly Thursday [26 Sep 2019], Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has acknowledged a step forward in the fight against Ebola that has lasted more than a year.

"The new response strategy is starting to take effect, especially in the city of Goma, which is now immune to the virus. Although much has been done, the epidemic is not yet eradicated. The strategy will be strengthened by the introduction of 5 new approved drugs, in addition to the Ebola vaccine, which will completely eliminate this scourge," he said.
