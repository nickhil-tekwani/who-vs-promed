Influenza update no 188
-----------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in the northern hemisphere temperate zones decreased to low levels.
- Similarly, influenza activity decreased in most regions of tropical Asia except for Sri Lanka and Viet Nam where activity of influenza A continued increasing.
- In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity remained low or similar compared to previous weeks, except in Cuba and the Dominican Republic where increasing influenza activity was reported.
- Influenza activity in the southern hemisphere started to increase slightly in South America and in South Africa but remained low in Oceania. In South America, respiratory syncytial virus remained the predominant circulating virus, but the proportion of influenza positive viruses was increasing.
- For information on H7N9 in China, please see link: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
-------------
Overall influenza activity in North America has continued to decrease to low levels throughout most of the region.

In Canada, the percentage of positive influenza tests continued to decline, with 3.4 percent testing positive in the last week of May [2013]. Influenza B remained the most prevalent circulating influenza virus. The national influenza-like-illness (ILI) consultation rate has remained stable during the last 8 weeks, but was still above the expected range for the past 5 weeks.

In the United States of America (USA), influenza activity continued to decline and has returned to inter-seasonal levels. Nationally, the proportion of ILI outpatient consultations decreased to 0.9 percent, below the national baseline of 2.2 percent. Of 2746 specimens tested and reported by collaborating laboratories, 177 (6.5 percent) were positive for influenza. Influenza B remained the most prevalent circulating influenza virus.

Mexico has reported relatively stable influenza activity over the last few weeks with the majority being influenza A(H3N2). From mid-May [2013] to the 1st week of June [2013], 7.5 percent of specimens tested positive for influenza. Among the positive specimens, 71.5 percnet of those were influenza A(H3N2).

Europe
------
Influenza activity continued to decline in Europe and is now at inter-seasonal levels of transmission for the region. Consultation rates for ILI and acute respiratory infection (ARI) were at low levels for all countries in the region. Of the specimens collected from sentinel sites, 2 out of 98 (2 percent) tested positive for influenza. Of the 116 influenza virus detections reported since 20 May [2013], 66 percent were characterized as influenza B.

Northern Africa and the Western Asia region
-------------------------------------------
Influenza activity seems to be at inter-seasonal levels in Northern Africa and Western Asia region. Most countries in the Western Asia region have mainly detected influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 throughout the season, with the exception of Jordan and Pakistan which reported a majority of influenza B, especially in the last several weeks.

Northern Asia
-------------
Influenza activity in much of the temperate region of Asia has decreased gradually over the past several weeks and has [been approaching] inter-seasonal levels.

In China, as of [30 May 2013], 132 cases of influenza A(H7N9) have been identified, of which 39 have died; more and updated information will be posted at: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/en/index.html

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In both the Caribbean and Central America, influenza activity remained low and/or similar compared to previous weeks, except in Cuba and the Dominican Republic where high influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 activity was reported. Acute respiratory illness in countries remained low or within expected levels, with the proportion of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) hospitalizations at 2.6 percent.

Cuba reported increasing influenza activity, with 35.7 percent of 462 specimens testing positive for influenza viruses since mid-May [2013]. Of those that were positive for influenza A, 96 percent were influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 and the remaining were influenza A(H3N2). Rhinovirus and para-influenza are also circulating in Cuba. Influenza activity also increased in the Dominican Republic; out of 218 samples tested, the proportion testing positive for influenza increased from 14.6 percent 4 weeks ago to 75 percent in the most current week, with influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 being the most detected virus. Since January 2013, 9 deaths due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were reported, including 4 pregnant women.

In tropical South America, ARI activity remained at the same levels, except in Colombia and Venezuela, where influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 continued to circulate.

In Colombia, the proportion of SARI hospitalizations and SARI ICU admissions continued to increase. Of the 436 specimens analyzed in the past 2 weeks, 27 percent tested positive for all respiratory viruses. 48 percent of those that tested positive for all respiratory viruses were influenza A(H1N1)pmd09.

Venezuela has reported increased ARI activity above the epidemic threshold for this time of year and the trend for reported pneumonia cases also increased in the last few weeks but remains at expected levels. Of the samples that were positive for influenza, 84.2 percent were due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by influenza A(H3N2).

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
Many countries in the Central African tropical region reported low activity, with the exception of Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya and Madagascar in the past few weeks. Cameroon and Cote d'Ivoire reported co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B, while Kenya detected influenza B and A(H3N2).

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate countries of South America
------------------------------------
In temperate South America, acute respiratory illness activity continued to increase and was reported as close to or at the epidemic threshold in the southern cone. Increased influenza-like-illness (ILI) and SARI activity was mainly due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but the proportion of influenza positive viruses increased, with co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).

Influenza activity in Argentina continued to follow the curve of what is expected for this time of year. Of the 2445 samples analyzed in Argentina since [1 Jun 2013], 43 percent were positive for a respiratory virus. Of those that tested positive, 57 percent were due to RSV and 18 percent to influenza A(H1N1)pmd09.

Influenza activity in Chile also increased, although RSV continued to be the most prevalent virus detected. The national ILI consultation rate continued to show an increasing trend and is now at the epidemic threshold level. Among the 2405 samples collected, 31 percent were positive for respiratory viruses. Among the positive samples, 40 percent were RSV, 18 percent parainfluenza, 17 percent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 12 percent influenza A not subtyped.

Paraguay reported increased ILI consultation rates. Of the 289 samples analyzed since [1 Jun 2013], 35 percent tested positive for respiratory viruses. Among the positive samples, RSV (76 percent) and influenza A(H3N2) (15 percent) were the most detected viruses, followed by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. Among the 109 samples from SARI cases, RSV was the most detected virus.

In Uruguay, the proportions of SARI hospitalizations and SARI-related ICU admissions increased over the last weeks. Among 46 samples processed since [1 Jun 2013], 26 percent tested positive for respiratory viruses and 4 percent for influenza viruses. RSV was the most detected virus.

Temperate countries of South Africa
-----------------------------------
In South Africa, increasing trends of ILI and SARI cases have been reported. Influenza activity continued to increase since the season started in late April [2013]. Influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 was the predominant circulating virus, constituting 35.6 percent of the 464 samples collected from sentinel sites in 9 provinces.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
--------------------------------
Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands continued to report low influenza activity.

During 2 to 8 Jun 2013 in Australia, of 234 ILI samples received, 3 were positive for influenza A(H1N1) pdm09, 3 for influenza A(H3) and 1 for influenza B (lineage not determined). In New Zealand, during 3 to 9 Jun 2013, influenza activity continued to remain below the baseline threshold. 15 out of 202 samples received were positive for influenza: 12 were influenza B (lineage not determined), 1 was influenza A(H1N1)pdmo9 and 2 influenza A (not subtyped).
