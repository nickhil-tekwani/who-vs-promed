[The outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis included in these updates have the
characteristics of "winter vomiting disease", and are presumed to be caused
by Norwalk-like viruses (i.e. caliciviruses classified in the genus
_Norovirus_), although this is rarely confirmed microbiologically. The UK
and Ireland seem to be particularly prone to outbreaks of "winter-vomiting"
disease in institutional settings. - Mod.CP]

Scotland: Three Deaths in Hospital Outbreaks in Fife
----------------------------------------------------
Three elderly patients have died following outbreaks of diarrhoea and
vomiting in Fife hospitals. Health officials said 2 women in their late
seventies and a man in his early eighties had already been seriously ill
when they caught infections. Officials revealed that the 3 patients at
Whyteman's Brae Hospital in Kirkcaldy died at the weekend.
A Fife Health Board spokeswoman said 60 patients and 40 members of staff
have shown symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting over the past 2 weeks. While
the majority of patients were suffering from viral infection some had an
antibiotic-related illness resulting from _Clostridium difficile_ [ _C.
difficile_ is associated with a pseudomembranous colitis, producing severe
diarrhea. Illness is seen after antibiotic therapy for other illnesses. -
Mod.MPP]. Most of the wards affected by the outbreaks have now reopened and
the remaining 2, Raith ward at Whyteman's and Ward Five at Queen Margaret
Drive, in Dunfermline, were expected to reopen on Wednesday. Some patients
at Victoria Hospital, in Kirkcaldy, were also taken ill. NHS Fife said
members of an outbreak control team which was set up were satisfied that
appropriate measures to tackle the infections were put in place. Medical
director Dr David Fraser, said: "Viral infections are often brought into
hospitals from the community." General good hygiene, especially regular
hand washing, has been highlighted as an important factor in preventing the
spread of these infections. "Precautions are in place to prevent further
spread and we are considering what further measures need to be taken to
prevent recurrence." Hospital staff and visitors have been reminded about
the importance of thorough hand washing.

Scotland : Winter Vomiting Disease Closes Wards in Two Glasgow Hospitals
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wards at 2 Glasgow hospitals have been closed to new admissions due to a
fresh outbreak of "winter vomiting" illness. Nine patients and 3 staff have
been affected at the Victoria Infirmary and the Southern General Hospital.
The outbreak is the third to strike the Victoria Infirmary, on the city's
south side, this year. A spokesman for the South Glasgow Hospitals NHS
Trust said: "The 2 wards at the Victoria Infirmary and one ward at the
Southern General Hospital have stopped taking new admissions due to a small
number of patients having diarrhoea."
Meanwhile, a ward at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, Fife, has been
closed after 4 patients and 3 members of staff showed symptoms which
include diarrhoea and vomiting. Tests are being carried out to determine
whether this is a viral infection or antibiotic-related bacteria. Earlier
this week it emerged that 3 elderly patients had died following outbreaks
of diarrhoea and vomiting in Fife hospitals. Health officials said 2 women
in their late seventies and a man in his early eighties had already been
seriously ill when they caught infections at Whyteman's Brae Hospital in
Kirkcaldy. Fife Health Board said 60 patients and 40 members of staff had
shown symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting over the previous two weeks. The
majority of patients were suffering from viral infection, while
some had an antibiotic-related illness resulting from _Clostridium
difficile_. Five wards at Whyteman's Brae Hospital, Queen Margaret
Hospital and the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy were closed as a result of
the outbreak. Hospital staff and visitors have been reminded of the
importance of thorough hand washing.

England: Hospital Outbreaks in the West Midlands
-------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of people have been struck by a sickness epidemic which has forced
the closure of at least 12 wards in hospitals across the West
Midlands. Nursing and residential homes for the elderly have also been hit
by the outbreak of viral gastroenteritis which is threatening to throw
hospital admissions into chaos. Four wards have already been closed to new
admissions at Walsall Manor Hospital while a further three have been shut
at Birmingham's City Hospital and Rowley Regis Hospital. Bosses at Sandwell
Hospital have so far quarantined one ward, along with New Cross Hospital in
Wolverhampton. Patients at Heartlands, Good Hope and Selly Oak hospitals
have also been struck down with the diarrhoea and sickness bug which is
thought to have been spreading for the past 2 weeks. John Rostill, chief
executive at Walsall Manor Hospital, said: "It puts more pressure on us
because we don't want to move the staff caring for patients with
gastroenteritis." West Midlands Ambulance Service was called in to help
struggling casualty units on Monday when City Hospital and a number of
Black Country hospitals closed their doors to emergency admissions for up
to an hour. Lorene Read, director of operations at Sandwell and West
Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs City Hospital in Dudley Road,
said some staff had also been affected by the illness. "We're going to see
that start to impact on accident and emergency," she said. Dr John Kemm,
consultant in public health medicine for the Department of Health, said:
"People need to be extra careful about making sure everything they handle
is clean. They need to be particularly careful about washing their hands."

Salford: Suspected Norwalk virus Infection Closes Hospital Wards
----------------------------------------------------------------
Seven wards have been closed at a hospital in Salford, Greater Manchester,
after 120 patients and staff became ill with a viral infection. It is
thought to be caused by Norwalk virus infection, which leads to sickness
and diarrhoea. A spokeswoman for the Salford Royal Hospitals NHS Trust
said: "We will be re-assessing the situation over the weekend before
deciding the next step." Visitors are being urged to stay away if they have
been ill themselves or have been in contact with anyone suffering from the
infection.
Hope Hospital in Salford has also stopped non-emergency operations.

Ireland: Norwalk-like virus Infection on the Increase
-----------------------------------------------------
A tiny virus is wreaking havoc on the healthcare and tourism sector. While
it is commonly called the winter vomiting bug, Norwalk-Like viruses can hit
victims at any time of the year. The National Disease Suveillance Centre
(NDSC) estimates about 40 000 are infected by the highly contagious bug
every year. But while the spread of the disease can be controlled, it can
never be wiped out completely, NDSC public health medicine specialist Paul
McKeown said he was surprised hospitals and health boards had dealt so well
with what was a very infectious organism. All of the hospitals and health
boards affected by the virus are strictly following international guidelines.
The winter vomiting disease was first described in 1929 and has had many
name changes since then. It is a viral gastroenteritis now known to be
caused by Norwalk-Like viruses. Norwalk-like viruses are typically
associated with outbreaks of self-limited gastroenteritis with symptoms
that may include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever and
malaise. Dr McKeown said: "There have always been outbreaks of winter
vomiting or gastric 'flu, but in the last couple of years in Ireland and
throughout the rest of Europe there has been a 50-100% increase in the
number of reported cases. "This disease waxes and wanes so some years it
will be worse than others. What we are seeing now is a period where there
are more cases than there has been previously and, hopefully, this will
reverse in the future."
Britain has been collecting statistics on the illness for quite some
time. Their figures show an increase of 50% over last year. Dr McKeown
said Ireland was learning more about the disease from each outbreak and
from observing how neighboring countries were dealing with it. The NDSC has
already assisted the tourism sector in developing guidelines on dealing
with the disease.
Dr McKeown said: "The bottom line is this disease is not eradicable but we
can control it to a certain extent and it is important that we do because
we have seen the effect it can have on healthcare and tourism. It is a
major irritation. Dr McKeown recommends that people who catch the bug
should stay out of work for at a minimum of three days to stop the spread
of the virus to colleagues. The NDSC is also recommending that infected
people avoid going to hospital or their GP's surgery: "Of course, they
should contact their doctors but any arrangement should be aimed at
containing the virus." Anyone who is infected does not build up a permanent
resistance: "People develop a short-term immunity for up to 14 weeks but
they can become infected more than once."

[There is some confusion among clinicians regarding the naming of the
viruses associated with "Winter Vomiting Illness". The designation
"Norwalk-like viruses" was adopted by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as the temporary genus name for a collection of
related caliciviruses associated with viral gastroenteritis. The genus
takes its name from the type species _Norwalk virus_, which was the first
of these viruses to be characterized in any detail. The Norwalk-like
viruses are now considered to be a coherent group and the formal genus name
_Norovirus_ was recently approved by the ICTV. It is likely that the short
duration of immunity following recovery and the variable incidence from
year-to-year are reflections of the antigenic and biological heterogeneity
of the noroviruses. Initially these viruses were associated with localized
food and water-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in North America, but in
recent years in Europe they have been associated with extensive outbreaks
of vomiting disease in institutional settings. It is unclear at present
whether this is due to genetic difference in the virus strains in
circulation or to other epidemiological factors. The above reports indicate
that outbreaks of "winter-vomiting " disease are being experienced in
hospitals throughout the length and breadth of the British Isles at the
present time. - Mod.CP]
