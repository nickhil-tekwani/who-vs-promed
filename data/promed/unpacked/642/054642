The Genome of a Bacillus Isolate Causing Anthrax in Chimpanzees
Combines Chromosomal Properties of _B. cereus_ with _B. anthracis_

Abstract
Anthrax is a fatal disease caused by strains of _Bacillus anthracis_.
Members of this monophyletic species are nonmotile and are all
characterized by the presence of 4 prophages and a nonsense mutation
in the plc Rregulator gene. Here, we report the complete genome
sequence of a Bacillus strain isolated from a chimpanzee that had
died with clinical symptoms of anthrax.

Unlike classic _B. anthracis_, this strain was motile and lacked the
4 prohages and the nonsense mutation. Four replicons were identified,
a chromosome and 3 plasmids. Comparative genome analysis revealed
that the chromosome resembles those of non-_B. anthracis_ members of
the _Bacillus cereus_ group, whereas 2 plasmids were identical to the
Anthrax virulence plasmids pXO1 and pXO2. The function of the newly
discovered 3rd plasmid with a length of 14 kbp is unknown. A detailed
comparison of genomic loci encoding key features confirmed a higher
similarity to _B. thuringiensis_ Serovar konkukian strain 97-27 and
_B. cereus_ E33L than to _B. anthracis_ strains.

For the 1st time, we describe the sequence of an anthrax-causing
bacterium possessing both anthrax plasmids that apparently does not
belong to the monophyletic group of all so far known _B. anthracis_
strains and that differs in important diagnostic features. The data
suggest that this bacterium has evolved from a _B. cereus_ strain
independently from the classic _B. anthracis_ strains and established
a _B. anthracis_ life style. Therefore, we suggest to designate this
isolate as "_B. cereus_ variety (var.) anthracis_."
