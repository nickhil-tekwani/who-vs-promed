The government decided Monday [17 May 2010] to dispatch more
Self-Defense Forces members to Miyazaki to help tackle the outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the southwestern Japan prefecture.

At the 1st meeting of its task force of all Cabinet ministers, the
government also decided to expand areas in the prefecture to be
disinfected to cope with the escalating outbreak.

The Finance Ministry is eyeing spending about 10 billion yen [USD
108.19], but the figure may swell, as the outbreak has caused the
worst damage from the disease in Japan.

As of Sunday [16 May 2010], more than 110 farms and facilities in the
prefecture have been found to have cows, pigs and other livestock
suspected of being infected with the disease, with a total of more
than 85 000 domesticated animals subject to slaughtering, according
to the prefecture.

At the 1st meeting at the prime minister's office, Prime Minister
Yukio Hatoyama vowed to "make utmost efforts" to prevent the spread
of the disease and provide support to farmers.

"We have to create a situation to reassure farmers hit by the disease
and people in Miyazaki Prefecture over this problem," Hatoyama said.
"We'd like to make steady efforts to seek an early solution through
cooperation between the local and central governments."

The government also decided to assign about 20 government officials
including the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry's senior
vice minister and an assistant to the prime minister to the task
force at the prefectural office to prevent further spread of the disease.

The task force's main assignments include providing financial support
to farmers and making arrangements with related ministries, according
to Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano.

Senior Vice Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda told a news conference
that the government plans to utilize reserves in the fiscal 2010
budget to deal with the problem.

[According to the last update from the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries, issued 16 May 2010, the total number of
affected farms has reached 111, including 2 cattle holdings in the
most recently affected Takanabe. The accumulated numbers of culled
animals are 77 511 swine and 8212 cattle, totalling 85 723 animals.

The 4 locations so far reported as FMD-affected in the Miyazaki
prefecture, namely Kawaminami (the biggest cluster), Ebino, Tsuno and
Takanabe, can be found on the map at

49 breeding bulls for the famous Miyazaki brand of beef and their
offspring will be slaughtered following an outbreak of FMD in
Miyazaki Prefecture, it has been learned.

On Sunday [16 May 2010], the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries and the Miyazaki Prefectural Government announced that it
was likely the disease had infected livestock at the Miyazaki
Livestock Improvement Association in Takanabe, which handles breeding
bulls for the Miyazaki beef brand. It is the 1st time for breeding
bulls for a designated brand of beef to be slaughtered.

In addition to the 49 breeding bulls, 259 head of commercial cattle
born to the bulls which had been monitored for meat quality will also
be slaughtered.

Prefectural officials said that 5 head of commercial cattle at the
Livestock Improvement Association showed signs of FMD on Friday [14
May 2010]. A survey conducted by the National Institute of Animal
Health confirmed that all of them had the disease.

Another 6 breeding bulls that provide about 90 percent of the semen
supplied to farmers for artificial insemination of their livestock
were earlier evacuated. Genetic testing indicated that they had not
been infected, and they will not be slaughtered [see commentary].

Officials said signs of the disease among cattle and pigs had also
been detected at the neighboring Miyazaki Prefectural Farmers Academy
and areas in the towns of Kawaminami and Tsuno, with 20 farms affected overall.

Altogether, the number of animals to be slaughtered has risen to 85
723. Included are 2 goats that were being raised at the Prefectural
Farmers Academy. The Miyazaki Prefectural Government has placed
restrictions on the movement of livestock around the Livestock
Improvement Association.

More than 110 farms in the Miyazaki region have been quarantined
after livestock have been found to be infected with the disease --
the 1st time it has occurred in Japan since 2000 -- and 85 000
animals have already been slaughtered or earmarked to be put down.

That figure includes 49 bulls with just 6 cattle from the region
moved out of the affected districts, according to local agriculture
officials. The surviving bulls have shown no signs of the disease as
of yet; their health is being closely monitored [But see item 2
above, claiming infection at the Miyazaki Livestock Improvement
Association. - Mod.AS].

Miyazaki Wagyu beef has attracted a global following due its flavour,
tenderness and fatty, marbled texture. Entire restaurants are given
over to the delicacy, which is usually prepared as a steak, as thin
strips of meat that are boiled and served with vegetables, or cooked
on a "teppanyaki" hotplate in front of the customer [picture at
<http://www.downundergenetics.com/images/Maifuku.jpg>].

One kilogram (2.2 lbs) of top-grade beef can wholesale for more than
BP 220 [USD 325.00], with a meal in a restaurant an occasion to
remember for the impact on the wallet as much as the taste of the beef.

The Japanese have enjoyed the delicacy for decades, but it is only in
the last few years that it has become popular in the rest of the
world. It is now served at top Parisian restaurants, and in 2006,
Selfridges, the London department store, introduced the BP 85 Wagyu sandwich.

Many ranchers feed their cattle beer every day, massage their flanks
with sake, take extreme care in brushing their hides and feed the
beasts on grain fodder. All of which helps to make the meat melt in
the mouth, the experts say.

Around 35 tons of prime meat is exported from Miyazaki every year,
although that trade will be hard hit this year [2010] after
agriculture officials halted exports. That ban on exports will be in
place for at least 3 months.

Authorities have increased their efforts to control the outbreak of
FMD, with an emergency task force swinging into action, with parts of
the countryside cordoned off and agricultural vehicles required to
undergo thorough disinfection procedures.

Experts have been unable to pinpoint the cause of the outbreak, which
was 1st detected on 20 Apr 2010.

As well as affecting farmers, the outbreak has forced Phoenix Zoo, in
Miyazaki City, to close in order to protect its antelopes, camels and
giraffes from contracting the disease.

[The evacuation of the 6 pedigree Wagyu bulls from the Takanabe
breeding institute/AI centre has been reported in posting
20100515.1597 (item 2). According to complementary information,
kindly collected by our dedicated communicator Kunihiko Iizuka from
various local sources, the 6 bulls were initially scheduled to move
to a newly built farm in Nisimera village, some 40 km west of the
institute. While underway, it was found that there were 3 nearby
livestock farms, and they were redirected to another farm in Saito
city, closer (20 km) to the institute. Altogether, they travelled
about 60 km during 2 days. It remains to be hoped that they had not
been infected in the institute prior to evacuation with special
clearance from MAFF. Reportedly, the bulls tested PCR negative just
before departure.

The need to move these animals, in order to salvage the highly
valuable if not irreplaceable genetic source, demonstrates the dire
straits in which the Japanese animal breeders find themselves due to
the rapid and extensive spread of the virus. This incident will,
undoubtedly, become one of the issues to be analysed when the time
for lessons to be learned arrives. Internationally accepted
alternatives to culling of valuable breeding stock or endangered
species in FMD-free countries, e.g. by vaccination and/or prescribed,
special biosecurity measures, deserve consideration. Such measures
could be developed, for example, in accordance with the stipulations
described in OIE's Code chapter 4.3 "Zoning and
compartmentalisation;" (see at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.4.3.htm>). - Mod.AS]
