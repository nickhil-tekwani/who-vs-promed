The 4 deaths that were reported in the Kingdom due to dengue fever over the
past 2 months have raised alarm among health officials.
"The number of deaths is high considering the time frame and the fact that
dengue is rarely fatal. This requires us to research the causes in order to
prevent further deaths," Yaqoub Al-Mazrou, deputy minister of health for
preventive medicine, said yesterday.
In 2004 there were 291 cases and 2 fatalities. In 2005 there were 305 cases
without deaths. In the first 2 months of 2006 there were 143 cases and 4
deaths, he said. Health officials have stepped up efforts to combat dengue.
Al-Mazrou was speaking at a joint press conference at the municipality
building in downtown Jeddah with Mayor Adel Faqeeh and Yaser Al-Ghamdi,
director of health affairs in the Makkah Region.
Al-Ghamdi said that there are no vaccines for the disease and preventive
measures are the only way to combat it. "It is not a deadly disease, and it
rarely lasts for more than 7 days," he pointed out.
He noted that dengue is a seasonal disease that increases during winter
when still water is not as likely to evaporate quickly. The most dangerous
places for dengue is anywhere near the still water where the mosquitoes
breed, such as puddles at construction sites. The government, he said, is
making use of the Singapore experience on combating the disease. They are
buying 300 Ovi Traps from Singapore.
Al-Ghamdi noted that in 2005 there were 300 reported cases in the Kingdom,
compared with 15 000 cases in Singapore. "The Singapore experience proved
its success (in reducing the number of dengue deaths) and we are confident
it would be helpful to us as well," he said.
Mayor Faqeeh noted that the city has located 150 large still water sites
around Jeddah and that most of them were dried or filled. "The rest of the
sites would be dealt with over the next two weeks," he said.
The municipality, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, has started
a public-awareness campaign. The mayor said that the current SR5 million
[USD 1.3 million] annual budget for the campaign is expected to increase to
SR20 million [USD 5.3 million]. So far they have distributed 2 million
pamphlets and awareness booklets about the disease in addition to sending
SMS messages, he said.
Al-Mazrou noted that the disease was first registered in the Kingdom in
1994, when more than 400 cases were reported. "Through collaborative work
we managed to eliminate it within 12 months," he said, adding that they are
confident they can [eliminate it more quickly].

Cases of dengue in Bacolod City may have increased last year [2005]
compared with those in 2004 but fewer deaths were related to the disease in
2005 than in 2004.
Meanwhile, there were only 251 cases of typhoid in 2005 [compared] to 513
in 2004.
Records from the City Health Office [CHO] show that the total reported
cases of dengue in 2005 was 909, compared with the 467 in 2004, but there
were only 3 reported deaths in 2005 and 5 in 2004. The highest recorded
number of cases of dengue in Bacolod City was 1542 in 1998.
CHO Statistician Warlito Vallente yesterday said the top 10 barangays with
the highest number of dengue cases are Taculing with 89, Mansilingan 84,
Villamonte 71, Estefania 64, Mandalagan 63, Alijis 57, Banago 54, Singcang
49, Bata 45, and Sum-ag and Tangub with 34 each. Bacolod City Health
Officer Dr Idilleon Isidto yesterday attributed the lower death rate in
2005 to the education campaign his office has been conducting in the barangays.
He said the CHO resumed its operation against dengue [in February 2005]
because of the rainy weather. It continues to conduct fogging operations in
barangays where there are reported cases on dengue, he added.
Isidto said he is reminding the public to keep surroundings clean at all
times and rid them of possible breeding places of mosquitoes. He said
stagnant water should be treated with salt or used oil [The measures do not
appear environmentally sound. Why not advise residents to remove all
stagnant water? - Mod.RY]
Meanwhile, Vallente said the barangays with the highest number of typhoid
cases in 2005 are Villamonte with 27, Estefania and Granada with 19 cases
each, Mansilingan 17, Alijis and Taculing with 16 each, Mandalagan and
Tangub with 12 cases each, and Banago and Singcang with 10 cases each.
The number of reported typhoid-related deaths was 5 in 2005 and 7 in 2004.
