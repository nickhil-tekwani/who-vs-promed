The Marathon County Health Department is investigating a cluster of
blastomycosis cases in the village of Weston, but officials are
refusing to say exactly where the outbreak is. County Health Officer
Joan Theurer said Fri 10 Sep 2010, that releasing specific
information would give people "a false sense of security."

"Just because nobody who got diagnosed is in your neighborhood
doesn't mean you couldn't be affected," Theurer said. "It really
serves no public interest in releasing that level of detailed
information."

The Wausau Daily Herald filed an open records request with the health
department, seeking more specific information about the location of
the clusters.

Local hospitals have reported 50 cases of the fungal infection in
Marathon County so far in 2010, twice the number of cases reported in
all of 2009. The usually rare infection can develop when people
breathe in spores released into the air by fungus that can cause
long-term health problems or death.

Weston Administrator Dean Zuleger said that county officials are
focusing on land close to Machmueller Park at the northeast corner of
the village. Theurer refused to comment on Zuleger's assessment of
the location.

Weston Community Development Director Jennifer Higgins said the
village received an e-mail from the county's health department on 3
Sep 2010, informing village leaders that clusters of the disease had
been found in the town of Wausau and in Weston. But the county also
has refused to give her additional information, she said.

Ruth Marx, an epidemiologist with the county's Health Department,
said the Weston cases largely fall within one subdivision, but she
also refused to release the name of that community. "The persons'
addresses are protected medical information, and (blastomycosis) can
have an impact on property values," Marx said.

The trouble for scientists and residents alike is how little is known
about preventing blastomycosis. And while treatment is available,
symptoms can easily be mistaken for another illness or injury in
people and animals.

In Marathon County, the disease has been found in multiple members of
households and in unusual patients, especially men younger than 50
years old and women and children of any age, catching the attention
of state and national experts.

The county health department, along with the Wisconsin Department of
Health Services and the CDC, began a study of the cases in Marathon
County this summer [2010].

[_Blastomyces dermatitidis_ is a dimorphic fungus endemic in the USA.

Dimorphic fungi exist in the environment (at ambient temperature) as
a mold and in its animate host (at body temperature) as a yeast. As
with _Histoplasma capsulatum_ and _Coccidioides immitis_, _B.
dermatitidis_ has endemic areas in the USA (or elsewhere) with
primary infection in the lungs due to inhalation of spores which is
often subclinical. Each fungus can sometimes disseminate outside the
lungs, especially in immunoincompetent hosts.

The endemic area of blastomycosis is less well defined as the other 2
dimorphic fungi but, based on sporadic cases or clusters of infection
in humans and/or dogs, appears to primarily consist of the
Mississippi and Ohio River valleys of the south central and
Midwestern USA as well as the area on both sides of the St Lawrence
river involving both the USA and Canada. Of note, north central
Wisconsin, the location of Marathon County, has been the source of a
number of reported clusters of this infection.

The tissue form of this infection is a characteristic yeast with a
refractile cell wall and single broad-based budding (see
