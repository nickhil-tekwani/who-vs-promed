Outbreak of aseptic viral meningitis in Germany
-----------------------------------------------
In week 33 (11-17 Aug 2001) the health office of Kassel, a city in the
German state of Hesse, received notifications from 2 hospitals in northern
Hesse of an increased number of cases of aseptic meningitis. In all 15
children and 10 adults had been admitted with symptoms including severe
headache, fever, neck stiffness, and vomiting. All were discharged after 2
to 4 days.
The health office of Kassel initiated an outbreak investigation to identify
the causative agent, describe the extent and severity of the outbreak, and
identify and exclude potential risk factors. Active case finding among
resident general practitioners and in hospitals in the city resulted in the
identification of 68 patients with aseptic viral meningitis from the Kassel
and neighbouring districts. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all 68 patients
was analysed for suspected bacterial meningitis. This diagnosis was ruled
out because of an absence of bacterial strains and an only moderately
raised cell count of lymphocytes in the CSF.
The first notified patient had been admitted on 15 Jul 2001. On 31 Jul
2001, for the first time more than 2 patients with aseptic meningitis were
admitted in one day. The number of admissions peaked between 4 and 19 Aug
2001. The youngest patient was aged 3 years, the oldest 50. Of the 68
patients, Sixty per cent (41) were aged between 5 and 14 years; 40 (59%)
were male; 27 (40%) were from Kassel county district, 22 (32%) from Kassel
city, and 11 (16%) from the neighbouring Schwalm-Eder district; 2-3
patients each lived in several adjacent districts.
A case-control study is currently being conducted to identify potential
risk factors. Of 7 CSF specimens from 2 hospitals that were analysed at the
Nationales Referenzzentrum fur Poliomyelitis und Enteroviren (NRZ PE, the
national reference centre for polio and enteroviruses), polymerase chain
reaction for enteroviruses was positive for 6 specimens. Echovirus 30 was
cultured from 4 samples. The outbreak continues.
An increase in the number of cases of viral meningitis caused by echovirus
30 to week 33, 2001 was recently reported in the Communicable Disease Report
for England and Wales (1). The virus is transmitted mainly via the
faecal-oral route; transmission via nasopharyngeal secretions can occur in
the first phase of infection. Indirect transmission can occur through
contaminated water (surface water, swimming or paddling pools), foodstuffs,
or surfaces. Handwashing is recommended as an effective preventive measure.
Eurosurveillance Weekly Editorial note:
Echovirus 30 is one of the more common echovirus types and is endemic in
the United Kingdom and probably most of Europe. It is associated
particularly with viral meningitis. This virus has caused a large epidemic
in England and Wales this year, following a smaller one in 2000.
A clear pattern is characteristic of these viruses [see figure in original
article. In 1996, a small epidemic occurred in summer. By the middle of
winter, however, the numbers reported returned to the baseline, and the
outbreak did not recur the following year. In 2000, another similar-sized
outbreak occurred, but during the winter months, numbers reported stayed
well above the baseline. When this happens, a recurrence of the outbreak in
the following summer can fairly safely be predicted, and this is what has
happened. This characteristic pattern has been described previously (2).
The epidemic in England and Wales is large enough to have induced a
detectable increase in cases of viral meningitis. To week 33 this year, 477
cases were notified, compared with 336 and 142 in the equivalent periods of
2000 and 1999, respectively. Echovirus meningitis tends to affect mainly
older children and young adults. Outbreaks of enteroviral infection are
rarely attributable to a point source such as a foodstuff, or swimming in a
lake, river, or pool. In countries where mumps vaccine has been extensively
used, enteroviruses will become even more predominant as a cause of viral
meningitis. Fortunately, most cases of viral meningitis, unlike some forms
of viral encephalitis, are benign (3).
