At Least 40 People Diagnosed With Legionnaires' Disease
-------------------------------------------------------
Investigators were scouring ventilation and water systems for the source of
bacteria that have infected at least 40 people [causing Legionnaires'
disease, health officials said Thursday. At least 4 of the victims are in
serious condition, said Joan Guix, director of Barcelona's Health
Department. Twenty-nine other people have been under medical observation
since falling ill Monday, and 7 new cases were detected Thursday, city
officials said.
All the victims, whose ages range between 38 and 92, live in the
19th-century fishing neighborhood of Barceloneta, an area that is home to
many elderly people on Barcelona's Mediterranean waterfront.
Apart from living in the same area of Spain's second-largest city, the
infected have no lifestyle habits in common to help find the source of the
disease, city health officials said.
Chemical analyses of several air conditioning water towers in the
neighborhood were being [performed Thursday and water samples from cooling
systems on top of hotels, office and residential buildings were being checked.
