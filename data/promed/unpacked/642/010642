Bananas Offer Hope in White Nose Syndrome Treatment
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The spread of white nose syndrome (WNS) across the United States has devastated bat populations, with some caves losing more than 90 percent of their occupants to the pernicious fungal disease. Until very recently, researchers working on the issue weren't quite sure of the cause -- beyond knowing that the fungus responsible for the infection is called _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ -- and they hadn't come up with a good solution, either. This year, that's changed, in a serendipitous incidence of scientific research on something else altogether that proved useful in managing fungal infections.

_P. destructans_ is particularly sneaky because it starts to move in when bats have started hibernating. The fungus slowly spreads across the nose, mouth and wings, and when the bat wakes up, it can be dizzy, disoriented, thirsty and hungry. Infected bats are desperate to restart their bodies after hibernation, but the fungus doesn't allow them to do so, and the results have been devastating as bats die by the millions. It's not just a tragedy for bat populations. It could also wreak havoc on U.S. crops, as bats are natural pollinators, and the work they do in the fields is worth billions of dollars. As the infection spreads steadily across the country, it's making biologists and agricultural researchers extremely nervous.

Here's where the bananas come into the picture. Researchers at the University of Georgia were looking for innovative ways to keep fruit stable during transport, so it wouldn't ripen and be destroyed while on the move. They wanted to find a way to slow the ripening process to keep fruit in good shape as it headed for the grocery store, and their research surrounded a bacterium known as _Rhodococcus rhodochrous_, which produces volatile organic compounds that keep fruit fresh. Along the way, they found something very interesting: When they treated fruit with the bacteria to slow ripening, those fruits also didn't mold, suggesting that the bacterium acts as an anti-fungal.

A graduate student took note of the phenomenon and realized that it might have some implications for the management of white nose syndrome -- if a bacterium naturally inhibits fungal growth on plants, why not on animals, too? He isolated samples of the fungus found on infected bats and exposed them to the bacterium, and found that it was stunningly effective. Purely by accident, the researchers had found a way to inhibit fungal growth on fruit -- another serious concern when it comes to keeping fruit safe and salable -- and a way to treat a troubling and aggressive infection that had previously been insurmountable.

The researchers are aware that this isn't a magic bullet, and they need to do considerable work before calling things a success. While they did release a colony of bats successfully treated for the infection, it could take time to roll out a sufficient amount of bacteria. In addition, using bacteria in what is known as a "biocontrol" could come with significant implications, because the researchers need to understand everything the bacteria does before introducing it into the wild. It may have unintended consequences beyond conveniently killing off aggressive fungi, and biologists don't want to create more problems than they solve by being hasty. For example, the bacteria might be a broad-spectrum anti-fungal with the potential to kill benign local fungus that's important for cave ecology, and that's not desirable.

This is an important 1st step, though, as it could pave the way to an effective treatment for infected bats. Saving the bat population and helping it rise back up to previous population levels is important, as without bats, the world would be an infinitely poorer place.

[ProMED-mail post 20150528.3391146 reported on the development of _Rhodococcus rhodochrous_ as potential treatment for this disease. In fact, that post makes the statement: "This hopeful story may be an important 1st step in managing WNS. And its scientific backstory is just as fascinating."

Also this statement: "The bacterium does not cure WNS; it arrests the development of the fungus and inhibits its growth. But it is still a tremendous 1st step in finding ways to manage the disease."

So when I 1st read this story, I thought they had found a way to treat the bats without handling them all. This article does not address this, but is rather a limited update on the previous press release.

However, in bats that consume fruit, why not use the bacterium in/on the bananas and let the bats eat it? I am sure there are bats that will not eat it but if that is their 1st source of food, especially as they wake up weak, and it is close by, then it seems possible.

While that in itself seems like a daunting task, no doubt most bat habitats are mapped as researchers and foresters are keeping an eye on the bat population. - Mod.TG
