A San Diego County ranch owner says 23 show
horses have been poisoned by someone who fed them
highly toxic oleander leaves. Debbie Tomin, owner
of Rockridge Farm in Rancho Santa Fe, says 3
horses are seriously ill and are undergoing
treatment at an equine hospital. The other
horses, including 2 pregnant mares, are being treated at the ranch.

Tomin says workers discovered the sick American
Saddlebred horses Thursday morning [30 Jul 2009]
and a feed mix of sliced apples and carrots,
which disguised the bitter oleander. Tomin says
someone broke into the ranch overnight. The
sheriff's department is investigating.

The ranch has about 30 show horses worth about
USD 2 million. Of those, 4 are owned by the
ranch; the rest are boarded for clients.

[Oleander (_Nerium oleander_) contains the
cardioactive glycosides oleandrin and neriine.
All parts of the plant are toxic, but these
cardioactive glycosides are considered to be
highest in the sap. It is extremely toxic and is
reported to be bitter. Hungry animals will
consume almost anything. But it is unlikely that
apples and carrots disguised the bitterness of
the oleander. It is more likely the animals were
hungry and simply ignored the bitterness mixed in
with the carrots and apples which were a nice treat.

Because of its toxicity, let's hope the
authorities are conducting a thorough investigation of this malicious act.

The plant is so toxic that using a leafless
branch as a skewer to cook frankfurters over a
fire has been known to poison the consumer of the frankfurter.
