The Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department has bolstered
inspection and control measures against avian flu after one of 6 bird
carcasses found on Leighton Road, Causeway Bay, tested positive for the H5
virus.
Assistant Director of Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Dr Thomas Sit
told reporters today more tests are being conducted on the dead spotted
munias collected on 31 Dec 2006. He expects results in the coming days. As
they are a wild bird residing in Hong Kong, they are more vulnerable to
avian flu from January to March due to cross-contamination with migratory
birds.
The department has enhanced checks on farms and pet shops, with no abnormal
incidents observed so far. Farm and shop owners have been urged to be
vigilant and adopt bio-security measures, while their workers should ensure
good hygiene.
Meanwhile, inspection of imported poultry and market stalls will be
strengthened, and doctors will be informed of the latest situation. They
must notify the Centre for Health Protection of any suspected avian flu
cases. To stop people keeping backyard poultry, Dr Sit said a new round of
village inspections will be conducted. The aviaries in Hong Kong Park, the
Zoological & Botanical Gardens and Kowloon Park have been temporarily
closed. All the birds are healthy.
Precautionary measures and cleaning operations have been enhanced in all
Leisure & Cultural Services Department venues where birds congregate.
Dr Sit called on the public to ensure good hygiene, avoiding contact with
and feeding wild birds. People should wash their hands thoroughly. For more

[And from the submitter: "An interesting aspect of the most recent finding
of multiple dead munias in Hong Kong is that the "wild" bird species
involved here is also a common pet species marketed through both the
domestic and international pet trades in China, and that the HK government
is reportedly checking pet stores and aviaries for outbreaks in the wake of
this discovery.
Officials in Hong Kong appear to be acting on the possibility that these
birds could have been captive specimens dumped on the street by an owner or
trader after they died, rather than free-living wild birds.
Birds of this same genus (and perhaps species) were involved in the
outbreak that occurred in the UK quarantine facility in Essex, England
during October 2005.
