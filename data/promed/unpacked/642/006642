According to the European CDC, 11 confirmed cases of legionellosis
have been reported in travelers returning from the northern town of
Lazise, Verona Province (Veneto Region) since July 2011. Though the
exact source of infection has not yet been identified, 3 of the 4
accommodations were geographically clustered together, south of the
town center. Legionellosis should be considered in the differential
diagnosis of any traveler with fever and pneumonia within 2 weeks of
returning from Lazise.

[The following has been extracted from the U.S. CDC document
Travel-Associated Legionnaires' disease
(http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm):

"About 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is
travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and
to report because its identification implies the presence of an
environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely
to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with
travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by
individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically
disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.
Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients
with community-acquired pneumonia and _Legionella_ testing should be
performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of
symptoms. ....

"Environmental sampling/testing should only be conducted after careful
consideration of the epidemiologic evidence linking a case(s) to a
particular location."

The following article is linked to the CDC document: Barbaree JM, et
al: Protocol for Sampling Environmental Sites for Legionellae. Applied
Environmental Microbiol 1987; 53:1454-8
(http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/files/sampling_protocol1987.pdf):
"Since legionellae not related to disease may be found in many of the
sites sampled, an epidemiologic association with the probable source
should be established before intervention methods, such as
disinfection, are undertaken."

"Random sampling without an epidemiologic evaluation and comparing
isolates from the environment and from patients could lead to false
conclusions about sources of epidemic strains."

Potential environmental sampling sites for _Legionella_ spp that the
CDC document suggests include: internal surfaces of faucets, aerators,
and shower heads; and water from incoming water main, holding tanks
and cisterns, water heater tanks, decorative fountains, irrigation
equipment, fire sprinkler system (if recently used), whirlpools, and
spas. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without
linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be
demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates
with that of any clinical isolates to assure frequently costly
corrective measures are carried out on the actual source

Veneto is one of the 20 regions of Italy, with a population is about 5
million. It is located along the Adriatic coast in the northeastern
part of Italy and its capital is Venice. Lazise is a town along the
eastern shores of Lake Garda in the Province of Verona in the Veneto
region, with a population of 6213 in 2004. It is located about 120 km
(75 mi) west of Venice and about 20 km (12 mi) northwest of Verona
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise). A map of Italy on which the
Veneto region can be located is at
