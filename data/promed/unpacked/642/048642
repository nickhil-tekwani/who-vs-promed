Re: Ephemeral fever, bovine - international spread (02) : RFI
-------------------------------------------------------------
Before entering a debate on epidemiology of bovine ephemeral fever it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.

The 1st comprehensive study of ephemeral fever showed that intravenous injection of infected blood was necessary to guarantee transmission of disease. Susceptible cattle were used as the assay system (Mackerras et al 1940). This has continued to be the case.

Mosquitoes insert their mouthparts into a venule and infected saliva containing BEFV enters the bloodstream. Culicoides are pool feeders. Any virus in their saliva reaches the bloodstream via the lymphatics -- for example with bluetongue virus. [There is] direct evidence of the absence of BEFV in lymph of cattle after experimental intravenous infection with viraemic blood (1991 unpublished experiment cited in St.George 2008).

As live virus cannot reach the bloodstream from an intramuscular injection, neither can live vaccine virus, administered this way. It is thus irrelevant as a source of BEFV or international transfer of the virus. No evidence of a carrier state has ever been demonstrated and immunity is sterile.

Young (1979) showed clearly that the physical basis of BEF acute disease is characteristic of an antigen/antibody reaction. This reaction peaks on the 5th day post infection with the arrival of homotypic antibodies and contributes to the difficulty of isolating BEFV from blood. The very potent effects of BEFV are mediated through cytokines whose clinical effects can be nullified by treatment.

BEFV has been isolated from Culicine and Anopheline species of mosquito (St.George et al 1976). The isolation of BEFV from Culicoides species proves only that they can be infected but not that they are vectors. Only mosquitoes should be considered in the natural spread of disease [see comment]. Many species of mosquitoes must be involved in the spread of ephemeral fever as the disease exists in Asia, Africa and Australia.

Virus neutralisation tests are unreliable as a measure of prevalence of ephemeral fever. Cybinski (1987) demonstrated clearly that some of the antibodies in naturally exposed cattle are not due to BEFV infection but are heterotypically generated by infections with other ephemeroviruses. There are specific PCR tests available for serum surveys.

[Toby St. George's comments are appreciated; his indication of the BEF vector being culicines (mosquitoes) rather than culicoides, based upon studies in Australia, (see also his earlier comments in ProMED archive 20011019.2569), are supported by observations from South Africa (ref.1) and Israel (ref.2).

This does not necessarily exclude the possibility of windborne spread of the disease vector. A well-referenced 2009 review in Annual Review of Entomology (ref.3) includes data on long-distance, wind-blown mosquitoes which are potentially viral disease transmitters (in the case under discussion, Japanese Encephalitis Virus). The issue deserves further studies, particularly in recently-infected regions and with the local arthropod fauna.
