Occurrence of grapevine leaf spot caused by _ Pseudocercospora vitis_ in
Argentina

Argentina. Accepted for publication 4 Nov 2004
In the lowland, coastal region of Berisso (in the north-east of Buenos
Aires Province), family farmers cultivate American grapevine (_Vitis
labrusca_) for the production of a typical 'coast wine'. In this region
diseased plants were observed and affected leaves sampled.
Leaf spots were circular, amphigenous, sometimes confluent, 2-8 mm in
diameter, brown or purplish brown. _Pseudocercospora vitis_ [Pv], the
anamorph of _Mycosphaerella personata_, was consistently isolated from
diseased material. Spore morphology of the specimen agreed with that of Pv
as described by Ellis (1971). Conidia were 5-10 septate, 25-90 micrometers
long and 5-8 micrometers wide. Identity of the isolate was confirmed by Dr
U. Braun, Martin-Luther Universitat, Germany (Accession number HAL 1755).
For pathogenicity tests, 9 grapevine plants were grown for a year in
10-litre pots in the greenhouse. 2 treated plants and an untreated control
plant were used for each of 3 replications. Each treated plant was sprayed
with a conidial suspension of HAL 1755. Controls received only distilled
water. After 20 days incubation, the original leaf spot symptoms were
reproduced and Pv was recovered from these lesions. No symptoms appeared on
control plants.
Several genera of _Vitaceae_ (_Ampelopsis_, _Cissus_, _Parthenocissus_) and
different species of _Vitis_ are listed as hosts of Pv (Farr et al., 1989).
Pv has been found in Brazil, Europe, India, Japan, North America, Korea,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and South Africa (Ellis, 1971; Shin, 1997). Pv was
reported in Argentina on European grapevine (_V. vinifera_) almost a
century ago but no symptoms were described (Spegazzini, 1910).
In the lowland regions of Berisso, where American grapevine is grown, the
relative humidity is high; partly due to the influence of La Plata River.
Pathogen infection is favoured by high humidity and therefore the disease
constitutes a potential problem for American grapevine in the specific
cropping areas where it is grown.
In other regions of Argentina, where European grapevine is grown
extensively, rainfall is increasing because of climate changes. Grapevine
leaf spot (a.k.a. black spot) may become a future threat to this
economically very important crop.
This is the 1st record of grapevine leaf spot on _V. labrusca_ and on any
host in Argentina.

[Mummified fruits (dried fruits) remaining from the previous fruiting
season are the source of inoculum for the next crop season. Mummified fruit
containing fruiting bodies (perithecia and pycnidia) overwinter on ground
and vines. Fruiting bodies release spores which then infect nearby plants.
Moisture is a critical element in disease etiology. Disease management
involves use of preventative and curative fungicides, and removal of
mummified fruit.
