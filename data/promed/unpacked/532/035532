[1] Cholera - Cuba (Camaguey Province)

Four young people, whose ages range between 23 and 28 years, died of cholera last Thu 3 Jul 2014 at the provincial hospital Amalia Simoni Argilagos.

The radio station Cadena Agramonte, which serves the province, has reported several cases of death from cholera [in addition to] these 4, but state-run national television has not reported on the matter.

The impact of cholera achieved such a magnitude that the Camagueyan carnival was suspended for 2 days before the date of conclusion last June 2014.

[Since the outbreak of cholera in Cuba was 1st reported in the eastern provinces, reporting of cases has been slow. With these 4 recent fatalities and a disease with a case fatality rate of 1-2 percent, there are probably hundreds of other cases.

In Cuba, no new cases have been reported since epidemiological week (EW) 8 of 2014. The national authorities continue to detect and investigate suspected cases.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 22 of 2014, there have been 31 628 suspected cholera cases, including 471 deaths, in total. Between EW 1 and EW 22 of 2014, there were 156 suspected cholera cases, and 4 deaths, signifying a monthly average of 31 cases. This is less than the number of new cases registered in the same period of 2013 (monthly average of 130 cases and a total of 13 deaths), in 2012 (monthly average of 557 cases and a total of 21 deaths), and in 2011 (monthly average of 240 cases and 35 deaths in total). Thus far in 2014, a decreasing trend in cases has been recorded nationwide.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) and until EW 23 of 2014, there have been 703 510 cholera cases, of which 393 912 were hospitalized (56 percent) and 8562 died. The cumulative case-fatality rate remains 1.2 percent, with variations ranging from 4.4 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent in Port-au-Prince.

Between EW 1 and EW 23 of 2014, 6689 cholera cases had been recorded, including 31 deaths (the cumulative case-fatality-rate for 2014 is 0.5 percent), signifying a weekly average of 291 cases and one death. This is lower than what was registered for the same period of 2013 (weekly average of 993 cases and 8 deaths), in 2012 (weekly average of 1498 cases and 11 deaths), and in 2011 (weekly average of 7697 cases and 62 deaths). Thus far in 2014, a decreasing trend in cases and deaths has been recorded nationwide. Eight out of 10 of the departments continue to record new cases. The departments of Nippes and Nord Est have not recorded new cases since EW 19 of 2014.

In Mexico, on 13 Jun 2014, the IHR National Focal Point reported 3 confirmed cases of toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa in residents of Tlaxcoapan, Hidalgo state; the 3 cases are members of the same family. Their symptoms began on 4 Jun 2014, and they reported a history of consumption of street foods prior to the onset. To date, no additional cases have been reported. The national authorities have enhanced prevention and control measures in response. These 3 cases represent the 1st confirmed cases of cholera in Mexico in 2014. During 2013, from EW 37 to EW 51, 187 cases, including one death, had been recorded nationwide.
