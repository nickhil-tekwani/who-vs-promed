Summary Abstract
COVID-19 has rapidly affected mortality worldwide. There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, requiring new approaches for timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, here we created OpenSAFELY: a secure health analytics platform covering 40% of all patients in England, holding patient data within the existing data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor. Primary care records of 17 278 392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10 926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with: being male (hazard ratio (HR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-1.65); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people with white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk even after adjustment for other factors (HR 1.48, 1.30-1.69 and 1.44, 1.32-1.58, respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for COVID-19-related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date.

[The 5 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were both imported, and it is now 6 days that no new cases have been reported from Beijing.

There were 5 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 28 new cases. According to the press release on the case investigation, there are 1432 total cases (including 1431 confirmed and one probable case). The newly reported cases involve 12 males and 16 females aged between 3 and 85 years. Among them, 12 had a travel history during the incubation period [https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/11/P2020071100719.htm].

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with lifting of restrictions.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 44 cases with one new death, compared with 35 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (10 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 89 consecutive days. There were 21 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (8), Seoul (7), Gwangju (5), and Daejeon (1), and 23 imported cases: Airport Quarantine (12), Gyeonggi (9), Jeonbuk (1), and Gyeongnam (1). There were 11 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 10 provinces yesterday, 9 Jul 2020).

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/). The English language page for notice 428 and 429 provide epidemiologic details on the 44 cases reported today (11 Jul 2020) with graphs and tables presenting the status of the pandemic in South Korea, including updates on major clusters in the country (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +188 cases and +7 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (10 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +276 cases and +12 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (67); Emilia-Romagna (47), Lazio (19), and Veneto (10) are the provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 66 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 50 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase, but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

[D] Iran: 255 117 total cases, 12 635 deaths

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani called on Saturday [11 Jul 2020] for big gatherings such as weddings and wakes to be banned to stem a rise in coronavirus infections but insisted that its sanctions-hit economy had to stay open. Iran must continue economic, social and cultural activities while observing health protocols, Rouhani said during a televised virus task force meeting.

It was not possible to keep businesses and economic activities shut down in the long-term, he said, emphasizing that "the people will not accept this".

Shortly after Rouhani's televised speech, a police official in Tehran announced the closure of all wedding and mourning venues in the capital until further notice.

Iran has been gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April 2020 but has recently reported a sharp rise in the infection rate.

Iran's daily COVID-19 death toll has topped 100 since around mid-June 2020, with a record single-day tally of 221 reported on Thursday [9 Jul 2020].

Iran's health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari reported Saturday [11 Jul 2020] that 188 people had died from the respiratory disease in the past 24 hours, raising the overall toll to 12 635.

Lari also raised the country's caseload to 255 117, with 2397 new infections recorded.

An adviser to Iran's Coronavirus Task Force warned that if appropriate measures were not taken, between 50 000 and 60 000 people could die from the pandemic.

The outbreak's rising toll has prompted authorities to make wearing masks mandatory in enclosed public spaces and to allow the hardest hit provinces to reimpose restrictive measures.

Iran closed schools, cancelled public events and banned movement between its 31 provinces in March 2020, but Rouhani's government progressively lifted restrictions from April 2020 to reopen its sanctions-hit economy.

[As of 11 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 255 117, including 12 447 deaths, an increase of 2369 cases and 188 deaths since 10 Jul 2020. The numbers of daily reported cases and deaths are slowly increasing. There are now 9 provinces classified as "red zones" and an additional 10 provinces considered in dangerous condition.

The takeaway message remains the same: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary, leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths, as well as the need to reimplement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 355 646 including 137 403 deaths, an increase from 3 291 786 cases and 136 671 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 215 598 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 10 Jul 2020 (+333 since 10 Jul 2020) including 18 667 (+14 since 10 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4611 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Tennessee, Alabama and Ohio. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1346 to 10 360. In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 42 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.2%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 18.8% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 40 787 857 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 11 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- Yesterday [10 Jul 2020], WHO launched the Access Initiative for Quitting Tobacco, which aims to help the world's 1.3 billion tobacco users quit during the pandemic. Smoking kills 8 million people a year, and smokers are more vulnerable to developing a severe case of COVID-19. WHO received its 1st-ever donation of nicotine replacement therapies for the project from Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health. The Initiative also enlists the help of WHO's and the world's 1st ever virtual health worker, Florence. You can speak with Florence to dispel myths around COVID-19 and smoking and to help develop a personalized plan to quit tobacco. WHO is in the final stages of adding more partners and encourages pharmaceutical and technology companies to join this initiative.
- WHO has published guidance on maintaining a safe and adequate blood supply during the coronavirus disease pandemic.
- Last Thursday, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros announced the establishment of the Independent panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPR) to evaluate the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. "This is a time for self-reflection, to look at the world we live in and to find ways to strengthen our collaboration as we work together to save lives and bring this pandemic under control," said Dr Tedros [Links to all documents mentioned are available at the source URL above. - Mod.UBA].

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 60.2% of the global newly reported cases and 65.9% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region.

(3058).

- The European region reported 9.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.4% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 31.8% (6611) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.2% (1708), Israel 7.3% (1523), Turkey 4.8% (1003), Spain 4.1% (852), Ukraine 3.8% (800), Romania 2.8% (592), Sweden 2.7% (565), Azerbaijan 2.5% (526), the UK 2.4% (512) France 2.3% (492), and Armenia 2.3% (489).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.8% of the global newly reported cases and 8.6% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 18.3% (3159) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 16.5% (2848), Pakistan 16.0% (2755), Iran 13.1% (2262), Oman 10.9% (1889), Egypt 5.7% (981), Kuwait 4.3% (740), Qatar 3.0% (520), and Bahrain 2.9% (511).

- The African region reported 6.9% of the global newly reported cases and 3.7% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 80.3% (12 348) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 3.7% (575), Kenya 3.1% (473), Algeria 2.8% (434), and Madagascar 2.4 % (361).

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.97% of the global newly reported cases and 0.79% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 53.8% (1160) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 19.0% (410), Australia 13.8% (300), Singapore 8.8% (191), China 1.9% (42), and South Korea 1.6%(35).

- The South East Asia region reported 13.5% of the global newly reported cases and 9.4% of global deaths. India reported 84.7% (27 114) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 9.2% (2949), Indonesia 5.0% (1611), and Nepal 0.36% (118).

Impression (unchanged): The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions.

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From
https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]

[**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts. In the table above, NA is "not applicable;" those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 12 735 534, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. Sobering is that if one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.1%). A global total of 565 068 deaths have been reported, an increase of 2299 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iraq, Bangladesh, Ecuador and Kazakhstan. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 1708 to 31 526. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.UBA]
