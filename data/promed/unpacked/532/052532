[In 2015, Mongolia reported 2 events of FMD -- one in February and the other in October, and both were associated with serotype O. See event summaries and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17308 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18884, respectively.
Information published by the Pirbright World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, shows that the following serotypes have been identified in Mongolia:
1. FMDV-untyped: 1931 to 1973 (types O and A occurred intermittently between 1931 to 1973 (Nyamsuren et al, 2006).
2. FMDV-O: 1974, 2000 - 2002, 2004, 2010, 2014-2015
3. FMDV-A: 2013-2013
4. FMDV-Asia 1: 2005

See data at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/mog.htm. - Mod.CRD

Mongolia belongs to "Pool 1" of the 7 internationally recognized endemic FMD virus pools. Pool 1 covers the region of Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and East Asia, including Mongolia. See map 1, page 6 in the EuFMD (European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease) monthly situation report at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/May2016.pdf.

According to the June 2016 monthly situation report (not yet published on the EuFMD website), the conjectured circulating FMD serotype A viral lineages in Pool 1 per 2015 are A/ASIA/Sea-97 and Iran-05(SIS10) sublineages. The genotyping results of the current Mongolian FMDV-A outbreak will be of interest, in particular to exclude the Indian lineage A/ASIA/G-VII which has recently spread to the Middle East, North Africa and Southeast Asia and against which adequate vaccine strains are required.

During the 83rd General Session of the OIE held in Paris, France in May 2016, Mongolia was approved as a Member Country with endorsed official control program for FMD, according to the provisions of Chapter 8.8. of the Terrestrial Code. The overall objective of an OIE endorsed official control program for FMD is for countries to progressively improve the situation and eventually attain FMD free status. The official control program should be applicable to the entire country even if certain measures are directed towards defined subpopulations only. Member Countries may, on a voluntary basis, apply for endorsement of their official control program for FMD when they have implemented measures in accordance with Article 8.8.39. of the Terrestrial Code. For the said article, see http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_fmd.htm. Countries in this list are liable to export of animals and their products under specified requirements (articles 8.8.22, 8.8.25.). - Mod.AS
