PAHO PROMOTES ACTIONS TO CONTROL FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE IN COUNTRIES OF THE
SOUTHERN CONE
Official representatives of Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay [Note
that Argentina was not present. -Mod. PC have reported on the current
situation of Foot-and-mouth Disease in their territories, measures they
have taken, and actions being carried out in each country to prevent
further spread of the disease and protect the free areas. These measures
include declarations of states of alert, border controls, and restrictions
on beef imports, said Dr. Primo Arambulo, Coordinator of PAHO's Veterinary
Public Health Program.
In Montevideo, Uruguay, an emergency meeting of the members of the
Agreement of the River Plate basin for eradication of Foot-and-mouth
Disease was held yesterday, convened by the Pan American Health
Organization through its Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center
(PANAFTOSA), in response to requests by the countries facing the existing
emergency. Representatives of the private and official sectors of Bolivia,
Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay participated in the meeting, along with Chile
as an observer. At the meeting, participants emphasized the crucial
importance of maintaining in each country actions of surveillance,
diagnosis, and prevention, even in areas where eradication has been
achieved, with the human technical, and financial resources needed to
achieve the success of this objective, said Dr. Arambulo. Participants also
evaluated and approved the strategy implemented by Paraguay of vaccination
in the border area, given the levels of risk in that country.
Among the principal agreements, according to Dr. Arambulo, the members
ratified the need to use and strengthen existing mechanisms of
notification, coordination, and intercountry collaboration established in
the Agreement of the River Plate basin and other international groupings,
with technical cooperation from PANAFTOSA. The participants also agreed on
urgent operational actions aimed at auditing and evaluating in the field
the measures and actions applied by each country in areas affected by the
emergency, as well as the mobilization and allocation of necessary
financial resources for their execution. PAHO is supporting the countries
in developing and implementing a plan to eradicate Foot-and-Mouth Disease
from the Americas by the year 2007.

Brazil is considering various theories, including smuggling and sabotage,
to explain why foot-and-mouth disease has mysteriously resurfaced in a
major ranching area for the first time in nearly seven years. The country's
most southerly state Rio Grande do Sul has 10 locations with outbreaks of
the virus and more than 500 animals -- cattle, pigs and sheep -- have been
slaughtered across the central infection area during the last week.
But the origin of [FMD in the state bordering both Argentina and Uruguay,
remained a mystery. The region's last reported case of foot-and-mouth was
in December 1993. Authorities in Rio Grande do Sul, say they are
considering 2 theories for the recent outbreaks.
"The first of these (theories) is the entry of on-the-bone beef in the
state," the state government said in a statement Wednesday. It cited a
shipment of such beef from Mato Grosso do Sul, one of Brazil's southern
states, which was impounded by Rio Grande do Sul health inspectors in June.
The reason given was that Mato Grosso do Sul, which has a long land border
with Paraguay, reported a case of foot-and-mouth earlier this year.
"The second hypothesis is the entry of animals with foot-and-mouth smuggled
from Paraguay and Argentina," it said. Local media speculated Thursday that
a rancher had bought 2 bulls in Paraguay a few months ago and arranged for
them to be illegally transported to his farm in Rio Grande do Sul. Last
week, officials said ranchers might have been tempted to buy animals from a
neighboring country to help herd reproduction. Immediately after the
foot-and-mouth problem surfaced in Argentina, Brazil dispatched naval and
army units to patrol its 625-mile land and river border with Paraguay to
prevent entry of suspect animals or meat products.
Then there is the sabotage theory. "The minister does not rule out the
possibility of this outbreak having being [been caused by sabotage,
criminals inoculating the animals in that area. He thinks that could have
happened," an Agriculture Ministry spokesman told Reuters last week.
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry has said it was not blaming either Argentina
or Uruguay for causing its own crisis because the type of virus found in
the cattle in Argentina was different from that discovered in Rio Grande do
Sul [There was a type A24 isolated from the Argentinian cattle and type O
was found in Brazil. - Mod. PC. Uruguay was also unlikely because its
national herd has been free of foot-and-mouth for a long time, it said. For
its part, Paraguay hotly denies all responsibility and insists that its
herds meet international health standards. All 4 countries are partners in
the world's third-largest trade bloc Mercosur, which houses a quarter of
the world's cattle. Mercosur has asked the Pan-American Health Organization
to coordinate inspections of infection zones, expected in areas where
Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay all have borders with extra inspections in
Rio Grande do Sul and part of Paraguay.
