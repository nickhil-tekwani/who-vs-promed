Raising backyard poultry has become increasingly popular in Montana and many feed stores across the state offer chicks for sale, especially at this time of year. The City-County Health Department in Great Falls says that raising your own flock can be a rewarding and fun experience that should include safe handling practices with live poultry to decrease disease risk. Two recent salmonellosis cases in Cascade County and several across the state have been linked to the improper handling of live baby chickens.

In 2016, 15 Montanans became ill with salmonellosis as part of an outbreak linked to live poultry that sickened 895 people in the USA, hospitalized 209 of them and resulted in 3 fatalities. Young children and persons with weakened immune systems, such as women who are pregnant, the elderly, and those with chronic disease, are at greater risk for infection.

Bowen Trystianson, Public Health Nurse for the CCHD, said, "Many families think of these animals as pets and it is their inclination to tenderly care for them and show affection, but it is also important to remember that they are animals prone to carrying disease." It is especially important for parents to be diligent about what their kids touch after handling poultry. Knowing the proper handling procedures will prevent your family from getting ill,"

CCHD is asking residents to handle poultry responsibly by following these steps:
- Wash your hands after handling animals
- Avoid touching your mouth after animal contact
- Don't eat or drink around animals
- Don't bring poultry into the house
- Supervise small children around animals
- Don't cuddle or kiss chicks

[In 2016, the CDC tracked multiple outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with live poultry including the following _S. enterica_ serotypes: Braenderup, Infantis, Mbandaka, Indiana, Hadar, Muenster and Enteritidis. The serotype or serotypes in these cases are not stated.

Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonellae. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL
