The shigellosis outbreak linked to the Mariscos San Juan No 3 restaurant in San Jose, California, has grown again. As of 27 Oct 2015, there are 190 people sick. 92 patients have been lab confirmed. So far, people living in Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Santa Cruz, Marin, and Merced counties are sick. Almost all of those sickened ate at the restaurant on Fri 16 Oct 2015 or Sat 17 Oct 2015.

People contract a shigella infection by coming into contact with an infected person, by touching a surface contaminated with feces containing the bacterium, or by consuming food or beverages contaminated with infected feces. Shigella bacteria are very contagious, so secondary infections are almost certain to occur.

At this time of the year, sick days are common for both kids and adults. But one infection in particular has seen a dramatic increase in 2015.

Shigellosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium _Shigella_. According to the Kansas City, Missouri, Health Department, there are normally only 10 cases of shigellosis per year in the area. However, this year [2015], that number has spiked to more than 150. Most of the cases in Kansas City have been children in daycare and elementary schools.

Shigellosis is transmitted by direct or indirect fecal-oral contact with someone who has symptoms. For example, you could contract it from someone who didn't wash their hands thoroughly before preparing your food or from swimming in a contaminated pool.

Most shigellosis cases resolve on their own. While some cases respond to antimicrobials, 3 strains have been found in Kansas City that are resistant to some antimicrobials. For those with no complications, the main focus is to stay hydrated when losing fluids through diarrhea.

[This Missouri outbreak is not likely to be a mostly point-source foodborne outbreak from a restaurant, as occurred in the California posting above, but rather introduction of shigellosis into settings where person-to-person transmission is more likely to occur, such as day care and elementary schools and additional cases in the household setting. - Mod.LL
