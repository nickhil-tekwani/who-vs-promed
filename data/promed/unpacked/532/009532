An investigation is underway into an outbreak of salmonellosis linked to summer barbecue events during the weekend of 6-7 Jul 2013. Dr Susan Turnbull, Medical Officer of Health, said: "The situation was brought to my attention towards the end of last week after recognition of a small number of linked cases of salmonellosis. My Health Protection team in conjunction with Dr Ivan Muscat, Consultant Microbiologist, are undertaking a comprehensive investigation.

"I am pleased to report that the likely source of infection has been identified and removed, and there is no reason to believe there is any ongoing risk of infection. All those who have been exposed to risk are being contacted individually. There were 14 laboratory-confirmed cases by midday on Mon 15 Jul 2013. However, the latest information is that over 60 people (including the 14 confirmed cases) who are part of the investigation have reported symptoms compatible with salmonellosis, so we are expecting final numbers to be much higher."

Dr Ivan Muscat, Consultant Microbiologist, said: "_Salmonella_ is the 2nd most common cause, behind _Campylobacter_, of bacterial foodborne illness in the British Isles. The number of salmonellosis cases of food poisoning has halved in the last 10 years. Although there are some 250 types of _Salmonella_, most infections are caused by serotypes Enteritidis and Typhimurium.

"Most cases of salmonellosis are associated directly, or via cross-contamination with raw meat, especially poultry, beef and pork. Raw eggs, and products containing raw egg, such as mayonnaise, remain other well-known vehicles for transmitting salmonella. Contact with live animals is yet another route, as is cross-infection from infected individuals. Therefore, careful attention to hand hygiene is very important in order to prevent the spread of infection within a family setting."

[The identified presumed source of this barbecue-associated foodborne outbreak of salmonellosis is not stated nor is the serotype of _S. enterica_ if known. ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope of the outbreak. More than 60 cases have been recognized so far, but no denominator is given to assess the attack rate.

Jersey (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) is part of the ancient Duchy of Normandy and is ruled by the Duke of Normandy, a title held by the reigning Monarch of the United Kingdom, though unrelated to those duties as king or queen of the UK. Jersey is a self-governing parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, with its own financial, legal and judicial systems, and the power of self-determination.

The island of Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands. Although the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are often referred to collectively as the Channel Islands, the "Channel Islands" are not a constitutional or political unit. Jersey has a separate relationship to the British Crown from the other Crown dependencies of Guernsey and the Isle of Man. It is not part of the United Kingdom and has an international identity separate from that of the UK, but the United Kingdom is constitutionally responsible for the defense of Jersey. Jersey is not a part of the European Union but has a special relationship with it, being treated as part of the European Community for the purposes of free trade in goods.
