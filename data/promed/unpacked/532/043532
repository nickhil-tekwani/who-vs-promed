Summary
-------
- What is already known about this topic?
CDC and partners are investigating the ongoing outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) in the United States, the District of Columbia, and one US territory.

- What is added by this report?
As of [22 Oct 2019], a total of 1604 cases of EVALI, including 34 deaths, were reported to CDC. Based on data collected as of [15 Oct 2019], use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-containing products in the 3 months preceding symptom onset was reported by 86% of patients. The median age of EVALI patients who survived was 23 years, and the median age of EVALI patients who died was 45 years.

- What are the implications for public health practice?
Most EVALI patients report using THC-containing products before symptom onset. CDC recommends that persons should not use e-cigarette, or vaping, products containing THC. Because the specific compound or ingredient causing EVALI is not known, persons should consider refraining from use of all e-cigarette, or vaping, products.

The number of Americans stricken with a severe, sometimes fatal lung illness tied to vaping has now reached 1888, CDC reported on Thursday [31 Oct 2019]. That's a rise from the 1604 case total from a week ago. Currently, cases have been reported in every state except Alaska, the agency noted.

The related death toll has also risen by 3 over the past week, to 37 fatalities, spread across 24 states and the District of Columbia. Deaths have involved patients ranging from the ages of 17 to 75, with the average age being 49.

No new data on possible factors driving these illnesses [were] released in the new report. However, last week CDC noted that 86% of cases involved products that contained THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Young men are being especially affected, with 70% of patients being male and 79% under the age of 35.

While THC remains a main suspect in CDC's investigation, a recent study suggested other chemicals might play a role. For example, researchers at the Mayo Clinic Arizona conducted an examination of 17 cases involving vaping-linked lung injury -- including lung biopsies. All of the patients examined had severe forms of the illness, and 2 had died.

"Based on what we have seen in our study, we suspect that most cases involve chemical contaminants, toxic byproducts or other noxious agents within vape liquids," said lead researcher Dr Brandon Larsen. He's a surgical pathologist at the Mayo Clinic Arizona in Scottsdale. Those findings were published earlier this month [October 2019] in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Dr Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, has stressed that nicotine-containing vaping products without THC cannot be ruled out as a potential cause of harm. Because of that, the CDC recommendation for everyone to stop vaping still stands, she said. What is clear is the illnesses affecting vapers can be sudden and severe. Symptoms include cough, shortness of breath and chest pains. Some patients have had so much trouble breathing they wind up on oxygen, and in extreme cases are placed on a mechanical ventilator.

CDC's updated numbers come 2 weeks after Juul -- the top-selling brand of electronic cigarettes in the USA -- announced it would no longer sell fruit or dessert flavors of its products. The company's decision comes as it faces widespread criticism its flavored nicotine products are hooking a generation of teenagers on nicotine and vaping, the Associated Press (AP) reported. The company also faces multiple investigations by US Congress, the US Food and Drug Administration and several state attorneys general. Juul is also being sued by adults and underage vapers who allege they became addicted to nicotine by using Juul's products, the wire service said. The flavors dropped by Juul will be mango, creme, fruit and cucumber, which account for 10% of its sales. The company will continue to sell its most popular flavors, mint and menthol, the AP reported.

Juul's decision to continue selling mint and menthol shows "it isn't serious about preventing youth use," said Matthew Myers, from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "Juul knows that 64% of high school e-cigarette users now use mint or menthol flavors, and this number is growing all the time," Myers said in a statement. Myers and his group believe all vaping flavors except tobacco should be banned, according to the AP.

[It is unfortunate these deaths continue to occur without a definite cause. While people die from lung cancers, as well as mouth and tongue cancers, from various tobacco products, those deaths are not sudden deaths -- and in people of all ages -- as has been associated with vaping. It makes one wonder whether the heating of these fluids in the manner of vaping affects lungs and absorption of products by a different pathogenic mechanism than that of traditional tobacco smoking. - Mod.TG
