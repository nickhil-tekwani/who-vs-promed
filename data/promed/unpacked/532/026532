[According to the full report, 2 samples from FMD-infected gazelles
were sampled in the UAE on 10 Jan 2007, received by the World
reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD, Pirbright) on 9 Feb 2007,
received for sequencing on 14 Feb 2007, and reported on 2 Mar 2007
(Total turn-around time: 21 days; sequencing time: 16 days). The 2
UAE gazelle isolates had 100 percent identity. The other 9 close
viruses were all Iranian (2006), of which the 2 closest were
O/IRN/12/2006 and O/IRN/24/2006, both showing 98.9 percent identity
with UAE/1/2007 and O/UAE/2/2007. No official information on the
current FMD situation in Iran could be found in OIE's WAHID
interface, but -- as can be deduced from WRLFMD's data -- the virus
(serotypes O and A) might be spreading there.
The report includes an Unrooted Neighbor-joining tree based on a
comparison of the complete VP1 gene. The tree, dated 2 Mar 2007, was
outgroup-rooted using O1/BFS 1860/UK/67.
According to WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature, formerly World Wildlife
Fund), 2 species of gazelle inhabit UAE's territory, namely the
mountain (_Gazella gazelle cora_) and the goitered (_Gazella
subgutturosa_) gazelles. (See source and picture at
<http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/asia_pacific/where/united_arab_emirates/about/species/index.cfm>).
It will be of interest to know which species was the one affected in
the case described above and to obtain sufficient epidemiological and
clinical details.
FMD in free-roaming _Gazella gazelle_ has been described in Israel in
1985, with extremely high morbidity and mortality rates. Similarly,
cases have been reported from Israel earlier this year (2006) (see
ProMED-mail posting Foot & mouth disease, gazelle - Israel (L.
Galilee) (02): conf, OIE 20070324.1025). In both cases, FMDV serotype
O was the causative agent. - Mod.AS
