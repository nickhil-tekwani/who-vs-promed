[Osh is in south east Kyrgyzstan, in the Fergana valley and bordering Uzbekistan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osh). Anthrax is common in this part of the country.

The Kyrgyz authorities clearly have this outbreak under very competent control and their control policy has given them a few years of freedom from this disease, which was otherwise an annual event (see below).

A description and map location of Kara-Suu district in Osh province, are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Suu_District. A description of Kara-Suu town is available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara-Suu. To use an Aussie phrase, it is beyond the black stump, which makes the local veterinary decision even more impressive. With thanks to my colleague Cristina (Mod.CRD) for forwarding this WOAH notification. - Mod.MHJ
