The Japanese encephalitis (JE) outbreak, which has claimed five lives in
Perak, has been brought under control with no new cases reported during the
last few weeks, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said on Tuesday. He
said concerted efforts by State health officials to eliminate the breeding
grounds of the _Culex_ mosquito, the carrier of the virus, which breeds in
dirty pools of water especially in pig farms, had succeeded in curbing the
outbreak.
He further said that the disease was confined to the vicinity of pig farms
in Tambun, Ulu Piah and Ampang in the Kinta district in Perak but that
state health officials had been instructed to monitor the situation. The
illnesses were confirmed as having been caused by Japanese encephalitis
virus by the Institute for Medical Research after analyzing fluid samples
taken from four victims. The disease is also not new to Malaysia; nine
cases were detected in 1989 and 82 cases in 1992. So far this year 18
cases have been reported, of which seven were treated at the Ipoh Hospital
and the others at private hospitals. Of these, five people died between
February and last month.
Of the 18 cases, one was a pig buyer and the rest were pig farm workers,
their family members or owners [of the farms, not of the people - Mod.CHC.

[Meryl Dorey ("Healthy Families...Naturally") was kind enough to let us
know that the Australian Federal Minister for Health has announced free JE
vaccination for all Australian children. There has been a total of 5 cases
of JE in Australia to date - 4 in the Torres Strait and 1 in Cape York at
the Top End. One wonders on what basis the decision was made to make this
vaccine available on the Australian mainland. - Mod.CHC
