[In 1996, USDA issued regulations ("MegaReg") to attain pathogen reduction
in meat and poultry slaughtering facilities. These regulations mandated
in-house generic _E. coli_ sampling as well as compliance sampling for
Salmonella spp. The regulations incorporated targets for slaughterers and
also mandated sanitation standard operating procedures and hazard analysis
critical control point ("HACCP") plans. The following news items reflect
early data from the USDA compliance sampling program. -- RAL
NEW USDA DATA SHOW CHICKEN IS 'SAFER THAN EVER,' NBC SAYS
September 28, 1998
National Broiler Council Press Release
http://www.eatchicken.com
WASHINGTON -- Cooperative efforts between the chicken processing industry
and the federal government are continuing to improve the microbiological
status of fresh chicken, according to Dr. Kenneth N. May, technical advisor
to the National Broiler Council. The latest figures from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture show that only about 10 percent of whole, raw chickens in the
processing plants tested positive for Salmonella.
"The Salmonella rate was as high as 50 percent in the 1980's," Dr. May said.
"Industry efforts brought it down to 20 percent in 1996 and 16 percent in
1997. Now it's down to about 10 percent. Chicken is safer than ever," he said.
Dr. May noted that USDA conducts only a "qualitative" test in which the
chickens sampled are either positive or negative for Salmonella. Other
scientific research over the years has shown that the actual number of
Salmonella cells on the chicken is extremely low. Salmonella and other
pathogenic bacteria on raw chickens are killed by the heat of normal cooking.
Dr. May said processing plants have achieved better results by installing
new equipment, modifying their procedures, and adopting new anti-microbial
interventions.
Larger processing plants have also implemented a process control method
known as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), in which
plants monitor specific steps in processing to ensure that quality is preserved.
"The industry has been moving in the right direction for more than a
decade," he said. "In addition, we ran our own pilot study of innovations in
processing in 1991 and demonstrated the effectiveness of technological
improvements."

The USDA report also showed pig carcasses contaminated with salmonella fell
from 8.7 percent to about 5.5 percent.
The results also indicated that 88 percent of the largest U.S. meat and
poultry plants met salmonella test standards required by the USDA under its
new meat inspection rules.
