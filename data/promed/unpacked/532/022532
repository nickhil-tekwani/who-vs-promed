In the course of 2004, in Santo Domingo de los Colorados, Pichincha
province, Ecuador, I have seen 3 patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF). 2 were adult males, aged 30 & 38 years, and one was a boy of 10.
They presented with fever, muscle and joint pains, skin rash, smarting,
weakness, and bleeding from the digestive tract (the adults also bled from
the lining of the mouth and vomited blood).

Laboratory tests were positive for dengue, hematocrits (red cell counts)
fell to 18, 25 & 16 percent respectively, they had low platelet counts and
prolonged thrombin & prothrombin (blood clotting) times. The
hemorrhagic picture resolved with blood & plasma replacement. They were
discharged from the hospital in good condition.

The patients were seen at a private clinic. Public clinics diagnose cases
on symptoms, laboratory tests for [dengue] IgM & IgG, and coagulation
tests. Dengue is endemic in Santo Domingo de los Colorados, with most
people having suffered from the (non-hemorrhagic) form. There are no
facilities for determining the type of dengue there. The clinical picture
is unmistakable.

Another imported case of dengue fever in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection has confirmed another imported
case of dengue fever, in a 41-year-old man. This brings the total number of
cases this year [2004] to 15. The man developed joint pain, fever and rash
on 23 Jun 2004, but recovered without hospitalization. He traveled within
Asia on 11 Jun 2004, returning to Hong Kong on 16 Jun 2004.

All the cases confirmed so far this year [2004] are imported cases.

The center urged the public to stay alert to the threat of dengue fever and
help in the reduction of mosquito breeding.

[Hong Kong, very diplomatically, does not name the countries to which the
patient traveled, but that information would help prospective travelers to
be aware of health problems at their planned destinations. - Mod.JW]

Dengue patients on the rise in Bangladesh
-------------------------------------------
Dengue Control Room sources in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka said, at
present, 84 dengue-infected patients are undergoing treatment in the city,
as the number is still on the rise in the current monsoon season, reported
the New Nation on Sunday [11 Jul 2004].

Experts pointed out the intermittent rainfalls during the current monsoon
created a favorable condition for the growth of dengue-virus carrying
_Aedes_ mosquitoes. The constant heavy rains, like those in the monsoon of
2003, could wash out the containers where they breed, thus reducing the
risk of outbreak of dengue, but the intermittent rains this season, once
every 4 to 5 days, makes it possible for the mosquito to breed abundantly.
As a result, the number of dengue-infected patients, including those who
have been cured in the last 2 months, now stands at 258 with the admission
of 24 fresh cases on Saturday [10 Jul 2004].

Sources from the Red Crescent Blood Bank said the collection of blood
platelets for hemorrhagic dengue patients has been substantially increased
in the last couple of days, as currently some 40 bags of blood platelets
are collected daily, compared with 8 bags, on average, during the normal time.

For the past few years, thousands of people in the country have been
attacked by the disease annually, and some 50 people died of the disease in
2003.

Tests confirm dengue outbreak
------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed the outbreak in Phuentsholing town as
dengue fever, according to the health ministry [Bhutan].

Since the outbreak was reported, the Phuentsholing hospital recorded 1393
cases, as of 14 Jul 2004. There have been no deaths.

A status report on the outbreak from the health ministry said only a few
patients requiring supportive treatment were admitted in the hospital.
Others had responded well with symptomatic treatment. A few cases were
found to be German measles (rubella) [which causes a fever and rash similar
to dengue infection. - Mod.JW]

Health authorities also observed that, in the past 3 days, Thimphu recorded
15 such cases, and Punakha, Haa, and Lhuentsi had recorded one case each,
while Wangduephodrang had recorded 2 cases. All these patients had traveled
to Phuentsholing, and, for the moment, they were all kept under observation
and surveillance.

As an intervention, the central medical and public health team from Thimphu
was assisting Phuentsholing hospital in out-break management. Besides
campaigning for local awareness and mosquito control measures, all
dzongkhag [district] health authorities were alerted to step up
surveillance for the outbreaks, especially among the southern dzongkhags.
