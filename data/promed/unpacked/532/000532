BROWN STREAK, CASSAVA - MALAWI: ALERT

International and Malawian researchers and agriculturalists have
called upon the government of Malawi to put in place measures to
control the deadly cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) in the country
before it reaches a crisis level.

This disease has drastically affected cassava production in
neighbouring countries where it is rapidly spreading. Although CBSD
has been in the areas around Lake Malawi, little has been done to
control it. Urgent action must now be taken to protect the crop which
plays a key role in assuring food security.

The breeding of cassava varieties tolerant or resistant to CBSD must
be intensified. The level of awareness on the disease, how it spreads,
its symptoms and the measures to halt its spread needs to be greatly
strengthened particularly among the Ministry of Agriculture staff,
extension workers and farmers. Another key component is establishing
effective systems for producing, maintaining, and distributing
disease-free planting material.

Major new outbreaks of the disease have been reported in recent years
from the Great Lakes region of East Africa. Worryingly, for the 1st
time CBSD has spread at altitudes above 1000 meters [ProMED-mail post
20100525.1735]. If this happens in Malawi, the entire country will be
threatened. This highlights the importance of frequent surveys to
monitor its spread and any new outbreaks.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease is caused by _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_). It
is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the
crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf
chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown, corky necrosis in the
starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when
the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 percent have
been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70
percent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The virus is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ and
is spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease
management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants,
use of virus-free seed tubers for planting, and vector control, but
these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries.
Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local
requirements (as suggested above for Malawi).

CBSV is a particular threat to new varieties developed with
resistance to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of
species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like
CBSV). The emergence of a new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes
is very worrying and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars
(ProMED-mail post 20100525.1735). The joint management of both
diseases has become a major challenge in the region (see, for example,
ProMED-mail post 20100507.1482) since development of crop varieties
with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult
(ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463).
