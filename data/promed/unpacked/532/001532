Officials with the North Carolina Division of Public Health are
cautioning pregnant women against consumption of soft cheeses, hot
dogs and deli-style meats and prepared salads. The warning comes
after 3 cases of listeriosis were identified in Moore, Durham and
Mecklenburg counties and a probable case was identified in Buncombe
County.

The 3 confirmed cases all involved Latinas; 2 (Durham and Mecklenburg
counties) of them were pregnant women whose pregnancies resulted in
miscarriages as result of the infection. The 3rd case (Moore County)
involved a pregnant woman as well. As a result of the disease, she
delivered early, but she and the baby are doing well. The probable
case (Buncombe County) involves another pregnant Latina who also lost
her baby. All 4 had consumed soft cheeses from a variety of sources.

Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated
with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Listeriosis outbreaks
have been associated with consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk and
contaminated soft cheeses, vegetables and ready-to-eat meats. The
disease affects primarily pregnant women, newborns, and people with
weakened immune systems.

"This is a tragedy, which could have been avoided," said State
Epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Engel. "Listeriosis can be prevented by
avoiding unpasteurized milk and other potentially contaminated food,
especially among vulnerable people."

Although the cases occurred close together in time, data from
molecular testing conducted at the State Laboratory of Public Health
showed that different strains were involved, and therefore a single
product does not seem to be the source of these cases, prompting
public health officials to issue a general listeria warning.

A person with listeriosis has fever, muscle aches, and sometimes
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. If infection
spreads to the nervous system, symptoms such as headache, stiff neck,
confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions can occur. Pregnant women
and people with depressed immune systems are most likely to become
seriously ill as a result of the disease.

_Listeria monocytogenes_ is found in soil and water. Vegetables can
become contaminated from the soil or from manure used as fertilizer.
Animals can carry the bacterium without appearing ill and can
contaminate foods of animal origin such as meats and dairy products.
The bacterium has been found in a variety of raw foods, such as
uncooked meats and vegetables, as well as in processed foods that
become contaminated after processing, such as soft cheeses and cold
cuts at the deli counter. Unpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from
unpasteurized milk are at increased risk to contain the bacterium.

General recommendations to avoid listeriosis include: Avoid
unpasteurized (raw) milk or foods made from unpasteurized milk;
thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources; wash raw vegetables
before eating; wash hands, knives, and cutting board after handling
uncooked foods; consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as
possible.

Recommendations for people at high risk, such as pregnant women and
persons with weakened immune systems, in addition to the
recommendations listed above include: Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon
meats, or deli meats unless they are reheated until steaming hot;
avoid getting fluid from hot dog packages on other foods, utensils,
and food preparation surfaces, and wash hands after handling hot
dogs, luncheon meats, and deli meats; do not eat soft cheeses such as
feta, brie, and camembert, blue-veined cheeses, or Mexican-style
cheeses such as queso blanco, queso fresco, and panela, unless they
have labels that clearly state they are made from pasteurized milk;
do not eat refrigerated pates or meat spreads (canned or shelf-stable
pates and meat spreads may be eaten); do not eat refrigerated smoked
seafood unless it is contained in a cooked dish such as a casserole.
Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, trout, whitefish, cod,
tuna or mackerel, is most often labeled as "nova-style," "lox,"
"kippered," "smoked," or "jerky." The fish is found in the
refrigerator section or sold at deli counters of grocery stores and
delicatessens. Canned or shelf-stable smoked seafood may be eaten.

State health officials warned consumers not to drink milk produced by
a Massachusetts dairy, saying it was the likely source of a bacterial
illness that killed 2 men and sickened 2 others.

Whittier Farms suspended operations and distribution, said Dr. Alfred
DeMaria, the state director of communicable disease control. Most of
its customers live in Worcester County. The Department of Public
Health issued the warning Thursday [27 Dec 2007] after identifying 4
cases of listeriosis. Two of the victims, a 78-year-old man and a
75-year-old man, died in June and October 2007.

Investigators have not identified the exact source of the
contamination in the production process, DeMaria said. But milk
samples gathered last week at one of the dairy's 2 retail stores
tested positive for listeria. Testing showed that the bacteria
causing the infections in the 4 victims likely came from the same
source.

Officials at Whittier Farms did not immediately return calls Thursday
[27 Dec 2007] seeking comment. The dairy has a processing plant in
Shrewsbury and operates 2 retail stores. A message left on an
answering machine at the Sutton store said it was closed and that
information to date was ''inconclusive.'' The message said the owners
would be addressing the issue as soon as possible.

Whittier Farms' milk products are sold under several brand names,
including Whittier, Schultz, Balance Rock, Spring Brook, and Maple,
state health officials said.

The Department of Public Health (DPH) has issued a warning to
consumers not to drink any milk products from Whittier Farms
[<http://www.whittierfarms.com/index.html>]
in Shrewsbury because of listeria bacteria contamination, which has
contributed to the deaths of 2 people. Four cases of listeriosis
infection have been identified by DPH, according to a statement
released by the state department late this afternoon [27 Dec 2007].
The cases occurred in June, October and 2 in November 2007. The 4
cases involved 3 elderly residents and a pregnant woman from
Worcester county. Two of the people have died. They have not been
identified.

DNA fingerprinting conducted by the State Laboratory Institute showed
that the bacteria causing these infections came from a common source.
Samples collected showed product contamination. Listeriosis is a
serious foodborne disease that can be life-threatening to certain
individuals. While most cases of listeriosis occur in adults with
weakened immune systems, the elderly, pregnant women and newborns,
infections can occasionally occur in healthy individuals. "Although
evidence suggests that contamination is likely to be at a low level
and the risk of infection low, even in those at high risk, it is
recommended that consumers do not consume these products and discard
any of these products they have," said DPH Director of Communicable
Disease Control Dr. Al DeMaria.

Symptoms of listeriosis include fever, muscle aches and sometimes
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or diarrhea. The illness may
be mild, and symptoms are sometimes described as flu-like.

About 2500 cases of listeriosis occur each year in the United States.
22 cases occurred in Massachusetts in 2006. For more information

A series of routine state inspections this fall 2007 found no health
violations at a central Massachusetts dairy farm linked this week to
a bacterial illness that killed 2 elderly men and made 2 other people
ill, according to documents obtained by the [Boston] Globe. But those
reviews did not look specifically for evidence of listeria [_Listeria
moncytogenes_], the bacterium that sickened the 3 men and one woman.
Instead, following guidelines established by federal health
regulators, the laboratory at the state Department of Public Health
tested milk from Whittier Farms for its overall bacteria count,
finding only one sample with a marginally elevated level of germs. A
dairy is cited only if there is a 2nd elevated test on the same
product.

Whittier agreed to halt production on Thursday [27 Dec 2007], and a
spokesman for the public health agency, Tom Lyons, said last night
that when Whittier resumes operations, the state will test milk from
the mom-and-pop dairy specifically for listeria. But there are no
immediate plans to begin testing for the germ statewide, he said.
Milk is sampled monthly at all dairies in the state, with more
exacting reviews carried out 4 times a year. "We'll certainly take a
look at [broader testing for listeria], but no state in the country
does this type of testing," Lyons said. "That's because this type of
bacteria is not usually found to occur in pasteurized milk products."

The inspection reports, including an exhaustive quarterly review
completed just 3 weeks ago, only served to deepen the mystery around
the dairy and the listeriosis cases, an illness heralded by flu-like
symptoms that can progress into life-threatening neurological
conditions. The state's top disease tracker said he knew of only 2
other situations in the United States in the past 2 decades when
pasteurized milk was identified as the source of a cluster of
listeriosis cases. "We always ask about hot dogs and soft cheese and
cold cuts; those are the most implicated foods," said Dr. Alfred
DeMaria, the state's director of communicable disease control.

Milk is suspected as the cause in this case because a bottle of
listeria-contaminated, coffee-flavored milk was found in the
refrigerator of one victim, and the genetic fingerprint of that
strain matched the bacteria found in all 4 victims. Also, listeria
was found in a milk sample taken last week at one of Whittier's
stores.

Family-owned Whittier continued to decline requests for interviews
yesterday [28 Dec 2007], issuing a statement that it promised to
cooperate with state investigators and adding that "we strive to
produce the best product, and, therefore, we are extremely concerned
about the situation." As word spread across Worcester County that
Whittier had halted production, milk drinkers flooded a state hot
line, corner stores discarded gallons of the drink, and delivery men
lamented losing customers.

The state disease hot line received 50 to 100 calls from consumers
and their physicians expressing concerns about potential exposure to
listeria. Patients were told to see their doctors if they were ill,
and physicians were told to send blood samples for testing at the
state laboratory.

At the Bagel Time deli in Worcester, general manager Tracy Adams had
a worker begin removing Whittier Farms products from the shelves
before sunrise. The shop has been a loyal customer, offering milk
flavored with coffee, strawberry, and chocolate. Bagel Time is a
typical Whittier buyer: a small, neighborhood business, not a major
chain. Shaw's Supermarkets, for instance, does not sell Whittier
products, which are marketed under brand names that include Whittier,
Schultz, Balance Rock, Spring Brook, Maple, and Model. Whittier also
runs its own shops in West Sutton and Shrewsbury. "It's unfortunate
because their product was top quality," Adams said. "They more than
likely will not survive this, so we're at a loss."

For Brian Gay, the news was especially devastating. Gay delivers
directly to the doorsteps of hundreds of customers. His company is
called Maple Farm Dairy, but his milk actually comes from Whittier
Farms. Yesterday [28 Dec 2007], his voicemail box overflowed with
customers. Some complained of headaches that they wanted to blame on
the milk. Others said that their child's diarrhea surely must be a
result of contaminated milk. So he made the necessary decision to
begin delivering another company's product, even as some of his
customers told him they were finished with home delivery.

[ _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized
milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of
many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in
crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human
infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur
from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an
infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in
veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.
Contamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or
following subsequent cooking or other processing.

Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it
is not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with
ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable products that have
been held at refrigeration temperatures. Listeria can also survive in
frozen food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g.,
brie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli
meats, and hotdogs have been sources of human listeriosis. The
sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification
techniques matching _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source
with a species recovered from a patient.

The following is from the previous ProMED-mail post "Listeriosis,
nosocomial - Norway: (Oslo) 20071024.3452:" Listeriosis is a
world-wide zoonosis caused by _Listeria moncytogenes_, which is
transmitted from the intestinal tract of farm animals to humans by
ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and in
some patients invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an
evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord,
endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy
can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or
stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur
annually in the US), but the disease has an overall mortality rate of
20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or
older, and those with compromised immune defenses (e.g., HIV-infected
patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.

The organism can be killed by pasteurization, but heavy contamination
can reduce pasteurization's effectiveness. Although cooking can kill
the organism, contaminated surfaces in food preparation areas can
contaminate previously cooked food that requires no further cooking
prior to eating. The organism can then continue grow in the
refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat product, since _L. monocytogenes_
grows at refrigerator temperatures. Its presence in food does not
alter the taste or smell of the food.

Implicated food has included raw milk and pasteurized milk, soft
cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie and camembert, ice
cream, raw vegetables, delicatessen salads such as cole slaw, cold
cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, raw and smoked fish,
shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken.

The last 2 articles provide further detail of the outbreak of
listeriosis in Massachusetts. Article 3 documents that 3 patients
were elderly and one was pregnant. Newborns, pregnant women, people
60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses
(e.g., HIV-infected patients) are more susceptible to severe forms of
listeriosis. The articles also document that the linkage was found by
DNA fingerprint between an isolate from chocolate-flavored milk found
in the refrigerator of one of the 4 patients and the isolates from
all 4 victims. Also, listeria was cultured from a milk sample taken
last week at one of Whittier's stores, but it is not stated whether
DNA fingerprinting was done on this isolate. Whittier's raw milk
could be contaminated with listeria, which then survived perhaps
faulty pasteurization and further proliferated in milk stored in the
refrigerator (because this organism can multiply at refrigerator
temperatures), or the milk could have been contaminated after
pasteurization, e.g., in the process of adding the chocolate-flavor.
The article does not state whether the listeria-positive milk sample
in one of Whittier's stores was plain or the chocolate-flavored
variety, or whether all the patients gave a history of drinking the
chocolate-flavored variety - Mod.ML]
