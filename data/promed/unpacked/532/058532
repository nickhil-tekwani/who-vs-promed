Michigan's Department of Agriculture has announced a state quarantine
in Berrien County to prevent the spread of plum pox virus (PPV),
which causes a disease that affects stone fruit, such as plums and peaches.
The agriculture department detected the virus in a single plum tree
east of Benton Harbor in the fall of 2006, resulting in parts of
Berrien County being placed under restrictions.
The state's quarantine restricts movement of susceptible trees and
plant parts near the location where the plum pox virus was discovered
but does not affect movement of fruit from the area.
The D-strain identified in Berrien County is not known to affect
cherry trees. PPV can only be transmitted by aphids or by grafting
where infected cuttings or rootstock are used.
"Our ability to regulate the movement of stone fruit nursery stock,
rootstock, and cuttings is crucial for preventing the artificial
spread of PPV to other areas of Michigan and surrounding states,"
said Ken Rauscher, director of the Pesticide and Plant Pest
Management Division.
"Our success depends upon compliance, so we urge citizens to abide by
the state's quarantine and not transport susceptible stone fruit species."
Individuals or businesses that violate the state's PPV quarantine may
be fined or could be jailed for moving regulated plants and fruit,
the state agriculture department said.

[PPV, also called Sharka virus, belongs to the genus _Potyvirus_, the
largest of the plant virus genera containing many viruses that
seriously affect a wide range of crop plants. PPV causes serious
losses in many stone fruit species. However, resistant cultivars are
available and some strains of PPV do not infect certain _Prunus_
species. It is transmitted by an aphid vector, mechanical
inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not
known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. PPV is
widely distributed in Europe and some parts of Asia, but was only
recently detected in America (USA 1999, Canada 2000, Argentina 2003).
So far, there have only been quarantine interceptions reported from
Australia and New Zealand where illegally imported cuttings of stone
fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus.
