The National Health Mission said [Thu 4 Jul 2019] 45 people have died till [3 Jul 2019] since the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in Assam.

Most of upper Assam districts, including Jorhat, Golaghat, Dibrugarh, Lakhimpur, and the lower Assam district of Kamrup have been affected by the mosquito-borne disease.

"Assam is undergoing the transmission season for Japanese encephalitis cases. A total number of 45 Japanese encephalitis deaths have been reported till [3 Jul 2019], in the state," the National Health Mission (NHM) said in a statement.

It, however, said the situation in the state is under close watch and all preventive measures are being taken to combat the situation.

Diagnostic services for Japanese encephalitis with ELISA kits have been made available in all district hospitals and government medical college hospitals, awareness programmes intensified, and fogging operations stepped up in areas from where Japanese encephalitis cases have been reported.

The NHM also said that free transportation is being provided to patients with suspected JE fever through 'Mrintunjoy 108 Ambulances'.

The Assam government is ensuring that treatment and diagnostic cost at medical colleges and district hospitals are borne by the state while a certain number of beds there have been reserved for Japanese encephalitis patients.

A round-the-clock central control room has been opened to deal with and monitor the situation and all deputy commissioners have been directed to step up surveillance activities.

Health and Family Welfare Commissioner and Secretary Anurag Goel held a meeting through video conference on [Wed 3 Jul 2019] with all the deputy commissioners and principal secretary of the Autonomous Councils to review the Japanese encephalitis situation in the state.

He also interacted with officials of the National Vector Borne Control Programme, NHM Assam Mission Director J V N Subramanyam, Director of Health Services Assam Dr R Bhuyan, and other health department officials.

On [Mon 1 Jul 2019], Additional Secretary Sanjeev Kumar, who led a 4-member central team to the state, had said it would be a challenge to contain the outbreak of the disease to the minimum in July and August.

The central team, including senior officials from the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, had visited the state to take stock of the situation on the instructions of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.

[The numbers of reports JE cases in Assam state continue to increase from 10 deaths and 35 additional cases on 28 Jun 2019, to 21 deaths and 69 cases on 1 Jul 2019, and now 45 deaths. The number of non-fatal cases is not given in the report above. This is the active JE virus transmission season there, so health officials are prudent to evaluate the situation and take measures to reduce incidence of the disease, because more cases can be expected. Interestingly, no mention is made of non-JE encephalitis cases, termed acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) that is very frequently mentioned in reports of encephalitis in northeastern India.

Immunization is the effective measure needed to avoid infections. Mosquito vector control is difficult. The pervious report indicated that health officials had reviewed the immunization status but not stated of whom nor what the findings were. It seems curious that no mention is made above of renewing vaccinations in the affected areas. Vaccination for JE was carried out in the affected areas last year (2018). It is not mentioned whether vaccination was carried out again this year (2019). The type of JE vaccine used previously is also not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY
