[The OIE Terrestrial Manual (2008) provides the following introduction to its chapter on ILT (see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf):

Avian infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a respiratory disease caused by Herpesviridae alphaherpesvirinae gallid herpesvirus 1. It is principally a disease of chickens, although it can also affect pheasants, partridges and peafowl. The clinical signs and pathological reactions may vary from extremely severe, with some birds dying due to asphyxiation, to very mild, indistinguishable from other mild respiratory diseases of chickens.

The principal lesion is tracheitis. In infected birds the virus can become latent and re-excreted at a later date without clinical signs. Laboratory diagnosis depends on isolation of the virus, demonstration of the presence of the virus or viral antigens, and detection of specific antibodies in the serum. Histopathological examination of the trachea for characteristic intranuclear inclusions may be of value. - Mod.PC]
