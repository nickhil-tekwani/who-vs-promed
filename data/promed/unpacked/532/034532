["Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment."

In February 2019, South Africa reported an outbreak of LPAI subtype H7N2 in commercial ostriches at a farm located in Free State. The event was resolved in May 2019. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=29620.

In 2016, LPAI subtype H7N2 was also reported in Western Cape Province; see ProMED-mail posting 20161025.4584823. - Mod.CRD
