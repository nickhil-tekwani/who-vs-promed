[1] Russia: non-working days
Date: Wed 20 Oct 2021

Russian President Vladimir Putin has supported the government's decision to declare non-working days from [30 Oct to 7 Nov 2021] in light of the unfavorable epidemiological trends. The regions where the situation is the worst may do so earlier, starting from [23 Oct 2021].

At a meeting with government members on [Wed 20 Oct 2021], Putin urged support for businesses, which during the non-working days will be losing 4 billion rubles [USD 56 000] a day. Also, he made an address to the Russian public: "We have only 2 ways of getting through this period -- to experience the illness or to be vaccinated. It is better to be vaccinated than to wait for the disease and its serious effects."

[30 Oct through 7 Nov 2021] will be paid non-working days. The regional authorities are free to declare other non-working days starting from [23 Oct 2021], if need be.

Testing for coronavirus must be expanded, with Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova saying that it would be appropriate to step up testing drastically in contrast to the standard rate of 200 tests per 100 000 residents.

Also, she called for expanding the use of QR-codes confirming proof of vaccination or recovery from the illness for those visiting public places, tightening anti-epidemiological measures on transport and restricting public events and the operation of public catering outlets from 11 PM to 6 AM.

Golikova asked Russians to refrain from trips to other regions so as not to aggravate the epidemiological situation. She mentioned no restrictions in this respect, though.

At the meeting Putin put forward a number of demands addressed to the government and regional authorities. The Cabinet of Ministers is obliged to monitor the availability of medicines and medical oxygen on a daily basis.

The government is to provide support for businesses, which, according to Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Belousov will be losing 4 billion rubles [USD 56 000] a day during the non-working period.

Starting from [15 Nov 2021] small and medium businesses in the affected branches of the economy may begin to be paid grants of one minimum wage per employee. "This will compensate for about half of the missing revenues in the affected industries," Belousov said.

Businesses will be entitled to low-interest loans at an annual rate of 3% again. Such a measure was already used once in March-July 2021. Loans will be extended on the condition that the employer refrains from layoffs.

Putin urged the regional authorities to avoid distorting medical statistics: "Understating rates and making the picture look better than it really is should be avoided at all cost."

Also, the president invited the participants in the session to give thought to using more widely the practice of granting employees 2 paid days off following the vaccination. "Two days spent at home will do them good," he said.

Covid infection rates in Russia are getting worse mostly because vaccination rates are too low and restrictive measures are often neglected. Over the past week alone the infection rate across the nation was up 15.5% and in 35 regions it is above the national average.

Of the 276 500 hospital beds reserved for covid patients in Russia 86.6% are already in use. In 27 regions (approximately 1 in 3) more than 90% of such beds are occupied.

[2] Delta subvariant AY4.2
[A] Israel
Date: Tue 19 Oct 2021
Source: The Times of Israel [abridged, edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/first-case-of-new-delta-mutation-ay4-2-diagnosed-in-israel/


A subvariant of the delta coronavirus mutation raising alarm bells in the United Kingdom has been found in a child who entered Israel from Moldova, health officials said Tuesday [19 Oct 2021]. The AY4.2 is being closely monitored by officials in the UK, and others have called for urgent research into the subvariant, though health officials say there is no evidence yet that it is driving an uptick in coronavirus cases in some places.

According to reports in Hebrew media, the subvariant was found for the 1st time in Israel in an 11-year-old boy who entered the country from Moldova. He was flagged at the airport and sent into isolation, Channel 12 news reported.

Health Ministry officials plan to hold a meeting on the worrying new strain, Walla news reported, amid fears that a new strain of the virus in Israel could reverse fading infection numbers after months of being pummeled by the fast-spreading delta variant.

There were 1486 new infections on Monday [18 Oct 2021], the Health Ministry said, with another 701 Tuesday [19 Oct 2021] as of late afternoon. There were 354 people hospitalized in serious condition and the death toll reached 8021, a day after crossing 8000 deaths.

B. Delta subvariant AY4.2 explained
Date: Tue 19 Oct 2021
Source: Science Media Centre [edited]
https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-comments-on-the-ay-4-2-subvariant/


There have been reports in the media of a new delta descendant designated as AY.4.2, here are some general comments from Professor Francois Balloux in case they're useful.

Prof Francois Balloux, Professor of Computational Systems Biology and Director, UCL Genetics Institute, UCL, said:

What mutations does AY.4.2 carry?

"A new SARS-CoV-2 lineage has gone up in frequency in the UK. It has been defined as AY.4.2. It is a descendant of the delta (B.1.167.2) variant. It carries 2 characteristic mutations in the spike, Y145H and A222V."

What other variants are they present in?

"Most SARS-CoV-2 mutations have independently emerged many times in unrelated strains. Both the spike Y145H and A222V mutations have been found in various other SARS-CoV-2 lineages since the beginning of the pandemic, but have remained at low frequency until now. The 1st strains carrying both mutations were sequenced in April 2020. Neither are found in any Variant of Concern.

"The A222V was found in the B.1.177 lineage that swept Europe in the summer of 2020, but careful follow-up analyses pointed to the lineage likely having no inherent transmissibility advantage and that its spread was most likely caused by demographic processes."

What do we know about their effect on transmissibility/severity?

"Neither mutation is a priori an obvious candidate for increased viral transmissibility, but we have learnt that mutations can have different, sometimes unexpected, effects in different strains."

How is it being investigated?

"The AY.4.2 is being closely monitored in the UK and elsewhere. It remains rare outside the UK. There have been only 3 cases detected in the US so far. In Denmark, the other country that besides the UK has excellent genomic surveillance in place, it reached a 2% frequency but has gone down since. In addition, functional work is underway to test whether it may be less well recognised by antibodies."

Could it explain the recent rise in UK cases?

"As AY.4.2 is still at fairly low frequency, a 10% increase in its transmissibility could have caused only a small number of additional cases. As such it hasn't been driving the recent increase in case numbers in the UK."

Should we be concerned?

"The emergence of yet another more transmissible strain would be suboptimal. Though, this is not a situation comparable to the emergence of alpha and delta that were far more transmissible (50% or more) than any strain in circulation at the time. Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."

[3] Japan: drop in case numbers
Date: Mon 18 Oct 2021
Source: Time [edited]
https://time.com/6107886/japan-covid-19-case-drop/


Almost overnight, Japan has become a stunning, and somewhat mysterious, coronavirus success story.

Daily new COVID-19 cases have plummeted from a mid-August [2021] peak of nearly 6000 in Tokyo, with caseloads in the densely populated capital now routinely below 100, an 11-month low.

The bars are packed, the trains are crowded, and the mood is celebratory, despite a general bafflement over what, exactly, is behind the sharp drop.

Japan, unlike other places in Europe and Asia, has never had anything close to a lockdown, just a series of relatively toothless states of emergency.

Some possible factors in Japan's success include a belated but remarkably rapid vaccination campaign, an emptying out of many nightlife areas as fears spread during the recent surge in cases, a widespread practice, well before the pandemic, of wearing masks and bad weather in late August [2021] that kept people home.

But with vaccine efficacy gradually waning and winter approaching, experts worry that without knowing exactly why cases have dropped so drastically, Japan could face another wave like this summer [2021], when hospitals overflowed with serious cases and deaths soared -- though the numbers were lower than pre-vaccination levels.

Many credit the vaccination campaign, especially among younger people, for bringing infections down. Nearly 70% of the population is fully vaccinated.

"Rapid and intensive vaccinations in Japan among those younger than 64 might have created a temporary condition similar to herd immunity," said Dr. Kazuhiro Tateda, a Toho University professor of virology.

Tateda noted that vaccination rates surged in July to September [2021], just as the more infectious delta variant was spreading fast.

He cautioned, however, that breakthrough infections in the U.S., Britain and other places where inoculations began months earlier than in Japan show that vaccines alone are not perfect and efficacy gradually wears off.

Japan's vaccinations started in mid-February [2021], with health workers and the elderly first in line. Shortages of imported vaccines kept progress slow until late May [2021], when the supply and daily inoculation targets were raised to above 1 million doses to maximize protection before the [23 Jul-8 Aug 2021] Olympics.

The number of daily shots rose to about 1.5 million in July [2021], pushing vaccination rates from 15% in early July [2021] to 65% by early October [2021], exceeding the 57% of the United States.

Daily new cases surged just weeks ahead of the Olympics, forcing Japan to hold the Games with daily caseloads of more than 5000 in Tokyo and around 20 000 nationwide in early August [2021]. Tokyo reported 40 cases Sunday [17 Oct 2021], below 100 for the 9th straight day and lowest this year. Nationwide, Japan reported 429 cases Sunday [17 Oct 2021] for an accumulated total of about 1.71 million and 18 000 deaths since the pandemic began early last year [2020].

So why the drop?

"It's a tough question, and we have to consider the effect of the vaccination progress, which is extremely big," said Disease Control and Prevention Center Director Norio Ohmagari. "At the same time, people who gather in high-risk environments, such as crowded and less-ventilated places, may have been already infected and acquired natural immunity by now."

Though some speculated that the drop in cases might be due to less testing, Tokyo metropolitan government data showed the positivity rate fell from 25% in late August [2021] to 1% in mid-October [2021], while the number of tests fell by 1/3. Masataka Inokuchi, the Tokyo Medical Association deputy chief, said falling positivity rates show infections have slowed.

Japan's state of emergency measures were not lockdowns but requests that focused mainly on bars and eateries, which were asked to close early and not serve alcohol. Many people continued to commute on crowded trains, and attended sports and cultural events at stadiums with some social distancing controls.

The emergency requests have ended and the government is gradually expanding social and economic activity while allowing athletic events and package tours on a trial basis using vaccination certificates and increased testing.

To speed up inoculations, former Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who left office recently, expanded the number of health workers legally eligible to give shots, opened large-scale vaccination centers and promoted workplace vaccinations beginning in late June [2021].

Kyoto University professor Hiroshi Nishiura told a recent government advisory board meeting that he estimates vaccinations helped some 650 000 people avoid infection and saved more than 7200 lives between March and September [2021].

Many experts initially blamed younger people, seen drinking on the streets and in parks when the bars were closed, for spreading the virus, but said data showed many in their 40s and 50s also frequented nightlife districts. Most serious cases and deaths were among unvaccinated people in their 50s or younger.

Takaji Wakita, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, told reporters recently he is worried people have already resumed partying in nightlife districts, noting that the slowing of infections may have already hit bottom.

"Looking ahead, it is important to further push down the caseloads in case of a future resurgence of infections," Wakita said Thursday [14 Oct 2021].

On Friday [15 Oct 2021], new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said a preparedness plan to be compiled by early November [2021] would include tougher limits on activities and require hospitals to provide more beds and staff for COVID-19 treatment in case infections soar in a "worst-case scenario."

He did not elaborate on details.

Many people are cautious about letting down their guard, regardless of the numbers.

Mask-wearing "has become so normal," said university student Mizuki Kawano. "I'm still worried about the virus," she said.

"I don't want to get close to those who don't wear masks," said her friend, Alice Kawaguchi.

Public health experts want a comprehensive investigation into why infections have dropped off.

An analysis of GPS data showed that people's movements in major downtown entertainment districts fell during the most recent, 3rd state of emergency, which ended [30 Sep 2021].

"I believe the decrease of people visiting entertainment districts, along with the vaccination progress, has contributed to the decline of infections," said Atsushi Nishida, the director of the Research Center for Social Science & Medicine Sciences at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science.

But people headed back to entertainment districts as soon as the recent emergency ended, he said, and that may "affect the infection situation in coming weeks."
