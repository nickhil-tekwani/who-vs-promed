BLACKLEG, OILSEED RAPE - CANADA (MANITOBA): NEW STRAINS

The development of blackleg tolerant varieties has provided canola
growers in western Canada with a honeymoon from the disease, but
tight canola rotations and the development of new pathogroups [fungal
strains] that our "Resistant" rated varieties do not have resistance
to are again leading to reduced yields and incomes for canola growers.

Blackleg can explain reduced yields and premature ripening when the
field looks great all year long. The classic symptoms may not be
visible, then a field is hit by hail and turns into a blackleg
disaster.

Blackleg in canola is here again. It is the 2nd most prevalent
disease for Manitoba and increasing in incidence. Scouting,
identification and management are still the tools to keep this yield
robber in check. Management is not a one or 2 year program, but a
long-term approach that includes careful variety selection, crop
rotation and crop protection products to help reduce blackleg.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) caused by the
fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of
oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. It can
also affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family, such as
cabbage, turnip, and some weeds, which may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Symptoms on oilseed rape may include lesions on leaves,
stems, and pods, with stem cankers leading to premature ripening or
collapse of the crop. However, symptomless infections (as mentioned
above) may also occur.

The fungus is seedborne and also spread by wind, splash dispersal,
mechanical means (for example on contaminated equipment), and
infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is
therefore often sprayed with fungicides. However, this does not
eliminate the risk from remaining underground parts of infected
plants. Disease management includes use of clean seed, cultural
practices to minimise inoculum, fungicides, and planting of resistant
cultivars. The pathogen is extremely diverse, with new strains
evolving frequently. It has overcome major resistance genes in the
past and can be expected to continue adapting to new crop varieties,
as reported above from Manitoba.

The related species _L. biglobosa_ has also been recorded in
association with blackleg symptoms in some areas, including the
Americas, but causes less crop damage.
