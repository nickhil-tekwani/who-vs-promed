I would also like to correct your report that salmon infectious
anaemia [ISA] virus has been found in British Columbia. There has been
only an unconfirmed report from the ISA reference laboratory in Prince
Edward Island. The original PCR test on a sample of 48 Sockeye salmon
had reported a positive result for the European strain of ISA, but
this has not been supported by any sequencing of the PCR product,
isolation of live virus or examples of disease in the farmed Atlantic
salmon (in which it is associated with disease). The provincial
laboratory in Abbotsford has tested over 4000 farmed Atlantic farmed
salmon as part of a regular health audit, and many samples from
different species of wild Pacific salmon without finding any evidence
of ISA virus associated disease.

The 48 samples have been retested by the federal laboratory and an
independent laboratory in Norway. No sequence consistent with ISA
virus was found in any of these samples.

Up until now, we considered pacific salmon resistant to ISA virus
infection and disease. In fact, the 1st laboratory reporting ISA in
Pacific salmon was the PEI [Prince Edward Island] laboratory.

The claim that ISA virus is now circulating in 4 species of wild
Pacific salmon, taken almost at random, without any sequence data to
support the announcement is remarkable, and makes little virological,
epidemiological, or statistical sense, and I would caution ProMED
readers against taking what has been reported below as scientifically
validated evidence.

[This communication agrees with the previous ProMED-mail post archive
no. 20111110.3335 indicating that there is no conclusive evidence for
infectious salmon anemia in the fish in question.

ProMED often reports unconfirmed information from media and other
sources and welcomes scientifically informed commentary. - Mod.PMB]
