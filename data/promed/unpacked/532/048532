[This is now the 2nd consecutive week with no cases of polio reported, neither WPV (wild poliovirus)-associated disease nor cVDPV (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus)-associated disease. That being said, there were 9 positive WPV1 isolates from environmental samples involving all 4 major provinces (Saddar and Landhi in Karachi district, Sindh province; Lahore district and Rawalpindi district in Punjab province; Peshawar district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; Quetta and Killa Abdullah districts in Balochistan province) in Pakistan and 3 cVDPV2 isolates from environmental samples in Maiduguri LGA (local government area) in Borno state, Nigeria. All samples in both countries were collected in the early part of February 2019. Hence, there is evidence of continued transmission of the WPV in Pakistan and the cVDPV in Nigeria. Other areas with cVDPV cases reported in 2019 have not reported on results of environmental samplings recently. It is unclear if and where sampling continues or where environmental sampling isn't being conducted.

[2] Real-time surveillance, East Africa
Date: Thu 14 Mar 2019
Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]
http://polioeradication.org/news-post/polio-surveillance-in-real-time/


In the Horn of Africa, health workers are using application-based technology to respond to poliovirus outbreaks with greater speed and accuracy. One of the most challenging aspects of polio eradication is timely disease surveillance: knowing where the poliovirus is lurking so we can roll out targeted immunization activities quickly and effectively. With new tools, eradicators are getting the information they need in real time.

For the past 3 decades, there have been 2 approaches to find polio: passive and active surveillance. Passive surveillance involves health workers routinely reporting cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) as they find them in health facilities. Active surveillance takes place where there is a higher level of concern that polio might be present. Experts go to hospitals, clinics, and even community healers to search out cases of AFP. This approach, often called active case-searching, reduces the risk that cases are missed due to human error: people forgetting to report AFP or healthcare workers or community healers not knowing that they need to report the case.

However, in active case search the key steps of detecting, reporting, and investigating the case might not always be happening consistently in all health facilities. There can be a delay of 2 months or more between a child being paralyzed, experts finding out, and alerting the polio surveillance system. In an outbreak setting, this can be long enough for the virus to infect and paralyze more children, moving from one area to another. There was an obvious need to make the surveillance system even more reliable and time-sensitive to ensure the polio surveillance framework is as robust as ever.

In order to ensure that active search is conducted timely with real-time evidence, the polio surveillance systems in Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Eritrea, South Sudan, and Tanzania have adopted an easy-to-use, portable disease-surveillance monitoring tool. It delivers unprecedented accuracy across huge areas. The best bit? Most people already have the basic component in their pockets: their mobile phones. The tool is known as integrated surveillance and routine immunization supervision. The idea is simple: surveillance officers use an app on their mobile phones to document active case-searching as it happens by tagging the location of every healthcare facility they visit and check.

"This provides real-time monitoring in the field," said Christopher Kamugisha, WHO's Horn of Africa Outbreak Coordinator. "Previously, officers would report having done active case-searching after the fact: 'I was here, and I did x, y, z.' But this is vulnerable to human error in remembering accurately. Sometimes, before we introduced it, someone would go to a distant, rural area and not be able to pinpoint their location on a map for others to follow up. Now, we are sure we are not missing things."

The map that is generated at the national level allows public health experts responding to the polio outbreak the opportunity to see where the gaps in surveillance for polio are in real time. The app guides surveillance officers through a checklist (questions cover resources available at the facility, polio, measles, and routine immunization) that they fill out and send then and there, using their mobile phones, even without an internet connection. It can also provide on-the-spot data analysis so that the surveillance officer can take immediate, evidence-based action.

With a swipe of the screen, users marry surveillance findings to the facility's location and send the information to a centrally generated map. This gives staff at the national level a clearer picture of where surveillance is working and where it is not, including data on where possible polio cases are, so they know where to direct extra resources.

It also means health workers actively searching for AFP do not have to spend extra time ensuring the information gathered in the field is being shared with the right people for them to take action. For the ongoing outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in the Horn of Africa, this means better disease surveillance and a better chance to protect children against polio.

[3] Innovative disease surveillance, Africa
Date: Thu 14 Mar 2019
Source: Global Polio Eradication Initiative [edited]
http://polioeradication.org/news-post/the-future-of-disease-surveillance-rolling-out-innovative-real-time-tracking-network-across-africa/


With no wild poliovirus reported anywhere in Africa since 2016, efforts are being intensified to actively look for the virus to ensure it is not hiding in any remote areas. In close collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, WHO's Regional Office for Africa is continuing to roll out an innovative disease surveillance platform, enabling the real-time detection of suspected polio cases anywhere on the continent.

Thousands of health workers, volunteers, and members of local communities across the continent have been equipped with geo-coded mobile phone technology and trained to conduct regular and active surveillance visits to health centres across Africa. Professionals and volunteers are tasked to regularly visit local health clinics and actively check for the presence of any child with polio-like symptoms (known as acute flaccid paralysis, or AFP) or to look for children in their communities presenting such symptoms. This information is subsequently fed back in real-time to national and regional authorities, enabling for rapid action and immediate dispatch of an investigative team as needed.

"This really is the future of disease surveillance," comments Reuben Opara Ngofa of WHO's African Regional Office in Brazzaville, who was instrumental in developing this innovative system and who recently returned from Burkina Faso where he helped roll out the system in remote areas. "Particularly in remote or hard-to-reach areas, we need to know immediately if we have polio circulating in the area, and this system allows for real-time information, which in turn allows for an immediate real-time response. If one of our informants identifies a child with polio-like symptoms anywhere, we will know about it immediately. We are really giving the poliovirus nowhere to run."

In addition to polio, this system helps detect and respond to other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, yellow fever, and neonatal tetanus. Across West Africa, measles vaccination coverage is being assessed through this system, and a cholera outbreak in 2018 in Ethiopia was actively tracked. It is a clear example of the polio infrastructure adding value over and beyond merely eradicating polio.

Thanks to such innovations and efforts of dedicated professionals and volunteers across Africa, the continent stands on the brink of a historic public health success: the certification of wild poliovirus eradication. In 1996, when Nelson Mandela launched the Kick Polio Out of Africa campaign, wild poliovirus paralysed more than 75 000 children every year, across every African country.

No wild poliovirus has now been detected since 2016, and this real-time GIS surveillance system will provide crucial additional surveillance data to truly validate the absence of wild poliovirus. Data generated through this system will be critically evaluated by the independent African Regional Certification Committee on polio eradication, when evaluating whether the region as a whole can be certified as free of wild poliovirus in early 2020.

[The 2 articles above on disease surveillance initiatives being implemented in Africa are very promising. Delayed reporting has been a significant challenge to the polio eradication effort. As mentioned above, if AFP cases are not confirmed for a period of time after the paralysis has manifest, the virus has oftentimes has already "moved on" to other areas, again, unidentified again until it has moved out.

Hopefully this change to using mobile phones with GIS identification at the time of investigation activities will shorten the time between date of onset of illness (in this case of paralysis) and confirmation of disease, so control measures (vaccination) can be implemented and interrupt transmission of the virus (either WPV or cVDPV) once identified.

If successful, there is a role for this type of intervention in other regions in the world as well. - Mod.MPP]
