Background information on Blastomycosis in Canada

The presence of endemic blastomycosis in Northern Ontario is old news
(at least 20 years) to Canadian Infectious Disease specialists (CMAJ
1983;129:728-31). This appears to be one of the many times something
is reported as "news" because it is the first time a reporter has
become aware of it.

The disease has been reported from southern Manitoba, Alberta,
southeastern Saskatchewan, Quebec, southwestern and eastern Ontario,
the St. Lawrence Valley, New Brunswick, and Lake Ontario area.
Increasing incidence in recent years has been reported from the
Kenora, Keewatin, Jaffray Mellick tri-municipal area in northwestern
Ontario. 38 cases were confirmed during 1970 to 1981. 16 cases were
reported in Ontario from 1982 to 1989. 24 cases were officially
reported during 1992 to 1994. 55 definite and 6 probable cases (3
fatal) were reported from the
Kenora, Keewatin, Jaffray Mellick tri-municipal area in northwestern
Ontario during January 1997 to April 1999 (local crude incidence =
117/100,000), with highest rates among Aboriginal peoples. 43 cases
(9 fatal) were confirmed in Manitoba hospitals during 1988 to 1999
(annual rate 0.62/100,000). Aboriginals were at highest risk.

[Thank you very much for this background information. We did not
report the finding of Blastomycosis as new, but reported an
apparently unusual cluster of cases. The incidence data from Gideon
show that the incidence has been rising over several years, showing a
change in the epidemiology of the infection in northwestern Ontario.
