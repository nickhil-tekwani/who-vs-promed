A 63-year-old engineer from the Quillota province died on Tuesday [13 Dec 2016] from a hantavirus infection, as confirmed by the HEALTH SEREMI [ministerial administrative unit] of Region V, Mario Méndez. The cause of death, which occurred when the patient was in the Viña del Mar Clinic, was confirmed by the Católica University laboratory, a [diagnostic] center approved by the Institute of Public Health.

"The epidemiological investigation underway raises 2 possibilities for the infection. One is in the work environment, in mining activity in the mountain. The other is the home where the person, together with family members, had been working cleaning and clearing areas of their swimming pool," said Méndez.

The patient had been hospitalized last week for a cardiopulmonary syndrome [from the virus] transmitted by the long-tail rice rat (_Oligorysomiyrs longicaudatus_).

Since 1985, 18 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been registered in Region V, with 12 deaths. In 2016, 3 cases have occurred, one of which was fatal.

Much of central and southern Chile, including the Valparaiso region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides 2 possibilities for the circumstances under which the man might have acquired his hantavirus infection, where in either he may have been exposed to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta in his environment. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
