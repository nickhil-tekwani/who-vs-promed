On 1 Jul 2010, Tri-Union Seafoods announced a recall of Chicken of
the Sea 12 ounce cans of solid white tuna packed in water, citing
that a production error caused some issues with proper sealing. The
FDA has specific guidelines on canned foods and the sealing process
and the tuna recalled did not meet those standards.

These products were distributed in 10 states including Wisconsin,
Nebraska, Utah, Pennsylvania, New York, Maine, Colorado, Indiana,
California and Oregon. The distribution dates were in February and
May [2010]. The 12 ounce Chicken of the Sea solid white tuna packed
in water has a upc code of 4800000262, "Best By Date 2/10/2014" and
product code 7OA1E ASWAB, 7OA2E ASWAB, 7OA3E ASWAB, 7OA4E ASWAB,
7OA5E ASWAB, 7OAEE ASWAB, or 7OAFE ASWAB. The best by dates and
product code numbers are imprinted on the bottom of the cans. No
other Chicken of the Sea products are affected by this recall.

There have been no reports of sickness identified with the
consumption of this product.

Canned food with loose seals can spoil quickly and has the potential
to cause sickness. Although rare, botulism can sometimes be found in
improperly sealed canned foods and according to an FDA fact sheet on
botulism, canned fish has been identified as a food that is commonly
contaminated.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in
these cases) are related to defective preparation procedures, which
could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable
spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
