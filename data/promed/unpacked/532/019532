Since 2017, there have been 4 cases of syphilis being passed onto babies from their mothers, as well as 1 probable case, NZME reports. A total of 2 of last year's [2017] cases were stillbirths. The Ministry of Health is currently investigating 2 possible further cases and has set up a group to tackle the issue.

All pregnant women are meant to undergo a blood test to check for the infection early in their term; if found early, syphilis can be treated with antibiotics.

Waikato DHB Hamilton Sexual Health Clinic director Dr Jane Morgan told NZME the increase in these cases is a clear message our healthcare system is failing. "The World Health Organisation has given Cuba an award for eliminating congenital syphilis. We are reintroducing it. It's just heart-breaking that we are seeing it. It is hard to comprehend. We know that LMCs (lead maternity carers) are talking about how short staffed they are, and that midwives are leaving that profession. What is happening about people's access to primary care... why aren't women being screened?"

The Ministry of Health reported 1 stillbirth due to congenital syphilis in 2016, and one in 2011-2012. Records couldn't be checked prior to 2011. There were 495 confirmed cases of syphilis last year [2017] -- more than double the number from 2015.

[Congenital syphilis occurs when a fetus is exposed in utero to a mother with untreated early syphilis. Up to 40 per cent of babies born to women with untreated early syphilis may be stillborn, or die from the infection as a newborn (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-congenital-syphilis.htm). Some babies are asymptomatic at birth, but, if untreated, may show developmental delay and damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain either in the 1st few weeks after birth or years later.

The incidence of syphilis has been on the rise in New Zealand since 2012 (https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/rise-syphilis-cases-prompts-calls-practise-safe-sex). Provisional data from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR) Ltd, indicated that the number of syphilis cases reported in 2017 has more than doubled since 2015; the highest number of cases were reported in males aged 20-39 years, particularly those in the 25-29 age group, in the Auckland and Wellington regions; nearly 70 per cent of the cases were reported in men who have sex with men (MSM) and nearly 21 per cent of these cases were also HIV positive.

This is similar to reports on the rising incidence of syphilis, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM), in many countries. However, although MSM remain the group most affected by syphilis, ProMED-mail has reported that there has also been in recent years a rising incidence among women and men who have sex with women in many countries, with an increased risk of congenital syphilis if pregnant women are affected. This pattern has also been reported in New Zealand, where for women the highest number of cases reported in 2017 was in the 20-39 years age group (https://www.health.govt.nz/news-media/media-releases/rise-syphilis-cases-prompts-calls-practise-safe-sex).

Auckland, the largest urban area in the country with a population of about 1.5 million residents, is a city in the northern portion of New Zealand's North Island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland). Wellington is the capital and 2nd most populous urban area in New Zealand with a population of about 400 000 residents, located at the south western tip of the North Island (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington).
