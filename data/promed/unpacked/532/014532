Rice tungro infestation has damaged rice farms in 11 municipalities in the
province of Antique. The Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA)
placed the total worth of damage at PHP 8.5 million [about USD 180 000].
The IPM [Integrated Pest Management] coordinator said the virus was last
seen in this scale during 1982.

It is one of the most harmful diseases for rice plants. It is spread by the
green and zigzag leafhoppers, common pests in rice paddies. The OPA issued
several recommendations for managing the disease, such as discouraging 3
croppings a year for communities with confirmed infection, synchronous
planting for whole communities, plowing infected seedbeds, and eliminating
weeds that serve as hosts for the rice tungro virus.

Based on the inventory of all government stocks, secretary Arthur Yap of
the Department of Agriculture (DA) assured Filipinos that rice supply is
stable. He said that apart from the stocks held in 500 warehouses all over
the country, ongoing harvests in the Visayas and Mindanao will boost the
inventory. The government also has started importing rice and initial
shipments will arrive by January 2010. "All in all, we are looking at about
140 days' worth of stocks," he stressed, as he sought to allay fears.

[Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia. Yield
losses of up to 100 per cent have been reported, and the disease is
spreading in the region. It is a co-infection involving _Rice tungro
bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; genus _Tungrovirus_, family _Caulimoviridae_) and
_Rice tungro spherical virus_ (RTSV; genus _Waikavirus_, family
_Sequiviridae_). More than one genotype of each virus may exist in the same
plant.

Symptoms include leaf discolouration, stunting, reduced tillering, and
reduced grain production. All growth stages of rice are susceptible, but
losses are higher for infections early in the growth cycle. Tungro is
transmitted by leafhoppers including the zigzag leafhopper (_Recilia
dorsalis_) mentioned above, but the most efficient vector is the green
leafhopper _Nephotettix virescens_. RTBV cannot be transmitted unless RTSV
is present. Infectious vector insects can spread the viruses over long
distances. The disease is not seed transmitted.

Disease management includes vector control, cultural practices, and use of
rice varieties resistant to the vectors and/or the viruses. However, vector
adaptation on leafhopper resistant varieties has been a problem, and the
presence of multiple viral genotypes in a single location (suggesting an
unstable virus population) poses a challenge to achieving durable crop
resistance.

Serious outbreaks of tungro have been reported earlier in 2009 from the
provinces of Iloilo, Capiz, and Aklan, which border Antique in the Visayas
region of the central Philippines.
