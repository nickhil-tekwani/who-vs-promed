Anthrax, post office contamination - USA (DC): possible
-------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON DC: The US Postal Service on Thursday closed 11 post offices in
the Washington area as it tested a Navy postal facility that handles mail
for government agencies for possible anthrax contamination. "The safety of
our employees and customers is the Postal Service's highest priority," said
Postal Service vice president Azeezaly Jaffer. Therefore, out of an
abundance of caution, the Postal Service has decided to close and test
facilities for biohazard contamination."
A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said on-site testing
and other preliminary tests came back positive for anthrax at the Navy
facility, and further testing is being done. The detection of the
potentially deadly pathogen came on Wednesday, the spokeswoman said, and
officials are "exploring" whether any precautionary measures need to be
taken for the workers at the Navy Consolidated Mail Facility, located at
the Naval District Washington Anacostia Annex.
All mail is irradiated before it gets to the facility so that there is very
little risk of potential exposure. No one has been hospitalized in the
incident, a Navy spokesman said, but the facility has been closed. "Most of
this mail moving through the Navy's facility was processed through the
Postal Service's V Street facility that processes government mail," Jaffer
said. "The contractor that transported this mail also collected mail from
other Washington DC area facilities."
In addition to the V Street facility, the Postal Service closed 10 post
offices in Washington, Maryland and Virginia. The Navy spokesman said the
level of anthrax detected by the automatic equipment at the Navy facility
was well below infectious levels, in the range of 100 to 140 spores.
Infectious levels begin at about 10 000 spores. The spokesman said a
follow-up test also came back positive for non-infectious levels of anthrax.
Authorities from the FBI, the Naval Criminal Investigative Services and
postal inspectors are investigating the discovery. List of closed post
offices:

Anthrax scare at US mail centre
-------------------------------
A centre handling mail for the White House is closed after routine tests
picked up possible traces of anthrax. The US Postal Service has shut down a
government mail handling office in Washington for anthrax testing. Routine
tests at the US navy mail office found traces of a substance that could be
anthrax, said a Homeland Security department spokesperson.
Eleven postal offices in the Washington area have also been shut for
further tests but it is not thought any postal worker has been exposed to
the poison. The naval office handles mail for federal agencies and the
White House. Air monitors at the office detected "small amounts of
biological pathogens, possibly anthrax" on Wednesday, said Rachael
Sunbarger, of the Homeland Security department. Closer investigation of
eight samples of the air revealed one positive test for anthrax. Further
tests are now being carried out. Naval staff said only a few people worked
in the office. They would be tested as a precautionary measure, but were
"very unlikely" to be at risk of exposure. "Almost all the mail that's
processed there is irradiated, so it's likely the substance would be
inactive," said Lt Corey Shultz.
The Postal Service said it was shutting 11 offices in the Washington area
that were served by the same contractor that transported mail to the navy
centre. "Out of an abundance of caution we want to make sure we've covered
everything," said spokesman Mark Saunders. "We learned late Thursday the
navy test was positive and that more samples were being taken at the
facility". Around 1500 staff were affected and would be moved to other
centres for the time being, he said.
At least 5 people died -- including 2 Washington postal workers -- and 17
were taken seriously ill within weeks of several anthrax attacks in October
2001. Letters containing anthrax spores were sent to news media in New York
and Florida, and anthrax-laced letters were sent to the Washington offices
of two senators. Those responsible have not yet been caught. Since the
attacks, the Postal Service has spent millions of dollars to test and
install equipment to sterilise the post.

[Better to be safe than sorry. The test-positive material from the Navy
site has been sent to USAMRIID and CDC for confirmation. One can speculate
endlessly on this to little purpose until the laboratory work is complete.
Logically they will be checking for plasmid content just in case the cause
was Sterne vaccine spores. If it is a true repeat of 2001 that will raise a
number of questions, good, bad and embarrassing. If it was a false
positive, we learn the need for better surveillance. - Mod.MHJ]
