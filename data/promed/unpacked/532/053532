[2] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula Province)
Date: Fri 1 Dec 2017

http://clubofmozambique.com/news/cholera-spreading-in-nampula/


The current outbreak of cholera in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula has now spread to 3 districts, according to Benigna Matsinhe, the deputy national director of public health. The outbreak began in the coastal district of Memba, and has now spread to the neighboring districts of Erati and Nacaroa. A team from the Health Ministry has gone to Nampula to assess the situation and provide technical support to the health staff on the ground.

"The Ministry has been monitoring the cholera and malaria situation in various provinces, including Nampula", she said. "Since September 2017, we have been aware of cholera in Nampula, which began in Memba. The situation is continuing, and so we decided to verify what is happening".

The team dispatched to Nampula contains doctors, nurses and epidemiologists. Matsinhe said it has now worked in the 3 affected districts, and other parts of the province, confirming that the supply of clean water and the promotion of activities to protect public health remain challenges. "We have community activists who can help the health sector spread messages on how to improve sanitation and individual and collective hygiene", said Matsinhe.

So far, 585 cases of cholera have been diagnosed in the 3 districts, but only 1 patient has died.

[3] Cholera - Sudan (Red Sea State)

Despite reports of the cholera epidemic abating in Sudan, medical sources continue to note the emergence of new cases of cholera in Port Sudan. Journalist Osman Hashim told Radio Dabanga that according to medical sources "on Fri 1 Dec 2017, the Ministry of Health opened 2 isolation wards at both Port Sudan Hospital and the Children's Hospital". He said that the wards received 12 cholera patients; 7 at Port Sudan Hospital and 5 at the Children's Hospital.

The sources expect the cholera rate to increase due to the dire deterioration of the environment and called on the government to chlorinate water and initiate environmental sanitation campaigns to prevent the spread of the disease.

Two new cases of cholera have been reported in Kwale County, health officials say. The victims have been admitted to Kinango Hospital.

County Health Executive Francis Gwama said specimens from the 2 patients were taken for further analysis.

Mr Gwama urged the public to help eradicate the disease by maintaining high hygienic standards at all times. He said a team of public health officers have been dispatched to villages to create awareness on proper sanitation. "We are engaging the public through our officers on the ground in consultative forums that aim at finding reliable solutions to health risks within the community," he said, adding that they are also finding possible ways of mitigating the spread of disease.

[5] Cholera - Kenya (Mombasa County)

Two new cholera cases have been reported at the Mwembe Tayari health center even as Mombasa County government affirms it is in control of the situation. Two people succumbed to the disease last week in the coastal city, and dozens were treated and discharged. The Hassan Joho led administration has also began clearing the Majengo dumpsite after KBC Channel One highlighted the health risk posed by the heap of garbage which is outside a food market.

Just last week, 10 patients were admitted at Majengo Health facility, but the facility has now been closed by the County's health department, following complaints allegedly from locals. Food vendors nearby say poor garbage management is the reason for the spread of the bacterial disease. It would take an hour to clear garbage that had accumulated at the facility, a relief to the residents.

The state of affairs in Majengo mirrors several other dumpsites that the small scale business community has to cope with. But even as the County Government maintains that everything is okay, 2 patients were admitted on Tuesday evening [28 Nov 2017]. Mwembe Tayari health center in Mvita Constituency and Utange Health center in Kisauni Constituency are the only operational cholera treatment centers so far.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 per cent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65 per cent (95 per cent CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
