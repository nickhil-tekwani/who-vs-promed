The number of infected with anthrax has increased in Kyrgyzstan
---------------------------------------------------------------
The 3rd case of confirmed human anthrax has been registered in Osh region
of Kyrgyzstan. This information came from the director of Republican Center
for Particularly Dangerous Infections. There was information about 8 cases
of anthrax admitted to the hospitals and in 5 of them the infection has not
been confirmed yet. The cases are with skin lesions, which are treated with
grater success, the representative of the Ministry of Health said. The
doctors say that the infections are due to consumption of contaminated beef.

[Our thanks to Asankadyr for the information in [1], which, yet again,
reiterates the importance of our informed members in filling out the
details of the events ProMED-mail reports. The coincidence of the 2
incidents, in the ongoing absence of the location of Beshinchi village,
would reinforce the speculation that the horse case may have been
associated with the cattle outbreak in Makarenko, site also unknown for the
present.

To find Uzgen, go to <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KG/0/Ozgon.html>.
According to Google Earth Turt-kul is immediately north of Uzgen (capital
of Uzgen district). There is, however, a town named Irisu in the mountains
well north of Uzgen. See
<http://www.traveljournals.net/explore/kyrgyzstan/map/m3218108/irisu.html>
which if the same as Irisuu would suggest two very separate outbreaks. -
