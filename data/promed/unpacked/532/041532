CWD positive deer found in southern Walworth County
---------------------------------------------------
Madison, Wisconsin: A 3 year old female deer shot by a village police
officer in a Fontana city park has tested positive for chronic wasting
disease (CWD). The site of the kill is about 2 miles outside of Wisconsin's
current CWD herd reduction zone.
"While this is certainly disappointing, this news is not unexpected," said
Tom Hauge, director of wildlife management at the Department of Natural
Resources. "We consider the Walworth County deer population to be at higher
risk for having CWD."
The Walworth County area is considered at higher risk for CWD because the
disease has been confirmed in deer not far across the border in northern
Illinois. There are also 2 quarantined captive deer farms in Walworth
County, one of which had confirmed CWD-positive deer.
"We do not know how this deer became sick," said Hauge. "We will learn as
much as we can from this deer and formulate a specific plan for more
intensive surveillance in the area where this positive deer was found. When
we get sufficient information, we will decide on what the next steps should
be."
The positive deer was noticed to look sick and reported to a conservation
warden on March 6 by a Fontana police officer. The conservation warden
requested that the police shoot the deer. A conservation warden then picked
up the carcass for sampling by the DNR and testing by the Wisconsin
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.
To date, more than 42 000 deer have been tested in Wisconsin. In 2003,
hunters will be asked to provide deer for testing in selected areas of the
state where wildlife managers and researchers would like to add to last
years data. Some car killed deer and deer identified as sick looking
continue to be sampled and tested.
"Thanks to efforts of hunters and citizens across the state, we had very
good testing last year," said Hauge. "Walworth County was already
designated for continued surveillance this fall because of its higher risk
status and to add more data to our surveillance picture. Finding this deer
supports that decision. One of the things we will want to do soon is
combine our existing surveillance data with Illinois to get a better
picture of the intensity and likely distribution of CWD in this border area."
This brings the number of confirmed CWD positive deer found in Wisconsin to
208. The first deer to test positive for the fatal neurological disease
were reported in February.
