Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on 13 Feb 2013, an increase of mortality in breeding hens in the State of Guanajuato was reported to SENASICA. The event apparently began suddenly on 12 Feb 2013; later, the following clinical signs were observed: edema, cyanosis and palpebral, comb, and chin swelling, diarrhea, dyspnea, shell-less or rough-shelled eggs, and sudden death. SENASICA immediately went to the affected farms and to those located in the outbreak area and around the outbreaks in order to start analyzing the situation. Virological and serological samples were taken and sent to both the regional and the national laboratory of SENASICA. On 17 Feb 2013, positive results were obtained by viral isolation of the highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza virus, H7N3 subtype. During the epidemiological investigation, 9 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza were identified in the State of Guanajuato. The outbreaks occurred in 7 breeder farms and in 2 commercial layer farms. The affected population was 647 742 birds, of which 34 889 died and 53 553 were ill. The affected breeder farms are located in the municipalities of San Felipe (1) and of Dolores Hidalgo (6), while commercial layer farms are in the municipalities of San Luis de La Paz (1) and of Juventino Rosas (1), all in the State of Guanajuato. In addition to the depopulation activities, a preventive vaccination was launched in breeder and layer farms in the State of Guanajuato. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing and the 1st results suggest the introduction of the virus through fomites and biosecurity failures.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total Vaccinated / Details
Guanajuato / Birds / 551 2080 /Commercial layer and breeder poultry

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Biosecurity Laboratory Level 3, SENASICA (national laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / 17 Feb 2013 / Positive
