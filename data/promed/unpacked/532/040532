The public health system in Kerala has been put on high alert as
chikungunya viral fever cases have been reported from Pathanamthitta,
Kottayam and Alappuzha districts in the state. According to health
department sources, a Central team is expected to visit Kerala soon
to assess the situation and assist the state in containing the spread
of the disease.
About 100 chikungunya cases were reported from Pathanamthitta
district, for which the government had released Rs 10 lakh [USD 24
734] to take up emergency preventive measures, a spokesman for Health
Minister P K Sreemathy told PTI. What worries health authorities is
that the outbreak of fever has come about on the eve of the onset of
the monsoon. The rainy season always posed health challenges to
authorities in the state. Last year [2006], there was an outbreak of
chikungunya in Alappuzha and nearby districts, which claimed 100
lives and drew national attention.
Most viral fever cases have been reported from the eastern parts of
Kottayam district, known as the "rubber-belt." District medical
authorities said blood samples taken from the patients had been sent
to the Virology Institute at Alappuza to ascertain the kind of virus
causing the fever. Since poor people depend mainly on government
hospitals for treatment, lack of sufficient beds and supply of
medicines also pose problems.
