A total of 981 people were diagnosed with chicken pox nationwide last week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday [Tue 19 Feb 2019].

The figure was higher than the previous 3 weeks and the highest reported during the same week in the past 5 years, the centers said, adding that most of those diagnosed with the disease were children and adolescents between 5 and 14 years old.

"Since the chicken pox vaccine became included in the nation's recommended routine immunizations for infants and children in 2004, the incidence rate has fallen by nearly 9%, but clustered cases still sometimes occur on school campuses," CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

A total of 5 clusters were reported in the past 4 weeks, while 11 clusters out of the 12 reported this year [2019] were in schools, 6 of which were elementary schools, he said.

"About 10 to 20% of elementary-school students who were vaccinated against chicken pox at a younger age gradually lose protective immunity over time," Lo said. Although specialists believe that it is not necessary to revaccinate everyone, the centers still encourage parents of children who have lost protective immunity to consider getting their children revaccinated, he added.

As the chicken pox is highly contagious and can transmit through air or fluids, the centers urged people experiencing symptoms -- fever, loss of appetite, headaches, tiredness, malaise, itchy rashes and blisters -- to wear a surgical mask, see a doctor immediately and avoid going to school.

Meanwhile, 161 019 people last week [11-17 Feb 2019] visited hospitals and clinics complaining of diarrhea, up 9.2% from the prior week [4-10 Feb 2019], the centers said. In the past 4 weeks, 25 clustered cases have been reported from mainly restaurants and hotels, it added.

Late winter and early spring are the common peak season for chicken pox and diarrhea, it said, urging people to wash their hands and practice good cough etiquette, as well as rest at home until at least 48 hours after their symptoms have subsided.

[2] Colorado (Aurora): ICE facility
Date: Wed 20 Feb 2019

Democratic Rep. Jason Crow went to ICE's privately run Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora [Wed 20 Feb 2019] seeking a tour. He was denied. "There is urgency to this, a public health emergency -- knowing that there are multiple outbreaks of at least chickenpox and maybe mumps as well," Crow told reporters [Wed 20 Feb 2019].

Crow's visit comes on the same day he sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Crow's concern stems from the recent expansion of the facility, which can now hold more than 1500 detainees. The freshman congressman -- who represents Aurora and other parts of the metro area -- is seeking answers about recent reports surrounding a chickenpox outbreak, quarantines and the number of medical professionals on staff.

Below are the questions sent to the Department of Homeland Security:

- Please explain the number and types of disease outbreaks (i.e. chickenpox) and the number of outbreaks that have led to quarantines in the past year at the Denver Contract Detention Facility in Aurora.

- What are the reporting criteria and requirements for outbreaks and which entities receive the reports?

- What actions have ICE and GEO taken to respond to the recent varicella outbreaks and what measures are being put in place to prevent future outbreaks?

- Will ICE direct GEO to hire more properly trained medical staff to accommodate the increase in detainee admissions? Please also describe what contract requirements and oversight are in place to ensure that detainees receive proper medical attention.

- What requirements are in contract or other guidance with GEO to ensure that detainees are provided proper medical care?

- Please describe the contract relationship between ICE and GEO and attach copies of the relevant contract documents (e.g. agreements, MOUs, guidance, etc.).

- Since 2015, how many 911 calls were placed from the Facility to City of Aurora or State of Colorado emergency professionals?

- When privately run facilities fail to comply with code, ICE has the opportunity to issue compliance waivers essentially forgiving them for the breach. Has ICE issued any compliance waivers for the Facility? If so, how many, and what were the reasons for those waivers?

- Since 2015, has ICE submitted a Contract Discrepancy Report for the Facility following the granting of any compliance waivers? If so, please attach any and all such reports in your response.

[This is the 3rd report on varicella in this facility. See Varicella update (01): USA (CO, VT) 20190201.6290432 regarding an outbreak in January 2019; and there was a prior outbreak in October 2018.The situation is entirely preventable. One must assume vaccination of incoming detainees is not taking place during entry medical exams.

Also see report on mumps in this same ICE facility: https://denver.cbslocal.com/2019/02/20/jason-crow-ice-immigration-chicken-pox-aurora/: Mumps confirmed at ICE facility amid capacity increase 20 Feb 2019. They have instituted stringent quarantine measures to contain transmission, but are they vaccinating individuals who have no recollection of being immunized when they detain them? The questions submitted to the Department of Homeland Security are appropriate and we hope will be answered. - Mod.LK
