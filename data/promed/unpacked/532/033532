PLAGUE, PRAIRIE DOGS - USA (TEXAS)

The Rita Blanca National Grasslands (RBNG), located in Dallam County in the
north west corner of Texas, is currently the site of a plague outbreak in
prairie dogs. So far plague has been confirmed in fleas from sites 9, 19,
23, and 35. Other sites are suspected to have experienced plague based on a
visual inspection of the towns where no, or minimal prairie dog activity
was observed. These sites are 7, 11, 14, 21, 22, 40, 46, and 89.
Warning posters have been placed throughout the area, but all areas with
prairie dog towns have not been inspected, and posters may not be at the
entrance to every site with a prairie dog town. All prairie dog towns in
the RBNG should be considered as potential sites of plague infection. While
infection has not been confirmed outside the RBNG, spread is possible to
adjacent areas.
Normally, the area is sparsely populated. In the past 2 weeks, however,
prairie dog hunting enthusiasts from multiple states have been frequenting
the RBNG to pursue their avocation. If a person presents with symptoms that
could be due to infection with _Yersinia pestis_, a history should be
obtained to determine whether the individual has recently been to the RBNG.
If affirmative, appropriate diagnostics and prophylaxis should be pursued
immediately.
Hunters are advised not to enter a prairie dog town. If a prairie dog town
is visited, however, prairie dogs, dead or alive, should not be handled,
and precautions should be taken to prevent being bitten by fleas.
