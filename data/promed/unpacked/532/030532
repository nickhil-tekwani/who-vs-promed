The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received
official reports of 2 confirmed malaria cases in Great Exuma,
Bahamas. Malaria transmission had not previously been reported from
this area until an outbreak was reported in late spring and summer
2006. One of the confirmed cases occurred in a U.S. citizen who
traveled to Great Exuma in late July 2007. This patient's illness has
been confirmed as malaria caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_. Malaria
is not considered endemic on the islands of the Bahamas.
Recommendations for Travelers
Antimalarial Medication
At this time, CDC is recommending chloroquine as an antimalarial
medication for travelers to Great Exuma. This recommendation is
expected to be temporary and does not apply to other islands of the
Bahamas. Chloroquine has a long history of use and safety and is well
tolerated by most people, including children. People with an allergy
to chloroquine should discuss an alternative antimalarial drug with
their healthcare provider. To learn more about chloroquine, including
dosing information, see Information for the Public: Prescription
Drugs for Malaria:
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentMalariaDrugsPublic.aspx>.
Other Prevention Measures
Because antimalarial drugs are not 100 percent protective, travelers
to Great Exuma, as well as other islands in the Bahamas, should take
precautions to protect against mosquito bites.
Use insect repellent containing DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide) on
exposed skin surfaces when outdoors, particularly from dusk to dawn.
To learn more about preventing mosquito bites and the appropriate use
of insect repellents, see

More Information
Malaria caused by _P. falciparum_ may rapidly result in a severe,
life-threatening illness if not promptly treated. If you have
traveled to Great Exuma and you become ill with fever and other
flu-like symptoms, you should immediately seek professional medical
care; inform your healthcare provider that you have visited an area
currently experiencing a malaria outbreak.

Healthcare providers needing assistance with diagnosis or management
of suspected cases of malaria should call the CDC Malaria Hotline:
770-488-7788 (M-F, 8 AM - 4:30 PM Eastern Time). For consultation
after regular business hours, call 770-488-7100 and ask to speak with
a CDC Malaria Branch clinician.

[ProMED-mail reported on the outbreak in 2006 and cited the results
of the CDC investigation in our posting from 21 Sep 2006 (see below).
The conclusion was that the transmission was initiated by
asymptomatic gametocyte carriers from a community of immigrants from
Haiti. This is probably also the source of the 2 new cases. The cases
illustrate the risk of introducing malaria into areas where the
climate permits transmission and the vector is present; the outbreak
in Jamaica, which started in November 2006, is probably still
ongoing. - Mod.EP]
