From the above media report it may be assumed that the cause of the fatal disease was identified by the animal health authorities, since their involvement, including vaccination, led to control of the event. This implies that the mortality was caused by an infectious agent against which vaccines are available. Information on the identity of the disease involved and vaccine used would be highly appreciated. - Mod.AS
