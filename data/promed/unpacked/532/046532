Malaria - Comoros: eradication project - comment
------------------------------------------------
Eradicating malaria in the Comoros archipelago is indeed a great hope, but
I would like to make some comments on the presented project.
I am a physician working on Comoros-acquired malaria imported to Marseille,
France. In Marseille, there is a large community of people from the Comoros
(about 70 000). Each year, after having visited friends and relatives
during the holidays in the Comoros archipelago (mostly Grande Comore, but
also Moheli and Mayotte), about 200 adults and children are hospitalized in
the 2 departments of infectious diseases and tropical medicine of the
Laveran military hospital and Nord teaching hospital for the management of
imported malaria. Therefore, the Chinese project appears to be of great
interest for the Comorian community in Marseille.
But there are 2 points that should be clarified:
1) As the Comoros archipelago consists of 4 islands with a great deal of
human movement via air and sea, I don't see how an intervention targeting
Moheli only could have wide and long term effect over the whole
archipelago. Also, I am not sure everyone knows that Grande Comore, Moheli
and Anjouan are 3 islands in the Republic of Comoros, while the 4th island,
Mayotte, is a French territory with a different administration. It appears
that the project does not have a regional approach over the whole
archipelago, unless there is a 2nd round that has not yet been presented.
2) The Comoros archipelago has a high prevalence of red cell genetic
disorders, such as G6PD (glucose 6 phosphatedehydrogenase) deficiency and
some hemoglobinopathies. Has this high prevalence been considered ahead of
wide distribution of primaquine without G6PD dosage? The theoretical risk
for hemolysis should be considered. What dose schedule of primaquine is to
be used?

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Simon for these comments and questions. The point on
G6PD deficiency is important, and the administration of primaquine in a
single dose is highly unorthodox. We will be happy to publish further
comments. - Mod.EP]
