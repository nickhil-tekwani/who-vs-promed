I can only partially address the questions.
In the US, Food and Drug Administration/Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research (http://www.fda.gov/cber/cberftp.html) regulates tissue and eye
banking. Dura mater and heart valves are classified as medical devices and
are regulated under a different section of the FDA. Please check the website
for further information and the latest updates.
Tissue banks in the US are governed by the American Association of Tissue
Banks (http://cgibin.erols.com/aatb/). An excellent site for more specific
information concerning tissue allografts is LifNet Transplant Services
(http://www.life-net.org/).
Only one case of CJD due to corneal transplant has been recorded and that was
in 1974. Eye Bank Association of America has a website
(http://www.restoresight.org/). Any reader requiring more information about
Medical Standards of the EBAA should contact them directly.
If I can be of assistance to anyone personally, feel free to contact me.

[So, dura mater and heart valves are classified as medical devices but
corneas are tissues. Perfectly clear. -- Mod CHC]
