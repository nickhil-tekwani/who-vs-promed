Investigations continue as further anthrax death announced
-----------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory results have confirmed a case of anthrax infection in a
deceased heroin user in the NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde area. This
takes the number of confirmed cases of anthrax in the current
outbreak in Scotland to 18, of whom a total of 9 individuals have now died.

This patient died on 12 Dec [2009] and so represents the earliest
death linked to this outbreak chronologically, however due to the
complexity of the various methods of testing for anthrax it has only
been possible to confirm the presence of anthrax infection now. It is
important to note that there is no evidence of person-to-person
transmission in this outbreak.

This user died on 12 Dec [2009] and was therefore exposed to heroin
in the early stages of this outbreak, however evidence suggests that
contaminated heroin may still be in circulation, and drug users all
across Scotland must remain vigilant. The outbreak began with the
identification of cases in NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde in December
[2009], with cases now having been identified in 6 NHS board areas
across the country, and represents the 1st known outbreak of anthrax
to have occurred in conjunction with drug use.

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland and head of the national Outbreak Control Team, said: "While
public health investigations are continuing to attempt to identify
the source of the contamination, no drug samples tested to date have
shown anthrax contamination, although a number of other types of
potentially harmful bacteria have been found. It must therefore be
assumed that all heroin in Scotland carries the risk of anthrax
contamination and users are advised to cease taking heroin by any
route if at all possible. While we appreciate that this may be
extremely difficult advice for users to follow, it remains the only
public health protection advice possible based on current evidence.
Users are encouraged to find out more about support services in their
area by calling Know the Score on 0800 587 5879 or visiting
<http://www.scottishdrugservices.com>. Those who do continue to use
heroin should follow current harm reduction advice, which says that
fresh filters should be used on each occasion and that filters should
not be re-used. It must be noted however that filters will not make
heroin safe or remove all traces of anthrax contamination, so the
best advice remains not to use heroin by any method. Users should
seek urgent medical attention in the event of symptoms such as
redness or swelling at or near an injection site or other symptoms of
general illness such a high temperature, chills, or a severe
headache, as early antibiotic treatment can be lifesaving."

Police enquiries are also ongoing. Strathclyde Police are
coordinating the Scottish Police investigation in support of this
public health response. The police are using their experience of
major investigations to establish the circumstances of how each
individual acquired their anthrax infection and are working to trace
the source of the contamination. Detective superintendent Derek
Robertson, who is leading the police investigation, said, "Our
investigations are supporting the public health response to the
current outbreak and we are working hard to attempt to identify the
source of the contamination. Anyone with any information on the sale
or supply of drugs in their area can report this to Crimestoppers in
complete confidence on 0800 555 111 and help remove dealers from
their communities".

[Many people, professional medics and vets included, think that
_Bacillus anthracis_ infections are easy to diagnose. I wish that
were so. My late lamented Russian colleague Benyamin Cherkasskiy
claimed that they could only culture some 30 percent of the human
cases they saw. And the Russians see more than most, unfortunately.
We have found over the years of field investigations that it is not
unusual for a veterinary diagnostic lab to come up with negatives of
patently obvious cases with prior positives. PCR analyses are a great
help in this field. And remember that some 5-9 percent of all
cultures will be penicillin resistant and/or phage resistant. It is
only in textbooks that it is simple.

On Wed 27 Jan 2010 I received a message from Dr Nigel Silman
<Nigel.Silman@hpa.org.uk> pointing out that it is the Health
Protection Agency Laboratories at Porton Down (Centre for Emergency
Preparedness and Response; CEPR) and not Dstl (Defence Science and
Technology Laboratory) who are undertaking all of these analyses as
well as the genotyping work on the strain transferred from Germany. I
do apologise for my error. I am reliably informed that the German
culture should arrive at CEPR Porton today, Fri 29 Jan 2010. - Mod.MHJ]
