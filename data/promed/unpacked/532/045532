Rivers State Records Two Cases of Lassa Fever
--------------------------------------
The Rivers Commissioner for Health, Dr Sampson Parker, on Wednesday 25 Jan 2012 announced an outbreak of lassa fever in the state. He said in Port Harcourt that two persons, including a female youth corps member, had been reported dead from the disease. Parker explained that the victims were serving in the state, but travelled to their homes in Edo and Ebonyi during the Christmas celebration, where they developed symptoms of the fever and eventually died. He said the state government had launched an enlightenment campaign to sensitise the people to the need to take necessary precautions against the disease.

Parker said the government had received reports of "pockets of occurrences" of lassa fever in seven states, including Edo and Ebonyi. "What we are doing now is to alert the people to the outbreak of the disease. "The fever is caused by the urine of a species of rat and mistakenly, when such enters the food we eat, it can be contracted.

"We want the people to be environmentally conscious and report to the nearest health centre, any symptoms of the disease, while they should avoid self medication." "Being a cosmopolitan area, it is possible that rats are found in trucks that bring food to the state. People should wash their fruits and vegetables with water before consumption."

The commissioner said officers from the Ministry of Health had been sent to various communities to inform the people about the disease and educate them on what to do once the symptoms are detected in their areas. "We are not taking chances, and we want to be pro-active in our approach to this development."

He said the government had in stock available drugs to treat the fever.

[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease and humans become infected as a result of contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the "multimammate rat." These rodents when infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their excreta.

Lassa fever occurs in all age groups and in both men and women. Persons at greatest risk are those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ rodentsare are usually found, especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions. Health care workers are at risk if proper barrier nursing and infection control practices are not maintained. Lassa virus may be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions of a person with Lassa fever. There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles. Sexual transmission of Lassa virus has been reported. (For further information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs179/en/index.html).

Rivers state lies in the extreme south of Nigeria. The states of Edo and Ebonyi where an outbreak of of Lassa fever was reported recently (see ProMED-mail reference below) lie to the north of Rivers state and are not contiguous with it. Therefore it seem likely that the two victims in Rivers state contracted infection during travel in the two more northerly states, rather than as a result of infection within Rivers state.
