The number of reported cases in a 3-month Buncombe County-based salmonella outbreak is still climbing, but health officials say they’re seeing fewer and fewer new cases of the disease each week. The total number of reported cases linked to the outbreak was 83 as of Friday afternoon, 18 May 2012, 62 of which involved residents of Buncombe County. The Buncombe total increased from 59 to 62 cases over the last week. The total count includes cases of people who visited or otherwise had connections to Buncombe County and were believed to have been exposed there.

“We do know there’s still transmission going and believe that it is all person-to-person at this point,” said Sue Ellen Morrison, disease control supervisor for the Buncombe County Department of Health. “At this point, we’re just urging people to be vigilant about hand washing and food preparation,” she said. “We just can’t say that enough.”

Agriculture officials have isolated the strain of salmonella that struck in late February 2012 — called Paratyphi B — to one ingredient: a starter culture distributed by Tempeh Online of Rockville, MD, to local company Smiling Hara Tempeh.

Morrison emphasized the need to use separate cutting boards and food preparation surfaces for meats and any raw fruits of vegetables being served, pointing out that meat substitute products like tofu and tempeh should be treated separately in the cooking process. “Meat substitutes are something that we didn’t even have in a category in the interview process,” she said of the investigation into the source of the outbreak. “It was because one of our nurses ate tempeh (as part of her regular diet) and discovered this sort of anecdotally that we were able to address this so quickly.”

The FDA is investigating but has yet to discover or release information on exactly where the starter culture was produced. Most tempeh starter is imported from Indonesia, where the protein originated.

[It appears that the source of the outbreak strain of _S._ Paratyphi B, probably the d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java), has been identified as the starter culture. ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the possibility of additional cultures in other states related to the same source.
