South Korean Health and Welfare Ministry Disease Control Division
confirmed on 4 Nov 2011 that sterilizing agents added to humidifiers
were the cause of a lung disease cluster and strongly urged people not
use such agents with humidifiers.

[The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- KCDC]
reported that investigations had shown that antiseptics used with
humidifiers were highly associated with a number of lung injury cases.
Therefore, in September 2011, they conducted experiments using mice
(rats?), allowing experimental animals to inhale antiseptics from
humidifiers. Necropsy of these animals showed pulmonary fibrosis
similar to those found in humans.

An expert panel will convene shortly to discuss the association
between these antiseptics and disease. Once the association has been
confirmed, sales of the antiseptics for humidifiers will be banned.
Because humidifier use is increased in the fall and winter, Health and
Welfare Ministry strongly urges to discontinue the sale and use of
these agents.

The report pointed out that a cluster of lung disease of unknown cause
was reported in April 2011, causing panic. Disease Control Division
reported in August 2011 that antiseptics or cleaners for humidifiers
were likely to be associated with lung disease.

Korean news reports that since August 2011, antiseptics for
humidifiers have been taken off the shelves. It is hard to find these
agents on the market now.

Steriliser blamed for mysterious South Korean deaths
----------------------------------------------------
A sterilising agent for home humidifiers probably caused the
mysterious deaths of 4 pregnant women, an official with a South Korean
health agency said Thursday [1 Sep 2011].

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) began
investigating after 28 cases of lung disease with unknown causes were
reported since 2004, many of them this year [2011] and involving
pregnant women, 4 of whom died earlier this year.

The agency said tests showed that a harmful substance in a steriliser
-- used by all the patients in their humidifiers -- could seriously
damage lung cells.

Tests showed that those who added the steriliser to their humidifiers
were 47.3 times more likely to get lung damage than those who did not,
KCDC said in a statement.

"The odds ratio of 47.3, clinically speaking, is exceptionally high
and rare," Youn Seung-Ki, a senior KCDC official, told AFP on Thursday
[1 Sep 2011].

KCDC refused to identify the harmful substance in the steriliser,
which it said was widely used in other goods like shampoo and
cosmetics, saying it could not verify whether the substance was also
harmful through skin contact.

"We still need more tests to reach a concrete final conclusion. But we
have decided, as a precaution, to urge people against using humidifier
steriliser and companies from selling the products," it said in a
statement.

Major steriliser producers had agreed to suspend sales until the final
result of the agency's probe comes out in about 3 months, Youn said.

"The patients added the steriliser whenever they replaced water in the
humidifiers and used a whole bottle (of steriliser) a month on
average," KCDC said.

South Korean households often use humidifiers during the long, cold,
and dry winter.

The agency said pregnant women spend more time resting at home,
increasing their exposure to air from the humidifiers. Women also
inhale about 30 percent more air after childbirth, meaning they could
be more at risk at that time.

About 600 000 units of humidifier steriliser worth 2 billion won (USD
1.8 million) are sold every year in South Korea. Makers of the product
say it helps remove bacteria and dirt from the water before it is
released into the air.

[An antiseptic, or disinfectant for humidifiers in this case must be
of some chemical component. The article in [2] mentions that the
substance is used in shampoos and cosmetics. The most frequent
compound that I can think of is sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS or NaDS),
sodium laurilsulfate, or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). It is generally
used as an agent for lather, as in soap, or as a degreaser for
components such as engine cleaners. They are often mixed with coconut
or palm oils or other cheap oils for mixture in various domestic
products.

SLS has been effectively used as a microbicide. It is believed to be
effective against a number of viruses, including HIV.

Please understand, I am NOT saying this is the substance being used in
these humidifiers, I am only suggesting it as a possibility based on
information in the article.

We would appreciate some information regarding the mystery substance
in the cleaner, or antiseptic used in these humidifiers. - Mod.TG]
