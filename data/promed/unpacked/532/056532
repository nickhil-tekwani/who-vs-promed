Two Maine residents were hospitalized after a salmonellosis outbreak linked to crabmeat from Hardie's Crabmeat in Deer Isle, state health officials report. Maine CDC is investigating at least 5 cases linked to the outbreak. Four Maine residents and someone from New Hampshire are among the confirmed cases in the outbreak.

Maine CDC and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry discovered the crabmeat was likely contaminated during preparation and packaging. Maine officials recommend packages of Hardie's Crabmeat purchased between 15 Jun 2021 and 15 Aug 2021 be thrown away. Freezing doesn't destroy the bacteria that cause _Salmonella_.

Hardie's Crabmeat addressed concerns from investigators about the contaminated food, and Maine CDC said there's no evidence crabmeat currently being sold poses a risk if eaten. Crabmeat from Hardie's was sold at multiple places across Maine, but packages should be clearly labeled as from that company.
