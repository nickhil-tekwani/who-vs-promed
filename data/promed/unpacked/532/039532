Four cases of typhoid have been detected in Manukau City in what medical
officials describe as an unusual flare-up of the disease. There has been a
spate [upsurge? - Mod.LL] of cases of the disease in Auckland since
September 2006. Most of those were people who contracted typhoid overseas.
Auckland regional medical officer of health Craig Thornley, however, says
the latest cluster in Clendon over the past month is unusual, since the
people affected in this cluster had not been traveling and probably
contracted the disease locally.
Dr Thornley says 4 ready-to-eat food outlets link 3 of the 4 cases and are
being intensively investigated. He will not say which they are, because
there is no evidence yet any are to blame. Manukau City Council, which
monitors the area's food premises, has already closed one of the outlets
after discovering it had inadequate toilet and hand washing facilities.

[If the investigation of this cluster reveals a food handler who is a
carrier of the typhoid bacillus, the spectre of Mary Mallon -- Typhoid Mary
-- resurfaces. A recent, more 2-sided telling of her story can be found at
<http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/typhoid/mary.html>. There are some excellent
pictures related to her story at the URL as well.
