WHO: 3 million Yemenis infected with bilharzia
----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization's (WHO) representative in Yemen, Ghulam R
Popal, said that there are 3 million Yemenis infected with bilharzias
[schistosomiasis], inflicting human and economic losses on the country. 20
per cent of the patients are suffering serious developments that are likely
to result in death.

In a Sana'a [capital of Yemen] workshop held last Wednesday [20 Feb 2008]
in preparation for a bilharzia eradication campaign that will be held on 11
Mar [2008], Rabani stated that the world had gotten rid of bilharzia, with
Yemen and Sudan being the only countries in the Middle East which are still
suffering from the disease, while other less developed countries have
managed to eradicate it.

Rabani pointed to countries such as Egypt and Afghanistan, places where the
bilharzia parasite was at one time more prevalent than in Yemen, and noted
that they managed to get rid of the disease through awareness campaigns.
Tunisian Riadh Bin Ismail, the WHO regional expert said, "The bilharzia
drug, called 'brazicontel' [praziquantel] has been approved by the WHO and
has no side effects if taken properly."

This eradication campaign changes the previous mechanism of shell
collection and preventing children from swimming in pools, which proved to
be more expensive, to one of giving the drug to children in the targeted
age group of 6 through 18 years. This age group is responsible for 90 per
cent of the disease's spread. Bilharzia treatment and prevention costs in
Yemen come to about USD 80 million each year.

Dr Abdulhakim al-Kahlani, General Epidemics Observatory manager in the
Health Ministry, said during his speech that this campaign is an important
factor in breaking the bilharzia life cycle because there will eventually
be no infected people who can contaminate stagnant water with the parasite.

Dr Abdullah Oshaish, bilharzia combat manager, explained that collective
curing targets 2 million of children at the school age. 31 per cent of
these do not go to school, pointing out that this year's [2008] campaign
aims at giving the drug to children living in 36 districts, spreading over
Taiz, Haja, al-Dhalie, al-Mahwait, Abian, and Dhamar. More than 40 media
people joined this campaign, organized by the Sana'a unit of WHO.
