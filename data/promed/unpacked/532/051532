At least 4 states have seen an increase in the number of cases of people ingesting household cleaners in an effort to prevent or cure the coronavirus. Illinois, New York, Maryland, and Michigan have all seen increases.

Over the weekend, Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike warned people not to take those products as a form of home remedy.

"Some recent examples include the use of detergent solution for a sinus rinse and gargling with a bleach and mouthwash mixture in an attempt to kill coronavirus," Ezike said. "Injecting, ingesting, [or] snorting household cleaners is dangerous."

The number for Illinois Poison Control is 1-800-222-1222.

[Cleaning products (more products than just bleach or sodium hypochlorite) can be very dangerous to mucous membranes of the nose, throat, and mouth. Unless a product is specifically designated for use in or on the human body, individuals should refrain from using cleaning products in such a manner. Cleaning products can be corrosive, inflammatory, or even deadly to tissues and to the entire body when used in such an inappropriate manner in the human body.

Bleach is a chemical compound called sodium hypochlorite. Most household bleaches contain concentrations of approximately 3-6%. Bleach is a relatively clear liquid diluted with water and used to kill fungi, bacteria, and viruses on a variety of surfaces (countertops, desktops, floors, etc. but not mucus membranes, such as the nose, throat, mouth, or genital regions) and can help reduce the load of viruses within the household. Bleach or sodium hypochlorite is corrosive, meaning it can destroy human tissue, such as mucous membranes of the nose, throat, mouth, and eyes and may blister intact skin.

Symptoms of inappropriate use/consumption of bleach can range from gagging, pain and irritation in the mouth and throat, pain and possible burns in the esophagus and stomach, and vomiting; shock can appear immediately to within a few hours. If the symptoms are not treated immediately, it can permanently damage the gastrointestinal tract and internal organs and, depending on how much was consumed, it can cause death.

According to the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center, if there is no vomiting or convulsion, drinking 4-8 oz (118 to 237 mL) of milk or water will help dilute the bleach. However, medical treatment should still be sought. Unless a poison control center specifically tells an individual to cause vomiting, this should be avoided after bleach is ingested.

Seek an ambulance to a hospital where treatment may consist of endoscopy or gastric lavage (washing the stomach) followed by a procedure to suck out or remove the stomach contents through a tube. This prevents further burning of the tissues of the esophagus.

This is a serious situation.

Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that some companies (Miracle Mineral Solutions or Master Mineral Solution) are allegedly marketing such solutions to combat HIV/AIDs, cancer, flu, and coronaviruses. The directions on these dangerous products direct the consumer to mix the solution with a citrus fruit juice (another acid). The combination produces chlorine dioxide, a bleaching agent that may be used in commercial water treatment. The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about these solutions.
