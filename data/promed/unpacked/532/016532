Yellow Fever (YF) transmission in Putamayo province, Colombia
-----------------------------------------------
The area of the YF outbreak is separated from coastal Colombia/Ecuador by
the Andes.
In 1994, while working in Ecuador, I was asked by the Ecuadorian government
to visit Nueva Loja (Lago Agrio) to investigate an outbreak of
dengue. Nueva Loja is close to the Rio San Miguel, which forms the border
with the affected Colombian province.
The local authorities had made an intensive survey of the town and
concluded that transmission was limited to a small block in a residential area.
Although interested in dengue, I was more concerned with the possibility
that YF could move from Nueva Loja across the Andes to the coastal region,
where _Stegomyia aegypti_ [formerly known as _Aedes aegypti_] is
common. Massive epidemics of dengue have occurred in coastal cities in the
past 25 years.
Records in the local hospital showed some deaths from yellow fever every
year, but the local personnel held that the region is isolated, with little
possibility of spread to other towns.
Between the hospital and the block where the dengue had occurred, I chanced
upon 3 parked buses. I learned that all 3 were leaving at dawn for
Esmeraldas, Guayaquil and one other city, the name of which escapes me.
In conversation with persons in the neighborhood, I learned that such buses
leave for these cities every day. Altogether, we estimated that around 16
000 people travel from the Nueva Loja to the coast each year by
bus. Moreover, although access to the area is restricted, there are also
other means of departing the area, including a small airport. I was also
told that there is considerable (illegal) cross-border movement.
I mention all this to emphasize that the massive mountain chain of the
Andes cannot be considered a barrier to the movement of YF virus to coastal
areas where _St. aegypti_ [_Ae. aegypti_] is abundant.
Esmeraldas has a population of 616 000 and Guayaquil about 3 million.
During an investigation at the end of a massive dengue epidemic in 1988 in
Guayaquil (by the Ecuadorian Government and CDC), results of a longitudinal
sero-survey indicated that there had been 404 000 cases of the disease in a
period of less than 3 months.
These findings indicate that the introduction of YF to such cities could
provoke a major epidemic.

[Dr. Reiter's observations and concerns are right on target here. As a
reminder, the _St. aegypti_ [_Ae. aegypti_] mosquito is the vector for
urban yellow fever as well as for dengue fever. Given the amount of
traffic and transportation of people and material from inland yellow-fever
prone areas to coastal areas with high indices of _St. aegypti_ [_Ae.
aegypti_], the potential for introduction of urban yellow fever
transmission to the coastal areas cannot be taken lightly. Dr. Reiter's
visit to Nueva Loja (Lago Agrio) to investigate a dengue outbreak in the
area, where there were cases of yellow fever as well, was cause enough for
concern at the time. As both diseases can share the same vector, the
potential for urbanization of yellow fever is clearly there. - Mod.MPP]
