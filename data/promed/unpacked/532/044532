[This OIE report relates to the 3 earlier October 2012 reports involving some 22 human cases; see 20121021.1356517, 20121022.1358240, and 20121026.1366840. Fortunately, the veterinary services response was effective in revaccinating [note "revaccinating"] all the livestock -- 2626 cattle, 3496 sheep and goats, 17 horses, and 176 pigs) -- in Tsovak and Vanevan. They are to be commended. Reading between the lines, either the normal spring vaccination was ineffective or the 2 owners of these late-season affected animals had not vaccinated them, quite possibly the latter. - Mod.MHJ
