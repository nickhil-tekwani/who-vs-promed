[This is the 2nd case of ASF reported by Hong Kong. As with the 1st reported case in May 2019, the source of infection was associated with the importation of pigs from China; the affected premise is again the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse.

The media report noted that "The latest dead animal in question had been imported from a farm in Meizhou city of Guangdong province on 25 May [2019], the Food and Health Bureau said on Saturday [1 Jun 2019]. At that time, [the animal] did not show any symptoms of the disease, and health authorities were investigating the case. "The earlier case was found in a pig imported from Zhanjiang in Guangdong" (see https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3012715/african-swine-fever-returns-hong-kong-hitting).

The OIE follow-up report no. 2 submitted 22 May 2019 for the 1st case of ASF (see ProMED-mail posting 20190513.6466692) detected in Hong Kong is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=30580. The epidemiological comments of this report state that "This is the 1st occurrence of African swine fever in Hong Kong. An African swine fever surveillance system is in place for local pig farms, slaughterhouses, and wild boars in Hong Kong. The virus was detected in tissue samples collected from a condemned carcass of an imported pig tested as part of the laboratory-quality management system. The slaughterhouse that held the pig was subsequently declared an infected place. Operations were suspended on 10 May [2019], and a total of 6515 pigs in the affected slaughterhouse were all destroyed and disposed of. Following rounds of thorough cleansing, disinfection, and inspection, the slaughterhouse re-opened on 19 May 2019." - Mod.CRD
