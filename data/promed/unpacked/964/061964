In response to a request from one of the moderators I have this information
to offer. Ambush is permethrin which is a synthetic pyrethroid. It is
widely used as a contact insecticide to control a wide range of
agricultural pests as well as medically important arthropods such as
mosquitoes and ticks. It is commonly used in many military organizations
worldwide to impregnate uniforms to prevent vector-borne disease
transmission due to its repellent properties. Another brand name is Prelude
and they are distributed by Zeneca Corporation. Both of these formulations
are registered for agricultural use. Those used for medically important
arthropods bear different brand names. Pyrethroids in general have low
mammalian toxicities but are very toxic to aquatic life especially fish.
Ambush C is cypermethrin which is the same compound which bears a cyanide
group to promote greater molecular stability therefore increasing residual
activity.
Complete molecular structure information and other properties of these
chemicals can be found in the Global Insecticide Directory First Edition by
W. L. Hopkins.
>From my experience with insecticide toxicology, applied vector control in
the field and use of these compounds, this is REAL bad news for those
ecosystems. Hope this helps.

[You can find Permethrin at the following EPA website, but there are many
other places as well listed when searching either under Permethrin or
'Ambush'.

I have made enquiries locally in S. Africa because a pesticide called
"Ambush" was marketed here (although I believe stocks are still available
at some agricultural-chemical outlets).
Old formulations ( I don't know how many years ago) were marketed as Ambush
and contained Aldicarb a Carbonate (LD50 for fish 0.56mg/l). However newer
formulations evidently contained Permethrin of the Pyrethroid group with an
LD50 for fish of 0.009mg/l but were still marketed as Ambush!
Both are evidently very toxic to fish so one or both of these pesticides
under the name of "Ambush" could be the culprit. They were used as a
contact insecticide covering a broad range of pests e.g.. leaf and fruit
eating insects on various crops.

[I checked ALDICARB out on the EPA website
Aldicarb
<http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/dwh/t-soc/aldicarb.html>
Drinking Water and Health
As part of the Drinking Water and Health pages, this fact sheet is part of
a larger publication:
National Primary Drinking Water Regulations
Technical Factsheet on: ALDICARB AND METABOLITES
NOTE: The MCLs for aldicarb and its metabolites are presently stayed.
Health Effects Summary
Acute: EPA has found aldicarb to potentially cause nausea, diarrhea and
relatively minor neurological symptoms resulting from acute exposures at
levels above the MCL. These effects appear to be rapidly and completely
reversible after exposure. No Health Advisories have been established for
short-term exposures.
Chronic: Aldicarb has the potential to cause neurological effects such as
sweating, pupillary constriction and leg weakness from chronic exposure at
levels above the MCL. These effects are associated with the inhibition of
cholinesterase in blood and nerve tissue.
Cancer: There is inadequate evidence to state whether or not either
aldicarb or its metabolites have the potential to cause cancer from
lifetime exposures in drinking water.
-- and there is more. These symptoms are similar to those quoted for people
eating the poisoned fish.
Gary mentioned the ecosystem damage from this pesticide. After I had
finishing posting yesterday I went back and looked at the East African
maps. There are a large number of rivers there, where also, one must
presume, people fish, bathe, wash clothes, and collect drinking water. See
the next communication. - Mod.MHJ

Several subscribers on the alloprimate mailing list have asked what
effects, if any, have been noted with primate populations on the lake
shore, especially regarding baboons that steal fish from local fishermen
after the fish are brought to shore. Any signs of poisoning?
Any information is appreciated.
