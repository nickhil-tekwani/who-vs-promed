[With the addition of these 3 newly confirmed cases and 1 death in a previously confirmed case, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 is now 157 including 39 fatalities (reported case fatality ratio 24.8 percent). The month of June 2019 has been a relatively quiet month with 7 newly confirmed cases reported, 6 of whom were primary cases (5 of whom had a history of contact with camels) and 1 was a secondary case. These 7 cases were reported from Al Qaṣim (3 cases), Riyadh (2 cases), and 1 case each from Ash Sharquiyah (Eastern) region, and Al Madinah region.

Abstract
Background
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ribavirin and recombinant interferon (RBV/rIFN) therapy on the outcomes of critically ill patients with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) accounting for time-varying confounders.

Methods
This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS from 14 hospitals in Saudi Arabia diagnosed between 09/2012 and 01/2018. We evaluated the association of RBV/rIFN with 90-day mortality and MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA clearance using marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders.

Results
Of 349 MERS patients, 144 (41.3%) patients received RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-α2a, rIFN-α2b or rIFN-β1a, none received rIFN-β1b). RBV/rIFN was initiated at a median 2 days (quartile 1, 3: 1, 3 days) from ICU admission. Crude 90-day mortality was higher in patients with RBV/rIFN compared to no RBV/rIFN [106/144 (73.6%) compared to 126/205 (61.5%), p 0.02]. After adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders using a marginal structural model, RBV/rIFN was not associated with changes in 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI 0.73, 1.44, p 0.87) or with more rapid MERS-CoV RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio 0.65, 95% CI 0.30, 1.44, p 0.29).

Conclusions
In this observational study, RBV/rIFN (RBV and/or rIFN-α2a, rIFN-α2b or rIFN-β1a) therapy was commonly used in critically ill MERS patients but was not associated with reduction in 90-day mortality or in faster MERS-CoV RNA clearance.

[In the above retrospective observational study, all studied participants were critically ill and ICU based when antiviral therapy was implemented. A question that comes to mind is whether earlier initiation of the therapy (perhaps at time of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection) would have led to better outcomes, with fewer cases progressing on to severe clinical disease... Given the number of studies that have had similar conclusions (no improvement in survival outcome) it may well be difficult to conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial addressing the use of antiviruals for clinical management. - Mod.MPP]
