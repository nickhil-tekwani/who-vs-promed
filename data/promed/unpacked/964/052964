Acute diarrhea is among the diseases monitored in France since 1990. According to the data disseminated by the Sentinel network France, it was noted that in metropolitan France, the incidence of cases of acute diarrhea detected in consultation of general medicine has slightly exceeded the epidemic threshold. The cases were of 300 cases for 100 000 inhabitants for a threshold of 282 cases.

According to data from the network, it was found that 6 regions had markedly exceeded the epidemic threshold and which are the Aquitaine with 308 cases, the Alsace with 319 cases, Provence-alpes-Cote-d'Azur with 327 cases, Lower Normandy 339 cases, Languedoc-Roussillon with 571 and the area which is at the head of this epidemic, and the Nord-Pas-de-Calais with 884 recorded cases.

It has been reported that 43 percent of the sick persons were men with an average age of 28 years. The gastroenteritis is contagious in the majority of cases when it is viral, bacterial or parasitic. The gastroenteritis is a very common illness and most of the people can easily run the risk of being affected. This risk is due to a bad hygiene and to some inappropriate actions in the handling of food.
