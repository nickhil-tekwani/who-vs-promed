Health authorities in South Lampung [regency of Lampung province] have
declared a special alert for the chikungunya virus in Bakauheni district,
after 121 residents contracted the disease. The alert was issued following
an increase in the number of infected residents, South Lampung Disease
Prevention and Surveillance chief Kristi Endrawati told Antara news agency
on Friday [12 Feb 2010?]. "During the rainy season, the spread of
chikungunya disease has intensified," she said. The disease 1st infected
residents in Hatta village before spreading to other areas of Bakauheni.

Once infected with the virus, victims typically develop a high fever,
reddish spots, joint pains, flu symptoms and headaches and vomiting.

Numbers of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which carries the chikungunya
virus and spreads it in humans through its bite, were rapidly increasing in
cacao plantation areas in the regency, she said. Kristi said that the
agency has held campaigns asking local residents to bury cacao pods, which
can hold water and serve as a breeding grounds for mosquitoes. "We have
also conducted fogging in Bakauheni's densely-populated areas and provided
medical services to locals," she said.

In South Kalimantan regency of Banjar [Borneo], at least 4500 people were
infected with the disease over the past 40 days. Banjar Disease Prevention
Agency chief Endah Labati said recently that the number was expected to
increase because the mosquitoes were breeding quickly in the wet season.
