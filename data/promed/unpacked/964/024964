In June 2022, 2 outbreaks of anthrax were declared in Extremadura. Now, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, the disease has reached Asturias. It is a focus in the municipality of Cangas de Onis, and has occurred in a cattle farm with 136 sensitive animals. This is the 3rd outbreak reported in Spain this year [2022].

Unlike this outbreak, which has occurred in cattle, the outbreaks in the province of Badajoz in Extremadura occurred in sheep. In addition, this year [2022] a veterinarian contracted the disease, possibly after performing a necropsy on a cow.

In 2021, Extremadura already suffered several cases of anthrax that also affected some people. This situation led the Cáceres Veterinary College to issue an urgent statement in which they asked the region's veterinarians to take extreme precautions when carrying out necropsies on these animals. "Therefore, and given the zoonotic nature of anthrax, if when we visit a farm we find a dead animal that could have symptoms compatible with anthrax, a necropsy will not be performed on the animal and it will be reported immediately," they explained.

Anthrax is a notifiable disease, included in the EDO list of the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). According to the European Agency for Food Safety (EFSA), the control measures basically consist of the implementation of biosecurity measures and the vaccination of susceptible animals.

The Asturias Veterinary Association has received an official notification from the principality warning of the detection of an outbreak of anthrax in a livestock farm in the council of Onís. The animals of these pastures must be vaccinated and may not be used for human consumption.

The Ministry of Rural Affairs has indicated that it has been identified in the Cabañayu and Cabos pastures and that the animals housed there "must be vaccinated against the disease and for those who have not yet gone to them, 3 weeks must elapse from the date of vaccination to be able to access them and provided that there have been no deaths in the last 15 days."

[The 2nd report lists outbreaks in pastures in Cabañayu and Cabos, presumably in 2 separate farms. Checking our reports of anthrax in Spain, we have not previously posted any anthrax outbreaks in Asturias.

Asturias is situated in northwest Spain, a fair distance from central Spain and Extremadura, in a mountainous setting with vast greenery and lush vegetation, making it part of Green Spain. The region has a maritime climate. It receives plenty of annual rainfall and little sunshine by Spanish standards and has very moderated seasons, most often averaging in the lower 20s C. Heatwaves are rare due to mountains blocking southerly winds. Winters are very mild for the latitude, especially near sea level (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asturias).

Livestock anthrax is sporadic in Spain. This is clearly an unusual event. In the past, prior to their national control and surveillance program, central Spain had enzootic anthrax and reported a significant number of human cases each year. One might suspect that this pasture, presently contaminated, had had a number of anthrax cattle graves. Past flooding may have floated the spores to the upper soil surface. And the grazing cattle -- cows graze by pulling the forage out of the soil -- acquired infective doses of spores. Such outbreaks can occur when old cattle graves are disturbed when re-laying drains, clearing old stream beds, and other soil activities. On the other hand, it might be the result of latent infections in cattle purchased in Extremadura and transported to Asturias, and if so, the genotype would match the strains seen in Extremadura. We must await the results of any investigations into the source and genesis of these 2 affected herds. Thanks to Mahmoud Orabi. - Mod.MHJ
