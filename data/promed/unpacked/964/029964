[This report includes information released by official sources up to Fri 13
Jul 2001, edited for presentation in ProMED-mail.
Since the preceding West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance report of Fri 6 Jul
2001, there have been 15 new reports of WNV-positive wild birds.
Consequently, the total of WNV-positive birds for 2001 becomes 38 (all
crows): New Jersey 19, Maryland 11, Connecticut 3, New York 2, Rhode Island
2 and Florida 1.
WNV-positive mosquitoes has been reported only from New Jersey and
Delaware. WNV-infected mosquitoes were not reported from Delaware in 1999
or 2000.
The USDA Report which follows provides a more detailed breakdown of this
information, including a listing of the mosquito isolates by species, with
the exception of the mosquito report from Delaware. - Mod.CP

Second Bird Positive for West Nile Virus in Stamford
----------------------------------------------------
The State Mosquito Management Program today announced the second bird
positive for West Nile virus (WNV) in Connecticut. The bird, a crow, was
found on Fri 29 Jun 2001 in the Springdale Section of Stamford. The crow
was tested through the State's wild bird surveillance system.
As part of the Connecticut Mosquito Management Program, there are 3
mosquito trap sites in Stamford (Sleepy Hollow Park, Cove Island Park, and
Intervale Road). All mosquitoes collected at the 3 trapping sites from 11
Jun to 25 Jun 2001 have tested negative for WNV. Additional mosquitoes were
collected from the Stamford sites on Thu 5 Jul 2001 and are currently being
tested with results due by the week of 16 Jul 2001.
The City of Stamford has a comprehensive mosquito control program that
includes larviciding and mosquito breeding site reduction. No additional
state action is required. The Mosquito Management Program will continue the
regular schedule for mosquito trapping in Stamford and statewide.
David K. Leff, Deputy Commissioner, Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP), stated that: "Today's bird is the second crow with WNV identified in
the State. The City of Stamford is already doing its part to protect the
public from WNV by having a comprehensive local mosquito control program.
We remind the public to take personal precautions to reduce mosquito bites,
reduce mosquito breeding sites around their homes and community by
eliminating standing water, especially after heavy rains, and to report
dead bird sightings to their local health departments."

Cumulative Test Results as of 11 Jul 2001
-----------------------------------------
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, 261 birds, mostly crows, have been tested by the Department of
Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental Laboratory. Of
those tested, 19 crows found in Bergen (1), Camden (1), Mercer (1),
Middlesex (12), Monmouth (3) and Morris (1) Counties have been confirmed
positive for the presence of the West Nile virus (WNV).
Mosquito Testing
To date, 13 mosquito pools collected in Middlesex (3), Monmouth (5) and
Morris (5) Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. In total,
734 mosquito pools have been tested.
Human Testing
In total, 17 residents have been approved for WNV testing and 16 have
accepted. Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from these individuals have
been or are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. These
individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered. To
date, testing has shown that 3 individuals were not infected with WNV and
results are pending for 13 others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been no cases of West Nile virus (WNV) infection detected in
horses or humans anywhere in the United States in 2001.

There have been 37 wild birds, all crows, reported as positive for WNV in 6
States. New Jersey has reported the most positive crows (19), but the most
significant finding was the positive crow detected in Jefferson County in
northern Florida. That finding marks the farthest south that any WNV
activity has ever been confirmed in the Western Hemisphere. The Florida
crow from which WNV was isolated was collected in mid-June.
No sentinel birds have been reported as WNV-positive in 2001.
In total, 13 mosquito pools have been reported as WNV positive in 2001. All
