Frank Shann's comments on the treatment of pigbel raise some interesting
questions in the choice of antimicrobial therapy.
Clearly, the final arbiter of what is the treatment of choice is the well
designed prospective trial. Nonetheless, a comment based on theoretical
considerations:
Disease results not from the presence of _Clostridium perfringens_, but
from its toxin. Indeed, finding _C. perfringens_ in stool is not abnormal.
This being so, treatment aimed at rapid reduction of toxin might be
expected to be more effective than that aimed at killing the organism. An
analogy would be severe streptococcal disease, in which more rapid clinical
improvement is seen with clindamycin, which turns off protein production,
than with penicillin (non-viable bacteria continuing to elaborate toxins).
If so, it might be expected that chloramphenicol (as an agent which acts on
protein synthesis) could give superior clinical results than penicillin or
metronidazole, even if it does not clear the organism. Gentamicin will
have no effect on _C. perfringens_.
Has the comparative study been done?

[For aminoglycosides like gentamicin, penetration of the protoplasmic
membrane of bacterial cells is dependent upon aerobic metabolism and is
electron transport-mediated. The absence of these pathways is thought to
be the principal reason that anaerobes and facultative organisms grown
under anaerobic conditions are uniformly resistant. Professor Shann's
recommendation (see: Pig belly disease - Solomon Islands (02) 980615234342)
of penicillin plus gentamicin plus metronidazole as a combination therapy
may be effective if the action of penicillin and metronidazole (both
bactericidal antimicrobials) increases the permeability of the protoplasmic
membrane and permits entry of gentamicin. The anti-ribosomal properties of
gentamicin would then be expected to contribute to a synergistic
antimicrobial effect. - Mod.ES
