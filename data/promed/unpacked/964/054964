Ministry of Health announces the discovery of new human case of bird flu
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Abdel Rahman Shahin, spokesman for the [Egyptian] Ministry of
Health, announced that today [Wed 26 Jan 2011] discovery of a new
human case of bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection] has
been identified. The case is a 7-year-old child resident in the
Gharbia governorate. This is the 122nd case since the onset of the
disease in Egypt in 2006, and the 4th confirmed case in 2011.

Shahin stated that the child had been admitted to a hospital in the
Gharbia Governorate suffering from fever, sore throat, cough and
muscle and joint pain. He had been exposed to domestic birds
(chickens) and was suspected to be suffering from bird flu. The
patient has received Tamiflu treatment and is in stable condition.
