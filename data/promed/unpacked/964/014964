[According to the most recent update on avian influenza A(H7N9) available on the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) website, as of 14 May 2014, a total of 423 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the Mainland. Cases have been reported from: Zhejiang (138 cases), Guangdong (106 cases), Jiangsu (53 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Hunan (23 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Anhui (14 cases), Jiangxi (8 cases), Beijing (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Shandong (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case, imported from Zhejiang), and Hebei (1 case). (See http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/599/34679.html for the most recent report).

Of the 8 cases reported this month (May 2014), 6 had a history of exposure to poultry but information for the other 2 was not available. The most recent date of onset of onset of illness of confirmed cases is 2 May 2014, in Guangdong province. It does appear as though transmission may be slowing down for this current wave. A key unknown is whether there will be yet another (3rd) wave of transmission in the late autumn.
