Nipah Virus Encephalitis : Tracking A Killer Virus
--------------------------------------------------
Chua KB, Lam SK
Department of Medical Microbiology
The outbreak of viral encephalitis started in Perak in late September 1998
and spread to Negeri Sembilan by late February 1999. We received
cerebrospinal fluid specimens from Seremban Hospital on 1st March and
worked on a fast track to isolate and identify the killer virus.
Although we confirmed several cases of Japanese encephalitis infection
serologically, epidemiological evidence suggested the existence of another
virus. Specimens were inoculated into a variety of host systems and within
five days, we detected a virus which caused syncytial formation in Vero
cells. Electron microscopy revealed pleomorphic viral particles ranging in
size from 160 - 300 nm, making us suspect that it is a member of the
paramyxovirus family.
At CDC, Fort Collins, arborviruses were ruled out and electron microscopy
confirmed our own observation. Further studies at CDC, Atlanta, revealed
that the virus was related antigenically to the Australian Hendra virus.
Since it is obviously a new virus, it was named Nipah virus after the
locality of the outbreak.
After confirming that Nipah virus is a paramyxovirus, we advised the
Ministry of Health on relevant control measures, which included the
avoidance of direct contact with infected pigs and the liberal use of
disinfectants in pig farms. Based on our suggestion, ribavarin was used in
the management of infected patients showing early symptoms. We also
established that throat gargles and urine from patients contained the virus
and the information was used to prevent nosocomial infections.
Tracking this killer virus, from isolation to identification, took exactly
17 days.
