Malaria has so far claimed 125 lives throughout the country since the
beginning of malaria peak season last month [March 2011] amid reports
of serious shortage of drugs in most districts. A further 71 858
people have so far been treated for the disease. Of the cases, 9549
were reported in the week ending 3 Apr 2011 with 2007 of the cases
being children under the age of 5.

According to information from the Cholera Control and Command Centre
(C4) epidemiological update, highest [number of] cases of malaria in
week ending 3 Apr 2011 were recorded in Mashonaland East that saw 3354
people being treated and 2193 in Manicaland province.

To date, 10 districts namely: Mudzi, Kariba, Mutoko, Mutasa, Kadoma,
Mutare city, Rushinga, Makonde, Chimanimani and Mutare rural have
recorded outbreaks. Meanwhile, people seeking treatment from some of
the districts where outbreaks have occurred have complained that some
were being told the malaria drug [co-artemether] was out of stock
while others got it.

Although no official comment could be obtained from the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare, sources confirmed that malaria drugs were
delivered last week [week ending 24 Apr 2011]. "There were no new
supplies all along. They were only delivered last Friday [22 Apr
2011]," said one source.

He further said because of the delay in procurement of malaria
supplies, health centres that had ran out of rapid test kits were
administering treatment without carrying out any investigation. With
[co-artemether], patients were supposed to be tested 1st for malaria
and only if they are positive can they be given treatment. But in this
case, since there were no kits to test people they ended up treating
people on suspicion that it could be malaria, thereby creating
unnecessary demand on the available treatment. And for the 1st time
since we introduced [co-artemether], we ran out of the drug," he
said.

Malaria is the 2nd largest killer [infectious] disease in Zimbabwe
after HIV and AIDS [but see comment below]. Although some districts
have malaria throughout the year, in most of the districts it is
seasonal. The malaria peak season is between March and May.

[Zimbabwe is one of the countries in the African region where,
despite evidence of wide scale implementation of malaria control
activities to more than 50 percent of the population at risk, there is
limited evidence of progress in reducing the number of malaria cases
between 2000 and 2009
(http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241564106_eng.pdf).

It is therefore clear from the current report from Zimbabwe that
despite the indications of progress made at the global level in
combating the disease through improved supplies of artemisinin
combination therapy (ACTs), long lasting insecticide treated nets
(LLINs), and rapid diagnostic test kits (RDTs), a lot more investment
need to be put into improving the supply chain bottlenecks to ensure
that the patients actually benefit from these supplies, with reduced
cases and deaths from the disease.
