Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As part of routine surveillance for H5/H7 avian influenza, H7 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a commercial turkey breeder and 2 turkey meat flocks. Sequencing determined subtype/pathotype of H7N3 on all premises. Clinical signs noted: slight drop in egg production in turkey breeder flock. Plan for confirmed positive flocks is euthanasia (foam method) and disposal. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding. Five additional commercial poultry premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus. Results are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (national laboratory) / birds / gene sequencing / 12 Mar 2020 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (national laboratory) / birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 12 Mar 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must 1st be cleaned from the environment.

"When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks."
