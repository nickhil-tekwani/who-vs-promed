Clark County resident dies from _Naegleria fowleri_, may be linked to Lake Mead
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Officials with the Southern Nevada Health District have reported a death in a Clark County resident due to the brain-eating amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_. The patient was a male, under the age of 18.

Based on health official's investigation, the individual may have been exposed at Lake Mead on the Arizona side of the lake at the beginning of October [2022] and began to develop symptoms approximately a week later.

Dr. Fermin Leguen, District Health Officer for the Health District said, "While I want to reassure the public that this type of infection is an extremely rare occurrence, I know this brings no comfort to his family and friends at this time."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the Health District that _Naegleria fowleri_ was confirmed as the cause of the patient's illness. Infection with the amoeba causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a brain infection that initially includes headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting and progresses to stiff neck, seizures and coma that can lead to death. Symptoms usually begin about 5 days after infection but can start within 1 to 12 days. Once symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within about 5 days.

_Naegleria fowleri_ is commonly found in bodies of warm freshwater, such as lakes and rivers, and geothermal water, such as hot springs. The amoeba infects people by entering the body through the nose and traveling to the brain. It cannot infect people if swallowed and is not spread from person to person. The infection is extremely rare, and almost always fatal.

Recommended precautions from the CDC include:
- Avoid jumping or diving into bodies of warm fresh water, especially during the summer.
- Hold your nose shut, use nose clips, or keep your head above water when in bodies of warm fresh water.
- Avoid putting your head underwater in hot springs and other untreated geothermal waters.
- Avoid digging in, or stirring up, the sediment in shallow warm fresh water.

[2] Pakistan (Karachi, Sindh): 6th _Naegleria fowleri_ case in 2022

Officials at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) in Karachi, Pakistan report a 28-year-old individual has died from the "brain-eating amoeba", _Naegleria fowleri_ on Monday night [17 Oct 2022], Pakistan news source, Dawn reports

The patient had no history of swimming and their house was supplied with water through tankers, according to the family.

This is the 6th primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) case caused by _N. fowleri_ reported in Karachi this year [2022].

Deaths related to PAM have been regularly reported from Karachi since 2008. At least 150 people have died of the disease in Pakistan over the past 14 years.

_Naegleria fowleri_ is a microscopic amoeba which is a single-celled living organism. It can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, ponds and canals.

Infections can happen when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the amoeba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM (which destroys brain tissue) and is usually fatal. Infections usually occur when it is hot for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infections are rare. Most infections occur from exposure to contaminated recreational water. Cases due to the use of neti pots and the practice of ablution have been documented.

The practice of ablution is included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called "wudu" or "ablution." It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[Both of the articles above accurately describe the portal of entry and pathology of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), an almost uniformly fatal infection due to invasion of the CNS by _Naegleria fowleri_ and less commonly other free-living amoebae. However, juxtaposing these 2 cases from the USA and Pakistan gives us the opportunity to evaluate what may be quite different risk factors in these 2 countries.

In the USA, the CDC database of 154 cases of PAM from 1962-2021 shows that about 70% of cases occur in young people aged 5-19 years, and in the months of July and August. The vast majority of American PAM cases are associated with freshwater recreational activities in lakes, ponds, reservoirs, canals, rivers, and other aquatic venues. Only 12 cases (8%) in the CDC database were associated with tap water, of which 5 had geothermally heated water (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/graphs.html).

Lake Mead is the largest manmade reservoir in the USA and is a very popular recreational area for aquatic activities. A news release from the Lake Mead National Recreational Area (NRA) on case [1] does not mention whether prior cases of PAM have been linked to Lake Mead. However, the same park service has previously published a fact sheet, "_Naegleria fowleri_: A Public Health Risk" (2012) which states that _N. fowleri_ has in fact been found in warm water springs of the Lake Mead NRA (http://npshistory.com/publications/lake/naegleria.pdf).

The 1st case of PAM in Pakistan was reported in 2008 from Karachi, and since then there have been over 150 cases in Pakistan, almost all fatal, with over 50 cases reported in Karachi alone. Pakistan has a hotter climate than the USA, and PAM cases in Pakistan have occurred over a broader range of peak months, namely May through October, when average monthly peak temperatures exceed 30Â°C. In a clinical series of 19 PAM cases at Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi, only one patient had a history of swimming in a pool and almost all cases in this and other reports from Pakistan have been linked to tap water alone. Much of Karachi has only intermittent water supply, so that most water for domestic use is stored in overhead tanks to ensure a continuous supply. Inadequate chlorination of these potable water sources allows _N. fowleri_ to propagate, and these amoebae have in fact been shown to be present in the piped water supply of Karachi [ref.1].

As mentioned in the Outbreak News Today article in item [2] above about the case in Karachi, nasal rinsing with water is part of an Islamic ablution ritual, and is likely to be another risk factor for PAM in Pakistan. If piped water has not been chlorinated, it can be disinfected by boiling, so it may be advisable to use boiled water for the neti pots used in the ablution ritual. Pakistan has reported a comparable number of PAM cases to the USA (> 150) over a much shorter time period (~12 years versus 60 years), and it is quite likely that many more cases have gone undetected or unreported in Pakistan. Thus, while PAM is a rare disease, it is not as rare in Pakistan as in the USA, likely due to the particular local risk factors described above.
