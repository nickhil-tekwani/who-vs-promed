One person and 2 dogs have been exposed to a rabid fox in Huntersville, prompting public officials to send out an alert to some of the town's residents, police say.

The alert was sent Thursday [15 Jul 2021] night to residents "on or near" Mt. Holly-Huntersville Road, in the 28078 ZIP code, after the fox tested positive for rabies, according to a news release from the Huntersville Police Department.

The release said there was "one human exposure and 2 domesticated dog exposures," but it did not describe the nature of those exposures.

The fox was the 6th animal in Mecklenburg County to test positive for rabies this year [2021], the release said.

North Carolina rabies law requires all owned dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies by 4months of age.

Mecklenburg County's Animal Care and Control offers a free monthly clinic for county residents to have their pets vaccinated against rabies. This clinic takes place the 2nd Saturday of each month from 8:00 a.m. to 10:45 a.m. at the animal shelter located at 8315 Byrum Drive in Charlotte. $10 microchips and free pet I.D. tags are also provided at the clinic.

If people are bitten or scratched by animals that might be rabid, the CDC recommends they wash the bite or scratch immediately with soap and water and talk to a healthcare provider. Rabies in people is completely preventable with appropriate medical care, the CDC notes.

A fox linked to 3 attacks in the last week was found to have rabies, Brunswick County officials announced. All 3 attacks occurred Wednesday [21 Jul 2021] in the south end of Brunswick County and left victims with scratches and bites.

"BCSO Animal Protective Services has set up traps in the area and those are being checked regularly in the interest of public safety," the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office posted on its Facebook page.

The attacks occurred in the areas of Waterloo Street and Hideaway Road in Ocean Isle Beach and near Sunset Beach. Following the last attack, the fox was captured, euthanized, and sent to a state lab for testing, where rabies was confirmed, according to a county press release.

One of the victims also reported an encounter with a racoon with possible signs of rabies as it was emaciated and unafraid of humans.

Bolivia resident JG said she also saw a fox Wednesday [21 Jul 2021] in the Sunset Harbor area that appeared to have sign of rabies. It's not the 1st incident of a rabid animal attack in the area this year [2021].

In April [2021], Burgaw couple KW and HW were treated for rabies after a rabid bobcat attacked them as they were leaving their home. Each were bitten 3 times before HW threw the bobcat to the ground and it ran off. The Pender County Sheriff Department confirmed a bobcat was killed in Burgaw the same day the couple was attacked.

Brunswick County Health Services and Animal Protective Services are working together to investigate the incidents and inform the community on proactive safety steps, they announced in a press release.

Possible signs of rabies, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
- General sickness
- Problems swallowing
- Lots of drool or saliva
- An animal biting at everything
- An animal appearing tamer than you would expect
- An animal having trouble moving or even paralyzed [this may also be true from a bump from a car, as cars do much damage to innocent animals. - Mod.TG]
- A bat on the ground

Steps to take if bitten or scratched by an animal that could possibly have rabies:
- Clean the wound well with soap and running water for 15 minutes and contact your doctor. The doctor will determine if a series of rabies vaccinations will be needed.
- Note the location and a description of the animal to provide to animal control.
- Do not try to catch any wild animal that bites or scratches you. Call animal control immediately to capture the animal for rabies testing.

If the animal is someone's pet, get the owner's name and address and provide them to the animal control officer. Any mammal can transmit rabies. The animal having bitten you, depending on the species and circumstances, must be evaluated or tested for rabies.

Steps to take to protect yourself, loved ones, and pets:
- Vaccinate your pets against rabies and keep the vaccinations current. North Carolina rabies law requires that all owned dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated against rabies by four months of age.
- Supervise pets outdoors, and keep all pets on a leash.
- Do not feed pets outdoors. Pet food attracts wildlife.
- Do not feed wildlife, feral cats, or feral dogs.
- Secure garbage cans with wildlife-proof lids.
- Leave young wildlife alone. If you find a juvenile animal appearing to need help, it is best to leave it alone and call a wildlife professional.

[3] Alabama: cat, human exposure
Date: Sat 24 Jul 2021

https://www.weisradio.com/cat-confirmed-positive-for-rabies-in-prattville-precautions-advised/


A stray cat scratched a person in the Durden Road area of Prattville, and the cat was confirmed to be rabid earlier this week by the Alabama Department of Public Health. The cat was seen in the neighborhood acting aggressively towards a nearby resident's cat. The onlooker was scratched by the rabid cat following trying to separate the animals.

The stray cat was taken to the Prattville/Autauga County Humane Shelter and was subsequently tested for rabies. The health department routinely tests animals having exposed people and other animals for rabies, especially when the animal is a stray or has an unknown vaccination status. Additionally, an investigation occurs to make sure all persons potentially exposed are treated appropriately to prevent a rabies infection from developing.

Animals bitten or scratched by a rabid animal are usually treated with a booster rabies vaccine and a short quarantine period. According to Dr. Dee W. Jones, state public health veterinarian, keeping your pets vaccinated is the best way to ensure the animal is protected from such encounters with a rabid animal. A currently vaccinated pet exposed to rabies is very unlikely to develop rabies and is allowed to undergo a much less strict quarantine following a booster vaccine dose.

Dr. Jones continues by saying the costs owners potentially faces are much less if their pet stays currently vaccinated, so he urges people to remain aware of their animal's vaccination status.

The rabies virus is transmitted by saliva. In general, rabies exposure requires direct contact with infected saliva, usually through a bite or a scratch, but other less common contact exposures with mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and mouth) are also considered as potential exposures.

Area residents are advised to take the following precautions to avoid possible exposure to rabies:
- Do not allow pets to run loose; confine them within a fenced-in area or with a leash.
- Do not leave uneaten pet food or scraps near your residence.
- Do not illegally feed or keep wildlife as pets.
- Do not go near wildlife or domestic animals acting in a strange or unusual manner.
- Caution children not to go near any stray or wild animal, regardless of its behavior.
- Advise children to tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by any animal.

A person who is bitten or scratched by an animal should wash wounds immediately with mild soap and water, apply first aid, and seek medical attention or contact the county health department immediately.

Alabama state law requires dogs, cats, and ferrets 12 weeks of age and older be current with rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccines are also available for horses and other livestock if recommended by a veterinarian. Vaccinating animals reduces the risk of rabies infection should an exposure occur; thus, vaccinations help protect animals, as well as their owners and caretakers.

For more information about rabies and prevention, please contact ADPH or visit the website at https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/infectiousdiseases/rabies.html.

[4] Oregon: bat, cat
Date: Thu 22 Jul 2021 6:36 p.m. PT
Source: KTVZ.com [edited]
https://ktvz.com/news/wildlife/2021/07/22/dead-bat-found-in-se-bend-tests-positive-for-rabies/


Southwest Bend resident CQ said Thursday [22 Jul 2021] she still can't believe a cat brought a dead, rabid bat into her home. Deschutes County health officials confirmed the dead bat tested positive for rabies.

"The whole thing was funny - until the bat did actually test positive for rabies," CQ said Thursday [22 Jul 2021]. "And then you have a moment where you're fearful: you think, my kids could get ill, or I could get ill."

One of CQ's cats brought the dead animal into her home on Woods Valley Place back on 9 Jul [2021]. She says she didn't even realize it was a bat until she picked it up to throw it away. And CQ didn't consider the possibility of the bat being rabid until a friend encouraged her to get it tested.

Rabies is transmitted through the bites of an infected animal, and while post-exposure vaccination is effective, the best plan is prevention. Deschutes County Health Services reminded residents to take necessary precautions to protect people and pets from rabies:

- Avoid physical contact with bats - healthy, sick, alive, or dead. Be sure to keep children and pets away from bats.
- Do not hand feed or otherwise handle stray animals and wildlife.
- Vaccinate all dogs, cats, and ferrets against rabies. This protects them and provides an immune barrier between humans and wild animals.

"There are 2 things people can do to protect themselves and their pets from rabies," said Emilio DeBess, public health veterinarian for the Oregon Health Authority. "Never handle bats, and make sure your cats and dogs are up to date on their rabies vaccines."

DeBess added that bats are the number-one carrier of rabies in the state, adding now is peak season. "We get usually a lot of positive animals during the summertime, starting somewhere in March or April," DeBess said.

To protect your pet, make sure their rabies vaccinations are up to date. Dogs, cats, and ferrets should be vaccinated against rabies at 3-6 months of age. After initial vaccination, a booster is required in one year, and then every 3 years after that. Under Oregon law, dogs and cats or ferrets not having current vaccinations and are suspected of exposure to rabies must be euthanized or placed under strict quarantine for 4 months.

CQ said her cats are currently quarantining at home since they handled the bat.

Bats play an important role in the ecosystem, especially in controlling insects, mostly at night. "If you find a bat during the daylight hours, it is most likely not healthy and should be avoided," DeBess added. Bats suffering from rabies will normally bite in self-defense and pose little threat to people who do not handle them.

Rabies is an infectious viral disease affecting the nervous system and is almost always caused by exposure from a rabid animal. Exposure is usually through a bite but can also occur through scratches and saliva contact with broken skin. It is almost always fatal once symptoms begin.

If a person or pet is bitten by a bat, promptly report it to Deschutes County Environmental Health and report the bite to your medical provider.

[5] South Carolina: dog, human exposure

https://wpde.com/news/local/dhec-several-people-6-dogs-exposed-to-puppy-with-rabies-who-was-in-florence-county


A puppy found in Edgefield County near Johnston, SC, who was brought to Florence County on 17 Jul [2021] tested positive for rabies, according to the South Carolina Dept. of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).

Six dogs were exposed as a result and will be quarantined as required in the South Carolina Rabies Control Act. At least 25 people were exposed and have been directed to their healthcare providers.

The puppy resided in Augusta, GA, from 14-17 Jul [2021] before traveling to the Pee Dee.

The puppy was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on Monday [19 Jul 2021] and was confirmed to have rabies on Tuesday [20 Jul 2021].

DHEC is working with the Georgia Dept. of Public Health to identify additional exposures.

This is an active and ongoing investigation.

"Keeping your pets up to date on their rabies vaccination is the easiest way to protect you and your family from this deadly virus," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to humans or pets. So give wild and stray animals plenty of space. In South Carolina, rabies is most often found in wildlife such as raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats, but pets are just as susceptible to the virus.

"If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it. Contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control officer, or a wildlife rehabilitator. If you believe you or someone you know has had contact with or been potentially exposed to this or another suspect animal, please reach out to your local Environmental Affairs office. An exposure is defined as direct contact (such as through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth) with saliva or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected animal."

If your pet is found with wounds of unknown origin, please consider your pet may have been exposed to rabies. Then contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Aiken office or Florence office during business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or after-hours and on holidays by selecting option 2 on the answering service.

There have been 46 cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2021]. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2020, one of the 168 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina was in Edgefield County.

A fox tested positive for rabies in the area of Gum Road on 20 Jul [2021].

Health officials said they received confirmation a fox picked up in the 2400 Block of Gum Rd on 20 Jul [2021] tested positive for rabies. They said a person was exposed and is undergoing rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. There was no further information provided about the exposure incident.

Rabies is a deadly disease caused by a virus attacking the nervous system. It kills almost any mammal or human getting sick from it. The rabies virus is mainly in the saliva and brain of rabid animals. It can be transmitted through a bite or by getting saliva or brain tissue in a wound or in the eye, nose, or mouth.

Rabies is rare in currently vaccinated animals and is highly preventable in people.

[There are numerous cases in today's report of several people being exposed to rabies, and I am glad the exposed individuals are being told to visit medical facilities. There should be stronger community involvement to host rabies vaccination drives, urging people to get their pets vaccinated.

When communities begin to experience more reports of rabid animals, then an awareness campaign should be initiated to educate residents regarding preventative rabies vaccinations for pets and the benefits to individuals, animals, and communities of building a rabies barrier of protection.

This should be a joint effort with communities, veterinarians, and public health officials. It should include not only vaccines for pets, but also education about wild animal involvement, and information regarding exposure to bats and different modes of exposure through bites or saliva in cuts or the eyes or mouth. Why not do a local news feature on keeping yourself and your pets safe from deadly rabies? Such a section on the local news could include keeping yourself and pet safe from not only rabies and wild animals, but also from heat stress and other dangers such as blue green algae in water sources.

Rabies is a deadly virus. Animals being exposed to this virus without vaccination will be euthanized.

Humans exposed to the rabies virus can receive post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment. This is a series of shots to prevent the exposed human from developing and dying from this deadly disease.

Be cautious out there, for yourself and your pets. - Mod.TG]
