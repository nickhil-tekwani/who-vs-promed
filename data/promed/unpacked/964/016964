Increased Transmission and Outbreaks of Measles -- European Region,
2011
------------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2003–2009, substantial progress was made toward the previous
goal of measles elimination by 2010 in the World Health Organization's
(WHO) European Region (EUR) (1,2). However, since late 2009, measles
virus transmission has increased, and outbreaks have become
widespread. In 2011, measles outbreaks have been reported in 36 of 53
EUR member states; a total of 26 074 measles cases had been reported
region-wide as of 26 Oct 22011. France reported the largest number of
cases (approximately 14 000), predominantly among older children and
young adults who had not been vaccinated or whose vaccination history
was unknown. Overall, the primary reason for the increased
transmission and outbreaks of measles in EUR is failure to vaccinate
susceptible populations. Eliminating measles by 2015, a new measles
elimination target date set in September 2010 by the 60th Regional
Committee for Europe, will require:
1) increasing demand for and delivery of vaccination to achieve and
sustain 95% or more coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing
vaccine (MCV) across a wide age range,
2) implementing effective outbreak control measures, and
3) further strengthening surveillance to identify cases and outbreaks
promptly, and in the future, to validate elimination (3).

Measles is a notifiable disease in all 53 EUR member states and all
states recommend 2 doses of MCV. Clinically diagnosed measles cases
are reported annually from member states to WHO/EURO using the WHO and
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Joint Reporting Form.
Countries also are requested to report monthly individual case
information (e.g., laboratory confirmation status and demographic,
clinical, and vaccination data) and to report outbreaks as they occur.
MCV coverage is reported to WHO/Europe annually using the Joint
Reporting Form.

After 3 years of historically low measles incidence (1), the number of
reported measles cases increased sharply in late 2009. In 2010, 30 639
measles cases were reported, the most since 2006. As of 26 Oct 2011, a
total of 26 074 cases had been reported in EUR in 2011. The western
European subregion (WE) reported 21 724 (83.3%) of the cases, the
central and eastern European subregion (CEE) 3570 (13.7%) cases, and
the newly independent states (NIS) of the former Soviet Union 780
(3.0%) cases. Since 2008, WE has accounted for the largest proportion
of measles cases in the region, with the exception of 2010, when most
cases occurred in CEE because of a large outbreak in Bulgaria (24 401
reported cases during 2009 - 2011).

As of 26 Oct 2011, a total of 12 882 (49.4%) cases had occurred among
persons aged 15 years and over, 6527 (25.0%) among children aged under
5 years, and 6423 (24.7%) among children aged 5–14 years. The median
age of patients was 15 years. Overall, 11 763 (45.1%) patients were
unvaccinated, and vaccination histories of 11 825 (45.4%) were
unknown. A total of 7288 (28.0%) measles patients were hospitalized,
including 4293 (58.9%) in WE, 2609 (35.8%) in CEE, and 386 (5.3%) in
NIS. The proportion of hospitalized patients was higher in CEE and NIS
(73.1% and 49.5%, respectively), where hospitalization of measles
patients is a long-standing routine practice, than in WE (19.8%),
where only patients with severe cases usually are hospitalized. Nine
measles-associated deaths were reported, including 6 in France, one in
Germany, one in Kyrgyzstan and one in Romania; 7 deaths occurred among
persons aged more than 10 years, 4 decedents were unvaccinated and the
vaccination histories of the remaining 5, all adults, were unknown.

A total of 115 measles outbreaks, accounting for 21 177 (81.2%) cases,
were reported in 36 countries from 1 Jan to 26 Oct 2011.

France
------
The outbreak in France is the largest ongoing outbreak in the region,
with 14 025 cases reported as of 26 Oct 2011. Cases have been reported
nationwide, including 2593 (18.5%) cases in the province of
Rhône-Alpes; 2167 (15.5%) in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur; 1191 (8.5%)
in Languedoc-Roussillon; 1158 (8.3%) in Limousin; and 1080 (7.7%) in
Île-de-France.

Spain
-----
In Spain, cases have been reported in 16 of the country's 17
autonomous communities (regional governments) and in the 2 autonomous
cities, including 1381 (50.3%) cases in Andalucia; 439 (16.0%) in
Catalonia; and 329 (12.0%) in Madrid. In Romania, cases have been
reported in 34 of 42 provinces, with six northwestern provinces (Arad,
Bihor, Cluj, Maramures, Salaj, and Satu Mare) reporting 1860 (86.3%)
cases.

Overall, transmission settings in the region varied and included
communities as a whole, groups with religious or philosophical
objections to vaccination, underserved populations with limited
health-care access, health-care facilities, and schools. Within
specific countries, settings also included vacation camps (France) and
rural populations (Romania); settings were not reported for
Uzbekistan.

Measles virus genotypes detected by molecular sequencing from
specimens from patients in EUR in 2011 included D4, B3, G3, D8, D9,
and H1. Genotype D4, detected in 24 countries during 2011, was the
predominant genotype. This genotype has been associated with outbreaks
in EUR member states since 2008 (4,5), including outbreaks during 2011
in France, Spain, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Romania,
and Uzbekistan. Genotype G3 also was detected in France, and genotype
B3 also was detected in Spain.

In response to measles outbreaks, a wide range of control measures
have been implemented, including 1) activities to strengthen
surveillance for timely identification and monitoring of cases and
outbreaks, 2) social mobilization and advocacy for immunization among
the general population and among health-care providers, 3) modifying
immunization schedules and vaccination policies, and 4) implementing
supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) of various scales, from
offering free vaccination to persons not covered by routine
vaccination programs to nationwide or subnational campaigns .

During 2004–2010, overall coverage with 1 dose of MCV (MCV1) for the
entire region was 92%–94%; WE had lower MCV1 coverage (90%–92%)
than CEE (88%–97%) and NIS (91%–96%). MCV1 coverage in France
during 2004–2010 was 87%–90%.

MMWR Editorial Note

The increase in measles virus transmission in EUR poses a serious
challenge to achieving the regional measles elimination goal by 2015.
Despite overall high coverage with MCV in the region, MCV1 coverage
remains below the target of 95%, particularly in WE. These data
confirm the existence of susceptible groups, which can include older
children and adults, and vaccination coverage <95% can support ongoing
virus transmission, leading to large-scale outbreaks (1,6). Additional
measures targeting susceptible populations to achieve ≥95% coverage
with 2 doses of MCV are needed to increase immunity levels in the EUR
population.

Principal factors contributing to decreased demand for measles
vaccination in EUR include lack of knowledge of the seriousness of the
disease, resulting in a reluctance to be vaccinated; skepticism about
the benefits of vaccination; fear of adverse effects from being
vaccinated; and limited health-care access for some underserved
populations (6). Religious or philosophical objections to vaccination
are serious barriers to increasing population immunity in certain
communities in EUR, particularly in WE (6).

The accumulation of susceptible persons among older children and young
adults because of low coverage in the past and the decline in natural
exposure to measles virus because of successful vaccination programs
has resulted in an increase in the median age of measles patients in
EUR (1,7). This change in measles epidemiology requires strategies
tailored to older age groups and strategies to prevent transmission
among infants too young to be vaccinated. To prevent further spread of
the virus, effective surveillance, outbreak prevention, and control
measures need to be continued, especially before mass gatherings
(e.g., the European Football Championship in Poland and Ukraine in
2012). Implementation of the revised Guidelines for Measles and
Rubella Surveillance in the European Region (8), beginning in 2012,
will help to further strengthen surveillance capacity in the member
states.

Measles in EUR is causing preventable death, illness, and financial
costs and has global implications. The 9 deaths and thousands of
measles-associated hospitalizations in EUR during 2011 are reminders
that measles is a serious disease that can lead to death in all age
groups, even in countries with high-quality health care and minimal
incidence of malnutrition. The substantial financial and human costs
of responding to these outbreaks impose an additional burden on
already limited resources. In addition, EUR has become a source of
virus introduction into other areas, such as the measles-free WHO
Region of the Americas. Importations from EUR have accounted for most
measles importations in the United States since 2008, with 20
importations in 2011 alone, including 11–13 cases from France (9).
During 2011, approximately 1000 measles cases were reported in the
Region of the Americas, necessitating extensive and costly public
health responses (10).

To increase demand for measles vaccination in EUR, innovative
strategies and tools are needed to effectively communicate the
seriousness of measles and the benefits of vaccination to the general
public and to health-care professionals. Reaching the EUR measles
elimination target by 2015 is achievable. However, reaching the target
will require ongoing, high-level political commitment to routine
childhood immunization throughout EUR. Additional measures also are
warranted, including SIAs to reduce susceptibility among older cohorts
and strategies to ensure access to health care among underserved
populations.

Request for information
-----------------------
In part (1) of 'Measles update 2011 (42) 20111127.3468' it was
reported that: "two cases of sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE), one of whom died, were reported in October 2011". It is
implied that the two cases of SSPE were described amongst the 30 000
currently reported cases. However, I am questioning the connection
between the current outbreak and the development of SSPE as I read the
report, given the typical incubation period of this admittedly
dreadful disease. [Average incubaion period is 6-8 years. - Mod.JW].
Does the HPA (the Health Protection Agency), source of the report)
have more information on these cases? Is there a way of looking at
whether the CSF antibodies are more specific to the circulating
genotype(s)? Or do molecular assays, when performed on CSF in this
condition, play a role? Admittedly I have never seen (and hopefully
will never see) a case of SSPE.

Two cases of mild IgM-negative measles in previously vaccinated
adults, the Netherlands, April and July 2011.
---------------------------------------------
(By van den Hoek A, Sonder GJ, Scholing M, Gijselaar D, van Binnendijk
RS)

Summary
-------
We describe 2 cases of mild, modified measles in fully vaccinated
adults in the Netherlands. The mildness of disease, the lack of an IgM
antibody response, the relatively low amounts of virus detected and
the fact that no additional cases were reported, suggests that these
vaccinated patients were less contagious than unvaccinated patients.

We report here 2 cases of measles in persons who had received 2 doses
of measles vaccine according to the recommended schedule. They were
investigated in the context of 2 measles clusters that occurred in the
Netherlands in April and June/July 2011.

First Case
----------
The first case was a patient born between 1976 and 1987 with a
verified history of 2 vaccinations.

In the Netherlands, childhood measles vaccination has been ongoing
since 1976. Since 1987, two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine have been recommended for children aged 14 months and 9
years.

The patient developed fever and exanthema on 18 April 2011, with no
complaints of coughing, coryza or conjunctivitis and without Koplik
spots. The exanthema was typical for measles. Blood samples taken on
the same day and tested by Serion Elisa classic Measles Virus IgG/IgM
showed an IgM concentration of 7 mIU/ml (negative) and an IgG
concentration of greater than 5000 mIU/ml (positive). PCR tests on
urine and saliva were positive for measles virus.

The source of this infection was an adult contact in a sports club
born after introduction of MMR vaccination in 1987, who had recently
suffered from confirmed measles (IgM- and PCR-positive). This person
did not have a history of vaccination and had travelled during the
incubation period in France, where measles outbreaks are ongoing since
2008 [1].

Genotype analysis of the measles RNA detected in urine and saliva of
both patients demonstrated the presence of genotype D4 measles virus.
This is a highly prevalent genotype found in many European countries
in 2010 and 2011, but the epidemiological data corroborates France as
the origin of this measles cluster. In 2011 other genotype D4 measles
cases were reported in the Netherlands, some of which had identical D4
sequences, but neither of which could be epidemiologically linked to
the 2 cases of this first cluster.

Second Case
-----------
The second case was a physician, born between 1976 and 1987, who also
had a verified history of 2 measles vaccinations. The physician
developed a rash typical of measles on 9 July 2011 and did not
complain of fever, coryza, coughing or conjunctivitis. A blood test on
14 July was negative for IgM (6 mIU/ml) and positive for IgG (greater
than 5000 mIU/ml). Virus was detected by PCR in a nasopharyngeal
sample taken on 19 July. The results of blood tests taken on 16 August
were negative for IgM and had an IgG titre of greater than 5000
mIU/ml.

The source of Second Case's infection was a patient, born in between
1970 and 1976 who did not have a history of measles vaccination and
who had travelled to Spain during the incubation period. The patient
attended an emergency department where the physician was working on 26
& 27 June 2011, with complaints of fever and rash. The measles
diagnosis was confirmed with a positive IgM test and virus detection
by PCR in a urine sample.

Besides the physician, the source patient also infected a nurse born
between 1970 and 1976, without a history of measles vaccination
(Table, Case 2C), and the source patients' 10 month-old child (Table,
Case 2B). In all 4 patients, genotype analysis demonstrated the
presence of a similar genotype D4 measles virus RNA as documented in
the 1st cluster, which differed from the 1st cluster by one
nucleotide.

In the Netherlands, childhood measles vaccination has been ongoing
since 1976. Since 1987, two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR)
vaccine have been recommended for children aged 14 months and 9 years.
The coverage of both doses has been consistently high (more than 95%)
in the last decades [2], but is not even throughout the country. About
1–2% of the population refuse vaccination on religious grounds. The
last outbreak of measles in these religious communities was from April
1999 to May 2000 and consisted of at least 3292 reported cases,
including 3 deaths [3]. No major outbreaks have been observed since,
except for a restricted outbreak in an anthroposophic community in
2008 [4]. Since 2009 large outbreaks of measles have been reported in
various European countries. The same virus genotype (D4) is
responsible for most of these outbreaks [1]. In the Netherlands, no
major outbreaks have been seen apart from some small clusters of
patients. The majority of the index cases acquired their disease
outside the Netherlands.

Conclusions
-----------
Our data show that fully vaccinated persons were infected with measles
virus, albeit in the absence of IgM seroconversion. Variable results
with respect to IgM antibody detection in infected persons who had
been fully vaccinated against measles have been presented before. Our
2 cases developed rash and some fever, but no other specific symptoms.
Due to resurgence of measles in Europe, we anticipated an increase in
measles importations in the Netherlands, which is why suspected cases
were more often investigated. Moreover, laboratory diagnostics were
extended to include RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal or urine specimens to
detect the presence of measles virus, and serological confirmation on
paired serum samples.

We conclude that mild measles in previously vaccinated persons due to
waning immunity can occur and the IgM test result can remain negative.
Case 1 developed a more than 4-fold increase in IgG titre, which, as
shown here, strongly depends on early blood sampling. The high IgG
titres in case 2 also indicate a strong secondary antibody response.

We preferred measles virus RNA detection by RT-PCR in urine and
oropharyngeal samples because this was found to be the most conclusive
diagnostic method and also allows epidemiological linkage between the
cases using genotyping. On the basis of both molecular data and travel
history, the source of these small clusters of measles was found to be
unvaccinated adults who had most likely imported measles virus from
outside the Netherlands. It should be noted that we do not know the
extent of virus transmission other than for the clinical cases
presented here. However, surveillance of contacts of the 2 mild cases
did not identify additional cases, which is consistent with findings
in other recently published case studies. Given the mild disease in
these patients, the lack of a systemic IgM antibody response, and
reduced shedding of measles virus estimated by realtime PCR, these
vaccinated patients may also have been less contagious than
unvaccinated patients.

ACT measles outbreak reaches 12
-------------------------------
ACT (Australian Capital Territory) health authorities remain on alert
after the number of people affected by an outbreak of measles more
than doubled. Last week 3 school students and a younger child were
confirmed as having measles. This week the number of cases has reached
12, with 3 people hospitalised.

A total of 8 of the 12 confirmed cases in the cluster are linked to
the Orana School at Weston. The ACT's chief health officer Paul Kelly
says parents of unvaccinated children should be vigilant as measles is
highly contagious. "The incubation period for measles is typically 10
days," he said. "But it can be from 7 to 18 days after being exposed.
And yes, we do expect further cases."

Dr Kelly says it can take several days for the measles rash to appear
and during this time the person is contagious. He says the high fevers
and complications can have serious implications for some people. "Most
cases of measles are reasonably minor," he said. "Up to a third can
have serious complications, and one in 1000 can get very serious
complications. As I said of those 12 we've had so far, 3 have been
hospitalised for those complications. So its not a trivial matter."

ACT Health says children who are not vaccinated should not return to
the Orana School until the end of next week to avoid contracting the
illness.

No-one wants measles for Xmas
-----------------------------
Health authorities are urging Aucklanders to get vaccinated to stop
the city's measles outbreak spreading across the country over the
Christmas holidays. There have been 372 confirmed and probable cases
of measles in Auckland since the end of May, with 64 people needing
hospital treatment for the disease.

The clinical director of primary care at Auckland and Waitemata
District Health Boards today urged Aucklanders to get immunised,
warning the risk of measles spreading further is likely to increase as
people leave the city for their Christmas holidays and large
gatherings and celebrations occur.

"We would urge everyone to check that their own and their family's
immunisations are up to date before they go on holiday, or catch up
with family in other parts of the country," Dr Stuart Jenkins said.
"I'm sure the last thing anyone wants for Christmas this year is a
case of measles, to pass measles on to someone else, or 2 weeks in
quarantine trying to keep away from friends and family."

Jenkins said more people were taking up the offer of free vaccinations
since the outbreak began. A sample of 20 Auckland GPs reported an
increase of approximately 50 per cent between July and October
compared to last year, he said. "However, there is still an outbreak
in the Auckland region, and people need to continue to be vigilant."
