Bluetongue zones widen as more cases found
------------------------------------------
Britain's bluetongue protection and surveillance zones was this week
[4-8 Feb 2008] extended after new cases were discovered during
pre-movement testing. The infected animals, in the south east of
England, were found as a result of the testing regime put in place
during the vector-free period. Bluetongue zones were subsequently
expanded further into Sussex and Dorset.

Evidence suggests the animals were infected before start of the
vector-free period but symptoms were so mild the cases were not
detected. The UK outbreak total now stands at 70.

Further similar cases are expected in the coming weeks as more
animals are tested prior to being moved, said rural ministry Defra.
It has ordered 22.5m doses of vaccine for bluetongue serotype 8
including 2.5m doses for disease-free Wales from animal health firm
Intervet. The first 2.25m doses, expected in May [2008], will be used
in the current protection zone.

As further batches arrive, the focus will shift westwards and along
the south coast due to the risk of the virus spreading from France,
according to the NFU. The strategy depends on the initial order for
2.25m doses arriving on time and no cases of bluetongue outside the
protection zone.

The NFU fears there may not be enough vaccine to go round if the
disease takes hold before vaccination is effective. For the policy to
work, 80 percent of susceptible stock must be vaccinated.

With 60m livestock in the UK and the need to vaccinate cattle twice,
the NFU council says the numbers don't stack up and has called for an
urgent review.

New bluetongue case in Watford
-----------------------------------------------------
A bluetongue protection zone has been set up in Greater London after
a new case of the disease was discovered in Watford, the government
announced today.

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
said the 20km [12.4-mile] zone was put in place after a cow in
Watford tested positive for the disease. The zone covers parts of
north and west London, as well as parts of Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire.

In addition, 2 cases have also been found inside the existing
bluetongue protection zone covering much of East Anglia and parts of
Kent. That zone has now been extended into Surrey and Cambridgeshire,
said a Defra spokeswoman.

The spokeswoman said the 3 cattle were infected before the start of
the "vector-free period" on 20 Dec 2007, the point at which it was
judged there was a low risk of the disease spreading because the
weather was too cold for the midges that spread it.

There are 75 confirmed cases of the virus, which is fatal to animals
such as sheep and cows, in the UK. The cases were identified by
routine testing, which is required before animals can be moved out of
the protection and surveillance zones. Defra said further cases could
be identified in the coming weeks.

Bluetongue was first confirmed in the UK on 28 Sep 2007 in East
Anglia. All other cases have been confined to the south-east of England.

[The most recent update of the Declaration of a Protection zone and
Surveillance zone, with map, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-btv-pzsz080208.pdf>.


The interpretation of official data on detected BT-positive animals
during the so-called "non-vector period" is debatable. If, as
suggested in the above report, the infection had taken place before
the start of the period, these are not new cases but just reflections
of last year's (2007) outbreak. According to this moderator's
understanding, to detect virus/vector activity during the declared
"no-vector season," at least one of the following should be met:

1. Clinical cases observed, confirmed by virus isolation (during the
viraemia);
2. Virus isolated from subclinical cases (possible by weekly blood
sampling in sentinels);
3. Infected vectors trapped;
4. Seroconversion clearly demonstrated in sentinels which have been
tested negative at the start of the season and became positive later.

It seems that the same doubts on the out-of-season BTV-8 activity are
encountered in continental Europe, e.g., France: subscriber Susan
Baekeland has kindly provided data of the French Ministry of
Agriculture, reporting that as of 6 Feb 2008, a total of 16 677 BT
accumulated cases have been listed, including 2 new ones which are
reported "as they involve an extension of an exclusion zone." They
were in Creuse (Sardent) and in Puy-de-Dome (Condat en Combraille),
south-central France.

An official view of EU's BT experts panel on the current situation --
"active or not?!" -- will be helpful.

In addition, an update on the BTV-8 situation in more southern areas
is in need; this, in view of reports (thanks to submitter Sabrine
Zentis!), on its further spread in northern Spain (Cantabria) and on
the detection of a positive cow in the south-western Swiss canton
Wallis, close to the lake of Geneva. - Mod.AS]
