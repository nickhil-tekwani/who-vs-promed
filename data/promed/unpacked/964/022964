Farmers in the Mekong Delta who sowed the summer - autumn rice crop early are facing a threat of disease outbreaks. Nguyen Van Hien, Plant Cultivation and Protection, said [that] unfavourable weather has brought rice diseases which could hit yields. Diseases often occur when rice is sowed early or late since brown-plant hoppers and other pests from unharvested fields from the previous crop move to the newly sowed fields, he said.

In Dong Thap Province some 560 ha sowed early have been affected by brown plant hoppers. [A farmer] said local agricultural officials did warn they had to have a gap of at least 3 weeks between crops to eliminate diseases. "But since the price of rice was high, farmers here sowed early."

In Kien Giang Province, more than 252 140 ha have been planted, with 15 500 ha being affected by diseases such as rice grassy stunt, rice ragged stunt and rice blast.

Plant Cultivation and Protection has instructed district bureaus to regularly report about diseases and warned farmers to destroy rice plants which are severely affected. This [2018] summer - autumn the delta has planted more than 1.65 million ha, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.

[Rice viruses
------------
_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) has been reported to cause yield losses of up to 90 per cent in several Asian countries. Symptoms include ragged appearance of plants, twisted leaves, vein swelling, unfilled grains and severe stunting of plants. Its only way of spread is vector transmission by brown plant hoppers (BPH; _Nilaparvata lugens_). The insects transmit the virus in a persistent manner and remain infectious for life. Infected hoppers can be transported on air currents to spread the virus quickly over long distances.

_Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) has been reported to cause serious damage in limited areas during sporadic outbreaks of its vector. It is spreading in large parts of the rice-growing areas of Asia. RGSV is also transmitted exclusively by vectors (_N. lugens_ and other species in the genus) in the same way as RRSV. Symptoms include severe stunting, excessive tillering ('grassy' appearance), erect growth habit, leaf spots and reduced pale leaves. Infected plants usually survive until maturity, but produce no panicles.

A number of other rice viruses (several also present in the region) are spread by different species of plant - or leaf hoppers. In tropical regions, levels of virus infection and vector density may be very high. High vector populations are often associated with virus outbreaks with crop losses of up to 100 per cent reported. In its own right, BPH causes yellowing, browning and drying of plants ('hopper burn') and leaves small injuries exposing the plant to fungal (such as rice blast) and bacterial infections.

Disease management for these viruses includes cultural practices (such as short term draining of rice fields, crop rotation, or rice-free periods), vector control and use of cultivars with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Crop cultivars resistant to BPH have low disease incidence, but insect adaptation overcoming plant resistance has been a problem. The application of insecticides to migratory plant hoppers is being used in some areas to reduce disease incidence.

Rice blast
----------
Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.
