Spring viremia of carp, Italy
-----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 27 Jul 2020 from Dr. Silvio Borrello, Chief Veterinary Officer, Food Safety and Collegial Bodies for Health Protection, Ministry of Health, Department for Veterinary Public Health, Rome, Italy

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 19 Jun 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 7 Jul 2020
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2004
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: _Rhabdovirus carpio_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Carmignano di Brenta, Padova, Veneto
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Jun 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or dated resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Lake
Water type: Fresh water
Population type: Wild
Production system: Open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / 0% / 0% / - / 300 / 300 / - / -
Affected population: Huge mortality of carps was ascertained in a lake. The real-time PCR test confirmed the presence of spring viremia of carp. Other samples of carps were also positive to carp edema virus. The high level of mortality could be originated by the copresence of both viruses.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: Official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Padova (national laboratory) / Carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) / Real-time PCR / 7 Jul 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a disease of cyprinids caused by a rhabdovirus, which mainly affects common carp _Cyprinus carpio_. The disease is widespread in European carp culture, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. It is a notifiable disease by the OIE.

Affected fish show destruction of tissues in the kidney, spleen and liver, leading to hemorrhage, loss of water-salt balance and impairment of immune response. High mortality occurs at water temperatures of 10-17 deg C (50-63 deg F), typically in spring. At higher temperatures, infected carp develop humoral antibodies that can neutralize the spread of virus, and such carp are protected against reinfection by solid immunity. The virus is shed mostly with the feces and urine of clinically infected fish and by carriers. Waterborne transmission is believed to be the primary route of infection, but bloodsucking parasites like leeches and the carp louse may serve as mechanical vectors of SVCV.
