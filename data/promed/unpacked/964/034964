Bird flu could spill over into Israel from Gaza
-----------------------------------------------
Ministry of Agriculture is monitoring coops within a radius of 10 km [about 6.2 miles]; poultry growers are asked to bring them into cages.

Bird flu has been detected (Tue 14 Apr 2015) in the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, seriously affecting chickens and water fowl.

Teams of the [Israeli] Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development are monitoring poultry coops in Israel's territory adjacent to the affected area of the Gaza Strip, within 10 km distance from Khan Yunis [see comment]. Farms within the monitoring area are visited on a daily basis in order to minimize the risk of further dissemination of the disease.

On top of the said enhanced activity within the mentioned area, routine monitoring for avian influenza is being maintained throughout Israel.

The State Veterinary Services have called upon all holders of backyard poultry to keep their birds caged and under cover and to prevent their free roaming in open terrain, to reduce the risk of infection from wild birds.

[Khan Yunis, a town in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, is located about 5 km [about 3 miles] from Israel's territory to its east; see square 13 in the interactive map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html.

The Gaza Strip, which borders Egypt's north Sinai territory, may have been infected by the H5N1 virus strain widely circulating in Egypt, becoming a potential linking step for the spread of that virus to southern Israel. From October 2014 to February 2015, 435 outbreaks in poultry were reported in Egypt, caused by a novel cluster of influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact. Reportedly, 3 of the outbreaks have been diagnosed recently in Egypt's Northern Sinai, bordering southern Gaza Strip.

The Director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture in Gaza, Dr. Zakaria Kafarneh, told Alhadath that the Gaza Strip is currently free of new bird-flu outbreaks following the culling of hundreds of birds affected by the disease in Khan Yunis, a few days ago. He said that the ministry started an awareness and guidance campaign targeting owners of commercial poultry holdings and birds farmers in the Gaza Strip, to introduce them to the disease and its risks and provide guidance in assisting discovery of outbreaks and their control.

Kafarneh indicated that the real danger of the disease comes from backyard holdings within the municipalities and not through the intensively kept birds on commercial farms.

Kafarneh said that the Ministry of Agriculture focuses on the detection of the epidemic in the northern part of the Gaza Strip area, where the largest numbers of domestic birds are held and should be tightly controlled.

Kafarneh explained that the Ministry of Agriculture cooperates with other agencies and organizations to deal with any spread or outbreak of the disease.

The Ministry of Agriculture in Gaza culled on Monday [13 Apr 2015] about 800 broiler chickens and ducks in the city of Khan Yunis after the discovery of them being infected with HPAI H5N1 strain of bird flu. The crews utilised the assistance of the city's mayor and staff for the implementation of the process, with the participation of doctors from the Ministry of Agriculture.

[As indicated by Dr Kafarneh, the main problem on his and his dedicated staff's hands is the presence of numerous backyard holdings throughout the Gaza Strip, including urban areas. The number of such holdings, each of which may include few birds of various species, is estimated to be counted in figures of 5 (or even more?) digits.

As of 2014, about 1.8 million people are living in the Gaza Strip, of which nearly 1.5 million in refugee camps. 90 percent of the population is urban. The most densely populated area is Gaza City, where the density (2014 data) is 6859 people per sq km. Even within the City of Gaza, chickens and other poultry roam around and there are numerous backyard poultry holdings. The per capita income in Gaza is among the lowest in the world.

As rightly remarked by a subscriber, "population numbers are not relevant to this strain, since human-to-human transmission is rare." Indeed it is not the high density of the population in the Gaza Strip which is the main concern; there are other regions worldwide that are characterized by continuous urban area (such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Monaco and even the Israeli Dan district). It is the combination of dense human population, poor hygiene and the close proximity to large numbers of free-roaming or backyard domestic birds which should be of concern in case "A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact" becomes endemic in Gaza. - Mod.AS]
