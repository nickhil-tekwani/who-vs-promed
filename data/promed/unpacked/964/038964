I wish to comment on information on the 2 Feb 2012 NYAS symposium on H5N1 dual use research you recently published [Avian influenza (10): H5N1 research controversy 20120204.1032857].

I am disappointed by the debate you report. I think the good questions are not addressed, so there cannot be good answers.

I think the main questions to answer are:

- Has the concerned work on H5N1 mutation demonstrated that H5N1 will evolve the proposed way and that it will undoubtedly appear without human intervention? The answer is no.

- Has the concerned work produced the virus that will certainly appear in nature and constitute a new threat for human beings, so that it deserves and allows new research, looking for vaccine or antivirals? Again, the answer is no. H5N1 could naturally evolve in a way different enough to pose different problems, particularly regarding vaccine design. However, a potentially dangerous virus now exists and it could "leak" from a laboratory. "Mother Nature" is not the "mother of bioterrorism," as some scientists are now used to saying!

- Has the concerned work given the signal to evil-minded people that a terrifying agent could be obtained from H5N1 virus? The answer is yes: Make some efforts, they will probably be successful!

- Has the concerned work sufficient scientific or technical originality or interest (Using particular, non-natural conditions, a pathogenic virus can mutate to a -- potentially -- more pathogenic one: What's new?) to deserve publication in journals we generally regard as prestigious? I am not sure, unless media impact has became the main criteria for good research. As V. Racaniello says, "If you think you can (do a risk-benefit analysis), you are wrong." I totally agree. But it is not a reason to do hazardous research when you know it is essentially hazardous research.

I totally disagree with any encouragement given to that kind of research. My point of view is strictly personal. I hope it will contribute to this important debate.
