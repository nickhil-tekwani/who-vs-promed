S. Korea confirms outbreak of H5N1 bird flu
-------------------------------------------
South Korea Friday [31 Dec 2010] confirmed an outbreak of bird flu
[avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] at 2 poultry farms in the
central and southwestern parts of the country.

Suspected cases reported on 29 Dec 2010 from a duck farm in Cheonan,
South Chungcheong province, and a chicken farm in Iksan, North Jeolla
province, tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus, the Ministry
for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. Both farms have
been placed under quarantine with authorities moving to cull and bury
their ducks and chickens to prevent the spread of the disease. The
ministry has raised the alert level for the disease to "caution."

The country confirmed 3 cases of bird flu from migratory birds earlier
in the month [December 2010]. In August 2008, South Korea declared
itself free of bird flu after the country suffered its worst outbreak
of the disease with nearly 8.5 million birds culled.

[HPAI H5N1 virus was detected on 7 Dec 2010 from a mallard duck,
captured in Iksan city, North Jeolla province, on 29 Nov 2010.
Similarly, the said virus was recovered from 2 dead eagle owls, found
on 29 Nov 2010 in Seosan city, South Chungcheong province (more than
100 km (62 mi) distant from Iksan city). In their OIE notification on
the 2 wild ducks, the South Korean veterinary services included the
following commentary:
"As part of continuous avian influenza surveillance, avian influenza
tests in wild birds were conducted. 2 dead eagle owls were found in
Buseok-myun (Seosan city, [South Chungcheong]) on 29 Nov 2010. Samples
(faeces, laryngo-pharyngeal swab) were collected. The NVRQS [National
Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service] found HPAI (H5N1 subtype)
virus antigen by PCR and gene sequencing on 10 Dec 2010. Clinical
surveillance and disinfection on the neighbouring poultry farms within
10 km [6.2] around the detection spot were enhanced. So far, no highly
pathogenic avian influenza positive has been detected in poultry."

The current information on the detection of H5N1 in domestic ducks and
chickens on 2 commercial farms in South Korea (still to be officially
confirmed), may be a reflection of the virus circulation in wild
birds. Genotyping may help in checking this possible connection.
