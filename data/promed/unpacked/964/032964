Ministry runs out of yellow fever vaccine
-----------------------------------------
Vaccination against yellow fever, which is required for travel to parts of
Africa and South America, has been suspended at several quarantine stations
due to higher-than-expected demand.
According to the World Health Organization, 41 countries in Africa and
South America are designated as yellow fever areas, and all of Japan's
quarantine stations recommend that travelers to these destinations be
inoculated against the disease.
In many cases, vaccination prior to entry into the areas is obligatory. For
example, all travelers to Ghana, as well as those aged 1 year and over
whose destinations include 17 countries, including the Central African
Republic, are asked to show an international certificate of vaccination on
entering those countries.
The ministry [Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare] purchases the
vaccine in bulk from the United States and distributes it to 18 quarantine
stations and other facilities. The ministry order is based on estimates
received from the quarantine stations every spring and autumn.
Since fiscal 2002, when it over-ordered by several thousands of vials, the
ministry has erred on the side of caution when ordering the vaccine.
The vaccine shortage became serious last month, especially in quarantine
stations in large cities, such as Osaka and Tokyo. The Nagoya Quarantine
Station posted a message on its Web site, saying, "Due to a stock shortage,
we may not be able to vaccinate you." The Narita Airport Quarantine
Station temporarily displayed a notice on its Web site, saying, "We have
suspended vaccinations until arrival of vaccine shipments." The Tokyo
Quarantine Station also temporarily suspended vaccinations. Although it was
able to resume the service after asking stations in Hokkaido to rush
vaccine from their own stocks. Even so, the Tokyo station has only been
able to meet half the demand.
The ministry managed to secure enough vaccine for 1000 people from a
regular supplier and plans to distribute the vaccine to stations in large
cities starting Monday. However, the vaccine will be in short supply until
later in February 2005 or early March, when the ministry expects to receive
7000 doses, which were ordered in autumn (2004). A ministry official said:
"It's a basic requisite that we keep enough vaccine on hand. We apologize
for being unable to meet requests as our forecast was out. We'll do our
best to make sure this doesn't happen again by reviewing the system by
which we estimate vaccine requirements."

[I have received queries regarding 2 statements in my previous comments on
the shortage of YF vaccine. One was that from a public health point of
view, the more people who are YF vaccinated the better. The query was how
does it benefit anyone to vaccinate people who aren't going anywhere near
YF. The explanation is this. The vaccine is valid for 10 years -- and
probably lifelong. World travelers are likely to repeat travel, maybe to an
endemic area in the future. But endemic countries do not require YF
vaccination, only receptive countries concerned about travelers returning
from the former, the USA notably *not* among them -- look at the US tourist
returning to die of YF in Tennessee at the height of the _Aedes aegypti_
season (see ProMED refs. below). So there is a potential long-term public
health benefit.
The other was regarding my warnings of an increasing threat of importation
of YF into areas of Asia infested with _Ae. aegypti_, because of old
research that showed that in the laboratory, Asian _Ae. aegypti_
mosquitoes were relatively incompetent vectors of YF. However, according
to the publications referenced below, the Amphur strain of _Ae. aegypti_
from Thailand was not significantly less competent than an East African or
a Caribbean strain [1], and an "incompetent" strain did in fact vector a YF
epidemic in 1987 [2]. Note that _Ae. aegypti_ has occasionally been
imported into Japan [3].
