[1] Counterfeit test results for travel
Date: Tue 10 Nov 2020

With global coronavirus cases rising, many countries are now requiring negative coronavirus test results for entry, but getting a test in time can be difficult for travelers. So it may have been only a matter of time before a black-market option emerged: counterfeit test results. The practice of forging or purchasing fake results has surfaced in destinations around the world, with instances of manipulated negatives in Brazil, France, and the United Kingdom.

Last week [week of 2 Nov 2020], French officials broke up an alleged forgery ring that was selling false test certificates at Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport. According to the Associated Press, the group was asking USD 180 to USD 360 (150 to 300 euros) for the digital certificates of a negative result (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/7-charged-with-selling-virus-test-documents-at-paris-airport/2020/11/06/1c2e25cc-2039-11eb-ad53-4c1fda49907d_story.html).

Police charged the group of seven (6 men and one woman) with forgery and fraud after investigating how an Ethiopia-bound passenger acquired a false coronavirus document at the airport in September [2020]. The fake certificates were stored on mobile phones and had the name of a medical lab located in Paris, the BBC reported (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54839434).

Police in Brazil recently arrested 4 domestic travelers who forged negative coronavirus tests to visit the island of Fernando de Noronha on a private jet, according to the Associated Press. The island, which is known as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, reopened to tourists on [10 Oct 2020] and requires entrants to present negative coronavirus test results acquired no more than one day in advance (https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/brazilian-tourists-jailed-faking-covid-19-tests).

According to a UK newspaper, the practice has also surfaced in England: The Lancashire Telegraph reported speaking with one man who doctored a friend's negative coronavirus test, printed it out, and used it for international travel. The newspaper also spoke to another traveler who was offered a fake document from their travel agent (https://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/18816550.east-lancs-travellers-faking-negative-covid-certificates-can-board-flights/).

As test-result protocols for travel are becoming more high-tech, however, it's unlikely that many travelers would be able to travel with a manipulated document. The state of Hawaii, for example, requires visitors to preregister in their online testing program, use an approved testing partner, and upload results to a digital portal. Paper copies are not accepted.

A new app called CommonPass launched last month [October 2020] for passengers on United Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways to upload their coronavirus test results directly to their airline for verification when flying through some airports. The health-screening app aims to decrease global reliance on quarantines by centralizing a traveler's coronavirus status and documents for easy access by airlines and their destinations. The app is on a trial run and is available only to passengers flying to or from New York, London, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

[And we "fight" about mask mandates... Guilty parties include not just the sales people of these counterfeit documents but also the individuals purchasing them. It is nice to read there have been custodial penalties in the countries where this has been uncovered. Given the requirement of a number of states in the USA that have mandatory 14-day quarantine when traveling from a high risk state, but can be shortened if there is proof of negative test following 3-4 days after arrival, one suspects this will become a lucrative business in the USA as well. A very sad state of affairs. - Mod.MPP]

Abstract
--------
After the world recovers from the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it is most likely to stabilise as endemic and seasonal, deserving/demanding control efforts perpetually in all countries, unless it can be eradicated. The risk of mortality is high among those above 65 years and those with chronic "lifestyle" diseases. Endemic circulation will, therefore, take a heavy toll on life annually. Eradication is an extreme form of control, eliminating the disease permanently and globally. Effective vaccines are expected in the near future. As the pandemic abates, herd immunity will be very high, enabling early eradication by additional build-up of a vaccine-induced herd immunity. Public memory of the pandemic will be fresh, which will assist in social mobilisation and fund raising towards eradication. If time is lost, the infection is likely to become non-eradicable as domestic/farmed animals may become fresh reservoirs. Resolve to eradicate and designing its road-map must be made at the earliest.

Dr TJ John, who is a world renowned physician, virologist, epidemiologist, and a leading poliovirus expert, has written a very thought provoking article calling for eradication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. He reminds us that SARS-CoV-1 was eradicated after 9 months (and about 8000 cases), with cases identified in 27 countries.

A key difference between the 2 viruses (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) is the high viral loads identified in SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are associated with transmission in asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections. Many of those infected with Poliovirus are also asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (about 1 paralytic case for every 200 infected individuals). Dr John's concerns about the continued threats of the virus to individuals identified as high risk of serious disease are valid. We will hope that SARS-CoV-2 will modify and become less serious in the way that -- as has been postulated -- the coronavirus OC43 may have started as the 1890 Russian flu and morphed into causing the common cold (see COVID-19 update (493): vaccine efficacy, CoV-OC43, WHO, global 20201117.7948812). Will the vaccines, once available, provide the tools to interrupt transmission? Is it premature to be considering eradication of the virus or should a plan be developed sooner rather than later? - Mod.MPP]

[3] Long term immunity

Immunity to the coronavirus may last years, new data hint
---------------------------------------------------------
Blood samples from recovered patients suggest a powerful, long-lasting immune response, researchers reported. How long might immunity to the coronavirus last? Years, maybe even decades, according to a new study -- the most hopeful answer yet to a question that has shadowed plans for widespread vaccination. 8 months after infection, most people who have recovered still have enough immune cells to fend off the virus and prevent illness, the new data show. A slow rate of decline in the short term suggests, happily, that these cells may persist in the body for a very, very long time to come.

The research, published online, has not been peer-reviewed nor published in a scientific journal. But it is the most comprehensive and long-ranging study of immune memory to the coronavirus to date. "That amount of memory would likely prevent the vast majority of people from getting hospitalized disease, severe disease, for many years," said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology who co-led the new study. The findings are likely to come as a relief to experts worried that immunity to the virus might be short-lived and that vaccines might have to be administered repeatedly to keep the pandemic under control.

And the research squares with another recent finding: that survivors of SARS, caused by another coronavirus, still carry certain important immune cells 17 years after recovering. The findings are consistent with encouraging evidence emerging from other labs. Researchers at the University of Washington, led by the immunologist Marion Pepper, had earlier shown that certain "memory" cells that were produced following infection with the coronavirus persist for at least 3 months in the body.

A study published last week [week of 9 Nov 2020] also found that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have powerful and protective killer immune cells even when antibodies are not detectable. (ref: Schulien I, Kemming J, Oberhardt V, et al. Characterization of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. Nat Med. 2020 Nov 12. Epub ahead of print; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-01143-2)

These studies "are all by and large painting the same picture, which is that once you get past those 1st few critical weeks, the rest of the response looks pretty conventional," said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University, said she was not surprised that the body mounts a long-lasting response because "that's what is supposed to happen." Still, she was heartened by the research: "This is exciting news."

A small number of infected people in the new study did not have long-lasting immunity after recovery, perhaps because of differences in the amounts of coronavirus they were exposed to. But vaccines can overcome that individual variability, said Jennifer Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto. "That will help in focusing the response, so you don't get the same kind of heterogeneity that you would see in an infected population," she said.

In recent months, reports of waning antibody levels have created worry that immunity to the coronavirus may disappear in a few months, leaving people vulnerable to the virus again. But many immunologists have noted that it is natural for antibody levels to drop. Besides, antibodies are just one arm of the immune system. Although antibodies in the blood are needed to block the virus and forestall a 2nd infection -- a condition known as sterilizing immunity -- immune cells that "remember" the virus more often are responsible for preventing serious illness.

"Sterilizing immunity doesn't happen very often -- that is not the norm," said Alessandro Sette, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology and co-leader of the study. More often, people become infected a 2nd time with a particular pathogen, and the immune system recognizes the invader and quickly extinguishes the infection. The coronavirus in particular is slow to do harm, giving the immune system plenty of time to kick into gear. "It may be terminated fast enough that not only are you not experiencing any symptoms but you are not infectious," Dr Sette said.

Dr Sette and his colleagues recruited 185 men and women, aged 19 to 81, who had recovered from COVID-19. The majority had mild symptoms not requiring hospitalization; most provided just one blood sample, but 38 provided multiple samples over many months. The team tracked 4 components of the immune system: antibodies, B cells that make more antibodies as needed; and 2 types of T cells that kill other infected cells. The idea was to build a picture of the immune response over time by looking at its constituents. "If you just look at only one, you can really be missing the full picture," Dr Crotty said.

He and his colleagues found that antibodies were durable, with modest declines at 6 to 8 months after infection, although there was a 200-fold difference in the levels among the participants. T cells showed only a slight, slow decay in the body, while B cells grew in number -- an unexpected finding the researchers can't quite explain. The study is the 1st to chart the immune response to a virus in such granular detail, experts said. "For sure, we have no priors here," Dr Gommerman said. "We're learning, I think for the first time, about some of the dynamics of these populations through time."

Worries over how long immunity to the coronavirus persists were sparked mainly by research into those viruses causing common colds. One frequently cited study, led by Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University, suggested that immunity might fade quickly and that reinfections could occur within a year. "What we need to be very mindful of is whether or not reinfection is going to be a concern," Dr Shaman said. "And so seeing evidence that we have this kind of persistent, robust response, at least to these time scales, is very encouraging." So far, at least, he noted, reinfections with the coronavirus seem to be rare.

Exactly how long immunity lasts is hard to predict, because scientists don't yet know what levels of various immune cells are needed to protect from the virus. But studies so far have suggested that even small numbers of antibodies or T and B cells may be enough to shield those who have recovered. The participants in the study have been making those cells in robust amounts -- so far. "There's no sign that memory cells are suddenly going to plummet, which would be kind of unusual," Dr Iwasaki said. "Usually, there's a slow decay over years." There is some emerging evidence that reinfections with common cold coronaviruses are a result of viral genetic variations, Dr Bhattacharya noted, and so those concerns may not be relevant to the new coronavirus. "I don't think it's an unreasonable prediction to think that these immune memory components would last for years," he said.

------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is critical for improving diagnostics and vaccines, and for assessing the likely future course of the pandemic. We analyzed multiple compartments of circulating immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 185 COVID-19 cases, including 41 cases at longer than 6 months post-infection. Spike IgG was relatively stable over 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months. By studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2 in an integrated manner, we observed that each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics."

Subjects for the study while covering asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases, the majority (92%) were mild and not requiring hospitalization, although 97% did report symptomatic disease. As waning immunity has been observed to occur more in milder clinical expression, the findings of the study are more intriguing, highlighting that there is persistent immunity up through 5-6+ months following infection. The subjects included 43% male and 57% females. Age distributions were not given. Race distribution included 77% white, 3% African American, 8% Asian. Ethnicity included 15% Hispanic.

The authors noted that spike IgG titers lasted 6-8 months following symptom onset, and receptor binding domain IgG and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titers were similarly stable. At 5 months or more after the onset of symptoms, almost all subjects were positive for SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain IgG.

The authors noted that memory B cells specific for the spike or receptor binding domain were detected in almost all individuals with COVID-19, with no half life noted 5+ months following infection. The authors pointed out that B cell memory to other infections is long lived -- 60+ years following smallpox vaccination and 90+ years after infection with influenza. In addition, memory T cell half-lives observed over a 6+ month period following symptom onsets were similar to those observed following yellow fever vaccination. The authors noted that these findings suggest that T cell memory "might reach a more stable plateau, or slower decay phase, later than the 1st 6 months post-infection". They concluded that a "hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells and B cells would be capable of substantially limiting SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and/or cumulative viral load, resulting in substantially reduced COVID-19 disease severity." With an observation that "immune memory consisting of at least 3 immunological compartments was measurable in about 90% of subjects more than 5 months following onset of symptoms, indicating that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility in most individuals."

Remember, we have only had almost 11 months experience with this virus. If these findings are reproducible and show an even longer duration of immunity, this is promising for duration of immunity following vaccination, as well as protection against 2nd infections ("reinfection"). - Mod.MPP]

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10am CEST [15 Nov 2020]

Overview
--------
Globally in the past week, rates of new COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to increase, with almost 4 million new cases and 60 000 new deaths recorded. Cumulatively as of [15 Nov 2020], 53.7 million confirmed cases and 1.3 million deaths have been reported to WHO.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
The number of new cases being reported globally continues to rise (Figure 1), with almost 4 million new cases in the past week ([9-15 Nov 2020]) alone. The number of new deaths globally has also grown by 11%, with almost 60 000 new deaths reported, of which 81% were in the Europe and the Americas (Table 1).

Although the European Region continues to report the highest number of new cases globally (46%), it has seen a 10% fall in the past week following the strengthening of public health and social measures across the region. However, the number of new deaths in Europe has increased substantially with over 29 000 new deaths reported in the past week. The Region of the Americas reported a sharp upward trend, with a 41% increase in new cases in the past week. The Eastern Mediterranean, African and Western Pacific Regions also reported increases in the number of new cases. The South East Asia Region, on the other hand, reported a decline in the number of new cases and new deaths. As of [15 Nov 2020], over 53.7 million cases and 1.3 million deaths have been reported globally.

Countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week included: the United States of America (reporting over 1 million new cases, a 47% increase compared to the previous week), India (306 000 cases, 5% decrease), Italy (242 000 cases, 9% increase), France (203 000 cases, 47% decrease), and Brazil (179 000 cases, 57% increase).

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
In the African Region, the gradual increase in the number of new weekly cases since last September [2020] continued, with 40 990 new cases reported, a 22% increase compared to the previous week (Figure 3). Death rates across the region remained similar to the previous week. South Africa, Kenya, Algeria, and Ethiopia reported the largest number of new weekly cases in the region.

Algeria reported a sharp (131%) increase in the past week, with 5806 new cases detected (132 cases per 1 million population) and 114 new deaths reported. Local authorities also reported a substantial rise in hospitalisations in October [2020], most notably in the north eastern and north central provinces. On [8 Nov 2020], the Algerian government implemented 12 additional new public health and social measures to mitigate this surge, including the reinstatement of a night-time curfew, closure of vehicle markets for 15 days, banning public and family gatherings, and postponing the start of university classes and vocational training until [15 Dec 2020].

In Angola, the incidence of new cases continued to decline, with 1039 new cases (32 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, a 32% decrease compared to the previous week. 19 new deaths were reported in the past week. As of [14 Nov 2020], 66% of confirmed cases reported in Angola were male and 86% were individuals aged 20 to 69 years. The capital city of Luanda has been considered the epicentre of the outbreak in the country, with 78% of cumulative cases and 84% of deaths to date.

On [11 Nov 2020], the South African government further eased public health and social measures as the national incidence of new cases remains relative steady, with about 13 000 new cases (224 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, while rates of COVID-19 associated hospitalizations and deaths continue to fall. However, the government warned of potential resurgence, highlighting recent spikes in cases observed in Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan area, Eastern Cape Province, potentially triggered by outbreaks in educational institutions and among people attending large gatherings.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [15 Nov 2020].

- Region of the Americas
Cases and deaths in the Region of the Americas continue to rise (Figure 4), with cases increasing over 40% and deaths over 10% in the past 7 days.

The United States of America reported the largest number of cases in the Region, with over 1 million cases (3036 cases per 1 million population) in the past week, amounting to nearly 11 million cumulative cases since the start of the pandemic.

In Canada, upward trends in both cases and deaths have continued, with over 30 000 new cases (835 new cases per 1 million population) and just under 400 new deaths (10 new deaths per 1 million population) in the past week. Increased activity has also been reported among vulnerable populations and settings (such as elderly adults and Indigenous communities, and in a range of settings including long-term care and assisted living facilities, schools, congregate living settings, industrial work settings, and social gatherings). Overall, nearly 300 000 confirmed cases and 11 000 deaths have been reported from Canada since the start of the pandemic.

Mexico reported 42 465 new cases this past week (328 new cases per 1 million population), a 16% increase compared to the previous week. There have been reports of increased hospitalizations in the northern state of [? Sonora, Coahuila, Sinaloa, Durango?], this region has been placed under the highest coronavirus alert level, joining the neighbouring region of Chihuahua, which borders the USA. Death rates in the country increased by 9% in the past week, with 3301 new deaths reported.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [15 Nov 2020].

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The incidence of new cases continued to increase in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (Figure 5), with over 238 000 new cases this past week, an 11% increase on the previous week, while the number of reported deaths was similar. Countries which reported the greatest number of new cases included Iran, Jordan, and Morocco.

In Pakistan, a resurgence is being observed with over 12 000 (58 cases per 1 million population) new cases reported in the past week -- a 45% increase on the previous week. The weekly number of deaths also rose by 21%, with 166 reported. Country officials have strengthened public health and social measures in light of these increases. Considering the large population of Pakistan (over 220 million people), concerted efforts to reduce transmission have thus far been relatively successful.

In Afghanistan, a 65% increase was observed this past week, with 1002 new cases (26 cases per 1 million population) reported. As of [12 Nov 2020], test positivity rates in the country were estimated at over 33%, highlighting the limitations in the testing capacity, testing criteria, and willingness of people to come forward for testing, with stigma considered as a major factor in the decision not to get tested. Men accounted for more than 69% of the total confirmed cases, and most recorded deaths were among men aged 50-79 years, which may in part be due to men being over-represented in testing.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [15 Nov 2020].

- European Region
Over the past week, the European Region recorded 46% of all cases and 49% of all deaths reported globally, with nearly 2 million new cases and almost 30 000 new deaths. However, in the past week, for the first time in over three months, the region observed a decline of 10% in weekly cases (Figure 6). At the same time, deaths continued to increase, with an 18% increase the past week in comparison to the previous week.

Varying patterns were seen in Europe with decreases in cases being observed in 24 countries in the past 7 days, ranging from a 2% to over 40% decrease in new cases in these 24 countries compared to the previous week. Whereas in other countries, weekly increases in new cases ranging from 1% to over 40% were reported. The countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past week were Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Poland, the Russian Federation, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, Romania, and Austria. Among these 10 countries, Austria reported the sharpest increase, with new cases this week 30% higher compared to the previous week. The countries with the highest weekly mortality rates, exceeding 60 deaths per 1 million population, were Czechia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, North Macedonia, Armenia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Croatia, and Montenegro. The United Kingdom was the 1st country in the region to record over 50 000 cumulative deaths.

The Russian Federation recorded its highest case and death counts, with over 150 000 cases (1038 cases per 1 million population) and over 2600 deaths reported in the past week. Public health interventions were strengthened across many regions. Moscow expanded public health and social measures, including switching universities to online learning and limiting the time during which restaurants and bars can serve customers.

Lithuania was also among the countries which reached a peak in cases and deaths over the past week, with more than 10 500 new cases (3919 cases per 1 million population). Similar to other countries in the region, Lithuania expanded public health and social measures in the 1st weeks of November [2020]. Additionally, Lithuania is adapting its hospital network to meet growing demands through expanding bed capacity and will set up a temporary hospital in a large exhibition center in Vilnius.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [15 Nov 2020].

- South East Asia Region
The South East Asia Region observed 6 weeks of continued decline in cases and deaths from the 2nd half of September [2020] until the end of October [2020] (Figure 7). New weekly cases fell from over 690 000 to around 380 000, and new weekly deaths decreased from over 9300 in the week commencing on [14 Sep 2020] to under 4600 in the past week. Since the start of November [2020], weekly cases have stabilized under 400 000 for the past 3 weeks, with 373 786 cases reported in the past week. Weekly deaths have also remained relatively stable, with 4534 deaths reported in the past week. Countries with highest number of weekly new cases per million population in the past week included Nepal, Maldives, and India.

The regional trend continues to be strongly influenced by India, which consistently reports the highest numbers of cases and deaths in the Region. After a period of sharp decline, cases and deaths in India have stabilized since the end of October [2020]. In the past week, further decreases of 5% in cases and 12% in deaths were observed, with 306 825 cases (222 cases per 1 million population) and 3 514 deaths reported. At the end of the week, the states of Maharashtra, Kerala, and Delhi reported the highest numbers of new cases, with over 80 000 in Maharashtra and almost 40 000 in Delhi.

Indonesia reported the 2nd highest number of cases in the Region in the past week. Until [8 Nov 2020], Indonesia had observed a weekly decline in cases for 6 consecutive weeks, with weekly cases falling from over 30 000 in the week commencing on [21 Sep 2020] to under 23 800 in the week commencing [2 Nov 2020]. However, in the past week, the country registered over 29 000 new cases (107 cases per 1 million population), a 23% increase from last week. Towards the end of the week, Indonesia registered over 5200 daily cases for 2 consecutive days. On both days, Jakarta and Jawa Tengah Provinces reported the highest case numbers in the country, exceeding 1000 each day.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [15 Nov 2020].

- Western Pacific Region
The number of cases continues to gradually rise in the Western Pacific Region (Figure 8), which reported nearly 33 000 new cases and over 400 deaths in the past week. New cases increased by 5% and new deaths increased by 15% compared to the previous week. This reporting period is the 2nd consecutive week that the Western Pacific Region reported more than 30 000 new cases per week since mid-September [2020]. The Philippines, Japan, Malaysia, and French Polynesia reported the highest number of cases in the region.

Guam reported 820 new cases (4859 cases per 1 million population) in the past week, more than double the number of cases reported the previous week and the highest weekly count since the beginning of the pandemic. 4 new deaths were reported, bringing the total to 93 cumulative deaths. In a correctional facility, 60 inmates and one officer tested positive for COVID-19 in the past week and are currently in isolation.

Malaysia reported 6852 new cases in the past week (212 cases per 1 million population).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218. A note of caution re weekend reporting artifact. During the weekend period, some countries do not submit reports to WHO (or elsewhere) or some reporting units within countries do not submit reports so it appears as though transmission may be slowing down when it is reporting that is slowing down.

Data by country, area, or territory for 17 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov17_1605642771.pdf.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (157 654), France (45 522), India (38 532), Brazil (35 018), and Italy (32 191) have been dominant. A global total of 11 053 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (16-17 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, France, India, Brazil, Italy, Russia (22 410), UK (20 051), Poland (19 152), Germany (16 206), Sweden (15 084), Iran (13 352), Spain (13 159), Ukraine (11 968), and Argentina (10 621). A total of 56 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 56 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 4.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.5%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA (which reported 26.5% of all newly reported cases in the past 24 hours), as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 31.1% and in reported deaths is 18.1%. In Italy, the dominant country in the European region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 3.0% and in reported deaths is 41.7%. And in Iran, the dominant country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 29.9% and in reported deaths is 6.7%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase. This appears to have slowed down with reduced reporting over the weekend although there is an increase today (17 Nov 2020), especially in reported deaths. as the non-reporting countries begin to report. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
