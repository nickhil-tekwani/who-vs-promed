592 recoveries and
56 currently active cases (including 4 on home isolation}

In the past 24 hours there have been a total of:
6 newly confirmed cases

[reported case fatality rate presently 42.9 percent]

Information on newly confirmed cases (6 cases)
All 6 cases reported from Riyadh
1- A 109-year-old [age is not a typo on my computer] Saudi male non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Gave a positive history of contact with other known cases.

2- An 87-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Gave a positive history of contact with other known cases.

3- A 72-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently in stable condition. Gave a positive history of contact with other known cases.

[Reported as a newly confirmed case on either 4 Aug 2015 or 18 Aug 2015 -- both these individuals were noted to be in critical condition and to have had contact with known MER-CoV infected cases in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. - Mod.MPP]

[With today's addition of 6 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection all from Riyadh it raises the total number of confirmed cases reported from Riyadh since the beginning of August 2015 to 74 (out of 77 cases reported from all of Saudi Arabia during this period) and the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 1134, including 486 deaths. One of the cases reported today (no. 6) is in a healthcare worker. Another one of the cases (no. 5) did not give a history of contact with other known case(s) -- the question that arises is whether this is a case reported from another hospital that did not have contact with the King Abdul Aziz Medical City hospital in the 14 days prior to onset of her illness. Presumably this information will be available in future update reports from WHO.

I have been using 21 Aug 2015 as the start date of the outbreak in Riyadh as there had been a 21-day hiatus in reports of cases from Riyadh prior to the major increase in case reports. As mentioned in earlier posts, the MOH press release mentioned the outbreak began in June 2015, but did not specify when in June the outbreak began (there were a total of 4 cases reported from Riyadh during the month of June). Using 21 Jul 2015 as a start date for the increase in case reports from Riyadh, since then (21 Jul 2015) there have been 81 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Riyadh, 7 of whom were in healthcare workers. Of the 81 cases reported from Riyadh, 46 (57.8 percent) gave a history of contact with other known cases and 21 (25.9 percent) gave a history of possible contact with other cases that was under review at the time of report. Only 14 (16.3 percent) did not give a history of contact with other cases.

A map showing the location of the newly reported cases can be found at the source URL above. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3594728,131. - Mod.MPP]

[The global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to WHO is now 1432 including at least 507 related deaths (reported case fatality rate of 35.4 percent). Looking at the cases reported in the above WHO update, the outbreak in "the hospital that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak" is very clear - of the 18 cases reported from Riyadh in this update, 15 are mentioned to be part of the ongoing outbreak associated with one healthcare institution (the King Abdul Aziz Medical City Hospital). Of these 15 cases, 6 were noted to have developed symptoms compatible with MERS after being admitted (4 for stated other chronic conditions, 2 who developed worsening symptoms after several days in the hospital), 6 had a history of visits to the emergency room of "the hospital that has been experiencing a MERS-CoV outbreak", one was treated at that hospital (location of treatment not specified but presume to be outpatient clinic) and one is under investigation. Fairly convincing evidence of transmission in the hospital environment, including both inpatient areas and the emergency room. One of these cases is a healthcare worker at this hospital (location and type of work not mentioned. - Mod.MPP]

[The Director of the Emergency Department at the King Abdul Aziz Medical City covering the National Guard is currently in critical condition with MERS-CoV infection.

Dr. Hanan Balkhi announced on Tuesday [18 Aug 2015] the closure of the Emergency Department at the Hospital. She explained the decision was a precautionary closure after an increase in MERS-CoV infections (up to 46 cases [at that time]). She noted that there are an additional 20 cases still under medical examination and evaluation and involvement of 15 people from the medical staff at the hospital.]

[The above media report is sobering -- the risks of working in the healthcare environment clearly demonstrated, as well as the mention that there are still 20 cases pending confirmation and involvement of 15 medical staff members from the hospital. It is not clear (from the sub-optimal machine translation) if the 15 medical staff members are including in the 20 cases mentioned that are pending confirmation, or are in addition to the 20 cases mentioned. Needless to say we will learn over the coming days how many more cases will be confirmed that are associated with this ongoing outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
