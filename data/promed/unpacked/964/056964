Ebola outbreak contained in Lofa County, MSF hands over activities
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola situation has improved in Lofa County and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has decided to withdraw from the area. New actors have arrived to help and since 30 October there have been no more Ebola patients in the Ebola Management Centre (EMC) in Foya. The success of MSF's intervention in northern Liberia can be considered a model of response, benefiting from a comprehensive approach and constant community involvement.... -- more

[2] Guinea: fights to reduce Ebola risks to miners

Guinea: fights to reduce Ebola risks to miners
----------------------------------------------
Health teams working in Guinea are ramping up outreach efforts in the country's mining regions, where a concentrated and mobile workforce provides a ripe environment for spreading the deadly Ebola virus. "The situation in Guinea remains worrying," Christophe Boulierac, a Geneva-based spokesman for the United Nations children's agency [UNICEF], said after completing a 10-day tour there last week. Ebola has sickened at least 2000 people in Guinea and killed at least 1233, with the infection rate rising slightly since October [2014], the World Health Organization reported in its latest status update. Boulierac traveled to 2 regions of Guinea: the West African country's northern mining region and its southeastern rainforest, where the current outbreak began nearly a year ago.

In and around the northeastern gold-mining town of Kouremale, near the border with Mali, "you can meet miners from all West Africa," Boulierac said, speaking by phone from near Conakry, the [Guinea] capital. These "artisan" or independent miners' movements -- from different countries and among shifting worksites -- offer heightened potential for contagion once they return to their families, he added. Ebola has migrated to Mali, where 8 cases of infection have been reported since October [2014]. UNICEF, other international partners and local governments are "scaling up their action in this strategic area in order to contain the outbreak," Boulierac said. They've begun setting up village "watch committees," recognizing the importance of local involvement. Each 5-person panel has a youth, woman, traditional healer, religious leader and public health representative, Boulierac said. Health officials recently set a goal of 132 such committees in the gold-mining region; within a few days, they were halfway there.

Mining, like other industries in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been rocked by Ebola. Health experts, including some from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have met regularly with officials of major firms to advise them of risks and safety measures, several CDC personnel who'd worked in Guinea told VOA earlier this fall." ... -- more

[3] Region: mobilize survivors

Mobilize survivors to contain Ebola, experts argue
--------------------------------------------------
The mobilization of Ebola survivors is necessary to hasten containment of the epidemic. That is the key message of an editorial published in the International Journal of Epidemiology. Ebola survivors could be valuable blood [plasma] donors. Their antibodies may have protective properties and could also improve the chances of survival in those infected with Ebola.

4 main reasons why Ebola survivors are critical to controlling the Ebola epidemic are listed in the editorial by Dr. Zena Stein of the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Joseph Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University and her colleagues, who are based at the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University.

1) People who have recovered from their infection have developed immunity to the current strain of Ebola, which makes them able to care for sick people with little to no risk of becoming infected again. "In a sense survivors are the only people in the world who are 'vaccinated' against further Ebola infection with the strain in circulation," says Dr. Stein. "This uniquely positions them to mediate between the infected and uninfected and between local people and foreign responders."

2) Survivors could be valuable blood [plasma] donors. Their antibodies may have protective properties and could also improve the chances of survival in those infected with Ebola. However, research has not yet proved the effectiveness of this kind of immunotherapy using the blood of survivors.

3) There is a cultural dynamic behind the authors' 3rd reason. Ebola survivors in afflicted countries often speak local languages, and communities may be more receptive to their aid than foreign responders. The authors consider that their cultural position would allow Ebola survivors to care in both medical and home-based settings. In addition, training and employment as caregivers would allow Ebola survivors to have an important source of income during a period that has seen increasing poverty and Ebola-related stigmatization.

4) Survivors may be able to generate a vital community-based response to the epidemic. "Community-initiated actions in epidemics are recognized as important to public health, and have already been proven successful in an African context. For instance, the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa has generated an effective, nationwide social movement among those HIV-positive, stigmatized and deprived of treatment. A movement among Ebola survivors could establish their effectiveness as advocates and educators, countering stigma and building community trust." ... -- more

[4] Guinea-Bissau reports suspected Ebola case

Guinea-Bissau reports suspected Ebola case
------------------------------------------
A man who entered Guinea-Bissau from neighbouring Guinea the day after the border reopened is being treated for suspected Ebola, a medical official said on Fri [12 Dec 2014]. The traveller was running a temperature and put under surveillance as he tried to pass through the Fulamori border crossing on Wed [10 Dec2014]. He took advantage of lax security among border guards to escape observation and boarded a bus headed for the eastern city of Gabu, where he was apprehended.

"He had a temperature higher than 39 C (102 F). It is for this reason that we have isolated him pending further analysis of his case," said Gilda Helena De Almeida Vieira, head nurse at a health post in the western village of Buruntuma; 8 fellow passengers were quarantined, said Vieira.... -- more
