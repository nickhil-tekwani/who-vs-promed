Norway's food safety authority (NFSA) suspects that there has been a pancreatic disease (PD) outbreak at a Marine Harvest fish farm.

According to the Norwegian agency, the affected centre is located at sea site 12624, in the Flatanger municipality in Nord-Troendelag, mid-Norway.

NFSA told Reuters there are 1.6 million fish at the site with an average weight of 1.1 kg [about 2.4 lb].

If the disease is confirmed, the fish has to be moved from the site or killed.

As indicated by the firm's spokesperson Ola Helge Hjetland, one fish at the location has shown PD, and the NFSA is now doing more tests.

Hjetland added that Marine Harvest still hopes that tests will show that the location has no outbreak of PD but if that is the case, he said that the fish will be moved to locations further south in Norway.

Norwegian rules state that the area from Nord-Troendelag and to the north should be free of pancreatic disease.

[Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) is a double-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus _Aquabirnavirus_, family Birnaviridae.

IPNV is a severe threat, ecologically and economically, to the aquaculture industry. The virus causes acute infection with substantial mortality in Atlantic salmon fry and post-smolts ["smolt" = a young salmon when it becomes covered with silvery scales and first migrates from fresh water to the sea. http://thefreedictionary.com. - Mod.LM] IPN is distributed worldwide, and has been a problem in Norwegian fish farms since 1985 and is regarded as one of the most costly diseases to the aquaculture industry. As the name implies, the pancreatic tissue in the pyloric caeca is a target for the virus and is affected during an acute IPN infection. - Mod.PMB
