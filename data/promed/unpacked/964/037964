South Australia had its 1st reported outbreak of Theileria, with the
death of 5 beef cattle on a property near Furner in October 2014.
Veterinarian Jade Hammer warns that South Australia should expect
further losses from the little-known disease, especially in years of
high summer rainfall.

Speaking at the recent Meat & Livestock Australia / More Beef from
Pastures / South East Beef Innovation & Profit Drivers Day, Dr Hammer
-- a vet at the Main St Veterinary Clinic in Bairnsdale, Victoria
(Vic) -- said Theileria is now in all states of Australia except
Tasmania.

In the Gippsland region of Vic it has become a growing problem, with
deaths of infected beef and dairy cattle as well as significant
production loses. The New South Wales DPI estimates average cost to
producers is AUD 58,000 [USD 43 876] or AUD151 [USD 114] a head, and
in Japan, where it is endemic, it costs up to AUD 100 million [USD
$75.6 million] a year. Dr Hammer said it was now one of the most
common reasons Gippsland beef producers called a vet, and his practice
alone had seen more than 300 outbreak herds.

A prevalence study conducted by 3 vet practices in the Gippsland area
who each bled 30 healthy cows from 5 herds, detected Theileria in 34
per cent of them. Recent studies showed this was dramatically
increasing to more than 60 per cent with cows 4-7 years old most
susceptible.
He has diagnosed animals on the same properties year after year in
Gippsland, because the ticks remained on the property and infected new
animals each season.

Frustrated by the lack of understanding of the diseases' transmission
and the message from government that it was only affecting a small
number of producers, Dr Hammer decided to raise awareness of the
disease. He is taking his Masters degree at the University of Sydney,
receiving funding from Meat & Livestock Australia and United
Dairyfarmers of Victoria to investigate the mechanical and biological
transmission of the disease. It is known to be spread by ticks but he
is also looking at other blood-feeding parasites such as march fly,
mosquitoes and lice to see if they play a role in transmission between
animals.

[Theileria are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks
carrying theileria feed on cattle, the parasite gets into their
bloodstream and enters red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient
red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia -- a reduction in the
red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry
oxygen and makes the animal ill.

A protozoan referred to as _Theileria buffeli_ has been present in
Australia for around 100 years. It has been seen occasionally in blood
smears of cattle from "ticky" country, but seldom caused any illness.
It was considered a benign infection.

Generally ticks are the carriers (vectors) responsible for spread of
theileria throughout the world. In New South Wales, the bush tick
(_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is suspected to be responsible, though
other ticks could be involved. Small numbers (fewer than 10 ticks) are
able to spread the infection. Many farmers on affected properties have
not observed ticks on affected cattle. Experimentally lice and march
flies have also been shown to transmit infection.
