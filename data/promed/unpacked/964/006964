The Ministry of Health demanded this evening [Wed 21 Dec 2022] that citizens who live at a distance of 60 m [197 ft] or less from the house whose residents were poisoned last night [20 Dec 2022] in Jabal Al-Dik - Al-Rum housing in Beit Sahour evacuate their homes for a period of 48 hours.

The Director of Bethlehem Health, Dr. Shadi Al-Lahham, said this measure aims to preserve the lives of citizens and to enable the health staff to open the apartment containing toxic gas to ventilate it.

He added that as a result of the presence of a toxic gas called "phosphine" in one of the apartments in a residential building in Beit Sahour, a number of citizens were poisoned, leading to the death of 2 and the injury of others.

Al-Lahham indicated work is underway by the health staff in cooperation with the security services to address the emergency situation, calling on the citizens in the area to cooperate to protect themselves by evacuating their homes surrounding the aforementioned apartment.

Al-Lahham explained this gas is internationally prohibited and not licensed by the Ministry of Health.

Subsequently, the Ministry of Health reported its teams and civil defense teams had finished their work in the city of Beit Sahour after reducing the concentration of toxic gases spreading in one of the city's residences and handed the site over to the police with a recommendation not to approach the site for 48 hours.

In turn, the official spokesman for the police, Colonel Louay Arziqat, stated a child died hours after the death of her brother in the Beit Sahour accident, adding the Public Prosecution decided to keep the body for an autopsy to find out the cause of death.

[Beit Sahour [Sahur] is a Palestinian town east of Bethlehem, in the Bethlehem governorate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beit_Sahour).

"Phosphine (PH3) is a colorless, flammable, and explosive gas at room temperature that smells like garlic or decaying fish. Exposure to phosphine may cause, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, thirst, muscle pain, difficulty breathing, and fluid in the lungs. Higher exposures and long-term exposure may cause serious harm. Workers may be harmed from exposure to phosphine. The level of exposure depends upon the dose, duration, and work being done.

"Phosphine is used in many industries. It's used to kill insects and rodents in stored grain and tobacco. Some examples of workers at risk of being exposed to phosphine include the following:
- factory workers that make electronics
- workers in plants that make rat poison
- pest control workers who use it to control for rats"
(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/phosphine/default.html)

"Phosphine is a highly toxic phosphorus hydride that is formed naturally via the anaerobic decay of phosphorus-containing organic matter or is prepared by an alkali metal hydroxide or white phosphorus hydrolysis reaction. Phosphine is used in industrial processes, in flame retardant production, and as a pesticide. It is characterized as a colorless gas that is odorless when pure. Exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact."

"Small amounts occur naturally from the breakdown of organic matter. It is slightly soluble in water. Phosphine is used in semiconductor and plastics industries, in the production of a flame retardant, and as a pesticide in stored grain."
(https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/phosphine)

"Air and water reactions
Highly flammable. Usually ignites spontaneously in air. Burns with a luminous flame [Merck 11th ed. 1989]. Insoluble in water.

"Fire hazard
Phosphine can explode with powerful oxidizers. The gas is heavier than air and may travel along the ground to an ignition source. Container may explode in heat of fire. When heated to decomposition, it emits highly toxic fumes of phosphorus oxides. Reacts violently with air, boron trichloride, bromine, chlorine, chlorine monoxide, nitric acid, nitric oxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen trioxide, silver nitrate, nitrous acid, mercuric nitrate, nitrogen trichloride, oxygen, and (potassium plus ammonia). Stable up to 131 deg F [55 deg C]. May become unstable at high temperatures. (EPA, 1998)

"Health hazard
Phosphine is a super toxic gas with a probable oral lethal dose of 5 mg/kg or 7 drops for a 150 lb [68 kg] person. An air concentration of 3 ppm is safe for long-term exposure, 500 ppm is lethal in 30 minutes, and a concentration of 1000 ppm is lethal after a few breaths. (EPA, 1998)"

Needless to say, this is a very toxic and potentially lethal compound. The article did not make clear how the authorities knew it was there or how they were alerted to the situation. However, it is clearly a lethal situation as 2 children have died. Our sympathy to the family or families affected. - Mod.TG
