The Regional Ministerial Health Secretariat [SEREMI] confirmed a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in La Araucania region.

The case is a 44-year-old farmer from the Victoria community who presented with the 1st symptoms of the disease on 20 Nov [2015] and was hospitalized yesterday [25 Nov 2015] in the hospital of that community, where a rapid test to detect hantaviruses was positive. The man was then transported to the Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano.

Samples were sent to the Laboratory of Molecular Virology of the Austral University of Chile, where it was finally confirmed as a hantavirus [infection], becoming the 9th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the region in 2015.

Currently, the man is hospitalized in the intensive care unit in stable condition, without respiratory complications.

The health authorities issued announcements to the population to carry out precautionary measures to avoid hantavirus infections from transmission [from rodents] to those working and living in rural areas.

[This case underscores information in previous reports from Chile, of cases of human hantavirus infections that occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus infection, some with pulmonary syndrome unlike this case, occur every year. The diagnostic system has been substantially improved. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical because of the speed with which the disease can progress and the urgency of proper treatment. The long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is the reservoir rodent host. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm.
