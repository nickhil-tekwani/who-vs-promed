A deadly anthrax outbreak has ripped through the Midlands province with cases being reported in Gokwe North and South districts, where herds of cattle have been wiped out and human cases have also been recorded.

Midlands veterinary services officer Munyaradzi Chigiji confirmed the development. He told NewsDayWeekender that samples to be tested to ascertain the cause of livestock deaths have since been sent to the department's laboratories in Harare. "I can confirm that lately there have been huge numbers of cattle dying in the 2 districts of Gokwe (Gokwe North and South). Villagers approached us and highlighted that they suspected it was anthrax due to the symptoms displayed by the cattle. We collected samples and sent them to Harare on Monday [26 Nov 2018]. We await results so that we can take appropriate measures," he said.

Chigiji also confirmed that human cases were recorded in the cotton-growing areas of Gokwe. "Some villagers developed signs of anthrax, and these were confirmed at health centres where the villagers went for treatment in Gokwe. The affected people were treated and discharged. We therefore urge anyone in Gokwe or those who will have visited the area to quickly visit a healthcare centre if they see signs of the anthrax disease. Anthrax can be cured in people, but a delay in seeking treatment can cause death," he said.

Villagers from Gokwe said they had lost a significant number of livestock. "I had a herd of 15 cattle, and all of it is gone. I had good breeds of heifers and hard Mashona, but all that is now history. From what we are seeing it's very likely that it is anthrax," HN, a farmer in Gokwe-Kana, said.

DG, a farmer in Nembudziya, said over 45 beasts died in his area in the last 2 weeks.

Anthrax is an infectious bacterial disease, caused by the spore-forming bacteria called _Bacillus anthracis_. It can be prevented on livestock through vaccinations.

[Anthrax is a constant problem in Midlands, with outbreaks in 2017 (2), 2016 (9), 2015 (1), 2013 (4), 2012 (5), 2011 (5), 2010 (4), 2009 (6), and so on. Anthrax is enzootic in Zimbabwe, and it is long overdue to have an effective, proactive, efficient national surveillance and control programme. Until that happens, we will continue to see reports of outbreaks, though this one is much worse than most. To have such high mortality rates is typical of high biting fly _Tabanid_ counts, with the female flies taking the infection from animal to animal, herd to herd, district to district.
