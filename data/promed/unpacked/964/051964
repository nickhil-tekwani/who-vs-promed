As China headed into a week of Lunar New Year travel and celebrations, it reported 11 new H7N9 avian influenza infections today [24 Jan 2014], including the 1st one in Beijing since the 1st wave last spring [2013]. At least 45 infections have been reported this week [week of 19 Jan 2014], a level that tops the busiest week of the outbreak's 1st wave last spring. In an outbreak that seems to be heavily driven by human contact with live poultry or their environments, health officials have aired concerns that holiday rituals that involve market-bird purchases and slaughter in people's homes, as well as crowded travel conditions, could amplify the numbers of infected people. The surge in H7N9 activity in China, as well as other recent high-profile infectious disease events, is triggering preparedness activities and threat assessments in other countries, including the United States, other Asian nations, and Europe.

The patient from Beijing is a man who got sick and was hospitalized after he bought pigeons and ate them, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported. His infection is the 1st reported in the city since late May [2013]. His case may also signal widening circulation of the virus, because the city is several hundred miles north of the main outbreak areas in eastern and southern China. Only 3 other infections have been reported by Beijing, and one was in an asymptomatic child. A total of 7 of the cases are patients from Zhejiang, the hardest-hit province. All are adults, ranging in age from 23 to 82; 5 are women and 2 are men. All of them are hospitalized, 5 in critical condition and 2 listed as severe. Of 85 cases reported in China so far this year [2014], Zhejiang has recorded 43, more than any other province. Authorities in its capital city of Hangzhou announced the suspension of live poultry trading in the main urban areas, starting today [24 Jan 2014], Xinhua reported. Earlier this month, Shanghai announced that it would temporarily shutter live bird markets starting [31 Jan 2014] to curb the spread of the virus. The burst of new cases today raises the outbreak total to 238, according to a case list compiled by the FluTrackers infectious disease message board. The unofficial number of deaths stands at 57. The rise in cases since October [2013] suggests that the reservoir persists and the transmission pattern may be seasonal, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
