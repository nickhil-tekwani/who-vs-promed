From: Henry Wilde MD <wilde@md2.md.chula.ac.th>

We had two confirmed cases [of legionellosis in Thailand. Both had been
imported from
neighboring countries (India and a Cruise Liner in the Pacific). One was a
79 year old European male (January, 1998), the other a 57 year old German
female (February, 1999). The female had chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). The male was previously healthy. Both recovered. The male
required intubation and prolonged respiratory care, the female did well
without it. Both were treated with azithromycin.
Diagnosis was confirmed by 4+ increase in antibody titers [presumably a
four-fold rise in antibody titer - Mod.ES. Legionella is not commonly
diagnosed in Thailand but the organism has been found in water tanks in
hotels etc. Recently, a third European patient is reported to have been
diagnosed at a private hospital in Bangkok. This patient has also survived.

[I'm guessing that the elderly male is the same case previously reported in
the ProMED-mail posting cited above. There is a bit more detail of the
clinical laboratory diagnosis in that message. - Mod.ES
