The 1st known epidemic of extensively drug-resistant typhoid is spreading through Pakistan, infecting at least 850 people in 14 districts since 2016, according to the National Institute of Health Islamabad. The typhoid strain, resistant to 5 types of antimicrobial agents, is expected to disseminate globally, replacing weaker strains where they are endemic. Experts have identified only one remaining oral antibiotic -- azithromycin -- to combat it; one more genetic mutation could make typhoid untreatable in some areas.

Researchers consider the epidemic an international clarion call for comprehensive prevention efforts. If vaccination campaigns and modern sanitation systems don't outpace the pathogen, they anticipate a return to the pre-antibiotic era when mortality rates soared. "This isn't just about typhoid," said Dr Rumina Hasan, a pathology professor at the Aga Khan University in Pakistan. "Antimicrobial resistance is a threat to all of modern medicine -- and the scary part is, we're out of options."

Typhoid fever, caused by the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi bacterium, is a highly infectious disease transmitted by contaminated food or water. It causes high fevers, headaches, and vomiting. About 21 million people suffer from typhoid each year, and about 161 000 die, according to the WHO.

Typhoid is endemic to Pakistan, where poor infrastructure, low vaccination rates, and overpopulated city dwellings persist. Doctors in the Sindh province were not surprised by an outbreak in November 2016 -- until cases proved unresponsive to ceftriaxone, used to treat multidrug-resistant, or MDR, strains of typhoid.

Only 4 isolated cases of extensively drug-resistant, or XDR, typhoid had previously been reported worldwide, according to Dr Elizabeth Klemm, an infectious disease geneticist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in England. The outbreak's origins were clear: Early case mapping revealed large clusters of victims around sewage lines in the city of Hyderabad. Dr Hasan's colleagues visited the region and found water sources that could be contaminated by leaking sewage pipes. 4 deaths have been reported so far, according to the National Institute of Health Islamabad. At least one travel-related case has been detected in the United Kingdom.

Genetic sequencing revealed that a common, aggressive MDR typhoid strain called H58 interacted with another bacteria, likely _E. coli_, and acquired from it an additional DNA molecule, called a plasmid, that coded for resistance to ceftriaxone. The findings were disturbingly simple: XDR strains can materialize in one single step, virtually anywhere where the H58 strain and the added plasmid are both present -- whether a sewer system or even a single human gut.

"There are multiple worst-case scenarios," said Dr Klemm. "One is that this strain spreads to other regions through migration. But the other is that it pops up elsewhere on its own -- plasmids with drug resistance are everywhere." But the accumulation of resistance genes in the Sindh strain was hardly an ambush, according to a commentary by vaccine experts at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. The 1948 discovery of antimicrobial treatment for typhoid plunged the infection's fatality rate from almost 1 in 4 to just 1 in 100, triggering "an epic thrust-and-parry duel" between powerful drugs and "a wily bacterial foe's stepwise acquisition of resistance to them," wrote Dr Myron M Levine and Dr Raphael Simon.

Doctors still prescribe an estimated 50 million doses of antibiotics for typhoid globally each year. In Karachi, the capital of Sindh province, antibiotic resistance is increasing by 30 percent each year, according to the WHO; at that rate, all typhoid cases in the city will be resistant to multiple drugs by 2020.

Physicians are treating the Sindh strain with azithromycin and other more expensive treatments that must be administered in hospital settings. Once we aren't able to treat this effectively, we're going back to the pre-antimicrobial era. That would mean a lot of fatalities in our future," Dr Klemm said. To preserve the last line of defense, public health officials have launched a campaign to vaccinate 250 000 children in Hyderabad using a new typhoid conjugate vaccine, Typbar-TCV, recently prequalified by the WHO. The vaccine lasts at least 5 years and can be given to children as young as 6 months old, according to the WHO.

Experts are also reinforcing hygiene habits for prevention: washing hands frequently, boiling drinking water, and eating well-cooked foods. In the longer term, modern sanitation infrastructure is needed.

The vaccination campaign has faced local opposition, according to local news reports, amid rumors that the vaccines have been poisoned in a Western effort to harm children. Similar suspicions have persisted since 2011, when a posed hepatitis B campaign helped gather intelligence before the Abbottabad raid that killed Osama bin Laden. 2 polio vaccination workers were killed in Pakistan in January 2018.

GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance, a public-private global health partnership working to increase access to immunization, has pledged USD 85 million to ensure that typhoid vaccines reach developing countries.

"It's a global concern at this point," said Dr Eric Mintz, an epidemiologist at the CDC. "Everything suggests this strain will survive well and spread easily -- and acquiring resistance to azithromycin is only a matter of time."

Abstract
--------
Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa and are often associated with the dominant H58 haplotype. Reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is also widespread, and sporadic cases of resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin have also been reported. Here, we report the 1st large-scale emergence and spread of a novel _S._ Typhi clone harboring resistance to 3 1st-line drugs (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) as well as fluoroquinolones and 3rd-generation cephalosporins in Sindh, Pakistan, which we classify as extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Over 300 XDR typhoid cases have emerged in Sindh, Pakistan, since November 2016. Additionally, a single case of travel-associated XDR typhoid has recently been identified in the United Kingdom. Whole-genome sequencing of over 80 of the XDR isolates revealed remarkable genetic clonality and sequence conservation, identified a large number of resistance determinants, and showed that these isolates were of haplotype H58. The XDR _S._ Typhi clone encodes a chromosomally located resistance region and harbors a plasmid encoding additional resistance elements, including the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and carrying the _qnr_S fluoroquinolone resistance gene. This antibiotic resistance-associated IncY plasmid exhibited high sequence identity to plasmids found in other enteric bacteria isolated from widely distributed geographic locations. This study highlights 3 concerning problems: the receding antibiotic arsenal for typhoid treatment, the ability of _S._ Typhi to transform from MDR to XDR in a single step by acquisition of a plasmid, and the ability of XDR clones to spread globally.

Importance
----------
Typhoid fever is a severe disease caused by the Gram-negative bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi. Antibiotic-resistant _S._ Typhi strains have become increasingly common. Here, we report the 1st large-scale emergence and spread of a novel extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _S._ Typhi clone in Sindh, Pakistan. The XDR _S._ Typhi is resistant to the majority of drugs available for the treatment of typhoid fever. This study highlights the evolving threat of antibiotic resistance in _S._ Typhi and the value of antibiotic susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing in understanding emerging infectious diseases. We genetically characterized the XDR _S._ Typhi to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between these isolates and a global collection of _S._ Typhi isolates and to identify multiple genes linked to antibiotic resistance. This _S._ Typhi clone harbored a promiscuous antibiotic resistance plasmid previously identified in other enteric bacteria. The increasing antibiotic resistance in _S._ Typhi observed here adds urgency to the need for typhoid prevention measures. - Mod.LL
