A high school student in Poughkeepsie [New York state] has died from a possible infection by Powassan virus. Earlier this month, according to the Poughkeepsie School District, the soon to be senior [going into his final year of high school] died from the Powassan virus [infection]. "The initial autopsy [diagnosed] Powassan virus [infection], a very, very rare tick virus," said Dutchess County Health Department commissioner Kari Reiber. Reiber says an initial test did come back positive, but other tests need to be done. "It was a screening test and that was positive, but in order to make the diagnosis and confirm the diagnosis, further testing has to be done," Reiber said. Powassan virus is spread by the same deer ticks that transmit Lyme disease, and its symptoms are the same as those of West Nile virus infection.

However, Reiber does provide information on how to protect yourself. "Wear loose, bright clothing and use appropriate insect repellent," Reiber said. "That will help." For now, members of Poughkeepsie High School will have to deal with the loss of one of their own.

"It's just a tough thing," said Contes. "We should never lose any of our young ones."

[Poughkeepsie is a city located in the Hudson Valley in the south of the state of New York. It can be found on the map of New York state at http://www.newyorkstatesearch.com/maps/New_York_State_map.html. It is likely that the high school student died as a consequence of infection by a tick-transmitted virus. Previously in ProMED-mail there has been correspondence (see below) concerning the precise identification of tick-transmitted viruses present in the Hudson Valley and similar environments. An accurate identification of the virus responsible for this fatality is awaited. - Mod.CP
