Eighth West Nile virus victim in New York City confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: A Staten Island woman was diagnosed with West Nile virus
infection on 2 Sep 2000, becoming the eighth New York City resident to be
struck down this summer by the mosquito-borne virus. The 53-year-old woman
became ill 23 Aug 2000 and was hospitalized 5 days later with encephalitis.
The woman is improving but remains hospitalized. She is the seventh victim
from Staten Island. Two other victims of the disease, one in Brooklyn and
another from Staten Island, were also hospitalized with the virus. Word of
the latest victim came only one day after authorities confirmed that a
61-year-old Staten Island man was the seventh victim in New York. Last
year, the virus caused 62 human cases of encephalitis and 7 deaths.
The City had already announced plans for pesticide spraying over the
weekend in an effort to reduce the mosquito population and halt the spread
of the virus. The area around the United Nations, which hosts its
Millennium Summit next week, and Central Park were sprayed with the
pesticide Anvil early Saturday. Several parts of Queens, Brooklyn and
Staten Island were targeted for Labor Day weekend spraying, along with most
of Manhattan between 23rd Street and 110th Street from river to river.

[On 1 Sep 2000 test results confirmed that a Hudson County resident had
become New Jersey's first known victim of the virus. This unidentified man
went to the Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus in August
suffering from symptoms that included a 100-degree fever. The 43-year-old
has since been discharged from the hospital and was reported to be at home
recovering.This brings the total number of human cases in this year's
outbreak to 9; 8 in New York and one in New Jersey. The more recent 6 cases
are younger in age (43-64) than the initial 3 cases (78-87). -Mod.CP
