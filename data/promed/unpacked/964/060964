DHS news release 31 May 2005
Drinking water found to be likely Camp Yamhill disease source
---------------------
State and local public health officials have identified water contamination
as the likely source of last week's disease outbreak at Camp Yamhill in
Yamhill County, which sickened more than 50 people.
Mel Kohn, M.D., state epidemiologist in the Oregon Department of Human
Services (DHS), said the camp's water treatment system, which draws water
from the North Yamhill River, may have been overwhelmed by surface water
run-off caused by recent heavy rainfall.
Kohn said it appears that more than one bacterial contaminant was in the water.
"The laboratory has confirmed cases of both E.coli O157 and Campylobacter,
both of which cause diarrhea," Kohn said. "Those who were infected suffered
varying degrees of illness, but we are glad to say that most have recovered."
Kohn said that no food item was implicated and that the large number of
infections and the 2 different bacteria types makes food an unlikely culprit.
"The camp is planning to upgrade its drinking water treatment system," Kohn
said. "We are providing technical assistance to the camp to help evaluate
their water system and recommend improvement options.
"Meanwhile, the camp is actively working to correct the situation. They're
taking steps to obtain clean municipal water and will be able to reopen
this weekend," Kohn said.
Kohn said the camp director has arranged to bring in drinking water from an
approved outside source and will continue to do so until treatment
improvements are identified and completed.
The investigation, which began last week, involved DHS and 6 county health
departments--Clackamas, Lane, Marion, Multnomah, Polk and Yamhill.
Exposure to the bacteria was identified as having occurred between 17 and
20 May [2005]. Public health staff interviewed more than 90 students and
adults attending camp during that period.

Camp's fouled water likely source of illnesses
-----------------------------------------------
Contaminated water is the likely source of a disease outbreak at a Yamhill
County camp that sickened more than 50 people, including 7 people from Lane
County, public health officials said Tue 31 May 2005.
The camp's water treatment system, which draws water from the North Yamhill
River, may have been overwhelmed by surface water run-off caused by recent
heavy rainfall, said Dr. Mel Kohn, state epidemiologist.
Lab tests confirmed the water was contaminated not only with _E. coli_ O157
but also _Campylobacter_, both of which cause diarrhea. No food items have
been implicated.
Campers at the Christian outdoor school camp were exposed 17 to 20 May
2005, and included 6 students and an adult chaperone from Eugene Christian
School.
The camp is planning to upgrade its drinking water treatment system.

[The water supply appears to be implicated in the transmission of enteric
disease here. If this indeed is the case, one would think that enteric
illness should have occurred during more than a single period. The initial
posting suggested that only the 17-20 May 2005 group was affected. This
posting states that more than 50 individuals were sickened, but we do not
know how many had _E. coli_ O157, how many (if any) had campylobacteriosis,
whether any other pathogens were identified in victims and whether all were
from the initially implicated group. - Mod.LL]
