Syria has asked the United Nations to help it guard against bird flu and
plans to tighten surveillance along its border with Turkey, a UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation [FAO] official said today [21 Jan 2006]. Turkey,
which has reported the deaths of 4 children from the H5N1 virus this month,
today accused neighbours with "closed regimes" of covering up outbreaks of
the virus.
Juan Lubroth, senior FAO animal health officer, told Reuters he did not
consider Syria's request for assistance to be confirmation that the country
had a bird flu problem. "It means that they want to get prepared to maybe
diagnose it if it were to come in soon," Lubroth said. "We will be fielding
a team there with the WHO in the next week or so."
At the same time, Lubroth said the FAO had received unconfirmed reports
within the past week of poultry deaths in northern Syria. The FAO, which
regularly monitors rumours of bird deaths possibly linked to highly
pathogenic avian influenza, has asked for information from Syria regarding
the reports.
Syria has culled birds near its 300 mile [483 km] border with Turkey as a
precaution, but said the birds had showed no sign of illness. Damascus,
which has launched domestic awareness campaigns on bird flu and has
prepared medical teams to monitor and deal with the eventuality that it
spills over from Turkey, rarely asks foreign organisations for help.
Lubroth said Syrian authorities planned to tighten their surveillance
activities and would probably cull more birds. "They are going to increase
their surveillance and maybe do some depopulation, some culling along the
northern border with Turkey. That's what I have heard," Lubroth said.
Beyond technical assistance from the FAO, Syria has also requested
diagnostic technology, laboratory equipment and protective gear.

Iranian animal and health officials have reportedly taken various
precautions against the avian influenza, also known as the bird flu.
An Iranian animal health department official stationed at the Turkey
border, Dr Kamyar Dahim said 30 000 birds along a 10 km border and in
Western Azerbaijan have been killed so far and their goal is to raise the
number to 150 000 in one week.
The Bird Flu Control committee has been receiving phone calls from
villagers having fowls with the disease, and a significant drop in chicken
and egg sales has been reported in Iran.
