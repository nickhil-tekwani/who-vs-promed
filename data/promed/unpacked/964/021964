Samples from a goose cage taken from a Guangzhou market in south China's Guangdong Province have tested positive for H7N9 avian influenza.

Two goose cage samples and one sewage water sample from 2 poultry booths in a wet market in Zengcheng, a satellite city of Guangzhou, tested positive, the Guangdong Provincial Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) confirmed on Sunday [5 Jan 2014].

"It is serious that the water sample test is positive, because it means all the birds inside coops have the possibility of being infected with H7N9 avian influenza. The longer they stay in the coops, the risk of being infected rises," said Yang Zhicong, deputy chief of the Guangzhou municipal CDCP. The city government of Guangzhou, the provincial capital, is tracking the poultry source. The market was shut down on Saturday [4 Jan 2014] for 3 days so disinfection and cleaning can take place.

Meanwhile, 17 sales people working in 9 poultry booths in the market are undergoing a week-long medical observation. So far, they have shown no signs of being infected with the bird flu, said Yang.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally only infect birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.

Six human cases of H7N9 bird flu have been confirmed in Guangdong Province since August 2013. None are from Guangzhou.

"According to expert assessments, Guangdong faces an extremely high risk of sporadic human H7N9 infections in winter and next spring [2014]," said Zhang Yonghui, head of the provincial CDCP.

"The cases may occur at any time across the province, and the Pearl River Delta region requires special attention," Zhang said.

The province has urged local agricultural and forestry authorities to strengthen daily management, tests, and disinfection of live poultry markets and crack down on illegal wildlife trade.

[According to the correct FIC translation, the virus has been detected in goose cages and not, as erroneously translated, goose meat. Subscribers are referred to FIC's advisory, namely: "to follow the official Chinese news version as a reference." The original Chinese news item is to be found in the Chinese version of flu.org.cn (http://flu.org.cn/scn/default.html).

The detection of the A(H7N9) virus in goose cages in the wet market in Zengcheng (a satellite city of Guangzhou), should be regarded as environmental. The source of cage contamination could be sought in any infected animal, not necessarily geese.

On 4 Apr 2013, the Chinese Veterinary Authorities notified the occurrence of infection of pigeons and chickens with low pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H7N9) to the OIE. The said information remains unchanged, restricting confirmed animal infection to chickens and pigeons. - Mod.AS
