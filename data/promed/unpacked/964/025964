Owners "helpless" as horse sickness sweeps Midlands
---------------------------------------------------
The latest outbreak of African horse sickness in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands
has struck at Nottingham Road with such severity that the annual Clifton
Hunters Trial scheduled for this weekend has been cancelled.
The 1st horse fell ill on Monday [18 Apr 2005] and by yesterday just about
every owner in Nottingham Road had a sick horse. Vets are rushing around
farms treating horses, battling to save expensive "hot-bloods", some
costing as much as R50 000 [8216.52 USD], without success.
The sickness is caused by a virus transmitted by midges. A horse that is
bitten by a carrier midge develops a high fever and later pneumonia.
Sally Hurst, of the Natal Equine Physiotherapy Centre in Mooi River, said
horses were dying left, right and centre. "We do not know what to do," she
said. "It costs R8000 to vaccinate and treat a horse and there is no
guarantee that the horse will live. [1314.64 USD; does not this sound a bit
expensive for vaccination?! - Mod.AS]
"In the past 2 days, I know of 8 horses that have died. A leading breeder
in the area has lost 8 horses... work that out at R50 000 each. It is all
very scary. We have had meetings with the authorities at Onderstepoort and
they say that without funding they cannot improve on the vaccine."
Hurst said it should be pointed out to the government that the horse-racing
industry was worth around R800 million [131 436 030 USD] and that it should
invest in protecting the lives of valuable horses.
Most riding schools have cancelled lessons as instructors fear a horse
might collapse, which would be traumatic for children to see.
Top government veterinary officials are in Mooi River, Karkloof and Howick
trying to help people treat their horses and save their lives. According to
one vet, the 1st case of horse sickness was in January. More horses have
since been struck down and there have been deaths every day.
There have been no cases at the Shongweni Equine Hospital, however. An
official at the hospital said that the environment was strictly controlled.
"We have no problems with horse sickness here," the official said last
night. Another vet, who asked that his name be withheld for professional
reasons, said little could be done to save a horse that had African horse
sickness. Internal bleeding caused the animal severe agony.
Dave Mullins, of Mooi River and the immediate past chairman of the South
African Equine Practitioners' Association, was out battling to save the
life of a horse and could not be reached for comment.
