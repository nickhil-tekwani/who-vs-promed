Hog producers have stopped routinely vaccinating their animals for
erysipelas, once a common swine disease in Iowa, livestock health experts
said Monday. Last week, hogs at the Dallas and Greene county fairs were
diagnosed with erysipelas, a bacterial infection that can cause death and
severe production losses unless swine are vaccinated. "People either forget
about it, or they don't vaccinate because they haven't seen it for a long
time," said Dr. David Schmitt, assistant state veterinarian with the Iowa
Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.
Last week, more than 190 hogs from the Greene County Fair were sent to
slaughter several days earlier than planned because they were exposed to 4
hogs found to have the disease.
In Dallas County, Linda Nelson, county Extension education director, said
erysipelas was detected in one hog Friday afternoon after the live hog show
was held. About 60 hogs exposed to the disease will be held for 3 weeks on
the fairgrounds in Adel after being vaccinated for the disease.
Dr. Nolan Hartwig, Iowa State University Extension veterinarian, said
erysipelas is caused by a bacterium that can survive for a long time in
soil and manure, particularly when conditions are wet. "This is not that
unusual," said Hartwig. "Every so often, we'll get a run of it." Because
most Iowa hogs are raised inside confinement buildings on concrete floors,
the disease is less common than it once was, he said.
In Knoxville, where the Marion County Fair livestock shows began Monday,
the number of animals entered in the shows was about the same as a year
ago. Dale Miller, Marion County Extension director, said all livestock
exhibitors have to sign a health affidavit about their animals' care and
feeding practices. A veterinarian also examines the livestock. No diseases
were found this year, Miller said, probably because of heightened awareness
caused by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Europe this year and last
year's outbreak of pseudorabies in Iowa. "Parents, the livestock
superintendents at the fair, veterinarians and individuals in general all
are being more vigilant this year," Miller said.
Kathy Krafka Harkema, sheep superintendent at the Marion County Fair, said
the health affidavit ensures that fair officials know as much about the
animals being exhibited as possible. Young people who show their livestock
at county fairs put a lot of effort into their projects, Harkema said. "The
kids are always concerned about anything that's a contagious disease," she
said.
In Dallas County, Nelson said fair officials would consider requiring
vaccinations for erysipelas next year.

[Strange. When I was a vet student seeing practice in the '50s, this was
one of the commonest infectious diseases I saw in pigs. Easy to diagnose
from the skin lesions. Easy to prevent with vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
