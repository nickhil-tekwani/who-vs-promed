[In the last posting I had made a request for comment on the most recent
French cases being in Brittany and the France/Belgium border, knowing full
well that British exported feeds had gone into the Brittany area as well as
into Belgium & Holland. That sprat produced this interesting mackerel. May
we expect some informed French, Belgian, or German comment? - Mod.MHJ

You asked on ProMED-mail how the most recent cases of BSE in France relate
geographically to exports of British meat and bone meal (MBM) as livestock
feed. One might also ask how they relate in time, since you note that these
cases clearly had long incubation periods. They may well have had, but we
cannot conclude this based on the presumed absence of British MBM during
most of these cows' lives.
A French parliamentary enquiry into BSE published in January 1997 found
that up to 16,000 tonnes a year of British MBM were imported directly into
France before France banned it unilaterally in 1989. This gives an idea of
the scale of the demand. But more also came in via other EU countries. The
amount could not be calculated, as no customs records exist within the
free-trade area. Other EU countries imported British MBM until the EU as a
whole banned it in 1994. The enquiry found that British MBM entered France
via other EU countries, notably Belgium, between 1989 and 1994, generally
re-labelled as having originated elsewhere. British MBM continued to come
in even after 1994. In 1996, it was found entering France re-labelled as
having originated in Ireland. Interestingly, the two companies charged with
those imports were based in Brittany, home of one of the recent cases.
Nor must we postulate that these two cases, born in 1989 and 1991, must
have originated from British MBM. The probable existence of substantial
unreported (or indeed, subclinical) infection on the Continent, plus the
parlous state of hygiene in MBM plants as detailed in investigations by the
European Commission, makes it likely that at least some indigenous feed has
been infected [ab initio. It is legal to feed MBM to pigs and chickens in
the EU. French scientists suspect that at least some French cases of BSE
born after the feed ban were caused by pig or chicken fodder fed to cows.
There is no reason to think that one geographical area of France has
received more infected MBM than others. It just happens that the locales
where the most recent two were found are big livestock areas.
It should also be noted that if British MBM has been getting illegally into
France, and causing infection, then it has been getting into cows in other
EU countries as well -- though as I mentioned, it is probably not necessary
to postulate a British origin for contaminated MBM.
In view of all this, and of the continued discovery of BSE cases in
countries with good veterinary surveillance such as France, it remains
surprising that Germany continues to declare itself BSE free. Germany
succeeded in defeating the European Commission's bid last spring to impose
a British-style specified offal ban (in which nervous tissue and other
offal thought to be the chief repositories of BSE infectivity are removed
from cattle carcasses after slaughter) across the EU, on the grounds that
as Germany is BSE-free, it doesn't need one.
