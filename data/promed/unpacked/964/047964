OSTRICH ILLNESS - INDONESIA (WEST JAVA)

The government called on the public on Wednesday not to take seriously a
reported anthrax infection which has plagued an ostrich husbandry site in
the West Java regency of Purwakarta.
Director General of Contagious Diseases and Settlement Environmental
Sanitation Umar Fachmi told The Jakarta Post he found there was no need to
quarantine the settlement around the breed site, situated some 90
kilometers east of Jakarta. A local resident has been suffering from a
bleeding ulcer, which is known as a specific symptom of anthrax, after
reportedly eating ostrich meat.
Umar played down the fear, saying the virus [sic] had passed its incubation
period without giving any trace of spreading. He said the virus needs seven
days to breed in an animal or human body. "If the ostrich meat was eaten on
5 Jan 2000, then the virus should have shown its effects within a week. Now
the period is over, and no other locals have complained about the disease,"
he said. He added that the virus, although deadly, could be cured by
antibiotic medicines. "Early treatment could eliminate the disease although
the virus stays in your body," he said.
Following the report, the local administration isolated the 70-hectare
breed site and has given anti-anthrax vaccines to thousands of livestock in
the animal husbandries located nearby, including in Subang, Karawang and
Bekasi.
Some 3000 ostriches bred by residents of Ciparungsari village, also in
Purwakarta, have been diagnosed with the virus.
Hundreds of the animals were stolen by nearby residents, ignoring the local
administration's warnings.

[This is a confused report. While anthrax is known in ostriches, it is
infrequent. This report carries no information on avian incidence, deaths,
signs. The human "bleeding ulcer" is a red herring. If the locals were
stealing affected birds there would have been reports of cutaneous lesions
if any were butchered, and possibly even of enteric cases. It would be
appreciated if any of our Indonesian members can provide us with an
authoritative report on the true situation and what was recovered by the
laboratories. Personally I am unconvinced that this is/was anthrax, but what
might it be? Hopefully it is something mundane and not a new infection. - MHJ]
