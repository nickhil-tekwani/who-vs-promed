At least 83 people from Kiroone village in Imenti South were yesterday [18 Oct 2015] rushed to hospital after consuming meat from a cow suspected to have died of anthrax.

Ben Gituma, the officer in-charge of Kanyakine sub-county hospital where the victims were taken, said most of the patients, including 10 children, suffered from stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhoea and joint pains. He said the victims are suspected to have eaten uninspected meat from a cow that was slaughtered after being treated. The hospital is said to be overwhelmed, with the number of those affected expected to increase.

Virginia Karimi, a victim, said villagers bought the meat at a throwaway price from the cow's owner, who has since gone into hiding. She said a relative bought the meat at Sh300 [USD 3.00] a kilo, but they started vomiting immediately after eating it.

Igoji West Member of County Assembly Alpha Chabari expressed fears that more affected villagers could still be in their homes. He said ambulances had been deployed to take patients to hospital.

[South Imenti is an electoral constituency in Kenya. It is one of 9 constituencies of Meru County. Meru is to the immediate east of Nairobi in what was once the Eastern Province; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/kenya.gif.

Eastern Province, still listed in the OIE annual animal health reports, is regularly afflicted with bovine anthrax, essentially every year; in 2014, 4 outbreaks, 12 bovine cases); 2013 (3, 3); 2012 (1, 1); 2011 (2, 3), and so on, and those are just the reported bovine outbreaks. Sheep and goats are also reported, but less frequently. Unfortunately, livestock anthrax gets little attention from the Kenyan government.

Symptoms from gastrointestinal anthrax are usually not immediate as reported here. The vomiting is more likely from the meat being rotten and very acidic. According to CDC [http://www.cdc.gov/anthrax/basics/symptoms.html], the normal symptoms for gastrointinal anthrax are: fever and chills; swelling of neck or neck glands; sore throat; painful swallowing; hoarseness; nausea and vomiting, especially bloody vomiting; diarrhea or bloody diarrhea; headache; flushing (red face) and red eyes; stomach pain; fainting; swelling of abdomen (stomach). As the incubation period for anthrax is a function of exposure, the more rapid the onset, the more likely it is to be lethal. So far, no deaths have been reported. - Mod.MHJ
