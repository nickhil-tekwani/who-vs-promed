BSE Case Confirmed in Alberta
---------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the
diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a 13-year-old
beef cow from Alberta. The animal's carcass is under CFIA control,
and no part of it entered the human food or animal feed systems.

Canada has a suite of robust BSE control measures exceeding the
recommended international standards. This year [2007], the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE) categorized Canada as a
Controlled Risk country for BSE. This status acknowledges the
effectiveness of Canada's surveillance, risk mitigation and
eradication measures. This case will not affect Canada's risk status.

Canada has taken all necessary measures to achieve the eventual
elimination of BSE from the national cattle herd. The enhanced feed
ban, which came into effect on 12 Jul 2007, is designed to prevent
more than 99 percent of potential BSE infectivity from entering the
Canadian feed system. The feed ban prohibits cattle-derived materials
with potential to harbour BSE infectivity, such as the brain and
spinal cord, from being used in all animal feeds, pet foods and
fertilizers.

The CFIA expects to detect a small number of cases over the next 10
years as Canada progresses towards its goal of eliminating the
disease from the national cattle herd.

This detection confirms the ongoing high level of commitment and
stewardship on the part of Canadian cattle producers to food safety
and animal health. The Alberta animal was identified at the farm
level by the national surveillance program, which has detected all
BSE cases found in Canada. The program targets cattle most at risk
and has tested about 190 000 animals since 2003. The surveillance
results reflect an extremely low incidence of BSE in Canada.

The age of the infected animal falls within the age range of previous
cases detected in Canada under the national BSE surveillance program.
The animal was born before the implementation of Canada's feed ban in
1997.

An epidemiological investigation directed by international guidelines
is underway to identify the animal's herdmates at the time of birth
and the pathways by which it might have become infected. All findings
will be publicly released once the investigation concludes.

[The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's approach is in line with OIE
recommendations regarding a case of BSE. It is also consistent with
what is expected regarding the previous cases of BSE. It is fortunate
that the detection system is robust and the carcass was retained
prior to entering the food chain. - Mod.TG]
