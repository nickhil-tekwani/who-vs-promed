New case of mad cow disease in France
-------------------------------------
A 9 year old cow in eastern France has tested positive for mad cow disease,
the 6th case detected in the country this year [2006], officials have said.
The animal was tested after slaughter in September 2006. It had been raised
in Gresin, in the Savoie region.

The numbers of French cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have
been declining steadily, from a peak of 274 in 2001 to 31 last year [2005].

France has recorded a total of 15 cases of the human form of the disease,
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, since it first appeared in 1996.
