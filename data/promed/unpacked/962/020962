Translation of information received on 21 June 2002 from Dr Nancy Medina de
Lopez, Director of the Autonomous Service of Agricultural Health (SASA),
Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, Caracas:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 22 March 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: 16 March 2002.
Outbreaks:
-------------
Location: State of Zulia
No. of outbreaks in March 2002: 5
Description of affected population: 4 broiler farms and one layer farm.
Outbreaks:
------------
Location: State of Zulia
No. of new outbreaks in April 2002: 3
Description of affected population: one layer farm, one zoo barn owl (Tyto
alba) and fighting cocks were affected.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
-------------------------------------------
month: March /April
susceptible: 510 000 /250 250
cases: 263 668 /52 000
deaths: 65 000 /20 000
destroyed: 20 000 /0
slaughtered: 226 332 /198 250
Diagnosis:
-------------
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made: the first diagnosis was issued by
a private laboratory, with a positive result by histopathology, and the
second was issued by a laboratory in Georgia, United States of America, both
for viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease virus.
This result was confirmed by the Veterinary Research Institute(1), by means
of virus isolation and by determining the intracerebral pathogenicity index.
B. Diagnostic tests used: histopathological examination and virus isolation.
C. Causal agent: velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease virus.
Intracerebral pathogenicity index: 1.87.
Epidemiology:
---------------
Once official notification had been made, an inspection was immediately
carried out, which found clinical signs consistent with Newcastle disease in
sick animals and a high mortality rate. Sanitary control measures were
immediately imposed.
Most of the affected animal populations had been vaccinated, with the
vaccine being delivered in their drinking water.
The epidemiological investigation detected a very significant association
between the high mortality rate (90%) in fighting cocks and the finding that
the personnel and suppliers of the poultry farms were fighting-cock owners
and enthusiasts. This species has a high susceptibility due to poor sanitary
handling, since there are no censuses of fighting-cock breeders and centres.
Control measures:
---------------------
- Affected farms placed under quarantine, ban on moving cocks out of the
affected State, ban on visits of any kind to outbreak areas, ban on the
movement of bedding, incineration of dead birds, elimination of birds with
clinical signs, and cleaning, disinfection and flaming of the installations
following depopulation of the birds.
- Optimisation of biosafety conditions.
- Meetings with administrators and technical personnel of all farms in the
State to inform them of the health event and to adopt a disease control
plan, with special emphasis on epidemiological surveillance and stepping up
of vaccination.
- In the State of Zulia, fighting cocks were vaccinated and immunization was
stepped up in other poultry farms, with a population of 11 990 309 birds in
324 farms throughout the State.
- Sanitary measures were implemented in populations of fighting cocks, by
applying a nationwide vaccination programme. In addition, the census of cock
breeders and centres was brought forward.
Current situation in the State of Zulia: no new outbreaks of Newcastle
disease were reported in May or early June 2002 in the State of Zulia,
indicating that the health event is totally under control in this State.

(25), 105, of 21 June 2002, outbreaks of Newcastle disease were reported in
the State of Trujillo during the months of May and June 2002.

[Newcastle disease virus is categorized into 3 groups. The velogenic strains
are the most pathogenic and easily transmitted. Virus is shed during
incubation, during the clinical state, and for a varying but limited period
during convalescence. It is present in exhaled
air, respiratory discharges, feces, eggs laid during clinical disease, and
all parts of the carcass during acute infection and at death.
Newcastle Disease has not been reported in people who raise poultry or
consume poultry products. - Mod.TG/JW]
