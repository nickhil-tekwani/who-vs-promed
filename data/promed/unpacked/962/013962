I hate to sound picky here, but do the persons who could know have absolute
confirmation that the syndrome in the pigs in Taiwan IS the foot-and-mouth
syndrome caused by foot-and-mouth disease virus?
For 30+ years we attempted to eradicate "foot-and-mouth" syndrome among pigs
in the U.S., only to realize that the syndrome did not affect cows on the
same farms as the affected pigs and that the causative agent was vesicular
exanthema of swine virus, a calicivirus. Genetic and epidemiologic studies
have established a link between the pig isolates of those outbreaks and
isolates from marine sources are related (see for example J Zoo Wildl Med
1990;21:3 and Arch Virol 1996;141:2443).
I'd hate for all this effort and concern with the Taiwan pork to be
attributed to the wrong virus, with different epidemiologic implications.

[For those who don't know, the standard response of all countries is to
refer their isolates of "FMDV" to the relevant FAO FMD reference laboratory.
The FAO regional laboratory is in Bangkok, Thailand, and the world reference
laboratory is in Pirbright, UK. Through contacts I will check. I would be
surprised if the UK Government would supply FMD vaccine to Taiwan without
confirmation.
However, though I am sure that if I am wrong I will be rapidly corrected, I
belive that vesicular exanthema has not been seen in North American
livestock in many decades; the feeding of dead sea lions to pigs was
stopped, I think, in the early 1950s and with that outbreaks of VE in pigs.
But another disease - swine vesicular disease - can be confused clinically
with FMD and SVD originated in China. As with VE, SVD does not affect
cattle. And it is notable that in the press reports there have been no
accounts of cases in Taiwanese dairy farms and in sheep & goats. Information
is being sought from OIE. MHJ]

Pig disease 'part of mainland plot to launch chemical war'
TAIWAN is investigating if China spread foot-and-mouth disease in pigs to
prepare for a chemical war against the island, the "Independence Evening
Post" says.
"Chemical warfare troops and military intelligence have set up task forces
to probe how the epidemic entered Taiwan and if China is using it to test
the possibility of waging a bio-chemical war on Taiwan," the daily reported
on Monday. The epidemic has alerted the military, even though it cannot
prove it was spread by China to destabilise Taiwan."
On 2 March, the United Morning Post quoted military intelligence as saying
China had ordered 500 tonnes of sarin nerve gas from Ukraine, possibly to
prepare for a bio-chemical war against Taiwan. China has also reportedly
invited former East German chemical warfare commanders and experts to
evaluate the possibility of launching a bio-chemical war on the island.
Despite the Taiwanese claim, Beijing on Monday offered Taipei, through the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, a new type of vaccine
to fight FMD. In spite of the pressing need, Taiwan responded coolly to
rival China's offer yesterday to supply vaccines; the two sides have been
political rivals since a civil war split them in 1949. Farm-council
officials questioned the quality of communist China's vaccines and said that
the island had never issued permits to import them from the mainland.
Taiwan is importing eight million vaccines from Britain to vaccinate healthy
pigs and other susceptible stock. Millions of doses were being airlifted in
from Britain, France, the United States and other sources whose production
meets Taiwan's quality requirements.

Taiwan meat packers and officials held widely publicised festive pork
"eat-ins" yesterday in an islandwide campaign to ease public fears over an
epidemic, handing out free steaks, sweet-and-sour pork and a Chinese
favourite -- stewed pig trotters. The trotters were crucial after days of
graphic television news coverage of the mass slaughter of thousands of swine
with the tell-tale symptoms of foot-and-mouth disease -- infected hooves.
"Tasty, juicy, you really want to take a bite!" said the slogan under a
colour picture of a steaming trotter splashed across top newspapers' front
pages in advertisements bought by hard-hit meat packers and feed firms.
"When was the last time you savoured a delectable pork trotter?" said
another. Many Taiwan consumers have not touched pork since March 20, when
the Cabinet's Council of Agriculture confirmed that it had found FMD,
ordered a ban on exports, and initiated a massive slaughter and vaccination
programme. Much rides on the success of the massive trotter promotion, as
pork prices are 60 per cent or more below their pre-epidemic levels. Pork
trading resumed on Saturday at the island's major hog wholesale centres,
most of which suspended operations last Monday in a failed bid to bolster
prices. The shutdown gave meat packers time to launch the drive to restore
confidence.
As of late Friday [4th April], FMD had been detected on 1,008 of the
island's 25,000 farms, with officials projecting that 886,000 pigs would
have to be destroyed, although only 160,315 had been slaughtered to date.
The Consumers' Foundation said people should ask pork sellers for
certificates proving their meats were safe and should not fear eating
certified pork. Such certificates have been appearing in restaurant windows
and grocery meat departments across Taiwan.
