In the last 24 hours 11 persons have died of Japanese encephalitis
[JE; virus] and its water borne form at BRD Medical College Hospital
[in Gorakhpur] taking the total number of causalities due to the
diseases to 300 this year [2011]. 42 people have been admitted to the
hospital with symptoms of JE, which occurs at the onset of monsoon due
to mosquito bite, and water borne viral encephalitis which is due to
consumption of contaminated water, officials said. The dead included
children in the age group of 3-14 years. As many as 264 patients
belonging to Gorakhpur, Basti, and Devipatan divisions are undergoing
treatment at the hospital, they said. Officials claimed that JE cases
have come down to as low as 9 per cent of total encephalitis deaths.

[In this report, unlike the most recent ones, both JE virus and an
unidentified water-borne pathogen are indicated as responsible for
these encephalitis cases. These cases of undiagnosed etiology are
often referred to as acute encephalitis. It is unfortunate that the
etiology of these cases, presumably one or more enteroviruses, has not
been determined after several years of occurrences.

Even as the health directorate struggles to control the rising number
of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Uttar Pradesh (UP),
the state government is planning to procure 4 special ventilators for
the neo-natal unit of Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College,
Gorakhpur, under National Rural Health Mission. The ventilators will
be specifically used to cater to AES-affected children with body
weight below 5 kg [11 lb].

Cases of AES have been increasing in the state. According to the
latest figures from the Health Directorate, as many as 1864 cases have
been reported from Uttar Pradesh so far, with 262 deaths. With 221
cases reported from Bihar and 6 others from Nepal, the total number of
AES cases this year [2011] has reached 2091, while deaths have crossed
300.

Of the total cases in UP, 126 cases and 12 deaths are due to Japanese
encephalitis [virus infections]. However, said Dr KP Kushwaha, head of
the pediatric department of BRD Medical College, the number of JE
cases this year are low compared to last year [2010], when around 12
per cent of the total AES cases were of JE. "This year till now, the
JE cases are merely 6 to 7 per cent of the total AES cases," he said.
