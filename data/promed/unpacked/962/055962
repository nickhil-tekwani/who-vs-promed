Bird flu continues to ravage Tripura; new cases of outbreak reported
--------------------------------------------------------------------
New cases of bird flu outbreak continue to ravage Tripura, sending
the officials into deep funk. About 400 birds died of avian influenza
last week [28 Feb - 4 Mar 2011] at Gandhinagar poultry farm. This
outbreak and die-off comes close on the heels of the outbreak in
R.K.Nagar poultry farm last month. Massive culling operations are
expected to start on Monday [14 Mar 2011] in Gandhigram government-run
poultry farm. After High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) at
Bhopal confirmed the bird flu virus among the birds at the poultry
farm, plans are afoot to put more than 11 000 birds to death and 200
000 eggs to destruction.

The culling operations take place in Bridinagar gram panchayat areas
which are near to the R.K.Nagar farm where hundreds of birds died of
bird flu last month. Even after the mass culling operation, the bird
flu virus continues to infect birds in other areas.

"At least 400 poultry birds have died since 1 March 2011 at the
Gandhi Gram government poultry farm. Central government experts tested
the samples of the dead birds and found them positive for the H5
strain of avian influenza," said Jyotirmoy Chakraborty, Joint
Director, Tripura animal resource development department. The
Gandhinagar poultry farm lies smack in the middle of several villages,
and poses a major worry to people.

At this Birdinagar farm which is 7.5 km [4.66 miles] away from
Agartala, 1160 birds were reported to have been culled on Saturday [6
Mar 2011]. "Culling has already begun and we are taking no chance.
Birds would be culled and eggs would be destroyed according to
prescribed guidelines," said Dr Deepanshu Choudhury, assistant
director of the animal husbandry department. The officials say a
strict surveillance would be maintained over 10-km [6.2-mile] radius
of the affected farms. At least 2100 hens, 7068 chicks, and 1400
Japanese Koel would be culled, the official said.

At least 16 rapid response teams have been constituted to undertake
culling operations in surrounding 12 to 15 villages.

The state officials say that the Union Ministry has instructed them
to take immediate steps to [prevent] the infection from spreading to
the other areas.

The regulations call for immediate ban on the sale of poultry and
poultry products, shutting down of poultry, egg markets and shops
within the radius of 10 km of the affected farm.

All these measures were undertaken during the outbreak last month.
Experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute are also assisting
the state officials. More than 200 000 birds were culled in April-May
2008 bird flu outbreak. As officials go about increasing the
surveillance within the 10 km radius of affected farms, the major
worry is that the state might look like a massive Venn diagram with
intersecting circles.
