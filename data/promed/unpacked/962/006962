Iris Yellow Spot Virus in onions: a new tospovirus record from India

Accepted for publication 11 Apr 2005

In the Jalna and Nasik regions of Maharashtra during 2002-03, plants of
field-infected onion (_Allium cepa_) exhibited characteristic symptoms of
chlorotic spindle or diamond-shaped lesions on leaves and scapes, with
twisting or bending flower-bearing stalks. In the advanced stages, single
spindle-shaped chlorotic lesions coalesced, leading to withering of leaves
and flower-bearing stalks.
The disease was transmitted to a number of virus indicator plants by
mechanical inoculation using phosphate buffer (0.01 M sodium sulfate, pH
7.0, containing 0.1 percent sodium sulfite). Inoculated _Nicotiana
benthamiana_ produced systemic necrotic lesions, eventually resulting in die-
back and wilting of plants, while _N. tabacum_ (varieties 'Xanthi
NC', 'White Burley', 'Samsun' and 'GT-4') and _N. clevelandii_ produced
local chlorotic ring spots, 3 to 6 days after inoculation. In _Vigna
unguiculata_ necrotic local lesions developed 3-4 days post inoculation. _N.
rustica_ failed to produce any symptoms and were not infected.
Field-infected onion samples and greenhouse-inoculated plants were tested by
ELISA, using the following antisera: Tobacco streak virus (DSMZ AS-0615),
Watermelon silver mottle virus (DSMZ AS-0118), Iris Yellow Spot Virus (DSMZ
AS-0528), Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (DSMZ AS-0105), Impatiens Necrotic Spot
Virus (DSMZ AS-0115), Chrysanthemum Stem Necrosis Virus (DSMZ AS-0529),
Peanut Bud Necrosis Virus (ICRISAT) and Potato Virus Y (DSMZ AS-0573);
utilizing the respective positive control samples.
Field-infected onion samples and the respective mechanically inoculated
tobacco plants reacted strongly with IYSV antisera, but failed to react with
any of the other antisera tested. RT-PCR using primers designed to the
capsid gene and flanking sequences of IYSV (GenBank Acc. No. AF001387)
produced the expected 925-bp amplicon from infected but not healthy onions.
Results of symptomatology, host range, ELISA and RT-PCR indicate that the
causal virus is a strain of Iris Yellow Spot Virus, a new report from an
important onion growing region of Maharashtra.
IYSV has been reported as a potentially devastating pathogen of onion in
Europe (Cortes et al. 1998), Israel (Gera et al. 1998) and the United States
(Gent et al. 2004).

[IYSV, a tospovirus, is difficult to readily identify. Research results to
date have shown: i) disease incidence varies among varieties; ii) IYSV may
be associated with plant stress (i.e. moisture, temperature extremes,
salinity, soil compaction, pink root, etc. ); iii) in more susceptible
varieties, IYSV incidence is initially higher along field edges and lower in
the center of the field (similar to the pattern of onion thrips). This
pattern of thrips distribution occurs when they immigrate from surrounding
vegetation, but their distribution may become more uniform in the field as
the season progresses. Entomologists at Cornell University are studying the
ecology of onion thrips and their movement patterns within and between
fields; and iv) IYSV incidence decreases as plant population increases,
possibly because onion thrips are challenged to locate a single plant when
plant populations are high. In a IYSV pesticide trial, it was found that
Actigard + imidacloprid resulted in a 34-38 percent yield increase of the
jumbo class. A complete integrated approach will be necessary for successful
IYSV and thrips management. - Mod.DH
