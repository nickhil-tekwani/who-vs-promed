I'd like to raise awareness by posting a case of leptospirosis in
Upper Austria which obviously is related to the recent flooding after
heavy rainfall in this region and shows the classical combination of
"injury - water contact - likelihood of contamination with urine of
rodents".
The patient is a 76-year-old man who hurt himself recently while
having contact with masses of water during the flood after heavy
rainfalls in the southern suburbs of Linz, Upper Austria. Within a
short period his condition deteriorated and turned into a multiorgan
failure. The diagnosis was done on a serological basis. He received
doxycycline for 7 days.
He was treated on an intensive care unit in a hospital in Linz,
needed hemofiltration, auxiliary ventilation, and although his liver
function shows slight signs of improvement, is still seriously ill.

[This case posting may represent one of many cases of leptospirosis
that may have occurred in the wake of the massive flooding in parts
of Europe. Many cases of leptospirosis are sporadic, often related
to exposure to animals or contaminated soil or water. Outbreaks,
however, may occur in conjunction with flooding, tropical storms, or
hurricanes, which can increase the exposure of humans to
leptospirosis-contaminated water (for example - Sanders EJ,
Rigau-Perez JG, Smits HL, et al: Increase in leptospirosis in
dengue-negative patients after a hurricane in Puerto Rico in 1996. Am
J Trop Med Hyg 1999; 61:399-404.) and as seen in the posting from
India Leptospirosis - India (Kerala) 20020918.5344. - Mod.LL]
