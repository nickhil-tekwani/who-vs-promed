Mary's Home Canning of Lancaster, PA is recalling 516 jars of Mary's Homemade Vegetable Soup (net wt 16 oz) and 1128 jars of Mary's Homemade Vegetable Soup (net wt 32 oz), because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Mary's Homemade Vegetable Soup (net wt 16 oz) and (net wt 32 oz) was distributed in PA, MD and DE in retail stores and farmer's markets.

These products were packaged in clear glass jars with white screw top lids in pint-size and quart-size varieties. The label of the jar reads in part: "Mary's Home Made Vegetable Soup...Heat and Serve...829-A Strasburg Road, Paradise, PA 17562." No codes or expiration dates are present on these products.

No illnesses have been reported to date.

The potential for contamination was noted after FDA testing found that the pH of the product was high, and it did not receive an adequate process time or temperature.

Anyone with a product fitting the above description should return the product to where it was purchased, if possible, or call Mary's Home Canning at 717-442-8349 for a refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.
