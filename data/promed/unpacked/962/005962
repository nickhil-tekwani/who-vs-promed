> The proponents of the disease hypothesis ... propose to test it by
examining fossils for sequences of the genomes of the pathogens mentioned.
But since the test depends on primers from exisiting disease agents, if the
pathogens responsible for the extinctions have also died out it will be
impossible to get results.

Difficult yes but not impossible. They could try something like the
representational difference analysis (RDA) proposed by Lisitsyn et al.
(Science 259:946, 1993) using as normal genome a library from earlier fossil
remains of the same species. This kind of technology has already been
successfully applied to the discovery of new viruses (i.e., KSHV) (Science
266: 1865, 1994).

Simon Elliott's comments on the multifarious sources of environmental stress
that could have led to the extinction of prehistoric species is consistent
with synecology.
Just to add another dimension to the disease theory, a parasite or pathogen
will not kill its host if it were to survive indefinitely. This relationship
is seen in chronic helminthic infections or in slow, persistent viral
infections. Fatal opportunistic infections in man, for instance, represent
the case of an "old parasite" in a "new host", eg, toxoplasmosis in AIDS or
human intestinal capillariasis. Evidently, HIV overdid itself in attacking a
strategic component of host resistance while annihilating its prospective
host. (It should have known better as those prehistoric "viroids" or whatever).
