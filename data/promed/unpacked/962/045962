The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) has confirmed the state's 2nd case of Powassan virus infection in 2021. Laboratory tests confirmed the case in a Knox County resident who likely became infected in Maine during June [2021].

Maine CDC confirmed the 1st case of Powassan virus in 2021 in late June, in a Waldo County resident who is recovering after spending time in the hospital.

Cases of Powassan are rare in the United States, with about 25 cases reported each year since 2015. Maine has identified 10 cases since 2010. Humans become infected with Powassan through the bite of an infected deer tick [blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_] or woodchuck tick [_I. cookei_ and also _I. marxi_, the squirrel tick].

Symptoms may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Serious neurologic problems may occur, including infection of the brain or the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Severe infection may result in death.

Maine CDC urges residents and visitors to take precautions against bites from ticks. Deer ticks can also carry bacteria that cause Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and other illnesses.

Many people infected with the viruses carried by ticks do not have symptoms. No specific treatment is available for these viral diseases. If you experience symptoms, call a health care provider as soon as you can.

The best protection against all tick-borne diseases is to prevent bites. Prevent tick bites by:
- Wearing protective clothing, including long sleeves and pants.
- Using an EPA-approved repellent on the skin, and permethrin on clothing for added protection.
- Using caution in tick-infested areas. Avoid wooded and bushy areas with high grass and stay in the middle of trails whenever possible.
- Performing daily tick checks, especially after leaving tick habitat and after returning home.
- Bathing or showering after coming inside. Also examine clothing, gear, and pets.

Asking a veterinarian about tick bite prevention for pets.

Tick transmission of Powassan virus [POWV] to humans is active again in Maine. As noted in earlier posts, humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada.

There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and black-legged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 8 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

Residents and visitors in Maine and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well-advised to heed CDC advice to avoid tick bites (see https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/avoid/on_people.html). The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
