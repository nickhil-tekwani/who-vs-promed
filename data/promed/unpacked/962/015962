California is in the middle of a whooping cough epidemic, the worst the state has seen in 70 years. The outbreak's latest fatality was a 25-day-old baby in Santa Barbara County. It's the county's 1st recorded death from the disease -- also called pertussis -- and only the 2nd death in California since the outbreak started last year [2014].

Doctor Charity Thoman is with the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department and says deaths from the disease are preventable because there is a vaccine. She hopes in the wake of this tragic death that people will work to keep the disease from taking any more victims. "I hope they use this information to make sure that they have their booster shot, to make sure that all their kids are up to date on their booster shots, and importantly for infants, to make sure that anyone coming into contact with an infant -- favorite uncle, baby sitter, nursery provider -- they all have their booster shots against pertussis," said Thoman.

San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties are not yet seeing record numbers, but total cases for this current outbreak far exceed those reported over the past few years.

[2013 was the US's worst year for pertussis (whooping cough) in 6 decades, with more than 48 000 cases, including 18 deaths. In 2014, the number of reported cases nationwide dropped to about 20 000. However, as of 15 Dec 2014, the number of pertussis cases reported in California in 2014 (9935) was the highest number in 70 years. San Diego County is among the hardest hit. The cases included an infant who died (ProMED-mail post Pertussis - USA (29) 20141222.3044440).

Although in some regions low immunization rates account for pertussis outbreaks, the California Department of Public Health said that low inoculation rates could not account for the current pertussis outbreak in the state, because 90 per cent of those children infected in 2014 had been vaccinated against pertussis; increased virulence and a mismatch between the vaccine strain and the current circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, attributed to genetic changes, as well as a waning immune response after vaccination may be other causes of the current outbreaks.

In the US, DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccines.
