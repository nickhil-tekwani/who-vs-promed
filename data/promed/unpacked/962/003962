Mato Grosso this year [2009] recorded 139 cases of serious dengue
[disease]. Of this total, 55 were confirmed, 84 are under
investigation, 133 are recovered, and 6 cases resulted in death. The
data of the 4th week of March [2009] were disclosed this Wednesday
[25 Mar 2009] by the State Secretariat of Health and announced in the
Dengue Epidemiological Bulletin. Despite the fall in number of
notifications, the alert for occurrence of cases of serious disease,
which have increased in recent months, continues.

There are 3928 reports of dengue fever for January-24 March [2009].
Compared with the same period of 2008 (5563 notifications), the
decline is 29 percent. According to Epidemiological Monitoring, all
141 municipalities in the state are directed to implement the actions
recommended by the state dengue contingency plan regarding reporting,
pesticide control, training and social mobilization.

In the state capital Cuiaba, the figures for cases of severe dengue
are as follows: 50 cases reported, 35 under investigation, 15
verified [cases], 48 progressed to recovery and 2 resulting in death.

In Ariquemes in the 1st 2 months of this year [2009], 284 suspected
dengue disease cases were registered. In the 1st 6 weeks of the year,
1305 cases were recorded in Rondonia. The city also installed a
clinic for the treatment of patients with dengue. This measure
reduces the hospital capacity in the city.

Dengue in Bahia has reached alarming proportions. On average, there
are 2400 reports [of dengue cases] per week and one death every 3
days. Centers for hydration to attend to patients are already
operating in the capital and in the state. But the threat remains
[for dengue virus transmission] in the streets, with trash scattered
by those who have not yet become aware of the danger of dengue.

In the city of Itabuna, which has the largest number of confirmed
deaths, the hydration posts are working in hospitals since Saturday
[21 Mar 2009], with the help of military physicians. In the Bahia
capital, the 2 centers of hydration for the state will be initiated
tomorrow [25 Mar 2009]. The municipality's [hydration centers] are
already working.

According to the report released today [24 Mar 2009] by the State
Secretariat of Health, 26 597 cases of dengue were reported in Bahia
up to the 2nd week of March [2009], an increase of 291 percent over
the same period last year [2008]. 28 persons died due to this disease.

Chaco's government confirmed that there were 784 confirmed cases of
dengue in the province, while neighbors and the municipal authorities
of Charat called for aerial spraying in the area, after expired
insecticides had been used. The number of cases was confirmed by the
Minister of Health of the province, Sandra Mendoza. "On 14 Jan
[2009], a health alert was declared, and starting on that date, a
continuing intensified campaign is monitoring indices of [_Aedes
aegypti_ vector mosquito] infestation in different locations in the
interior province," said the official, who also said that there are
34 cities affected by the disease.

Mendoza said that dengue in Chaco "is not an epidemic, but an
outbreak, which is controlled because work started on prevention
before suspected [dengue] cases appeared." [But] The mayor of the city
said: "This outbreak has already become an epidemic, with more than
6000 suspected dengue cases in just Charat,
that began more than 45 days ago."

[In the 28 Mar 2009 edition of Univision (in Spanish)
<http://www.univision.com/contentroot/wirefeeds/salud/7916450.html>,
the Minister of Health on Thursday (26 Mar 2009) confirmed the
existence of a dengue outbreak in the northern part of the country,
indicating that there are 2200 confirmed cases of dengue in the
country, of which 1200 are in the province of Chaco, about 1000 km
north of Buenos Aires. However, the mayor of the town of Chaco
Charat, Miguel Weaver, told the newspaper Clarin that the number of
dengue patients in the province totaled 6000.

The 24 Mar 2009 edition of El Diario Argentino.com (in Spanish)
<http://www.eldiarioargentino.com/salud-nota.php?idx=5974>
said that Hugo Fernandez, director of Disease Prevention in the Health
Ministry, recognized the existence of more than 980 cases in Chaco and
felt that this is an "outbreak." The official also noted that the peak
intensity of the disease occurs in Argentina in April. However, the
mayor of Charat, Miguel Weaver, argued that, in this population of
western Chaco, "there are about 100 patients per day or more," in a
conversation with this agency. He added, "This is not 5, 10 or 20
cases; this is an epidemic."

This raises the question as to when an "outbreak" becomes an
"epidemic." In any event, in this part of Chaco, the number of cases
appears to be increasing, even if the above figures are conflicting,
and one hopes that provincial and national health agencies are
successful in bringing down the numbers of new cases and providing
timely and effective treatment of cases to avoid fatalities.

Paraguay has recorded 630 cases of dengue this year [2009]. According
to the Minister of Public Health, Esperanza Martinez, since January
2009, there were 630 confirmed cases of dengue in Paraguay, and 700
more people may have contracted the disease.

Ivan Allende, Director of Health Surveillance, explained that
Paraguay is suffering "an epidemic of dengue of low intensity, but
must avoid further spread. The people need to eliminate the water
where the mosquito is breeding."

More than 2200 people have been affected by dengue fever in Ho Chi
Minh City since early this year [2009], an increase of 8 percent over
the same period last year. The Municipal Health Department reports
that as many as 90 percent of households in such districts as Binh
Thanh, 12, and 6 were found to have mosquitoes.

The Preventive Medicine Department under the Health Ministry held a
meeting on 27 Mar [2009] to launch a national project to prevent a
possible dengue fever epidemic, especially in southern provinces
during the monsoon season.

The project, worth more than VND 91 billion [USD 5.1 million] is
expected to reduce the infection and fatality rates by 10 percent
from the average level of the 2003-2007 period.

The West Java administration has declared all its municipalities and
regencies under threat from dengue fever, after local authorities
recorded more than 6000 cases of the disease, 47 of them fatal, as of
March this year [2009].

Wahyu Saputra, head of the provincial health agency's disease control
section, told The Jakarta Post on Friday [20 Mar 2009] that of the
affected areas, Depok had recorded the most cases (637), followed by
Sumedang, Garut, Subang and Purwakarta districts with more than 300
infections each.

But he added the figures were slightly down from those in the same
period last year [2008], when more than 6800 cases were recorded, 65
of them fatal.

"To prevent the figures from rising, we are focusing on campaigning
for a healthy environment. We're also providing information on
symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease to prevent more fatalities,"
Wahyu said.

An end to Australia's worst dengue fever outbreak may be in sight, as
the rate of infection slows in far north Queensland.

The number of infections has slowed to fewer than 10 a day, down from
a peak of about 20 a day in the Cairns area, the epicentre of the
outbreak.

However, health authorities have warned residents throughout the
north to remain on guard, because fresh rainfall and complacency
could see the epidemic spiral out of control.

"We've had some encouraging signs in the last few weeks that the
number of cases has declined, (but) we've still got a long way to go
even if that is sustained," Queensland Health Physician Dr Frank
Beard said.

"We're still getting a significant number of cases, and it's likely
to be several months before we can be confident of getting rid of it."

Authorities are hoping the onset of the dry season in the coming
months will give them a better opportunity to cull the population of
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which spreads the disease.

If the disease is not eradicated during the dry months, there's a
significant risk it could become endemic to the region.

"We are actually trying to ramp up our response to make sure we nail
this outbreak," Dr Beard said.

So far, some 860 people have contracted dengue fever, with the vast
majority of cases occurring in the Cairns area. Townsville has also
been affected but to a much lesser degree.
