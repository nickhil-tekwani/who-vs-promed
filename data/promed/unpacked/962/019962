A [Rift Valley] fever epidemic has killed 16 people and infected at
least 100 others in the central region of Tanzania, David Mwakyusa,
Minister of Health, stated on Tuesday [20 Mar 2007].
Rift Valley fever (RVF), as it is popularly known in Tanzania, is a
mosquito-borne disease spread from infected livestock to humans.
Mwakyusa said the disease also claimed about 154 lives in less than 3
months on the border region of Kenya. At least 41 people are still
receiving treatment in hospitals in Tanzania after showing symptoms of RVF.
"The disease was first reported in Arusha and has not [now?] spread
to Dodoma where we are recording many new cases," Mwakyusa said,
according to BBC News.
Veterinary officials in Kenya said the ongoing domestic animal
vaccination campaign could be the cause of the rampant spread of RVF.
The RVF virus is transferred to humans from livestock through the
_Aedes_ mosquito, a species originally found in tropical and
subtropical zones. Symptoms include liver failure and bleeding from
the nose and mouth.

[A previous report from Tanzania on 14 Mar 2007, recorded 10 deaths
from RVF in the Dodoma region, although it was unclear whether these
were local cases or whether the disease had been contracted
elsewhere. This new report recording 16 deaths and 100 cases confirms
that RVF has spread from the border region with Kenya (around Arusha)
towards the central region of Tanzania.
