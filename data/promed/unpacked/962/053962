Unlike the past 2 years, when vaccines were not procured due to lack of funds, veterinarians are ending vaccination against brucellosis this year [2022]; the number of euthanized animals in Central Bosnia (canton/subregion) has exceeded 120.

The number of sick people is also increasing. Unfortunately, few people want to talk publicly about this serious infectious disease because animal husbandry brings disease and money. However, the disease does not choose, so veterinarians and those who consume unboiled milk products also get sick.

[MM], an 18 year old from the settlement MehuriÄ‡i, is one of dozens of residents of this canton who arrived at the hospital for brucellosis with a moderate or severe clinical picture, and who agreed to talk about his illness. Along with high body temperature, sweating, and loss of appetite and body weight, there are also a number of other symptoms. "I've been here for 14 days because of brucellosis. My joints, shoulders, knees hurt, I couldn't walk properly," he tells us.

"Most patients come in a bad condition, in wheelchairs, on crutches with already developed complications of spinal disease," points out infectious disease specialist Dr Minela Zekiri-Sivro.

Along with veterinarians, for whom this is a occupational disease, brucellosis is the commonest disease for livestock farmers, who, even at the cost of their own health, hide the disease because it makes it difficult for them to sell cheese and livestock.

However, the fact that brucellosis is on the rise is also confirmed by the data of the competent cantonal ministry on 126 euthanized sheep, cows and goats and 23 dogs. The fact that the owners of two-thirds of the euthanized animals did not implement the measures prescribed by law to prevent the disease, from which more and more people fall ill, is worrying, which is why they were not even entitled to compensation for damages.

"We are an endemic hotspot for brucella -- the epicenter of brucellosis and Q fever [QF], given that we are such a region. According to the hospital data, we have had 54 patients since the beginning of the year [2022]," says Zekiri-Sivro.

As the livestock farmers, who did not want to be on camera, told us, the biggest problem is uncontrolled traffic or, simply, livestock smuggling. Silence about animal diseases, most often in nomadic animals, also leads to soil contamination, due to which the consequences for the health of a large number of people are unfathomable.

"The solution is difficult in our conditions, the state must seriously deal with this problem. We have more and more disabled people whose situation results from brucella and QF infection," emphasized Zekiri-Sivro.

Perhaps for a start, the state agencies just strengthen their control upon the implementation of their own laws, which have clearly defined the rules. In addition to preserving health, this would also save money, since the treatment of patients with this infectious disease lasts up to 6 months. The most tragic aspect is that brucellosis is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, it only heals itself.

[Brucellosis in small ruminants, and to a lesser extent in cattle, is endemic to Bosnia & Herzegovina (B&H). Sheep and goat populations are managed under an extensive production system, while smallholder farming and herding multiple livestock species together are common practice. These risk factors, along with close and repeated contact and the relative weakness of disease control measures, enhanced the opportunity for the transmission of brucella over several decades.

Since the end of the Bosnian war (1992-1995), an increasing number of cases of brucellosis have been reported in animals and humans. Implementation of measures for brucellosis control in animals, which are the reservoir for human infection, started in 2001, based on test-and-slaughter strategy. In 2009, this strategy was replaced by a mass sheep and goat vaccination program. From 2010 onwards, eradication programs based on the vaccination of young sheep and goats (3-6 months old) and test-and-slaughter in adults have been applied. The diagnostic testing relied exclusively on serological methods, namely, Rose Bengal test (RBT) used for screening of flocks and individual animals, while the complement fixation test (CFT) serving as confirmation test. The bacterial isolation and molecular detection of brucella are not included in the control program of ruminant brucellosis in B&H (for the above and additional information, see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2022.101821).

The above report includes a description of a recent brucellosis event involving a relatively large number of infections in human patients in Bosnia, with a detailed and candid description of the signs experienced by one of the patients. It demonstrates the difficulties that public and animal health authorities encounter during their efforts to achieve control and eventual eradication of brucellosis, from animals and subsequently from humans. A One Health approach, including close cooperation between the 2 agencies, is essential when dealing with this serious zoonosis. - Mod.AS
