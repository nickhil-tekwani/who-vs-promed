A highly contagious virus affecting cattle and horses has put area producers on alert. Vesicular stomatitis, or VSV, has been found in Texas, Colorado, and New Mexico. According to the Texas Animal Health Commission, the closest case of VSV has been reported in the Abilene area, one county away from the Amarillo reporting region.

VSV is of concern due to the similarities with foot-and-mouth disease which can be transferred by the biting midge, sandflies, or the black fly. There is no vaccine available for VSV. "Biting midges are common throughout the country," said West Texas A&M University Vero Director Dr Paul Morley. "Small biting flies you will see in particular."

The virus will run its course in about 5 to 7 days.

[2] Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) news release

Since the last vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) update on Fri 12 Jul 2019, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has received reports of 11 new confirmed cases of VSV.

Texas VSV confirmations since [12 Jul 2019]:
3 new VSV-infected equine premises have been confirmed in Bastrop County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Hays County
- 3 new VSV-infected equine premises have been confirmed in Hood County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Johnson County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Shackelford County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Tom Green County
- 1 new VSV-infected equine premises has been confirmed in Wichita County

The newly confirmed premises are under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses will be monitored by regulatory and authorized veterinarians until premises are eligible for quarantine release 14 days after clinical VSV signs are observed.

To date, 20 premises in 12 Texas counties have confirmed cases of VSV. Of the 20 premises, 2 have been released. Currently affected counties are: Bastrop, Coleman, Hays, Hood, Johnson, Shackelford, Taylor, Tom Green, Val Verde and Wichita counties.

TAHC will send out VSV updates every Friday and all cases will be reported to the Equine Disease Communication Center.

What veterinarians need to know:
- Several states are imposing enhanced entry requirements on Texas livestock due to the VSV cases. For information, contact the state of destination. For a list of state animal health offices visit:

- If you suspect your client's horse has VSV, contact your TAHC Region Office for paperwork and procedures.

What equine and cattle owners need to know:
- VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle.
- In the past decade, the Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of VSV outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways.
- VSV normally has an incubation period of -8 days before the infected animal develops blisters that swell and burst, leaving painful sores. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects.
- If VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent the movement of animals and the spread of the disease to other premises, fairs or markets.

Strategies for preventing VSV
Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd. However, these tips may help protect livestock:
- Control biting flies
- Keep equine animals stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies
- Keep stalls clean
- Feed and water stock from their individual buckets
- Don't visit a ranch that's under quarantine for VSV. Wait until the animals have healed

[As a reminder, if you are traveling, consult your veterinarian who may contact the state of destination to see whether their import requirements have changed due to VSV now being found in the United States. Many states are requiring additional statements being added to the export certificate of veterinary inspection (CVI or ICVI), and some states are requiring permit numbers.

VS can infect horses and cattle but clinically it might be confused with foot-and-mouth disease in cattle. As FMD is a major hazard with significant international implications accurate and rapid diagnosis is important. FMD only occurs in ruminants, not horses, a valuable differentiation. - Mod.MHJ
