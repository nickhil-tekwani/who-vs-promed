The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit [WECHU] has detected the eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus in a mosquito pool in the community.

The EEE virus has been linked to a number of reported cases of illness and death in southwest Michigan, but there have been no human cases in Windsor-Essex.

"Despite the recent cooler temperature in the region, it might not be cold enough to eliminate the risk posed by mosquitoes. This is a good reminder for everyone to continue to protect themselves against mosquitoes by removing any standing water and to take personal protective measures to avoid mosquito bites," said Dr Ahmed, medical officer of health at the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.

According to the health unit, serious health effects caused by EEE are rare. Only 4-5 percent of infected people develop symptoms and less than one percent develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis.

Still, the health unit recommends anyone who spends time outdoors to use insect repellent, cover as much exposed skin as possible, and wear light coloured clothing to avoid mosquito bites.

The WECHU will continue to monitor for EEE activity and distribute educational materials in the area where the positive mosquito pool was identified.

[EEE virus continues to circulate in Ontario currently, in this instance in mosquitoes collected in Windsor, Essex County. The species of mosquitoes in which the virus was detected is not mentioned.

An earlier equine case occurred in Ontario on 10 Aug 2019. The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of a confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse located in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. The unvaccinated mare was euthanized following the sudden onset and progression of neurological signs. Laboratory diagnostic testing confirmed infection with the EEE virus (see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (09): Canada (ON), USA (LA,NY) horse 20190821.6633946).

Windsor, Ontario is immediately across the Detroit River from the City of Detroit, Michigan, a state that has had both horse and human EEE cases this year (2019).

There have been sporadic EEE cases in horses in Ontario in recent years. It would be prudent for horse owners in Ontario to vaccinate their animals. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites are the only preventive measures that individuals in affected areas can take to avoid EEE virus infection. - Mod.TY
