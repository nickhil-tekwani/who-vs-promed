An anthrax outbreak has hit south Kyrgyzstan, where 2 people are reported
to have died of the disease, and 6 others are being treated in hospital
with similar symptoms, health officials in the Central Asian state said on
Monday [9 Jun 2008].

Anthrax has been confirmed in the 2 fatal cases, who were from the village
of Beshinchi. Further tests are being carried out on the 6 people, who are
currently being treated in isolation wards, officials said. Health
officials said the victims may have contracted the disease when they
slaughtered a horse for its meat in late May 2008.

There are effective vaccines against the disease. Authorities have
temporarily shut the local livestock market.

[I have searched for this village in south Kyrgyzstan but as yet have been
unable to find it. I am asking my contacts in Bishkek for more information,
and when it comes through, it and the location can be posted.

Unfortunately, this is not an unusual outbreak for Kyrgyzstan. The puzzle
is that it is claimed to have started with a presumably sick horse. People
eat horses in Central Asia. Horses can get infected from grazing but also
by horseflies with contaminated mouthparts, which is what I suspect in this
instance, as horses are not aggressive grazers as are cattle. And, if so,
there will have been prior livestock cases to contaminate the flies'
mouthparts. That the local livestock market has been closed would hint that
the authorities suspect that more might be happening than they are party to.
