CHOLERA - HONG KONG
===================
Date: Tue, 13 May 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
Source: On-line newspapers The Sydney Morning Herald and Hong Kong Standard

The first outbreak of drug-resistant cholera has hit Hong Kong, with eight
confirmed cases reported. The Direct of Health, Dr. Margaret Chan Fung
Fu-chun, said there was a high probability that there is a common source,
since the cases thus far have originated in one area. (The Sydney paper,
however reports nine cases in different areas of the territory.) Seven
cases are being treated in an isolation ward at Princess Margaret Hospital;
one (a 76-year-old man) is in critical condition at Tuen Mun Hospital.
The form of cholera is identified as the Ogawa sub-type, resistant to
tetracycline. Professor Yuen Kwok-yuen, a microbiologist at Hong Kong
University, said that there are many second-line drugs that can be used.
Both he and Dr. Chan told reporters that the outbreak was unusual in that it
is early in the year for cholera. Cases usually appear in the hottest
months of June and August.
The front page of today's Hong Kong Standard carries a photo of a
53-year-old woman being wheeled into the Princess Margaret Hospital on Mon,
12 May. And both newspapers report a concentrated effort to find the source.
Dr. Chan said that some patients had eaten processed food, including chicken
feet, fish balls and dim sum before falling ill. Health officials have
swooped down on food stalls in the city, and small food processing factories
are being investigated. A 1994 outbreak of cholera was traced to restaurant
seafood tanks that were filled with water from the polluted harbor.
