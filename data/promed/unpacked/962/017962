- ICT (Islamabad).13 Mar 2018. As temperatures have started rising in this region of the country, the chances of hatching of eggs and growth of larvae of _Aedes aegypti_, the vector that causes dengue fever have increased and according to health experts, it is time for both individuals and the concerned government authorities to take proper preventive measures to avoid an outbreak of the infection in the coming months. Currently, the most important preventive measure is source reduction by means of elimination of mosquitoes' egg laying sites, particularly in and around houses and offices located in the areas from where confirmed cases of dengue fever have been reported in previous spikes of the infection.

India
- West Bengal (Kolkata). 7 Mar 2018. An Indian Council of Medical Research analysis of blood samples collected from the city and the rest of Bengal confirms that deadlier dengue strains now circulating in Kolkata. It has revealed that the prevalence of serotype II has jumped from 26 per cent in 2016 to 73 per cent in 2017. And the prevalence of serotype IV, believed to be the most potent of the dengue variants, has jumped from 11.4 per cent in 2016 to 18 per cent last year [2017]. Various estimates have put the number of dengue deaths in Kolkata in 2017 at around 50 and experts say the increased prevalence of the more dangerous strains may be the principal reason behind the spike in deaths.

[2] Research: Dengue association with stroke

Summary
-------
A new study has found that people with dengue fever have a higher risk of stroke, especially in the 1st 2 months following infection. The study is published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).

"Clinicians in dengue-endemic areas should be aware of this association, especially for patients with dengue who have neurologic deficits or for patients with stroke who have unexplained fever," writes Dr Chia-Hung Kao, Department of Nuclear Medicine and PET Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, with coauthors.

Dengue is a mosquitoborne viral infection that infects at least 100 million people every year around the world, with about 4 billion people at risk of the illness, which includes dengue hemorrhagic fever that can lead to spontaneous bleeding, organ failure and death. It is found in many countries in South and South East Asia, Africa, South America, the Caribbean, in the United States and more.

The researchers looked at data on 13 787 patients (most between 31 and 60 years of age) with newly diagnosed dengue between 2000 and 2012. They found the incidence of stroke was higher in people with dengue fever (5.33 vs. 3.72 per 1000 person-years). The risk of stroke was as high as 2.49 times in the first 2 months of infection with dengue relative to control patients who did not have dengue. "Our findings may help with clinical risk evaluation and may serve as a basis for further investigation of the pathogenesis of dengue-related stroke," conclude the authors.
