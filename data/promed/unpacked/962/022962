The New Mexico Department of Health is reporting a case of plague in a 43-year-old woman from Rio Arriba County who is currently hospitalized. Confirmatory testing was conducted at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division.

The 1st plague case in New Mexico in 2014 was reported in April 2014 in a 57-year-old man from Torrance County who is still recovering. An environmental investigation will take place at the woman's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.

"Plague activity in New Mexico is usually highest during the summer months, so it is especially important now to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas, which can expose you to plague," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "This person was most likely exposed to plague when her dogs brought infected fleas back into the home."

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets.

"We are seeing die offs of rabbits, squirrels, pack rats and various rodents in several areas of New Mexico from both plague and tularemia," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. "Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk."

In New Mexico, there were 4 human plague cases in 2013 with one fatality, one human plague case in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, one of them fatal.

[The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case are not stated, although overall 95 percent of cases are bubonic in nature. As in the previous 2014 cluster of 4 human cases of plague in Colorado, this NM case seems to be related to a dog exposure, but this time, the canine was not reported to be ill. As compared to cats, dogs are not considered to be significant in the transmission of _Yersinia pestis_ to humans, as underscored by the following paper. Clearly, however, since this paper, cases from canine exposure have occurred.

Orloski KA, Eidson M: _Yersinia pestis_ infection in three dogs. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1995;207: 316-318.

Abstract:
"_Yersinia pestis_ infection was diagnosed in 3 dogs. Clinical signs included lethargy (3 dogs), pyrexia (2 dogs), and a purulent skin lesion in the cervical region (2 dogs). _Yersinia pestis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonotic disease of human beings. Human cases have resulted from contact with infected domestic cats; however, the risk of human infection from contact with infected domestic dogs is unknown. Dogs frequently are exposed to _Y. pestis_ in areas in which there are plague epizootics; however, clinical illness in dogs is rare. In the western United States, where _Yersinia pestis_ is endemic, plague should be considered in the differential diagnosis when examining dogs with nonspecific fever and lethargy."

A map of the USA showing the origin location of plague cases in the USA between 1970 and 2012 shows that in New Mexico, most cases are found in the northwestern part of the state (http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/). Rio Arriba County is in this high distribution area. - Mod.LL
