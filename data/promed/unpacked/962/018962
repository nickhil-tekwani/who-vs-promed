UNDIAGNOSED FEBRILE ILLNESS - INDIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In the last 3 days, 3 persons have died and more than 1000 are said
to be affected by a mystery fever that hit Salaya village of Jamnagar
district. Jamnagar district administration claimed that it was a viral fever.
A 13-year-old male, a 52-year-old male and a 60-year-old male died in
the last 2 days. Jamnagar district collector T Natarajan, however,
said that the cause of death was not viral infection. Patients have
been complaining of high temperature coupled with severe body ache,
especially in the joints.
Seven medical teams consisting of doctors and pathologists have been
pressed into service to cover Salaya's 30 000 residents -- largely
consisting of fishermen, trawler owners and traders.
Natarajan said that the district administration has started an
intensive clean-up operation not only in Salaya village but also in
nearby settlements as soon as the fever broke out. He said that
water tanks in the village are being emptied and cleaned.
On Sunday, around 625 cases and on Monday another 250-300 cases of
viral fever were registered.
Sources in the Jamnagar district panchayat health department said
that viral fever was not the cause of death of 3 people. They said
one was a heart patient and [another] was suffering from oral cancer.
They admitted that the 13-year-old could have succumbed to viral
infection. The coastal village has very limited medical facilities
and even temporary arrangements to give primary treatment to the
villagers seemed inadequate.
The district administration has made arrangements to send patients to
city hospitals. "Blood samples have been sent to state health
department laboratories while we are also getting tests done locally
in Rajkot. Nothing can be said till the test results are out, but
symptoms point to viral fever," said Natrajan. "The situation is
under control but we are taking no chances -- 15 medical teams are on
a door-to-door cleanliness and hygiene campaign. A massive
chlorination drive is also on," he said.

[ProMED-mail has been aware of almost annual reports on "mystery
febrile illnesses" coming from India, with a low rate of confirmation
of etiology. The rationale for posting the above report is a
combination of the reports of approximately 1000 or more cases, and
the mention of arthralgia (joint pains) as a predominant
symptom. Sayala is in the port region of Gujarat in the northwest of
India, on the Arabian Sea. This year there have been reports of
chikungunya outbreaks in the Indian states of Andrah Pradesh,
Maharashtra and Karnataka. Given the apparent low rate of mortality
associated with the above-mentioned febrile outbreak, chikungunya
would certainly be on the list of possible etiologic agents.

As always, ProMED-mail would appreciate information from
knowledgeable sources on the etiology and extent of the
above-described outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
