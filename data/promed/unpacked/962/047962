ANTHRAX - AUSTRALIA (05): (VICTORIA) OVINE, NEW OUTBREAKS

Anthrax has been confirmed on an additional 2 farms in north-west Victoria, bringing the number of properties with livestock deaths to 4. 26 sheep have died at 2 farms near Swan Hill, with 3 of those animals testing positive for the bacteria.

The detection adds to the 2 previous confirmed deaths and more than 30 sheep that have died, but were too decomposed to test for the bacteria, at a farm at Nyah and another at Swan Hill.

Victoria's chief veterinary officer Charles Milne said he was not surprised the bacteria had been detected on other properties. He said seasonal conditions were to blame for the outbreak because the disease spread through soil, not animal to animal. We've identified another 2 infected premises. These are adjacent to an existing known infected premises," Dr Milne said. "They had boundaries that were common in one case and were very close in the other. So whilst it is a development it is not unexpected. It is entirely consistent with how we've seen this disease operate. We don't believe there's been a transportation of stock between the 2nd infected premises and the 3rd and 4th."

"Inquiries are still underway ... but we are confident no animals were moved off into the human food chain or could potentially infect other farms."

Not a quarantine failure
------------------------
Agriculture Victoria has previously stated properties surrounding confirmed anthrax sites would be vaccinated following the additional outbreak. Dr Milne said the detection of the disease on neighbouring properties was not a sign quarantine and vaccination programs had failed. "The farm that was immediately adjacent, we discovered the dead sheep when we were surveying it for vaccination," he said. "So yes, that property's been vaccinated. The other property that is a little distance away, that will be vaccinated today [15 Mar 2017]."

Dr Milne said authorities were "fully in control of this particular incident."

To find Swan Hill, Victoria, go to https://goo.gl/ex9lgv.
For Nyah, Victoria, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AS/07/Nyah.html (this has a better set of maps than the 1st map).

There are a number of lessons from these outbreaks. First, no carcass is "too old." Just swab the nasal turbinates and you will recover spores, which will germinate nicely. As the turbinates are made of just a very thin boney scaffolding covered by blood vessels and nerves there is insufficient tissue for acidification during decomposition, and there is plenty of oxygen, which is necessary for sporulation. Plus in our field experience we have successfully recovered spores both from recent deaths and from skulls over 3 years after death. So if the animal has been dead for over 3 days, swab the turbinates.

Secondly, tabanid (haematophagic) flies normally have difficulty "seeing" sheep and goats; they cast too small a shadow for a black body attraction. But with large flocks if they don't see cumulative shadows they will certainly smell the exhaled carbon dioxide. Anthrax is essentially non-contagious so the pathogen has to depend on mechanical vectors to take it from animal to animal, from pasture to pasture, and from farm to farm. For cattle one needs a loading stage of some 4-6 dead/sick animals before enough female flies are ready to fly further than to the next cow. This condition will have been met by tens of dead sheep. The neatest example of this that I have seen was with a 2000 acre (809 ha) game ranch outside Uvalde, Texas, where it started in some cattle just outside the NW corner; came through the 8 ft (2.5 m) fence to infect some deer, and then jumped 2 km (1.2 mi) to outside the eastern border of the ranch to catch a white tail deer. All fences on the ranch, inside and around were 8 ft high. Deer can't jump that but female flies go through looking for their next blood snack.

Because of the real possibility of fly-borne spread this is why neighbouring herds, and flocks, should be vaccinated, as well as checked for unreported deaths. Note this is how Milne's people found these 2 further outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]
