North Dakota's state veterinarian says the state's 1st reported case of anthrax this year [2020] is a reminder to livestock producers to take action to protect their animals from the disease, especially in areas with a past history of the disease. The case, in Morton County, was confirmed yesterday [3 Sep 2020] by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

"Anthrax has been confirmed in cattle in a Morton County beef herd," Dr. Susan Keller said. "Producers in past known affected areas and counties should consult with their veterinarians to make sure the vaccination schedule for their animals is current. Producers in Morton County and surrounding areas should confer with their veterinarians to determine if initiating 1st-time vaccinations against anthrax is warranted for their cattle at this time."

Effective anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week for immunity to be established, and it must be administered annually for continued protection. Producers should monitor their herds for unexplained deaths and work with their veterinarian to ensure that appropriate samples are collected and submitted to a diagnostic lab to give the best chance of obtaining a diagnosis.

Anthrax has been most frequently reported in northeast, southeast, and south-central North Dakota, but it has been found in almost every part of the state. A few anthrax cases are reported in North Dakota almost every year. In 2005, however, more than 500 confirmed deaths from anthrax were reported with total losses estimated at more than 1000 head. The animals impacted included cattle, bison, horses, sheep, llamas, and farmed deer and elk. One case of anthrax was reported in North Dakota in 2019.

An anthrax factsheet is available on the North Dakota Department of Agriculture website at http://www.nd.gov/ndda/disease/anthrax.

Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. The bacterial spores can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as heavy rainfall, flooding and drought. Animals are exposed to the disease when they graze or consume forage or water contaminated with the spores.

[As this outbreak is this far west, not an everyday occurrence in North Dakota, I asked Dr. Susan Keller, ND State Veterinarian, to comment. - Mod.MHJ]

We have had cases before in late summer, early fall. We went through a hot stretch of weather just before this case occurred. A year ago, there was more rain in September [2019] than that area normally might receive for a whole year.

Now we have dry conditions, and dugouts are stale with low water levels. No one in that area vaccinated routinely against anthrax. I'm sure more will after this.

[To see where Morton County is in SW North Dakota, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton_County,_North_Dakota.

While outbreaks have occurred throughout the state, they are, frankly, uncommon in the western half of the state. For years, there has been a thorough program to persuade the eastern ranchers to annually vaccinate there, and it has been successful in significantly reducing the number of outbreaks to near zero, the exceptions being ranchers who had not vaccinated their animals, their procrastination publicly noted. This means that the western ranchers have not been directly subject to the very successful vaccination campaign of the last decade, which has had a very significant impact on the incidence of this livestock disease.

Concurrent with this is the slow appreciation by the western ranchers to get their cattle vaccinated PDQ if not yesterday. Hopefully, they will wake up and follow their eastern colleagues' example. I hope that they do, as North Dakota is on its way, albeit slowly, as these things are, to be the 1st US state with a recognized significant livestock anthrax problem to be declared free of this disease.

The "hot stretch of weather" noted by Dr. Keller will have greatly reduced the innate resistance of the cattle in Morton County such that a minimal dose of anthrax spores at an old cattle grave was enough to initiate this cow's infection and death. The good news is that there is now a focal point in the region to encourage area vaccination and prevent future cases and any soil recontamination. - Mod.MHJ
