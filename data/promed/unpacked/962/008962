Australia (NT): Murray Valley Encephalitis Warning Following Death of Child
---------------------------------------------------
A Northern Territory-wide warning has been issued after a young child was
diagnosed with a potentially fatal Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV)
infection. The Department of Health and Community Services issued the
warning after the child contracted the virus in Central Australia. The
virus is carried by mosquitoes. The warning particularly applies to people
living, visiting or camping within 5 km of swamp, creek and river systems
overnight.
Symptoms of MVEV infection include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness,
tremors and seizures, especially in young children. In some cases the
disease progresses to coma. The Department has warned people experiencing
these symptoms to seek urgent medical attention. It said above-average
rainfall for many regions in February and March had set the scene for
increased mosquito numbers and an increased risk of virus transmission.
February to May is the peak risk period for the virus in the Territory.
The Department also issued a warning for Kunjin virus. Kunjin virus disease
is not normally fatal. Symptoms include fever, headaches and muscle and
joint aches and pains. Both viruses are transmitted by the common banded
mosquito. This mosquito bites only after sundown, with a peak in the first
2 hours of the night.

[Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus are members of the
Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses. Murray Valley
encephalitis virus is endemic in New Guinea and parts of
Australia. Inapparent infection is common. The elderly and the young are
most at risk from this potentially fatal mosquito-transmitted viral
encephalitis. Kunjin virus is closely related to Murray Valley
encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. It occurs predominantly in
Australia and Sarawak, where it normally causes mostly asymptomatic
infections, although occasional cases of encephalitis have been reported. -
