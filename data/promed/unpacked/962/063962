International travel and the urban spread of yellow fever.

Abstract
Objective: To examine the potential for international travel to spread yellow fever virus to cities around the world.

Methods: We obtained data on the international flight itineraries of travellers who departed yellow fever-endemic areas of the world in 2016 for cities either where yellow fever was endemic or which were suitable for viral transmission. Using a global ecological model of dengue virus transmission, we predicted the suitability of cities in non-endemic areas for yellow fever transmission. We obtained information on national entry requirements for yellow fever vaccination at travellers' destination cities.

Findings: In 2016, 45.2 million international air travellers departed from yellow fever-endemic areas of the world. Of 11.7 million travellers with destinations in 472 cities where yellow fever was not endemic but which were suitable for virus transmission, 7.7 million (65.7 percent) were not required to provide proof of vaccination upon arrival. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Peru and the United States of America had the highest volumes of travellers arriving from yellow fever-endemic areas and the largest populations living in cities suitable for yellow fever transmission.

Conclusion: Each year millions of travellers depart from yellow fever-endemic areas of the world for cities in non-endemic areas that appear suitable for viral transmission without having to provide proof of vaccination. Rapid global changes in human mobility and urbanization make it vital for countries to re-examine their vaccination policies and practices to prevent urban yellow fever epidemics.

[The significant yellow fever (YF) outbreaks in Angola with spill-over into the DR Congo in 2015-2016 and the current outbreak in Brazil have raised concern about the risk of international spread from these outbreaks. The movement of 11 YF infected Chinese workers from Angola to China in 2016 as well as the recent movement of individuals from Brazil to Europe this year (2018) have sounded alarm bells about international spread of the virus via infected travelers. The above report contains data on numbers of travelers going from YF endemic areas to cities so far free of YF but have YF virus vectors and numbers of unvaccinated individuals traveling to YF endemic areas and returning to cities at potential risk. It is clear that a policy concerning required vaccination of travelers is needed. The time for consideration of policy changes and implementation is now, not after YF appears in new locations where spread could be rapid. - Mod.TY
