A baby was born with congenital syphilis in Port Augusta [a small city in the state of South Australia] last year [2017], the 1st child to be born with the serious and potentially fatal disease in South Australia in 18 years.

While South Australian health authorities declared an outbreak of infectious syphilis in March last year [2017], the national response to the outbreak is still yet to be rolled out in the state.

Greens MP [Member for Parliament] Tammy Franks laid the blame for the outbreak on a lack of funding for sexual health programs. "I think all South Australians should be concerned that a child in our state is born with congenital syphilis," Ms Franks said. "That is a thing of the dark ages, it shouldn't be happening in 2018."

The Federal Government has committed AUD 8.8 million [about USD 6.25 million] to addressing the national outbreak, but Indigenous Health Minister Ken Wyatt told the ABC more funding was likely to come. "I'm certainly looking at additional funding that would assist in the process for both South Australia and other states where we are seeing an increase in syphilis outbreaks," Mr Wyatt said.

The outbreak, which is believed to have started in an Aboriginal community in northern Queensland in 2011, has spread across 4 jurisdictions to include the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. Health Department figures show that to [30 Sep 2018 -- see [2] below], 1184 cases had been diagnosed in affected areas in Queensland, 877 in the Northern Territory, 196 in Western Australia, and 44 in South Australia.

There have been up to 15 congenital syphilis cases diagnosed in neonates or infants that are attributed to the outbreak. Of these, up to 7 babies have died.

Royal Australasian College of Physicians sexual health medicine president Catherine O'Connor said the outbreak was an "extremely serious problem that is a perfect storm. It is a totally preventable and treatable disease, it should not be happening in a wealthy country like Australia," Dr O'Connor said. "It will take years of hard work to get rates down to an acceptable level from here." She said there needed to be a long-term and sustained prevention program introduced nationally, combining sexual health education with testing.

In June [2018], a "test and treat" rapid response model was rolled out in Townsville, Cairns [Queensland], and Darwin [Northern Territory], focussing on Aboriginal people aged 15 to 29 [years]. This month [October 2018], Mr Wyatt announced testing kits would next be distributed to East Arnhem Land and Katherine in the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region in Western Australia. But despite the passage of more than 12 months since the outbreak was announced in South Australia, the rapid response testing model is yet to be introduced in the state.

Health authorities say the remote Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara [APY] Lands, as well as the west and Eyre regions are affected. It is understood that the spread of syphilis in South Australia continues to be a major concern for regional health services, with 4 patients recently diagnosed in just one day in one clinic.

A Federal Department of Health spokeswoman said the design of the response in SA [South Australia] was still being discussed with stakeholders, including SA Health, the Aboriginal Health Council of SA and Aboriginal community controlled health services (ACCHS). "The Australian Government's contribution to the enhanced response to the syphilis outbreak is being channelled through the ACCHS sector, and that will be the case in SA," the spokeswoman said. In a statement, SA Health said it had updated the antenatal clinical guidelines to help GPs better detect syphilis before pregnancy and after birth to reduce cases of congenital syphilis.

"We're also supporting an enhanced sexually transmissible infection and blood-borne virus prevention partnership response for South Australian Aboriginal communities, which builds on the work of the Commonwealth's 'Young, Deadly, Syphilis Free campaign'," the statement said.

Aboriginal Health Council public health medical officer David Johnson said that Nganampa Health in the state's remote APY lands had a "best practice model" for sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention that had been in place for 20 years. This program had possibly provided a buffer for South Australia from the higher rates of infection seen in other states, he said. But Dr Johnson warned numbers were rising and only 10 to 15 per cent of the Aboriginal population in other high-risk areas had been tested for syphilis.

"Some people are arguing to include Adelaide [capital city, South Australia] in the outbreak area," Dr Johnson said. "We still don't know the extent of the outbreak here."

He said Aboriginal health services were asking the Federal Government to fund additional resources to roll out the rapid response model and increase the proportion of people tested in the community.

Pregnant women with untreated early syphilis have a 70 to 100 per cent chance of passing the disease to their baby through the placenta or at birth, with up to a third of pregnancies resulting in miscarriage or stillbirth. Infected babies who aren't treated can have seizures, brain damage, blindness, developmental delay, or die.

The rapid response test functions similarly to the blood sugar test many diabetics do regularly -- it is a pin prick blood test that delivers a quick result. Traditionally, tests for syphilis take up to two weeks to process for results.

The Multijurisdictional Syphilis Outbreak (MJSO) Working Group was formed by the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia (CDNA) in April 2015, in response to an ongoing outbreak of infectious syphilis among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living largely in remote and rural areas of northern Australia. Increased notifications associated with the outbreak in northern Australia were first reported in January 2011 in northwest Queensland (Qld), followed by the Northern Territory (NT) in July 2013, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia (WA) in June 2014. In March 2017, South Australia (SA) declared an outbreak in the Far North and Western and Eyre regions from November 2016. In August 2018, WA declared that the outbreak had spread to the Pilbara region with the 1st syphilis notification in this region in February 2018.

This surveillance report summarises the outbreak epidemiological data as of 30 Sept 2018 (current status). Please note: the MJSO Surveillance Report was formerly known as the MJSO Communique. Historical epidemiological data and MJSO activities are published in earlier MJSO Communiques available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ohp-infectious-syphilis-outbreak.htm

Current status
--------------
Outbreak data to 30 Sep 2018 are summarised in Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2 below [available at the source URL above].

Outbreak cases are reported as either category 1 or category 2: category 1 cases include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people residing in an outbreak declared region [affected regions include Torres and Cape, Cairns and Hinterland, North West, and Townsville Hospital and Health Services in Queensland; Alice Springs Urban, Alice Springs Rural, Barkly, East Arnhem, Katherine, Darwin Urban and Darwin Rural regions in the Northern Territory; Kimberley and Pilbara regions in Western Australia, and; Far North and Western and Eyre regions in South Australia] at the time of diagnosis, and; category 2 cases include people who are a sexual contact of a confirmed outbreak case which includes Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who do not reside in an outbreak area at the time of diagnosis and non-Indigenous people regardless of where they reside.

From the commencement of the outbreak to 30 Sep 2018, there were a total of 2335 outbreak cases (category 1 and 2 cases) reported across the four outbreak affected jurisdictions: 1212 in Queensland (from January 2011); 883 in the Northern Territory (from July 2013); 196 in Western Australia (from June 2014), and; 44 in South Australia (from November 2016) (Table 1 and 2).

[ProMED-mail has previously reported the ongoing syphilis outbreak among young heterosexual indigenous people in remote communities that has spread across Australia since 2011 and that has been associated with increasing numbers of cases of congenital syphilis (Syphilis - Australia (02): (NT,WA) increase, indigenous, congenital, fatal 20151102.3760394, Syphilis - Australia: (NT) increased incidence, indigenous people, RFI 20150713.3507530, and Syphilis - Australia (03): (QL) indigenous, RFI 20120808.1234631).

Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people (Indigenous Australians) includes many regional groups. There are about 650 000 Indigenous Australians; they make up about 25 per cent of the population in the Northern Territory, 4.0 per cent of the population in Queensland, 3.0 per cent of the population in Western Australia, 3 percent in New South Wales, 2.0 per cent in South Australia, 4.6 percent in Tasmania, and less than 1 per cent in the Capital Territory (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians).

70 per cent of the indigenous population live outside major cities, of which about 1/3 live in remote communities, where access to health services is likely to be poor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians): "Only 20 per cent of Aboriginal people who live in remote communities of more than 50 people have access to a doctor on a daily basis according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures from 2006. A further 41 per cent have local access to a doctor once a week or once a fortnight" (http://www.creativespirits.info/aboriginalculture/health/hospitals-doctors-health-aboriginal-people#ixzz3fk6Jag2m).

The reports above say that Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) (included in the Far North Government Region), as well as the Eyre and Western Region are the affected areas in South Australia. APY is a large Aboriginal local government area located in the remote northwestern corner of South Australia and the Eyre and Western Region is the Eyre Peninsula, a triangular peninsula, and the coastline extending west to South Australia's border with Western Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula).

APY has a population of around 2500 residents, about 85 percent of whom are Indigenous Australians (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara). The Eyre and Western Region has a population of almost 60 thousand residents, only 4.4 percent of whom are estimated to be Indigenous (https: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula). Indigenous Australians are located in 3 communities in Eyre and Western region: Maralinga Tjarutja Lands in the far west, Yalata 350 km [about 217.5 mi] to the south and Koonibba a further 188 km [about 117 mi] to the southeast (https://www.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/7290/Eyre_and_Western_Region_Plan.pdf). For a map showing the location of APY, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anangu_Pitjantjatjara_Yankunytjatjara, and for a map of South Australia showing the Eyre and Western Region, see https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Spoehr/publication/236165460/figure/fig3/AS:299436707205122@1448402682202/South-Australian-Government-regions.png).
