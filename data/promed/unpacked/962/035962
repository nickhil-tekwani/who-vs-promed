Influenza Activity -- United States and Worldwide, 13 Jun - 25 Sep 2010
-----------------------------
From 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010, the United States experienced low levels
of influenza activity. During this period, typical seasonal patterns
of influenza activity occurred in the Southern Hemisphere; in
addition, influenza activity was observed in the tropical regions,
with a mix of 2009 [i.e. pandemic] influenza A (H1N1), influenza A
(H3N2), and influenza B viruses co-circulating. This report
summarizes influenza activity in the United States and worldwide
since the update published on 30 Jul 2010 (1).

United States
----------------
In the United States, CDC [Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention] collaborates with federal, state, and local partners to
collect influenza information via multiple surveillance systems.
During the summer period of 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010, influenza
surveillance systems that were in operation included: 1) World Health
Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus
Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories, which
conduct viral surveillance; 2) the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like
Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), which reports outpatient
visits for influenza-like illness (ILI); 3) the BioSense Program,
which contains chief complaint and discharge diagnosis data on
emergency department visits due to ILI; 4) pneumonia and influenza
deaths from the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System; 5)
influenza-associated pediatric deaths from the Influenza-Associated
Pediatric Mortality Reporting System; and 6) reports of novel
influenza A virus cases from the National Notifiable Disease
Surveillance System (NNDSS).

During the period 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010, WHO and NREVSS collaborating
laboratories analyzed a total of 25 833 respiratory specimens from
the United States. Of these specimens, 326 (1.3 percent) tested
positive for influenza; 261 (80 percent) were influenza A viruses,
and 65 (20 percent) were influenza B viruses. Of the influenza A
viruses, 185 (71 percent) were subtyped; 130 (70 percent) were H3,
and 55 (30 percent) were 2009 influenza A (H1N1). The percentage of
specimens positive for influenza varied slightly over time, with less
than one percent of tested specimens positive each week until late
July 2010 and 1.0-2.6 percent of tested specimens positive from late
July through late September 2010. The largest proportion of positive
samples came from the southeastern United States (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee)
(40 percent), followed by western states (Region 9: Arizona,
California, Hawaii, and Nevada) (14 percent), and the Midwestern
states (Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, and
Wisconsin) (10 percent).

The weekly percentage of outpatient visits to ILINet providers for
ILI during 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010 ranged from 0.7 percent to one
percent, which is below the national baseline of 2.3 percent. This
was consistent with data provided by the BioSense Program, which
indicated a low level of ILI visits in emergency departments (0.7
percent--1.7 percent). Mortality attributed to pneumonia and
influenza, as reported by the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System,
was below the epidemic threshold throughout the period covered by
this report except for 3 nonconsecutive weeks. No
influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported to the
Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality Reporting System, and no
human cases of novel influenza A were reported to NNDSS for the
period 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010.

In early July 2010, 2 outbreaks of influenza A (H3) were reported in
Iowa. The 1st outbreak caused ILI in 4 of 13 members of a college
sports team; 3 of these 4 were found to be positive for influenza A
by rapid test, and 2 of 3 were later confirmed to have influenza A
(H3) infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 2nd outbreak
involved 9 of 12 children and one parent with ILI in a child care
setting; 2 children were rapid-test positive for influenza A, and one
was PCR-positive for influenza A (H3) infection. None of these
patients had a direct history of recent travel, and no epidemiologic
links were identified between the 2 Iowa outbreaks. The Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported an outbreak of
influenza B during the 1st half of August 2010, which involved
children visiting the United States as part of an international
exchange program. Approximately 35 of 400 children had ILI, and 6
sought health care at a local hospital. Influenza B was identif!
ied in 8 cases.

Worldwide
-------------
From 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010, influenza A (H3), 2009 influenza A
(H1N1), and influenza B were identified worldwide. Seasonal influenza
A (H1) viruses were reported only rarely. Reports by the WHO Global
Influenza Surveillance Network (2) showed that influenza B was the
viral type most commonly identified until early July 2010, when 2009
[i.e. pandemic] influenza A (H1N1) became the predominant strain.
Since late August 2010, influenza A (H3) has been the viral subtype
most commonly identified. The WHO Global Surveillance Network
reported that the predominant viral type or subtype identified from
Asia (44 percent of analyzed specimens) was H3, followed by 2009
influenza A (H1N1) (32 percent of specimens) and influenza B (13
percent), but this varied by country. In Africa, influenza B (44
percent) viruses were the most common, followed by influenza A (H3)
(31 percent). In South America, 2009 influenza A (H1N1) (32 percent
of specimens) and influenza B (32 percent) predominated. In North
America, 69 percent of isolates were identified as influenza A (H3)
viruses. The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus predominated in Oceania
(63 percent of specimens). In Europe, a small number of cases were
reported, and most specimens (59 percent) were influenza B, followed
by 2009 influenza A (H1N1) (19 percent).

Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Virus Isolates
-------------------------------------
Virus isolates from around the world are received and analyzed at the
WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control
of Influenza, located at CDC. 79 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses were
collected and analyzed from 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010 (16 from the United
States, 33 from South America, 13 from Asia, 15 from Africa, and 2
from Oceania); all but one (99 percent) were antigenically similar to
A/California/7/2009 (2009 [pandemic] influenza A H1N1), which is the
H1N1 component of the 2010/11 Northern Hemisphere vaccine recommended
by WHO. Of the 101 influenza A (H3) viruses characterized (24 from
the United States, one from North America, 42 from South America, 7
from Asia, and 27 from Africa), 97 (96 percent) were antigenically
similar to A/Perth/16/2009, the H3N2 component of the 2010/11
Northern Hemisphere vaccine, and 4 (4 percent) showed reduced titers
with antisera produced against A/Perth/16/2009. Finally, of 45
influenza B isolates characterized at CDC during this period, 34 (76
percent) belong to the B/Victoria lineage (12 from North America
[including 9 from the United States], 16 from South America, and 6
from Asia), and 30 of 34 (88 percent) were antigenically similar to
B/Brisbane/60/2008, which is the influenza B component of the 2010/11
Northern Hemisphere vaccine (B/Victoria lineage). The remaining 11
influenza B viruses (3 from the United States, 3 from South America,
and 5 from Asia) belong to the B/Yamagata lineage.

Resistance Profiles of Influenza Virus Isolates
----------------------------------------
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
Control of Influenza at CDC tested isolates collected during the
period 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010 for resistance to antiviral medications.
Of 232 isolates tested for neuraminidase inhibitor resistance, 178
were received from 18 foreign countries (52 were 2009 influenza A
[H1N1], 85 were H3N2, and 41 were influenza B), and 54 were collected
from the United States (17 were 2009 influenza A [H1N1], 25 were
H3N2, and 12 were influenza B). None of the 232 tested viruses were
found to be resistant to either oseltamivir or zanamivir. Of 180
isolates tested for adamantane resistance (139 foreign isolates and
41 isolates from the United States), 100 percent were found to be
resistant to adamantanes.

Human Infection with Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Isolates
----------------------------------------
During the period 13 Jun to 25 Sep 2010, 6 cases of human infection
with avian influenza A (H5N1) were reported to WHO from Egypt and
Indonesia; 5 of these cases were fatal (3). Since December 2003, a
total of 505 human cases (resulting in 300 fatalities) have been
reported from 15 countries in Asia and Africa. No human cases of
avian influenza (H5N1) infection have been identified from North
America or South America.

MMWR Editorial Note
----------------------
During the period 13 Jun to 26 Sep 2010, influenza A (H3), 2009
influenza A (H1N1), and influenza B were present worldwide and also
were detected in the United States. Despite the overall low levels of
influenza virus circulation throughout the summer in the United
States, there have been clusters of H3N2 disease, as well as sporadic
cases of infection with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B
viruses. These outbreaks are typical of sporadic outbreaks of
influenza during the summer months.

Although it is difficult to predict which influenza virus strains
will predominate during the upcoming influenza season, antigenic
characterization of viral isolates submitted during the summer
demonstrated that the majority are antigenically similar to the
influenza vaccine candidates included in the 2010/11 Northern
Hemisphere vaccine.

Vaccination continues to be the best method for preventing influenza
and its associated complications. Vaccine manufacturers project ample
supplies of influenza vaccine in the United States for the 2010/11
influenza season. Guidelines for influenza vaccination, published in
July 2010, were revised this year [2010] by the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) and call for annual vaccination of all
persons aged 6 months or over (4). Because children aged under 6
months are too young for influenza vaccination but are one of the
groups at highest risk for influenza-related hospitalization,
vaccination of household contacts and caregivers of young children is
recommended to reduce their risk for influenza illness (4).
Vaccination of pregnant women might also provide protection to
infants aged under 6 months in addition to protecting women during
pregnancy and the postpartum period (5,6).

On 5 Aug 2010, ACIP recommended that trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine (brand name Afluria) manufactured by CSL Biotherapies not be
administered to children aged 6 months to 8 years (7). This
recommendation was based on findings of an increased risk for fever
in children aged under 9 years and febrile seizures among children
aged under 5 years in Australia and New Zealand associated with
receipt of CSL Southern Hemisphere trivalent inactivated vaccine
(TIV). If no other age-appropriate, licensed seasonal influenza
vaccine is available for a child aged 5 to 8 years who has a medical
condition that increases their risk for influenza complications,
Afluria may be given, and providers should discuss the benefits and
risks of influenza vaccination with the parents or caregivers before
administering Afluria (7). No cause has been identified to date to
explain these adverse reactions in children who received CSL TIV.
Safety of seasonal influenza vaccine will continue to be monitored
through the season.

Antiviral medications for treatment and prevention of influenza
continue to be an important adjunct to vaccination as part of efforts
to reduce serious morbidity and mortality related to influenza (8).
Because all H3N2 and 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses submitted for
testing are resistant to adamantanes (amantadine and rimantidine),
adamantane use is not recommended. However, influenza B, influenza A
(H3N2), and 2009 influenza A (H1N1) viruses remain susceptible to
neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir), and these drugs
are recommended agents for influenza prophylaxis and treatment when indicated.

Additional information on influenza testing, use of antiviral
medications, influenza infection control guidelines, and vaccination
recommendations are available online from CDC at

surveillance reports also will be available online at
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly>.

[The information provided in the antigenic characterization section
of this update indicates that in the 2010/11 northern hemisphere
vaccine, the H1N1 component is identically matched to the currently
circulating strain, the H3N2 component well matched, and the B virus less so.

In the United States section of the report, it is stated that a total
of 25 833 respiratory specimens were analysed. Of these specimens,
326 (1.3 percent) tested positive for influenza [virus]. One is left
wondering what other virus/viruses is/are out there causing
respiratory illness during the June/September period in North
America. - Mod.CP]
