Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 5 Oct 2015
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: African swine fever [ASF] virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Commune de Ferkessédougou, Ferkessédougou [Savanes district]
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Sep 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 486 / 486 / 223 / 0 / 0
Affected population: mortality in pigs with clinical signs suggestive of the disease (hyper salivation, lack of appetite, coordination disorders, and skin redness on ears, snout, tail, and abdomen) in 4 districts (Lanviara, Gare, Douane, and St Paul [Ferkessédougou department]). The farms are of free and indoors type. Investigations are being carried out to evaluate the extent of the disease.

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: mortalities were reported at the border of Ouangolodougou, a border town with Burkina Faso in June 2017.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, screening, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: quarantine, official destruction of animal products, stamping out, disinfection, disinfestation, control of vectors

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Laboratory for Agricultural Development (LACADA) (national laboratory) / Swine / real-time reverse transcriptase / polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 2 Oct 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating viral hemorrhagic fever that can kill up to 100 percent of domestic pigs, for which there is still no vaccine or treatment. The ability to survive for long periods in uncooked pork endows the virus with a very high capacity for transboundary spread over great distances, demonstrated by its introduction into Europe no less than 3 times. It is also currently prevalent in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), wherever pigs are kept. The last decades have seen exponential growth in the pig sector in SSA but also a striking increase in the number of ASF outbreaks. The 2 phenomena are highly likely to be linked.

Little detailed information on the socio-economic effects of ASF is available, but it can confidently be stated that it has a severely negative effect on household income and food security, contributes to the failure of the pig sector to reach its full potential to increase incomes, generate employment, and alleviate poverty, and is a disincentive to investment in the pig sector. Pig keeping is widely practiced by women, pensioners, unemployed youth, and other vulnerable sectors of society. It has been found to be particularly helpful in building confidence and providing security to especially women in societies traumatized by war. It has therefore become imperative to develop a strategy to better manage and control and where possible eliminate ASF among domestic pigs in SSA.

The joint strategy has been developed by a task force representing FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organization), AU-IBAR [InterAfrican Bureau for Animal Resources], and ILRI [International Livestock Research Institute] and validated at a workshop held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from 10-12 Nov 2015. It provides the background for a roadmap for progressive control of ASF in SSA. The strategy takes into account the complexities of both the epidemiology of the disease and the diverse and largely disorganized pig sector in the region. Eradication of the virus from the region is not an option owing to the involvement of African wild suids and ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex. However, while prevention of contact between the natural hosts and vectors and domestic pigs is necessary, virus is spread among domestic pigs mainly by contact with infected pigs and pork. The main focus of the strategy is therefore on preventing outbreaks in domestic pigs by improved organization of the pig sector and identifying and mitigating the risks throughout the pig value chains. In most SSA countries up to 90 percent of pigs are kept in traditional scavenging systems. There is a need for transformation to enable the implementation of the simple biosecurity measures necessary to protect pigs from ASF. Considerable financial resources will be required to enable pig producers to convert from lower to higher input systems, but the rewards will be reaped in terms of less ASF and generally better health, production and welfare that will lead to greater profitability. Biosecurity should also be enhanced in the commercial sector and at all levels of the pig value chain. The strategy aims to eliminate risky marketing practices and improve market access for producers in rural as well as in urban/peri-urban areas so that improved biosecurity becomes a real and rewarding investment.

The strategy will be underpinned by research to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of ASF in SSA and of its socio-economic importance in the region, as well as capacity development to improve surveillance for, diagnosis of and response to ASF at local, national, sub-regional and regional levels. It proposes feasible risk-based solutions for outbreak control that will be specific for systems and areas in line with pro-poor policies. The approach is holistic and includes a wide array of stakeholders who will be asked to make inputs into the strategy, because without their involvement control will not be achieved. Support will be sought from regional, sub-regional, and international organizations and networks as well as the private sector.

The expected outputs of the strategy are a better understanding of the drivers of the disease, transformed production systems that enable the application of adequate biosecurity, and improved capacity among all pig value chain actors and veterinary services. Envisaged outcomes would be reduced prevalence and impact of ASF and better performance of the pig and pork value chains."
