A large Saudi Arabian camel sampling study published today [17 Dec 2015] revealed several new clues about MERS-CoV, building a strong case for the animals' role as the source of human infections, while a second study detailed early results for a camel vaccine.
Both studies were published today [17 Dec 2015] in Science [see commentary]. The camel MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) sampling study [see 1] was led by a team from Hong Kong and also included researchers from Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Egypt. The vaccine study [see 2] was based at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands and included scientists from Germany and Spain.

[1] For the 1st study, researchers sampled 1309 camels at wholesale markets, slaughterhouses, and farms in Jeddah, Taif, and Riyadh in 2014 and 2015.

Overall, 25.3 percent were positive for coronaviruses, 12 percent of them specifically yielding MERS-CoV. Investigators saw a peak during the winter season, when as many as 23 percent of samples were positive for MERS-CoV.

Most of the animals that tested positive were from wholesale markets, and local camels were more likely to test positive than those that were imported from Sudan and Somalia.

Young camels -- those younger than 1 year old -- were most likely to be infected, with 34 percent testing positive for MERS-CoV or other coronaviruses. The rate was nearly double that for camels in other age groups, which researchers said suggests that the younger ones play a key role in spreading the virus.

The virus was present in 25 percent of nasal swab samples, but only 1 percent of digestive tract specimens, hinting that airborne transmission as the most likely route for virus spread.

The team also found 2 other coronavirus species co-circulating in Saudi Arabia's camels, including a 229E-like virus that is closely related to a type of human coronavirus that is the most frequent cause of common colds. It was found in 20 percent of the camels. The other coronavirus they found was HKU23, which had previously been found in camels from Dubai.

Coronavirus co-infections were fairly common. Tests showed that 6.9 percent of animals were infected by 2 or 3 coronaviruses, and more than half of the camels infected with MERS-CoV tested positive for at least one other coronavirus. Researchers said that, taken together, the results show that dromedary camels are an important host for coronaviruses.

In another part of their study, the investigators looked at 93 full-gene sequences of camel coronaviruses, including 67 from MERS-CoV. Their analysis found that MERS-CoV diverged into 5 distinct lineages, with lineage 5 representing a recombination of lineages 3 and 4. The novel recombinant virus was 1st detected in camels in July 2014, but it wasn't detected in humans until February 2015. The 5th lineage led to human outbreaks in South Korea and the Middle East, according to the study.

Researchers said the findings support camels as the direct source of human MERS cases and that they can harbor other coronaviruses. They added that the patterns they found show that avoiding direct contact with camels, along with contaminated materials or environments, could help break the transmission chain to humans.

[2] In the 2nd study, researchers tested the effectiveness of a vaccine for camels that uses a weakened poxvirus to deliver the MERS-CoV spike protein. The candidate virus, called MVA-MERS-S, was 1st developed 2 years ago and has gone through testing in mice.

The team vaccinated 8 camels by intramuscular and nasal routes, half receiving MVA-MERS-S and half receiving a version that didn't contain the MERS-CoV spike protein. Camels got a booster shot 4 weeks later. Then 3 weeks after that the researchers experimentally infected the animals. Vaccinated camels had mild symptoms with significantly lower levels of virus compared with controls.

The team also found that the vaccine showed protection against camelpox virus, another disease that affects Saudi Arabia's camel population.

As one of the next steps, the researchers are getting ready to test MVA-MERS-S in humans, according to a press release today [17 Dec 2015] from Germany's Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. It said the vaccine already meets several preconditions for human clinical trials, and a project is underway to pave the way for phase 1 trials. Currently, there are no human vaccines for MERS-CoV, though development is underway on a few candidate vaccines.

Michael Osterholm, MPH, PhD, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the camel sampling study supports the case that MERS-CoV likely emerged on the Arabian Peninsula and why following virus pools for future human disease is so crucial. He said the findings also provide a sense of the evolutionary process that global health officials need to be aware of.

The camel vaccine study is important, because it shows in principle that a camel vaccine can be found, Osterholm added. Because animals vaccinated with the experimental vaccine still shed some virus, it's not clear if it will be good enough, but he said a camel vaccine holds the potential of curbing the spread to humans.
Osterholm said during the SARS outbreak, health officials had an easier task at removing the animal host, which involved getting palm civets out of the markets. The challenge is much more difficult, though, with camels. [On top of their use as draft animals and producers (meat, milk, hair), camel racing has grown to become an industry of considerable dimensions and low tolerance for interventions. - Mod.AS]. The key point is the vaccine is needed to interrupt MERS-CoV transmission from camels to humans, he said. "Even if the vaccine is moderately effective, it would still be important."

A MERS-CoV vaccine for camels might also cut transmission among camels, a key point to consider, given that the world could have a much bigger problem if the virus makes its way to Africa's camel population, Osterholm said. At 10.5 million, Africa's' camel population dwarfs the 1.5 million camel population in the Arabian Peninsula, he added.

Abstract
--------
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections cause an ongoing outbreak in humans fueled by multiple zoonotic MERS-CoV introductions from dromedary camels. Besides implementing hygiene measures to limit further camel-to-human and human-to-human transmissions, vaccine-mediated reduction of MERS-CoV spread from the animal reservoir may be envisaged. Here, we show that a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) virus vaccine expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein confers mucosal immunity in dromedary camels. Significant reduction of excreted infectious virus and viral RNA transcripts was observed in vaccinated animals upon MERS-CoV challenge as compared to controls. Protection correlated with the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. Induction of MVA-specific antibodies that cross-neutralize camelpox virus, would also provide protection against camelpox.

Concluding remarks
------------------
Protective immunity to coronaviruses is orchestrated by antibody and cellular immune responses. Investigations in mice have already provided evidence that vaccination with MERS-CoV spike-protein-based candidate vaccines, monoclonal antibodies directed against the spike protein, or dromedary immune serum, induce protective immunity against lower respiratory tract MERS-CoV infection (28-30). A DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein induced MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody responses in dromedary camels to similar levels as the MVA-S vaccine but no challenge experiments were performed (31). However, also studies in the field indicated that MERS-CoV seropositive dromedaries may carry MERS-CoV viral RNA in their nasal excretions (8, 15, 16). Thus, sterilizing immunity may not be possible to achieve as virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract even in the presence of specific antibodies, similarly to other respiratory viruses. Because dromedary camels do not show severe clinical signs upon MERS-CoV infection, vaccination of dromedaries should primarily aim at reducing virus excretion to prevent virus spreading. Young dromedaries excrete more infectious MERS-CoV than adults (8, 15, 16) thus would be the first target to vaccinate. Our results reveal that MVA-S vaccination of young dromedary camels may significantly reduce infectious MERS-CoV excreted from the nose, when analyzing two groups of each four animals challenged with a high dose of MERS-CoV. Two major advantages of the orthopoxvirus-based vector used in our study include its capacity to induce protective immunity in the presence of pre-existing (e.g., maternal) antibodies (32) and the observation that MVA-specific antibodies cross-neutralize camelpox virus, revealing the potential dual use of this candidate MERS-CoV vaccine in dromedaries. Dromedary camels vaccinated with conventional vaccinia virus showed no clinical signs upon challenge with camelpox virus while control animals developed typical symptoms of generalized camelpox (33). The MVA-S vectored vaccine may also be tested for protection of humans at risk, such as healthcare workers and people with camel contacts.

Abstract
--------
Outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) raise questions about the prevalence and evolution of the MERS coronavirus (CoV) in its animal reservoir. Our surveillance in Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 2015 showed that viruses of the MERS-CoV species and a human CoV 229E-related lineage co-circulated at high prevalence, with frequent co-infections in the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels. Including a betacoronavirus 1 species, we found that dromedary camels share three CoV species with humans. Several MERS-CoV lineages were present in camels, including a recombinant lineage that has been dominant since December 2014 and that subsequently led to the human outbreaks in 2015. Camels therefore serve as an important reservoir for the maintenance and diversification of the MERS-CoVs and are the source of human infections with this virus.

Concluding remarks
------------------
Four CoV species circulate widely in humans, and 2 others have caused severe sporadic infections with limited human-to-human transmission (1, 25). The wide species range of CoVs and their propensity to cross species boundaries suggest that more will emerge in the future. Since the 1st report of MERS in 2012 (1, 2), the causative virus has been transmitted to over 25 countries, mostly by international travelers that have been to the Middle East (3). Even though a high prevalence of MERS-CoVs has been detected in this work and in previous studies of dromedary camels (4-14), limited quarantine and biosecurity measures are in place to reduce the exposure of humans to the virus, and more cases must be expected in the future. The recent out-break of MERS in Korea (3) shows that MERS-CoVs have the ability to cause large outbreaks in environments that are different from the Middle East. Although changes in human population density, climate conditions, and social factors may contribute to the spread of MERS-CoVs in other regions, the prevention of transmission at the animal/human interface is likely to be the most efficient measure to contain the threat from this virus.

The 2 papers are welcome contributions to the MERS research. A wide-scale surveillance in the Saudi camel population was long due. Vaccination of camels might eventually be the preferable and most practical solution to their threat to human health, while remaining, themselves, clinically unaffected.

Why has MERS gained more ground in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia than in any other country, remains to be explained. - Mod.AS
