Tick-borne diseases
-------------------
In 2009 the probability of natural-focus infections is enhanced as a
result of the increase in temperature above the norm in the
autumn-winter months of the past year [2008]. In the European
territory of the country it was an abnormally warm November-December,
and the presence of a large forage reserve due to a high grain [and
forest mast -- nuts and acorns] yield will lead to increased rodent
populations. In 2009 an increased probability of tick-borne diseases
is predicted, caused by 2 abnormally warm winters, which have
produced an increase in the population of carriers in the natural
foci.

[The vectors of concern are wild rodents transmitting tick-borne
encephalitis virus (a flavivirus). The same prediction could be made
for the hantaviruses associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome, transmitted not by ticks, but by dust contaminated with the
carrier rodents' urine and feces. - Mods.CP/JW]

Anthrax
-------
In 2009, the occurrence of epizootic foci of anthrax is most probable
in territories of the Southern, Central, Volga, and Siberian Federal
Districts, caused by cattle being pastured on livestock burial
grounds, with animal cases leading to subsequent human infection.

[This is a traditional Russian viewpoint. But risky cattle graves are
normally very much the exception, not the rule. A grave will only
pose a risk if the carcass had been scavenged or butchered/necropsied
before burial. So the claim of "graves" is probably an excuse to
deflect criticism on inadequate vaccination, non-reporting of
unexpected livestock deaths, and ongoing recontamination following
field-butchering sick and dead cattle. The absence of reports of
livestock deaths without human cases may indicate that the only
outbreaks diagnosed are when there are human cases, ignoring the
ongoing recontamination from the animal cases and the risks involved.
- Mod.MHJ]

Rabies
------
An increase in the average long-term amount of rabies is predicted
among animals mainly in the Central, Volga and Southern Federal
Districts, where there will be a consequent high risk of human cases.
The greatest number of victims will be observed among city dwellers,
due to population movements, and an increasing number of wild
carnivorous animals and neglected pets.

[In view of this prediction, perhaps the authorities will step up
vaccination of dogs and cats in those at risk regions. And if the
long overdue application of wildlife oral vaccination remains
unrealised, then it will not be surprising if the above grim
predictions come true. If foxes are a main wildlife reservoir in
Russia, public health officials should consider an oral vaccination
program similar to the successful ones carried out in other European
countries.

African swine fever
-------------------
The Ministry of Emergency Situations also predicts new outbreaks of
African swine fever in the Caucasian region. The increased
probability of outbreaks is predicted in places with large numbers of
domestic pigs in private farms and pig-breeding facilities where the
animals are not kept indoors. The risk of infection in large
pig-breeding enterprises is not excluded in the case of failures in
the organization of measures for infectious disease protection.
