A recently discovered virus might lead to the next environmental
catastrophe in the Keys.
It's called HLV-PA, and it attacks the Caribbean spiny lobster
(_Panulirus argus_). It's the first virus ever detected in any
lobster species. And it is100-percent fatal.
So far, HLV-PA (herpes-like virus-Panulirus argus) has been seen only
in juvenile lobsters. "It's definitely a lethal disease," Butler
said, a professor of biological sciences at Old Dominion University
in Norfolk, Virginia, who discovered the virus 2 years ago in the
Keys. "We never have an animal survive. They usually die within 3 or
4 months. It kills them flat out. I don't want to be Chicken Little,
but this is a potentially scary scenario."
Commercial and recreational lobster fishing are multimillion dollar
industries in Florida; tens of thousands of divers, hunt lobsters,
and HLV-PA might be a factor in recent dramatic drops in lobster
harvests.
Butler and a handful of other scientists are in the early stages of
researching how the virus affects spiny lobsters. Among those
scientists is Jeffrey Shields, an associate professor at the Virginia
Institute of Marine Science and co-author of a paper describing
HLV-PA that will appear this year in the journal Diseases of Aquatic
Organisms.
"I work with a lot of crustaceans, and I get concerned when I see the
prevalence of a disease in more than 10 percent of a population,"
Shields said. "In juvenile spiny lobsters, we're seeing it as high as
16 percent, and that's in end-stage cases -- those animals that are
ready to die.
"The prevalence of diseases in animals that are not ready to die is
usually double, so it could be as high as 30 percent. That's pretty
dramatic."
Although research on the virus is just getting started, scientists
have made some discoveries:
The virus attacks the lobsters' blood cells and turns their blood
milky white. It appears throughout the Keys -- scientists don't know
how long it has been around or whether it affects lobsters elsewhere
in the Caribbean region. It can be transmitted from one lobster to
another.
Healthy lobsters use chemicals to detect sick lobsters and avoid
them. "These are social animals, so that's an interesting behavior,"
Butler said. "It's a natural mechanism that might help retard further
development of the disease. Let's hope Mother Nature has done it
right and has come up with a mechanism to protect these animals."
Scientists are now trying to determine whether other crustaceans are
susceptible to the virus, whether the virus started showing up
because of some other environmental problem, whether lobsters in poor
nutritional condition are more likely to catch the virus, whether the
disease's prevalence is increasing, and whether anything can be done
to protect the lobster population.
Butler and his virus team have received about $300 000 from the
National Science Foundation and the National Marine Fisheries Service
to study HLV- PA.
"One problem is that we only have funding for 2 years," Butler said.
"So unless somebody steps up, our funding will be over, and we won't
be able to continue. That's the money-grubbing fact of this
situation."
The past 2 years have not been good for Florida's lobster industry.
Between 1965 and 2000, Florida commercial fishermen have landed an
average of more than 6 million pounds of lobsters [annually], mostly
in the Keys.
During that time, the smallest harvest was 4.3 million pounds in
1983. In 2001, landings dropped to 3.4 million pounds, and in 2002,
the harvest was 2.6 million pounds. Such low landings might indicate
lower lobster populations, and lower populations might be in part the
result of HLV-PA. "We can speculate all we want, and we have to couch
it in those terms," Shields said. "I'm working with a number of
fisheries, and it's always difficult to pinpoint the cause of
mortality. But this virus is definitely something to worry about."
Spiny lobster facts
Scientific name: _Panulirus argus_
Range: Coastal and shallow Continental Shelf waters from North
Carolina to Brazil, including the Gulf of Mexico and Bermuda. A few
have been found in the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa.
Habitat: Juveniles larger than 3/4 of an inch live in sheltered bays
and hide in sponges, small coral heads, sea urchins, and the crevices
of ledges. Adults inhabit coral reef crevices and overhangs, rocky
outcroppings and ledges.
Reproduction: Spiny lobsters in Florida generally reproduce during
late spring and early summer.
Diet: A large variety of slow-moving animals including mollusks,
crustaceans, and urchins.
Predators: Groupers, sharks, loggerhead sea turtles, and octopus.
