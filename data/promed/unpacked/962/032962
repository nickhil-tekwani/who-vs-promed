Outbreak of potato wart forces fumigation
-----------------------------------------
A Government biosecurity team will fumigate an Invercargill [Southland region] garden which has a soil-borne fungal disease capable of destroying commercial potato crops.

Potato wart can be easily spread. The owner of the [infected] property said he had first noticed there was a problem last [2011] Christmas and contacted Environment Southland which then sent a sample to the Primary Industries Ministry, which inspected the property in March [2012], and began covering the infected area with plastic.

The owner said he understood the ministry would cover the remainder of the area and remove the glass house. The fumigation would start mid-November [2012] and the ministry would replace everything that had been destroyed. The ministry would provide next year's potato seeds and would continue to monitor the area.

A ministry spokesperson said all potato wart infestations had been found in domestic gardens and none in commercial crops. "If it was to spread to commercial properties, it would have a serious impact on the New Zealand potato industry."

[Potato wart disease is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and also reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia (including the South Island of New Zealand), and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds.

On infected tubers, 'eyes' develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age and eventually rot and disintegrate. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and reinfection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is therefore less damaging in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers, and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread since fungicides are ineffective. There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed but new pathogen strains are emerging compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.

Experimental methyl bromide and ethylene oxide fumigation treatments were shown to kill resting sporangia of the potato wart fungus. These appear to be the treatments adapted to field applications and mentioned above.
