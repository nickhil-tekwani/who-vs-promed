Yellow fever in Sudan, 21 November 2005
---------------------------------------
The Federal Ministry of Health reported to WHO an outbreak of yellow fever in
the South Kordofan State. As of 16 November 2005, 404 cases and 118 deaths
were reported from different localities in South Kordofan State ( Abu Gebiha,
Rashad, Dilling, Kadugli, Talodi) [427 cases with 121 deaths as of 17-18 Nov
2005 according to WHO�s Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean � see
links below. � Mod.JW]

Of 38 blood samples sent to the reference laboratory, [U.S.] Naval Medical
Research Unit, NAMRU 3 in Cairo [Egypt], 13 were confirmed positive for yellow
fever by PCR tests.

On 14 November 2005, the Federal Ministry of Health requested vaccines from
the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) emergency vaccine
stockpile. The request has been reviewed and accepted by the International
Coordinating Group and 1.7 million doses of yellow fever vaccine will be
arriving in Sudan next week.

WHO and UNICEF are supporting national authorities to ensure availability of
vaccine and rapid implementation of the mass vaccination campaign to
respond to the outbreak. Medecins sans Frontieres have opened 2 treatment
centres in Abu Gebiha and Kadugli.

[An 11 Nov 2005 report from IRIN that WHO & the Sudan health ministry had
diagnosed this outbreak as dengue (see refs. below) appears to have been
erroneous. The last recorded epidemic of YF in this area was in 1940 (Kirk R
1941 An epidemic of yellow fever in the Nuba mountains, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.
Ann.Trop.Med.Parasit. 35:67-113).
