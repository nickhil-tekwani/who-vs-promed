An outbreak of Verocytotoxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC)
O26:H11 occurred in Denmark from February to April 2007. The outbreak
was detected at Statens Serum Institut (Danish National Institute of
Health, SSI) on 9 Mar 2007 by routine PFGE typing of VTEC isolates
collected as part of the laboratory surveillance system. A total of
20 laboratory-confirmed cases were detected as part of the outbreak
(Figure -for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL). The majority of
cases were children; the median age of cases was 2 years.
Interviews with the affected families resulted in several hypotheses
concerning the source, including the possibility of a (beef) sausage.
However, a large number of different sausages were mentioned and as
the onset of symptoms in most cases was over a period of several
weeks the parents of the cases were generally not able to give
detailed information about the food items consumed by the children.
Therefore, a new hypothesis-generating method was applied.
The parents were asked to locate all supermarket purchases paid for
by credit or debit card (via their bank account statements,
accessible through their home-banking systems) and supply a list of
type and location of supermarket, date and the exact amount of money
withdrawn from their accounts. In collaboration with 2 large
supermarket chains, most of these purchases could then be traced in
the central computers of the supermarkets through a search of the
precise amount paid. Thereby a list of all individual items bought
could be produced. This method was applied to 7 families of cases
that volunteered to participate. For 6 of these cases, it was found
that a specific beef sausage had been bought by one of their parents
or, in 1 instance, the kindergarten of a child. None of the parents
had mentioned this sausage in the interviews. No other specific
products likely to be the source of a VTEC outbreak were identified
among the products purchases by the families.
Following this finding, a case-control study was conducted among 14
cases and 40 matched control-persons drawn from the Danish population
register. The results of the case-control study corroborated the
hypothesis that the specific sausage was the source of the outbreak.
The production facility of the sausage in question was then inspected
and the sausage recalled. However, at the time of recall (2 Apr
2007), the product was already sold out from all shops where it had
been on sale. It was made from frozen beef imported from a European
country. Part of this beef was still available at the plant where the
sausage was produced and was found to be culture-positive for the
outbreak strain of VTEC (with a matching PFGE profile). Subsequently,
4 sausages, including 2 whose packaging had not been opened, were
recovered from private homes; those 4 also tested positive for the
outbreak strain.
The sausage in question was an organic fermented cured beef sausage.
It had been produced as a special batch consisting of 19 080 sausages
predominantly made for sale in week 5 in 1 of the large Danish
supermarket chains. No apparent production faults were noted from the
logs kept by the producer. Investigations concerning the mechanism of
contamination of the sausage are still ongoing.
Apart from a very small number of sausages exported to Sweden, the
sausage had only been for sale in Denmark. The beef sausage was the
subject of an alert on the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF,
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/rapidalert/index_en.htm>) and the
outbreak was the subject of an Enter-net urgent enquiry
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>), but the
outbreak appears to have been confined to Denmark.
This is only the 2nd recognised general outbreak of VTEC in Denmark;
the first occurred in 2005 and was epidemiologically linked to
pasteurized organic milk (1). Lightly preserved sausages containing
meat from ruminants are well-known sources of infection with VTEC,
exemplified by the serious outbreak with VTECO103 in Norway in 2006
(2). In the present outbreak, the outbreak strain contained the gene
for eae and vtx1, but not vtx2. The potential of this strain to cause
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) was regarded as limited. In
accordance with this, the symptoms of cases were found to be mild.
Although only 20 laboratory-confirmed cases were found, the true
number of cases is believed to have been much higher. Had the
sausages been contaminated by a more virulent strain, the
consequences would have been grave. Acquiring the detailed lists of
the items bought by the affected families in the major supermarket
chains proved to be a strong tool in the hypotheses-generating phase
of the investigation and was a major help in the finding of the
source. This method may also be used for other outbreak
investigations in the future.
This outbreak underlines that fermented (beef) sausages may pose a
food safety hazard and emphasizes the need for more knowledge about
food safety in this area.

[_E. coli_ strains can be grouped by the presence of their O
(somatic) and H (flagellar) antigens, as example the typical
VTEC-associated O157:H7. The toxins produced are generally one or 2
Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx 2) as well as eae, a protein intimin that
is responsible for attachment of the organism and mucosal effacing
lesions and other virulence factors including E-hly, espA, etp and katP.
Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with VTEC
disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and
nonmotile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be
obtained from sheep and cattle and although they cause as many as 30
percent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to be somewhat less (or at
least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro
assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of
non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own
lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from
O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O103,
O111, O128, and O26 (6). The latter being the cause here.
If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3 year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA, and 28
strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2
strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
As observed here, stx genotype is usually associated with the
severity of disease and strongly determines the likelihood of
progression to HUS. Patients infected with VTEC strains that harbor
stx2 as the sole stx gene have been found to develop HUS
significantly more frequently than patients infected with strains
harboring stx1 alone or stx1 in combination with stx2.
