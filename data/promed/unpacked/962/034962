In a bid to eliminate yellow fever in the country, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said it had vaccinated over 2 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Borno and surrounding communities since February [2018]. The organisation's Communications Officer, Ms Charity Warigon, made this known in a statement in Abuja on [Fri 1 Jun 2018].

She stated that the campaign, which would run through 2018, was aimed at vaccinating 25 million Nigerians in different parts of the country, while immunisation would continue in the coming years. She noted that the campaign was in response to yellow fever cases reported in the country since 2017 when the 1st case was confirmed in Kwara. She added that since then, 41 cases were confirmed in 7 states and more than 1700 suspected cases reported from all states in the country.

Warigon said that the campaign was the largest ever yellow fever mass campaign in the country, adding that the programme was part of comprehensive strategy by WHO, UNICEF and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to Eliminate Yellow Fever (EYE) in Africa by 2026.

She stated that "in Borno where millions of people are in need of humanitarian assistance, no case of yellow fever has been confirmed so far.

The presumptive positive case of the disease however highlighted the importance of protecting the highly vulnerable population against yellow fever in this extremely fragile area.

"Since humanitarian crisis unfolded in the North East following the Boko Haram insurgency in the region, Borno has been bedevilled with problems." [she said]

The communications officer quoted Dr Wondi Alemu, the WHO Nigeria Representative, as saying "vaccinating IDPs in Borno is crucial.

"This is because protecting vulnerable populations living in high-risk conditions will prevent the spread of diseases, including yellow fever if an outbreak occurs."

She stated that the living condition of millions of people in the state and tide of outbreaks across the country made it urgent to target the most-at-risk people with the vaccination.

Warigon said WHO was also supporting the campaign in Nigeria through training of workers to help track cases, to coordinate and provide logistic support.

She noted that more than 3000 WHO-trained volunteers in Borno, including senior supervisors, healthcare workers and community leaders, worked together to vaccinate more than 2 million people aged between 9 months and 45 years in IDPs camps and surrounding host communities.

She, however, called for more efforts at creating awareness among citizens on the importance of vaccination against yellow fever.

She said vaccination was a critical part of the campaign and crucial to guarantee the protection of high number of people in the country.

She maintained that immunisation was the most important and effective measure against yellow fever, as a single dose of the vaccine was sufficient to provide life-long immunity and protection against the disease.

[In early February 2018 the World Health Organisation (WHO) said that it will immunise 1.2 million people against yellow fever (YF) in Borno state because of the large number of internally displace refugees living in camps in situations that place them at great risk of a YF outbreak. It has already vaccinated 2 million refugees there. The WHO was already working with the Federal Government and other implementing partners to control spread of the disease in 16 states of the country in the past 5 months including Abia, Anambra, Enugu, Kano, Katsina, Kogi, Kwara, Kebbi, Lagos, Nasarawa, Niger, Oyo, Plateau, and Zamfara among others. The current effort is the start of the YF vaccination campaign that would run through 2018 and was aimed at vaccinating 25 million Nigerians in different parts of the country and would be the largest ever in Nigeria. This will be a logistically difficult but needed effort. Presumably, there is an adequate supply of the vaccine for the campaign. The recent YF outbreak in several states in Nigeria indicate that the virus is present and the risk of a major outbreak is real. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
