Outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis phage type 13A infection in a Scottish
hospital
An outbreak of salmonellosis among residents of a hospital for over 200
disabled ex-servicemen and women (many of them elderly survivors of the two
world wars) to the west of Glasgow was reported to the Scottish Centre for
Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) on 2 November 1998. About 40
residents developed diarrhoea and two cases died between 23 October and 2
November. Many cases were only mildly ill but 13 people had confirmed
salmonellosis. The epidemic curve suggested a point source outbreak,
peaking on 26 October, suggestive of a foodborne outbreak associated with a
vehicle consumed after 20 October. There was no evidence to indicate a
specific vehicle, so general control measures were introduced to the
hospital's catering practices, and strict measures to prevent cross
infection were applied. These controls were fully operational by 30
October. An outbreak control team was convened, and instituted
epidemiological, microbiological, and environmental investigations.
The last confirmed cases fell ill on 1 November, which suggests that the
control measures were successful. On Monday 16 November the outbreak
control team declared the outbreak over. Over 300 faecal specimens were
taken from the 700 or so residents and staff. _Salmonella enteritidis_
phage type 13A, an unusual phage type in Scotland, had been identified by
the Scottish _Salmonella_ Reference Laboratory in 32 of these by 17
November, around 20 of whom have had symptoms suggestive of salmonella
infection. Many of the hospital residents have erratic bowel habit, and the
final case definition has yet to be applied to all the cases' clinical
histories, so the eventual tally of cases may be higher. Three residents
with pre-existing disease and salmonella infection died, but the
contribution of the infection to their deaths is unclear. Analytical
epidemiological investigations are not complete but preliminary evidence
suggests that pooled egg dishes, including scrambled eggs, may have been
vehicles of infection. This hypothesis is compatible with the environmental
evidence, but is not supported by any microbiological findings.
