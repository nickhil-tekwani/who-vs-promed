[2] India (Rajasthan): Triple disease -- dengue, chikungunya, scrub typhus
Date: Wed 29 Aug 2018
Source: The Times of India (TOI), Times News Network (TNN) [edited]
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/rare-triple-disease-combination-shocks-docs/articleshow/65585198.cms


An uncommon combination of triple diseases -- dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus, has shocked Sawai Man Singh Hospital (SMS) hospital doctors. 2 such cases have already been reported in 11 days.

When a 63-year-old was rushed to SMS Hospital from Kotputli of Jaipur district, she had double pneumonia, breathing problems, low platelet count, and abnormal functioning of liver and kidneys. She was brought to SMS hospital on [19 Aug 2018] and died on [23 Aug 2018] while undergoing treatment. When the doctors conducted diagnostic tests, they found that she tested positive for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus.

The rare combination of the triple diseases -- dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus, has shocked the SMS hospital doctors. 2 days before [the woman who died] was rushed to SMS Hospital, a [23-year-old man] from Baswa of Dausa district, was brought to the hospital, on [17 Aug 2018]. The doctors immediately admitted him and began with the treatment. He has recovered and was discharged from the hospital on [Mon 27 Aug 2018].

[The man] was brought to the hospital with high-grade fever and altered sensorium. The doctors provided him with treatment and he responded to the treatment well. "Both patients were brought to the hospital with a more or less similar condition -- double pneumonia, breathing problems, low platelet count, and abnormal functioning of liver and kidneys. These complications can be found in a patient suffering from dengue, or chikungunya, or scrub typhus. But when we conducted tests, we found that they (both patients) have a triple combination of these diseases. So it is quite necessary for doctors not to rule out other diseases, if a patient is tested positive for one disease," said Dr CL Nawal, senior professor (medicine), SMS Hospital.

The cases of scrub typhus, which was termed as a mysterious disease, were reported first from Alwar district, almost 10 years ago. But the disease, which is caused by the bite of a mite, has started affecting other districts such as Dausa, Karauli, Dholpur, Bharatpur, and also rural areas of Jaipur. Now, it has started targeting its victims in combination with other vector-borne diseases. A private hospital consultant physician, Dr Adil Aziz, said, "It is quite uncommon that we find a patient suffering from the 3 diseases scrub typhus, chikungunya, and dengue. We report combinations of diseases such as malaria (_Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_), or malaria and dengue, but patients with scrub typhus, chikungunya, and dengue at the same time, are very uncommon.

The reason for cases of the triple diseases being reported, could be a spurt in cases of scrub typhus. In SMS Hospital, 411 cases of scrub typhus have already been reported this year [2018], and 415 cases of dengue were reported. However, only 11 cases of chikungunya have been reported so far in 2018.
