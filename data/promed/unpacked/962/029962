COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), Hong Kong (SAR-PRC)
------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 24 Jul 2020 from Dr. Thomas Sit, Chief Veterinary Officer/Assistant Director (Inspection & Quarantine), Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, Hong Kong, Hong Kong (SAR-PRC)

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 21 Jul 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 23 Jul 2020
Report date: 24 Jul 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 24 Jul 2020
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: Zoonotic potential unknown at this time
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Sheung Wan, Central and Western District, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Jul 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A cat kept in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 patient. The animal did not show any relevant clinical signs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Likely human-to-animal transmission.
Epidemiological comments: The cat was placed under quarantine on 21 Jul 2020 after confirmation of a human case from the same household. Following veterinary examination, nasal, oral and rectal swab samples were taken after the cat's admission to the quarantine facility. The oral sample was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The cat has not exhibited any specific clinical signs. Investigations are continuing to determine the duration of virus detection. Risk management measures are in place for this case, including cleansing and disinfection of the premises, and proper personal hygiene and protection. Mammalian pets from household with confirmed human cases will be collected for testing of SARS-CoV-2 as appropriate.

Control measures
Measures applied: Screening; traceability; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory) / Cat / Real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 21 Jul 2020 / Positive
School of Public Health, The University of Hong Kong (regional reference laboratory) / Cat / RRT-PCR / 23 Jul 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging disease which means, as defined by the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, 'a new occurrence in an animal of a disease, infection or infestation, causing a significant impact on animal or public health resulting from:

1. a change of a known pathogenic agent or its spread to a new geographic area or species; or
2. a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the first time.'

OIE Members are required to notify the OIE of the detection of an emerging disease as set out in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code." Source: https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/A_Reporting_SARS-CoV-2_to_the_OIE.pdf

"Now that SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely distributed in the human population, there is a possibility for certain animal species to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for animal and human health, animal welfare, for wildlife conservation, and for biomedical research.

"Cats (domestic and large cats), mink, and dogs have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the field setting, following contact with humans known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In the field setting, cats have shown clinical signs of disease including respiratory and gastrointestinal signs. SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink has been characterized by respiratory disease and an increased mortality rate.

"Although several animal species have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, these infections are not a driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; the pandemic is driven by human-to-human transmission.

"Further information about these events, which have reported to the OIE, can be found below on the page 'Events in Animals' (see https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/).

"Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. To date, findings from experimental infection studies suggest that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Findings from laboratory studies suggest that, of the animal species investigated so far, cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and cats can be affected with clinical disease. In an experimental laboratory setting, cats were able to transmit infection to other cats. In the laboratory setting, ferrets were susceptible to infection and able to transmit infection to other ferrets, although they appear to be less affected by clinical disease. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for future studies, e.g., to evaluate vaccines or therapeutics. Golden Syrian hamsters, as well as cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be consistently infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may show clinical signs. Dogs appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected than ferrets or cats. Egyptian fruit bats were also infected in the laboratory setting but did not show signs of disease. The infected fruit bats were able to transmit infection to other fruit bats."

"People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness.

"Animals suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should remain separated from other animals and humans." Source: Technical factsheet on infection with SARS-CoV-2 in animals, available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/A_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2__1_.pdf. - Mod.CRD
