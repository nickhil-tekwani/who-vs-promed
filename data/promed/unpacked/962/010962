Panama's Health Minister Luis Francisco Sucre on Monday [12 Dec 2022] reported the 1st malaria death case in the indigenous community of Guna Yala, east of the capital.

Sucre explained that on the past 8 Dec 2022 the patient was taken to hospital with some health complications and passed away 3 days later.

So far this year [2022], the Health Ministry's Epidemiology Department has reported as many as 5710 cases of malaria, and the Guna Yala region and Darien and Panama East provinces are the regions with the highest incidence.

Since 2020, Panama has been part of a Mesoamerican regional initiative aimed at eliminating malaria, and is currently developing a strategy with the acronym DTIR (detection, treatment, investigation, response) for each case; however, more and more cases are being reported.

According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the 1st common symptoms of malaria are fever, headache, chills, and vomiting; usually appear 10 to 15 days after infection.

[Guna Yala, formerly known as San Blas, is a provincial-level indigenous region of the Guna people located in northeast Panama along the Caribbean Sea. _Plasmodium vivax_ is the only malarial species reported in Panama and fatalities due to _P. vivax_ are very rare, so it would be interesting to know if malaria was the primary cause of death in the case reported above, or if it was a concomitant infection in the setting of one or more life-threatening comorbidities.

Worldwide, there was a marked increase in malaria cases and deaths in 2020 compared to 2019, and much of this is attributable to disruptions in malaria prevention, diagnosis, and treatment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the WHO Region of the Americas, Panama, and 6 other countries (Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Suriname, and Venezuela) all had a >40% estimated increase in malaria incidence in 2020 compared to 2015 (1). As of 5 Dec 2022, the Panama Ministry of Health (MINSA) has registered 5710 cases of malaria, which is more than any prior year since 2000, with the previous high of 5365 cases in 2004 (ref.1, Annex 5-F).

Guna Yala has the highest incidence of malaria of any region in Panama, even though it has one of the lowest populations (approximately 33 000). This high per-capita incidence of malaria may be due in part to its long Caribbean coastline and other climactic conditions. However, Guna Yala is also a politically autonomous and relatively remote region where access to health services is limited. Cases of malaria are mainly detected through intermittent active surveillance by visiting MINSA technicians who obtain thick blood smears from individuals with fever. A recent study in Guna Yala using community health workers to conduct systematic malaria rapid diagnostic tests in 39 target communities found a much higher rate of positive tests (22%) compared to intermittent active surveillance (3-4%), suggesting that a large number of malaria cases are missed because people are either absent or asymptomatic at the time of routine active surveillance visits (ref. 2).
