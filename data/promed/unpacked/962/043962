Since 8 Jun 2011, Member States have started reporting cases
according to a new EU case-definition [see below - Mod.LL]. This
resulted with marginal adjustments of figures compared to previous
reports in 5 Member States, Finland (that is not reporting cases
anymore), France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.

On 22 May 2011, Germany reported a significant increase in the number
of patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and bloody diarrhea
caused by Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC). Since 2 May 2011,
795 cases of HUS and 2287 non-HUS STEC cases have been reported from
EU Member States, including 759 HUS cases and 2229 non-HUS STEC cases
in Germany. 22 of the HUS cases and 9 non-HUS STEC cases in EU Member
states have died [total = 31 - Mod.LL].

While HUS, caused by STEC infections, is usually observed in children
under 5 years of age, in this outbreak the great majority of cases are
adults, with around 2/3s being women.

Laboratory results indicate that STEC serogroup O104:H4
(Stx2-positive, eae-negative, hly-negative, ESBL, aat, aggR, aap) is
the causative agent. PFGE results shows indistinguishable pattern of 7
human O104:H4 outbreak strains in Germany and 2 strains of O104:H4 in
Denmark.

Although the source of the outbreak is still under investigation,
food items [sprouts, see below - Mod.LL] originating from a specific
farm in northern Germany have been indicated by the German authorities
as the most likely vehicle of infection.

Most cases are from, or have a history of travel to the North of
Germany (mainly Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony,
North-Rhine-Westphalia and Hamburg). In the EU/EEA, Austria, Denmark,
Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the UK have
reported cases of HUS, while 5 other Member States have reported only
non-HUS STEC cases.

[2] Germany Joint Institute Statement
Date: 10 Jun 2011
Source: Robert Koch Institute [edited]
http://www.rki.de/cln_151/nn_217400/EN/Home/PM082011.html


Joint statement issued by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment
(BfR), Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food safety (BVL),
Robert Koch Institute (RKI)

Conclusions
-----------
BfR, BVL and RKI jointly conclude that the current general
recommendation to abstain from eating cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce in
northern parts of Germany does not need to be upheld.

In addition to adherence to good hygiene practices, BfR, BVL and RKI
recommend abstaining from eating raw sprouts. Households and
gastronomic businesses should dispose of any sprouts currently in
stock as well as any food items that might have come in contact with
these.

BfR, BVL and RKI recommend in addition that all food products
originating from a distinct producer in Lower Saxony be taken from the
market.

BfR, BVL and RKI recommend strict adherence to good hygienic
practices when handling food or caring for patients.

This notice replaces earlier recommendations issued by BfR and RKI
regarding the consumption of cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce.

State of knowledge regarding human infections
---------------------------------------------
Current situation
-----------------
Data from several surveillance systems established at the Robert Koch
Institute confirm a decline in the number of new EHEC infections. The
sentinel surveillance system established in hospital emergency
departments shows that the daily number of patients presenting with
bloody diarrhea -- as the 1st indication of a possible EHEC infection
-- as well as the proportion of female cases is declining.
Mathematical modeling of statutory notification data taking into
account the notification delay also confirms that the number of
reported cases in the affected areas is continually decreasing, both
using the date of symptom onset as well as the date of
hospitalization. The observed decline may be due to changes in the
dietary consumption of cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce (which may
indirectly have led to a reduced consumption of sprouts) or to a
gradual disappearance of the source of infection.

Earlier epidemiological studies
-------------------------------
Since 20 May 2011 RKI together with other federal and state
authorities for health and food safety has been investigating an
outbreak of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in northern Germany. The
cause of the outbreak could be progressively narrowed down through the
analysis of several consecutive epidemiological studies that built
upon one another.

For methodological reasons, the 1st 2 case-control studies were
limited to exposures that were hypothesized -- based on extensive
exploratory interviews -- to potentially explain a large proportion of
cases. Epidemiological analysis of these studies showed that cases
consumed raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce significantly more often
than healthy study participants. These findings were complemented by
results of another case-control study conducted among affected
customers of a canteen that revealed a strong association between the
consumption of foods from the salad bar and EHEC infection. As neither
the results of these studies results nor available information from
investigations of the food safety authorities permitted a more precise
identification of the source of infections, RKI initiated further
studies.

Recipe-based restaurant cohort study
------------------------------------
With a high probability, the results of the "recipe-based restaurant
cohort study" finally permit narrowing down the source of the
infection to the consumption of sprouts. It was possible to apply this
methodological approach only after a sufficient number of restaurant
customers could be identified to ensure adequate statistical power of
this analysis.

To ascertain the consumption of raw fruit and vegetables by patients
and controls more objectively and less dependently on memory, RKI used
the following approach in the "recipe-based restaurant cohort study":
5 groups (travel groups, clubs, etc) that comprised a total of 112
participants and included 19 individuals who acquired EHEC infection
were questioned regarding the foods they consumed after eating in a
common restaurant. Additionally, the menus ordered by the participants
were identified by means of order lists and meal receipts. The
restaurant kitchen was questioned in detail regarding the preparation
and the type and quantity of ingredients in each menu ordered by any
of the study participants. Furthermore, available photographs taken by
travel group members were analysed to confirm which food items,
including toppings, were seen on the plates. The data thus gathered
was analyzed in a cohort approach that permits the retrospective
estimation of the relative risk of infection for the restaurant
customers. Results of this analysis showed that customers who ate
sprouts had an 8.6-fold increased risk (95 percent confidence interval
(CI) 1.5 to infinity) of EHEC/HUS illness compared to those who did
not. This study also revealed that 100 percent of those who contracted
the illness had eaten sprouts.

Insights from case-control-studies regarding the consumption of
sprouts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patients were questioned on the consumption of a large number of
animal and plant origin food products, including sprouts, in the
initial intensive exploratory interviews in Hamburg on 20 and 21 May
2011. In these, only 3 of 12 patients reported having eaten sprouts.
Moreover, a relevant under-ascertainment of sprout consumption seemed
unlikely since the participants of this survey demonstrated an
exceptionally high dietary awareness. Methodological standards in
outbreak investigations call for inclusion of those exposures in the
standardized questionnaires that can potentially explain a high
proportion of outbreak cases. The inclusion of too many potential
exposures may lead to false positive associations. For these reasons,
sprouts were not included in the questionnaires of the initial case
control studies. Later, more extensive interviews subsequently
conducted by RKI again included the consumption of sprouts. Overall,
16 (30 percent) of 54 patients who could answer questions on the
consumption of sprouts in the context of these extensive interviews
stated having eaten sprouts within the time frame consistent with the
period of acquisition of the infection.

An additional case-control-study with the goal of further
differentiating among plant food products was initiated on 29 May 2011
in Lubeck, Bremerhaven, and Bremen using 3 healthy controls matched
according to age, sex and place of residence to each of 26 HUS
patients. In this study, 6 (25 percent) of 24 cases stated having
eaten sprouts in the incriminated period of infection, compared to 7
(9 percent) of 80 healthy controls. This association was statistically
significant in univariate (odds ratio: 4.35, 95 percent CI 1.05-18),
but not in multivariate analysis, thus limiting the explanatory power
of this result. Compared to controls, cases included in this study
reported eating vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce
more frequently, a finding in accordance with the earlier
case-control-studies. However, these associations were not
statistically significant. Overall, these findings are thus consistent
with the results of the 2 previously published case-control-studies
and show these vegetables to be frequently eaten together.

State of Knowledge regarding the food supply chain
--------------------------------------------------
So far, the EHEC pathogen O104:H4 was not detected in any food
product from the retail market. A definitive point of entry of the
EHEC pathogen O104:H4 into the food supply chain has not been
identified despite intensive efforts of all authorities involved in
the affected federal states as well as RKI, BfR, and BVL.

According to current knowledge, distribution chains suggest that the
spread of the EHEC infections may have emanated from an agricultural
business in Lower Saxony and are in accordance with the geographical
distribution of many of the case clusters.

To support the investigation of this outbreak affecting several
federal states, the federal and state level decided to establish a
task force at BVL consisting of experts from several states, BVL, BfR
and RKI, and supported by experts of the European Food Safety
Authority (EFSA) as well as the European Commission.

The mission of this Task Force is to analyse the available
epidemiological results on individual outbreak clusters in conjunction
with information on related food supply chains available from food
safety authorities across federal states. Clusters consist of persons
who contracted the disease after a common exposure, such as eating in
the same hotel, restaurant or canteen.

Distribution supply chains of sprouts originating from the Lower
Saxony producer can explain 26 of 55 EHEC O104:H4 disease clusters or
isolated cases in 5 German states. Lower Saxony has provided extensive
information from food control activities. At present, human
introduction of the EHEC pathogen into the agricultural business
cannot be excluded. However, water, preceding suppliers or seeds are
also possible sources. These possibilities are currently under
investigation through investigations of supply chains and laboratory
analyses.

Other sources of contamination into this specific agricultural
production cannot be excluded at present. The authorities in Lower
Saxony and BfR have taken extensive samples in this business in the
past few days, the investigation of which has not been entirely
completed. Even if the outbreak pathogen has not been detected in any
samples thus far, the accumulated evidence strongly points to this
producer as the source of the outbreak.

The federal and state authorities will perform further investigations
and analyses of supply and distribution chains to investigate whether
contaminated seed for sprout production may be present in other
companies or could reach the market.

Because the seed used for the production of sprouts may also be the
source of the pathogen, other sprout producing businesses could
potentially be contributing to the spread of EHEC O104:H4 as well.

The ability to survive and grow on sprouts makes a wide distribution
of EHEC through the supply chains of the producers to the consumer
possible.

Therefore, RKI, BVL and BfR recommend not eating uncooked sprouts
until this potential source of the contamination has been thoroughly
investigated.

This information replaces the earlier warning of RKI and BfR against
the consumption of cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce. According to the
current state of knowledge, products from the agricultural business in
Lower Saxony are the most likely source of the EHEC infections.

[3] "Smoking" sprouts
Date: Fri 10 Jun 2011
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/germany-pins-down-ecoli-its-the-bean-sprouts

Germany said on Friday, 10 Jun 2011, that deadly _E. coli_ bacteria
that have killed 31 people and hit farmers across Europe almost
certainly came from contaminated bean sprouts grown at an organic farm
in northern Germany. Traces of the deadly strain were detected in a
packet of bean sprouts from the farm found in a family's rubbish bin
in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 2 family members fell
ill after eating the produce.

The discovery came just hours after health officials in Berlin said
they had identified bean sprouts or similar shoots as the most likely
source of the outbreak, citing a study of patients and the food they
ate.

On Friday, 10 Jun 2011, the state consumer protection agency in North
Rhine-Westphalia said it had found the 1st direct _E. coli_ link to
the organic farm in the neighboring state of Lower Saxony, near the
small town of Bienenbuettel. "According to our knowledge to date, the
bean sprouts originated from the farm," the state agency said.

Bean sprouts, a common salad ingredient grown from a variety of
seeds, are popular in Germany, where they are served in salads and
often in sandwiches. The institute said Burger's comments covered a
wide range of shoots. The investigation has focused on the organic
farm for days, and the agriculture minister for Lower Saxony said
separately he was convinced this was where the outbreak had begun.

Gert Lindemann, the minister, had earlier said that alfalfa, mung
bean, radish and arugula sprouts from the farm near Bienenbuettel
might all be linked to the outbreak. "The chain of evidence pointing
to bean sprouts is flawless. For us, the source of the outbreak is
definitely the farm in Bienenbuettel," Lindemann said on Friday, 10
Jun 2011. The farm has been shut down and is no longer delivering
vegetables to market.

Authorities said on Friday it was now safe to eat tomatoes,
cucumbers, and leafy salads, food originally suspected as the source,
but bean sprouts should be avoided while studies continue.

[4] Epidemiological link to sprouts
Date: Fri 10 Jun 2011
Source: New York Times
http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/world/europe/11ecoli.html


After days of confusion, German authorities said Friday, 10 Jun 2011,
that they had finally narrowed down the most likely cause of one of
the world's worst recorded _E. coli_ outbreaks to contaminated,
home-grown bean-sprouts. But they also warned that new cases were
still being reported and that key questions remained unanswered,
including how pathogens came into contact with the sprouts and whether
some of the contaminated produce is still in circulation.

At a news conference here, Reinhard Burger, the head of the country's
disease control agency, said that all the tests on sprouts from the
suspect source, a farm in Lower Saxony state, had proven negative, but
that by studying the pattern of the infection, "it was possible to
narrow down epidemiologically the highly probable cause of the
outbreak of the illness to the consumption of sprouts."

"It was the sprouts," he declared.

The outbreak claimed at least 30 lives in Germany, unsettled the
nation and threw European agriculture into disarray. The announcement
of a likely cause went some way to assuring German consumers that at
least some of the food earlier suspected of containing toxins, notably
cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuces, was now officially declared safe for
consumption. But many shop-keepers were furious with the authorities'
handling of the crisis.

"It is possible that the source of the infection has now been
exhausted, that is to say, that the food has either been eaten or
thrown away," Mr. Burger said. He said investigators had examined 112
people, 19 of whom had been infected with_ E. coli_ during a group
visit to a single restaurant, and had examined recipes for the food
they had eaten, spoken to the chefs who prepared it and even examined
photographs they had taken of one another with their choice of food on
the table.

The aim was "to discover exactly how each meal prepared, which
ingredients went into it," he said. The result was that customers who
ate sprouts were found to be almost 9 times more likely to be infected
than other diners. It was this trail, from hospital beds to
restaurants, that led health inspectors back along the food chain to
an organic farm at Bienenbuttel south-east of Hamburg, where the
sprouts originated.
