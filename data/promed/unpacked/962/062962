Gammalin 20, not cholera, caused mass killing in Adamawa, says government
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adamawa state Government has given more insight into the outbreak of
[suspected] cholera in the northern senatorial district of the state
which has so far claimed over 300 lives.

The State commissioner for health, Dr Tijjani Maksha, told newsmen in
Yola Friday (17 Dec 2010) that the killer disease is not cholera, but
a waterborne disease linked to Gammalin 20.

According to the state commissioner, a river that runs through all the
5 local Governments was poisoned with Gammalin 20 either by fishermen
or saboteurs resulting in the massive killing of people, especially
children and the aged.

Dr. Maksha disclosed that a team of medical experts drafted to the
area said that the rising death toll occasioned by the epidemic is
associated with the poisoning of river tributaries in all the local
governments in the northern parts of the state. He added that
concerted moves are on to combat the epidemic scourge, even as the
death toll has continued to rise.

But, he was quick to add that things being equal, the ravaging
epidemic is under control already. He gave an assurance that the
affected local government, especially the communities using the rivers
as their main sources of drinking water, have been directed to stop
forthwith as alternative sources are being provided for them.

The councils are Michika, Madagali, Mubi North, Mubi South and Maiha.

[Gammalin 20 is a marketed name for the organocholorine chemical
compound more commonly known as lindane.

Hexachlorocyclohexane gamma-, also known as HCH gamma- or lindane, is
a white solid that turns into a vapor when released into the air. Once
released, it looks colorless but has a musty odor. HCH gamma- is a
man-made chemical and it exists in 8 different forms.

There are several ways that you can be exposed to HCH gamma-. You can
be exposed by eating HCH gamma- contaminated food like plants, meat or
dairy products (milk). You could breathe contaminated air if your
workplace makes or uses HCH gamma-. It is possible to be exposed by
drinking HCH contaminated water or by breathing HCH released from
waste sites or landfills. You could be exposed through skin contact if
you use soaps, lotions or shampoo containing HCH gamma- that help
treat and control head and body lice and scabies. Nursing mothers that
have been exposed to HCH gamma- can pass it on to their babies in
breast milk.

Workers exposed to HCH gamma- while making pesticides showed signs of
lung irritation, heart disorders, blood disorders, headache,
convulsions, and changes in sex hormones. Humans and animals exposed
to large amounts of HCH gamma- died. Reports show that some people who
swallowed high doses of HCH gamma- had seizures and some died. Others
exposed to very large doses developed blood disorders and had
seizures. People who breathed HCH gamma- in the workplace developed
blood disorders, experienced dizziness, headaches, and showed changes
in the levels of sex hormones.

HCH gamma- can get into your body when you eat foods that contain the
substance. When you breathe contaminated air, HCH gamma- can get into
your lungs. When you use HCH gamma- containing products to remove lice
and scabies, the substance can enter your body through your skin. Once
in your body, the HCH gamma is stored for a short time in body fat.
HCH gamma tends to leave the body very quickly through urine. Small
amounts leave the body in feces and when you exhale (breathe out).

Lindane has been used in human and animal medicine to treat scabies.
However, organochlorines have been shown to block GABA
neurotransmitters and is a neurotoxin. Additionally both high doses
and prolonged use have resulted in liver, kidney and neurological
dysfunction. Consumption of high doses over long periods of time do
not have documented consequences.

As topical drug on the skin it rarely causes a reaction, although it
has caused skin irritation and rarely seizures.

While very high doses, prolonged use, or consumption of the chemical
has resulted in adverse health effects, including death, the fact that
this chemical is in the water should dilute the chemical concentration
and its effects. However, those with previous health conditions may be
weakened in some way and more susceptible.

I am uncertain if cholera is actually persisting in the region and
this chemical spill is a coincidence because generally the clinical
signs associated with lindane or other related organochlorine
intoxications do not seem that closely related to the clinical signs
of cholera. However, I am not certain which form of the chemical or
the concentration of the chemical was found in the water. So I suppose
misdiagnosing this "outbreak" as cholera is possible, but it seems a
stretch to me.
