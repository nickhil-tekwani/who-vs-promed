Mumps outbreak hits Metro Vancouver
-----------------------------------
The British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has issued a
health alert for mumps virus infection for the Lower Mainland,
following an outbreak in Whistler earlier this spring [see ProMED-mail
report archived as: Mumps - Canada: (BC) 20110415.1188]. A total of 77
people have contracted the disease according to the BCCDC. About 50 of
those cases were from an earlier outbreak in Whistler and Squamish and
the rest have been in the Lower Mainland. About 70 per cent of the
cases were between 18 and 35 years of age, but cases have ranged from
one to 54 years of age.

"We do have cases in the Vancouver area now, whereas the earlier part
of the outbreak was really in Whistler and Squamish," said Dr Monica
Naus. It's the 1st sizeable mumps outbreak in the province since 2008
and it is largely affecting young adults. But the centre did not say
how many cases have been discovered or specify where it has been
detected around Metro Vancouver or the Fraser Valley. In 2008 nearly
200 people in the Fraser Valley and Metro Vancouver were infected with
the normally rare virus. The outbreak was been traced back to a Fraser
Valley religious group that opposes the mumps vaccination.

"Symptoms of mumps include fever, sore throat or cough, swelling of
the salivary glands, usually the parotid glands, resulting in
'chipmunk cheeks'," said the alert, which was issued on Monday [20 Jun
2011]. "Mumps can cause meningitis, and orchitis (inflammation of the
testicles) which is more common in adult males and rarely results in
sterility, as well as other serious complications such as deafness. It
is spread by respiratory secretions through coughing and sneezing but
also direct contact such as kissing or sharing utensils or water
bottles."

"Anyone who suspects they have mumps should contact their physician
by telephone 1st or call the HealthLink BC. Mumps is contagious so
anyone with this infection should avoid exposing others especially in
medical waiting rooms and emergency rooms," according to the alert.

The centre is asking parents to immunize their children with the MMR
vaccine and for adults to make sure their own immunizations are up to
date. "In BC, children receive 2 doses of mumps vaccine at 12 and 18
months. The vaccine is given as the combined measles, mumps and
rubella (MMR) vaccine, and provides protection against all 3 diseases.
For best protection against mumps, those born in 1970 and later should
also receive 2 doses."

Since 1995, children in BC have received a mumps vaccine at 12 months
of age and 18 months, Dr Perry Kendall, the provincial health officer
said in 2008. But older children may have only gotten one dose of the
vaccine, meaning they are at an 80 per cent level of protection,
versus 95 per cent protection for those with a 2nd dose.

[Mumps typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle
aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, and is followed by swelling of
salivary glands. Anyone who is not immune from either previous mumps
infection or from vaccination can get mumps. The incubation period for
mumps virus infection can range from 12-25 days (commonly 14-18 days).
Most mumps virus transmission is thought to occur before the salivary
glands begin to swell and for up to 5 days after the swelling
commences.

Vaccination is normally achieved using the MMR (measles, mumps and
rubella) triple vaccine, which has the added advantage of enhancing
immunity to measles virus infection in children and young adults who
may be at risk of measles infection through inadequate or no previous
vaccination.
