Taking time out from his trip to Africa, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China was determined to clean up the scandal-ridden industry, ordering local authorities to conduct an investigation immediately and release the findings to the public "on time" to ensure social stability. "The violations by Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology are serious and appalling," state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying, as police in Changchun took the company's chairwoman Gao Junfang and 4 senior executives away for questioning.

Xi also ordered the authorities to use severe punishment "to cure the chronic disease [of corruption] and scratch poison from one's bones." He told the authorities to resolutely "improve the supervision of vaccines and guard the bottom line of safety in order to safeguard public interest and social security."

The orders echoed zero-tolerance directives by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the weekend in response to revelations that Changsheng Bio-tech had produced inferior DPT (diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus) vaccines for children as young as 3 months old. "No matter what companies or people are involved, severe punishment would be meted to all who [violated the safety standards], and there would be no tolerance," CCTV quoted Li as saying. Li said the incident crossed a "moral bottom line" and ordered an investigation into the "complete production and sale processes" of the vaccines.

Meanwhile, officials in the east Chinese province of Shandong said there had been no reports of any children sickened by the inferior vaccines. In a report on [Mon 23 Jul 2018], newspaper Dazhong Daily quoted the Shandong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention as saying that, while the DPT vaccines were ineffective, they were not thought to be harmful. It said also it had records for all 215 184 children who were given the shots.

As a new vaccine scandal grips China, parents say they've lost faith in the system. It is not the 1st time the Chinese leader has vowed to clean up the vaccine industry. Li made much the same pledge more than 2 years ago in response to a similar scandal. According to a statement on the government's website, Li said in March 2016 that China "must fix" the loopholes in the supervision of vaccine production and distribution after it was revealed that a total of CNY 570 million [USD 83.9 million] worth of improperly stored or expired drugs had been sold across the country over several years.

In the latest scandal, it is thought that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Chinese children might have been injected with ineffective vaccines, made by the country's largest producers, under a compulsory government health-care system. Fury and fear filled China's social media over the weekend as parents questioned how such a scandal could have been allowed to happen. On WeChat, the country's most popular messaging service, the Chinese word for vaccine appeared in 321 million articles and searches, 80 times the number of times it appeared on [Fri 20 Jul 2018].

The Jilin Food and Drug Administration, where Changsheng Bio-tech is based, said on its website on [Fri 20 Jul 2018] that the company sold about 252 600 substandard DPT vaccines to the Shandong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency in charge of public health in a province of about 100 million people. For that offence, Changsheng Bio-tech was fined CNY 3.4 million [USD 500 691], but it was also revealed that the company had been guilty of another serious violation over the manufacture of rabies vaccines.

The State Drug Administration said on [Sun 15 Jul 2018] that during an unannounced inspection of the listed company, officials discovered forged data relating to about 113 000 rabies vaccines. The watchdog revoked the company's license to produce the drug and said it might launch a criminal investigation.

Changsheng Bio-tech issued a statement via the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on [Sun 22 Jul 2018] saying it was "deeply sorry" and had stopped production of DPT. The company's share price has nearly halved in the past week, and trading in the stock was suspended on [Mon 23 Jul 2018].

In November, China's national drug watchdog announced that Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, another major vaccine producer, had sold 400 520 inferior DPT vaccines to Chongqing and Hebei.

A father in Guangzhou, whose daughter was given 4 doses of DPT produced by Changsheng and the Wuhan Institute in 2015 and 2017, told the South China Morning Post on [Sun 22 Jul 2018] that he no longer had any faith in vaccines made in China. The man, surnamed Lin, said he planned to take his daughter to Hong Kong for vaccinations in the future. "I [and my family] will not be having any more vaccinations on the mainland until the government takes real and serious steps to resolve this issue," he said.

China's drug watchdog has told the country's 2nd-biggest maker of rabies vaccines to stop production after a snap inspection uncovered evidence of forged data, dealing yet another blow to the scandal-plagued pharmaceutical industry.

The State Drug Administration said inspectors found serious violations of a protocol for drug production involving the Vero-cell rabies vaccine at Changchun Changsheng Bio-technology, in Changchun, in the northern province of Jilin.

In a statement on [Sun 22 Jul 2018], the administration said it ordered its Jilin branch to revoke the company's Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for medical products certificate, an essential license for production. The statement said the batch involved in the inspection had not been put on the market, and inspectors from the Jilin drug regulator and the administration were stationed at the company for further investigation. The administration did not give details of the forged data.

Rabies is a deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals and is usually transmitted through a bite. It can also cause pain, headaches, fever, seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. Treatment for exposure to an infected animal involves a series of shots.

Tao Lina, a vaccination specialist at the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said the incident was serious and would undermine to the public's already weakened confidence in vaccines. "The incident is very severe in nature because it has dealt another blow to the public's confidence in domestically produced vaccines," Tao said. "The regulator should punish the company by revoking their production licenses and imposing a very hefty fine."

Just 2 years ago, a scandal erupted in China over revelations that about CNY 570 million [USD 83.9 million] of improperly stored or expired vaccines were illegally sold across the country for years.

Changsheng Life Sciences, Changchun Changsheng's Shenzhen-listed parent company, said in a statement on [Mon 23 Jul 2018] that the company had voluntarily recalled and sealed all the rabies vaccines that had been sent to disease control centres and hospitals. It also defended its quality by saying "no adverse effects related to the quality of the vaccine have been found from years of adverse effects monitoring." Changsheng said it had about 23 percent of the market for rabies vaccines and produced about 3.54 million sets of the shots last year. Rival Liaoning Chengda Biotechnology made about 8.4 million.

According to Changchun Changsheng, its vaccine was registered for use in India, Cambodia, and Nigeria by last year. But it was unclear whether any had been exported.

The scandal comes less than a year after a batch of the company's DPT vaccine to prevent diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus was found to be substandard. The 252 600 vaccines in the batch had been sold to disease-control and prevention centres in Shandong province. The authorities conducted a 2-month investigation but did not release their findings.
