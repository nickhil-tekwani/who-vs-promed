[This OIE report clarifies what we had been unclear before. The incident now appears to involve 2 medium sized dairy herds in the same village of Staskovce. As they seem to have come down essentially together there could well be a common source. Being at the onset of winter there will be little fly activity to take the infection from one herd to the next. Let us hope that we have a ProMED-mail member within the Slovak state veterinary service who can brief us as to what they have discovered.

Comparing the OIE maps in relation to this outbreak and the 3 in 2010, this Staskovce, Stropkov, village appears to be close but to the north east of the 2010 outbreaks in Stefurov, near Svidnik. - Mod.MHJ
