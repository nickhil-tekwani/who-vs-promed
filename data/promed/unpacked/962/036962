Potato ring rot has shown up on at least 2 Prince Edward Island
farms, the provincial Department of Agriculture has confirmed. The
Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is investigating now to
determine the extent of the problem.

"It's on 2 farms on a couple of lots on those operations," said Dave
McManus, CFIA. "They're doing an investigation to determine the
source of infection. We [are] testing any lots of the same source --
if they're on other farms -- and also all the lots on the farm where
the ring rot was detected."

There is zero tolerance for ring rot in seed potatoes. "When
bacterial rot is found in a seed lot, those farms will lose their
seed potato status," said McManus. "They can market their potatoes
for table stock but not for seed."

McManus said it has been several years since ring rot has been found
in Prince Edward Island. The locations of the affected farms have not
been disclosed.

[Ring rot of potato is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_. It is found in parts of North
America, northern and eastern Europe with reported yield losses of up
to 50 percent. Many solanaceous species, including tomato and
eggplant, are also susceptible, and the pathogen has also been found
associated with symptomless infections of sugar beet and sugar beet seed.

Symptoms on potato may include wilting and yellowing of leaves, rot
of the vascular ring of tubers with emerging bacterial ooze, and
extensive tuber rot followed by internal hollowing, cracking, and
mummification. Wilting symptoms may occur late in the season and are
often masked by the natural senescence of the crop. Symptom
expression depends on host cultivar and is favoured by cool climates.
Tubers with ring rot are often subjected to secondary invasion by
other bacteria and fungi, which can result in total loss of tubers in
the field or in storage.

The pathogen is spread by infected seed tubers or other plant
material, plant-to-plant contact, soil and mechanical means (for
example during harvest or grading). The bacteria can survive for
several years on dry surfaces and for over a month in water. They can
overwinter in unharvested potatoes or crop debris. Ring rot can pass
through one or more field generations without causing symptoms, and
latently infected tubers are an important means of spreading the
disease. Laboratory tests are needed to detect latent infections.
Disease management is expensive and may include the use of clean seed
potatoes, cultural practices, and plant hygiene measures before and
after harvest.
