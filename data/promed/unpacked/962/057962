The deadly dengue haemorrhagic fever claimed the life of a 16 year old girl
at the weekend, igniting fears of an outbreak in Mount Salem, one of this
resort's most depressed inner-city communities.
A student of the Caribbean Christian Centre for the deaf died at the
Cornwall Regional Hospital between Friday and Saturday [11-12 Jan 2008]
after all her vital organs collapsed under the pressure of the viral
illness, which is transmitted by the female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. "This
death highlights a looming crisis which could have incalculable costs if it
goes unresolved," said councillor Avery Rose-Green (PNP, Mount Salem
division) in reference to the deplorable hygienic conditions that
characterise the area.
Mount Salem, a paradoxical division featuring a curious mix of affluence
and abject poverty, is home to hundreds of residents who have no access to
basic social amenities such as flush toilets. Consequently, they engage in
a dangerous practice -- known as parachuting -- whereby they defecate in
plastic (lada) bags and throw them into the large uncovered drains, which
run through several sections of the community. This, coupled with irregular
garbage collection, facilitates the breeding of mosquitoes, heightening the
risk to pubic health. Officials from the St James Health Department were
locked in meetings up to press time yesterday and were consequently unable
to comment.

Health officials have been sent to communities in Chaguanas to investigate
a possible dengue outbreak in the Borough. A Health Ministry official said
yesterday [21 Jan 2008] that 6 residents had reportedly contracted dengue
fever but "we have no details on this so we sent a team to gather
information and assess how serious the problem was."
Chaguanas mayor Surujrattan Rambachan said information from Surveillance
Nurse of County Caroni, Cecile Johnson-David, indicated that the outbreak
required urgent attention. He said laboratory tests have confirmed that the
6 patients had contracted dengue fever. The affected patients live along
the Longdenville Main Road, Cunupia; Ragoonanan Road, Enterprise; Kinnow
Crescent, Orchard Gardens, and Franz Gardens, Orchard Gardens. Rambachan
has launched a campaign to rid the borough of empty containers and tyres
after 6 cases of dengue fever were recorded at the district health facility.

According to the daily newspaper La Nacion, the CCSS [Costa Rican Social
Security] detected at the end of last year 3 Costa Ricans who were infected
[with dengue virus], who had entered the country from Panama. The
epidemiological fence was ordered by the CCSS in the southern zone of the
country, along the Panamanian border, to impede the propagation of dengue
[virus] type 3 here [in Costa Rica].
The CCSS, which administers state hospitals in Costa Rica, established the
epidemiological fence in this zone since dengue virus type 3 has not been
registered in the country but has been present in Panama, according to the
newspaper.
The epidemiological fence cut off the dissemination of dengue [virus type]
3, said Costa Rican minister of health, Maria Luisa Avila, pointing out
that detection of these cases occurred at the end of December [2007]. She
indicated that "the appearance of a new type -- dengue virus 3 -- increases
the risk of people susceptible to the development of DHF.
The Minister informed [the newspaper] that "Panama Ministry of Health
officials, which visited the country to inspect the condition of the
indigenous [people] who work here, took advantage of this visit to
cooperate with Costa Rican authorities concerning dengue."
According to official data, dengue, following its eradication in Costa
Rica, reappeared -- as variants [dengue viruses] 1 and 2 -- in just last
year affected 25 000 people, 8 of whom died, including 4 minors.

Worrisome increase of dengue cases in Colombia
----------------------------------------------
The National Institute of Health considers the increase of dengue cases in
Colombia to be worrying, despite the preventive and educational campaigns
carried out by health officials.
Data from this institution indicate that last year [2007] there was a 10
per cent increase in the number of cases, which represents 3694 illnesses
more than in 2006. In that year [2006] 38 842 cases were reported in the
country and in 2007 there were 42 536 reported according to Pilar Zambrano,
epidemiologist with the National Institute of Health.
In press releases, this official said that the zones most affected by the
presence of the dengue [virus] mosquito vector were the cities of Yopal,
Medellin, Cucuta, Villavicencio, Valledupar, Santa Marta, and Cartagena.
However, she pointed out that despite the increase in the number of
infected people, the numbers of deaths were reduced, which were more than
50 in 2006 and only 19 last year [2007].

Ironically, Colombia essentially eliminated _Aedes aegypti_ by the 1960s,
after which this mosquito reinvaded the coastal areas and spread into the
inter-Andean valleys and cities, such as Medellin, that had not had this
mosquito and are now infested with this dengue virus vector.

The number of possible dengue cases in El Oro has increased to 55 from the
beginning of the year [2008] up until Tuesday of this week [ 22 Jan 2008].
The majority of these [cases] were located in Santa Rosa and Machala, which
presumes more than 2 per day.
Taking into account the underreporting of the disease, recognizing that
many people opt for self-medication and the uncertainty of the diagnosis,
those affected [infected by dengue virus] could be many more [than those
reported]. It is estimated that for every "official" case, 3 are
unreported. Moreover, [dengue case] figures are those reported by state
health units and do not include those who are treated in private [facilities].
However, the director of health, Rosa Marina Aguilar, pointed out that of
the 55 cases reported [as dengue] by the health areas, only 3 have been
[laboratory] confirmed by the Instituto de Higiene Izquieta Perez.
The rest [of the reported dengue cases] are presumptive or probable, taking
into account their fevers, the official explained, while explaining that
the heads [of the health units] are pushing initiatives aimed at dealing
with the disease and to reduce its incidence.
He noted that the contingency plan turns on 4 actions: prevention sustained
by community education, cleanup, fumigation in areas of risk [of
transmission], and abate application [larvicidal treatment]. Aguilar
underscored that the task was not just that of the National Malaria
Eradication Service, but also involved the active participation of the
teams for basic [medical] attention.
He then signaled that in the case of cleanup he hoped to count on the
collaboration of the armed forces and the municipalities, indicating the
importance of community participation. He especially referred to
cooperation in the destruction of objects in houses, which accumulate
water, which turn into mosquito breeding sites for larvae of _Aedes
aegypti_ , the vector of the disease [virus].
It is worth remembering that last year [2007] there were more than 1600
[dengue] cases, of which 114 corresponded to the classical type, the most
dangerous variety [this number must mean DHF, rather than classical dengue
fever. - Mod.TY]
As a positive fact, it is [important ] to point out that there have been no
deaths, thanks to opportune detection of complications and adequate
treatment, Dr Aguilar emphasized.

Clinics and hospitals in Caracas continue to register an increasing number
of patients infected with dengue [virus]. This worries physicians because
the number [of dengue cases] is greater than in previous years. According
to the Venezuelan Society of Infectious Diseases [Sociedad Venezolana de
Infectologia], 2007 had the greatest number of dengue cases registered
since the epidemic in the country in 1989.
The official statistics for 2008 to date do not indicate if the disease
continues to increase [as detected in] emergency rooms and health centers.
Experts consider that it is necessary that official epidemiological
bulletins be published so that health officials can react in a timely
fashion and fight the disease.

[It is not clear why publication of the official epidemiological bulletins
was stopped in the middle of last year (2007). Although information about
dengue in Venezuela is coming out piecemeal, it is evident that dengue has
been a significant problem there from 2007 until the present, as it has
been in many parts of Central and South America. Jose Felix Oletta, former
minister of Health and Social Assistance, indicated in an article in El
Nacional of 25 Jan 2008 (<http://www.el-nacional.com/www/site/>) that he
had calculated from figures published in the national press that at least
42 people died of dengue in 2007 with 82 000 cases of the disease. He said
that there were 18 deaths just in the Libertador municipality, no fewer
than 5 Mianda state, 6 in Aragua, 2 in Carabobo, and 9 in Zulia.

In the last 3 weeks [of January 2008] 244 dengue cases have been reported
of which 242 are classical dengue and 2 are DHF, without counting
unreported cases.
There has been a fight against dengue in the state since August [2007], and

The team of specialists who warned of the possible existence of a dengue
[virus] serotype 5 confirmed yesterday [26 Jan 2008] that national and
regional authorities must investigate thoroughly why there are complicated
cases with liver damage. Jorge Guerrero, one of the doctors involved in the
study, spearheaded the application. "We request that doctor Ferdinando
Letbrandi, head of the biology lab and mutation of viruses of the
Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC), be sent all the
evidence to determine whether or not there is a new dengue virus," said the
doctor from Zulia.
Up to the end of 2007, there were nearly 19 000 cases in the region. So far
this year [2008], 1291 [dengue cases have been] reported, according to the
Ministry of Health. They complain that health authorities in the region
hide epidemiological figures.
The certification of the probable existence of serotype 5 of the dengue
virus was called for yesterday the doctors from Zulia, who reported on
Monday [21 Jan 2008] of the presence of a new dengue virus strain in the
population.
"We have had patients with severe levels of liver and lung injury, [and
with] gallbladder and kidney problems. Given the suspicion caused by this
situation we notified the Ministry of Health and now ask that samples be
taken from patients who are in hospitals. "We have great confidence that
IVIC, through the Ministry of Health, will determine whether or not a new
dengue virus exists," he said.
The upsurge of dengue fever has caused alarm in the region due to the high
figures reported by the Ministry of People's Power for Health (MPSS) from
the last quarter of 2007.
"We are witnessing an epidemic that over the years, instead of decreasing,
has grown at significant levels in Zulia and in other states around the
country," added the University of Zulia School of Medicine Rector Leonardo
Atencio.
Nereida Valero, head of dengue research and head of the virology laboratory
of the Institute of Clinical Research, said that in this instance they have
no evidence to justify the presence of a new dengue [virus] serotype. "The
molecular studies of dengue virus have shown that there are 4 serotypes,
and it is highly unlikely that a mutation occurred, or a change in its
genome, [sufficient] to produce a new serotype. Until we do detailed study
of isolation and sequencing of the virus, we can not talk of a new
serotype," he said.
The virologist confirmed the circulation of all 4 serotypes of dengue
[virus] in the population, and that last year [2007] they had identified
them. Until now, IVIC has not received the samples to scientifically
analyze the probability of the emergence of a dengue [virus] serotype 5.
Despite suspicions by the clinical doctors in Zulia, Letbrandi assured that
the studies conducted as of the end of 2007 had not found another strain,
"but did not rule out that there could be a mutated virus (in nature) with
a touch more severe hepatic [symptoms] than normal."

[The situation in Zulia illustrates the need for timely laboratory support
for accurate diagnosis, especially when clinicians believe that they are
seeing an unusual set of symptoms. Concluding that there is a new dengue
virus serotype based only in clinical signs is premature. Fortunately, the
virologist involved here is clearly doubtful that a new dengue virus
serotype has emerged during the Zulia epidemic. ProMED-mail awaits with
interest any news concerning the sequence and antigenic test results as
they emerge. - Mod.TY]

The number of people in Zulia ill [with dengue] went from 8181 in 2006 to
18 405 in all of 2007. [Nationally], there were 77 269 cases of classical
dengue and DHF in 2007, an increase of 94 per cent, which makes this an
epidemic, according to a report from the Ministry of People's Power for
Health. [Cases] of this disease in Zulia represent 24 per cent of the
national total. The regional increase [in dengue cases] was 125 per cent.
The World Health Organization considers that [this increase] is due to the
El Nino [climatological] phenomenon.
According to data provided by the Director General of Epidemiology, Zulia
leads the country in the number of [dengue] cases, a marked difference from
other states as follows: Miranda (5584 cases), Guarico (4938), and
Anzoategui (4419). All of these are considered in an epidemic state
according to the Ministry [of Health].
The presence of diverse [dengue virus] serotypes in the region increases
the risk of outbreaks of DHF, of which Zulia has the greatest number: 1346
cases of a national total of 6145.

The Vice Minister of Health, Juan Alberto Nogales, indicated this Friday
[25 Jan 2008] that the [dengue] epidemics which occurred in [the] Chapare
[region], (Cochabamba) [department which is equivalent to a state or
province. - Mod.TY] are controlled and under observation.
"Epidemic outbreaks have appeared as a consequence of flooding, are under
surveillance and we are developing all strategic technical measures in
order to calm the people," he indicated.
A national emergency alert was declared, accompanied by a national sanitary
alert, which implicated designation of funds, materials and deployment of
activities aimed at avoiding the consequences of the floods.
He indicated that in the Chapare they were developing a campaign centered
on the eradication of the mosquito that causes [transmits the virus] that
causes dengue. He indicated that this work is being done with the
Department of Health of Cochabamba, in order to eradicate dengue in the
Chapare zone. "We have help from departmental teams for [field] studies of
mosquito proliferation, as well as the collaboration of 10 Cuban
entomologists, who are carrying out a thorough surveillance in order to
calm the populace," he assured [everyone].
Given this, he said that in the previous week [week of 13 Jan 2008] 101
cases of classical dengue were registered, and there were 143 cases in the
entire country. Also, he said that new hantavirus cases and 10 malaria
cases are being treated and controlled. "Despite the magnitude of these
happenings, we are able to control outbreak of these infections," Nogales
mentioned.

The reappearance of dengue virus type 2 is now beginning to become a source
of worry for the municipal Secretary of Health. According to the
superintendent of epidemiology of the Secretariat, Meri Baran, the number
of [hospital] admissions due to dengue has increased since 2007.
Previously, few were admitted, but an increase has been seen in 2007,
principally of children. There is a hypothesis that this increase occurred
with the appearance of dengue [virus] type 2, which practically was not
recorded since 2002, when there was a surge of [dengue virus] type 3, she said.
According to Meri Baran, this increase in admissions is principally among
people who have had the disease before.
The superintendent of the Secretariat, however, denied that Rio is having a
dengue epidemic. According to her, this only occurs with the emergence of a
new virus serotype, as was the case in 2002, the year in which Rio had its
greatest epidemic of the disease [caused by serotype 3 replacing types 1 &
2. - Mod.JW].
There is a remote possibility of a dengue epidemic due to the appearance of
dengue [virus] type 4 in Brazil. The threat of dengue [virus] type 4 always
exists because it has circulated in other countries, but has not entered
Brazil. There has been just one [dengue virus type 4] case, in the
beginning of the 1990s, in Rondonia [far western Brazil], but did not
become disseminated.
At the beginning of this month [January 2008] the state Secretariat of
Health said that Rio was the city that had the greatest index of dengue
virus infections in the state in 2007, registering around 23 000 cases.
Niteroi [directly across the bay from Rio] was in 2nd place with more than
7000 infected [individuals], followed by Sao Goncalo, Campos dos

notification of 458 suspected dengue cases in 58 municipalities. Of these,
192 cases were laboratory confirmed in 20.6 per cent of municipalities in

Valenzuela troubled by steep rise in dengue cases
-------------------------------------------------
A steep rise in dengue cases in Valenzuela City had been monitored during
the first 3 weeks of January [2008] -- a whopping 90 per cent increase in
the number of reported cases compared to the figures from the same period
last year [2007].
Radio dzBB reported Thursday [24 Jan 2008] that the Valenzuela City
government has already recorded 25 dengue cases from 1-19 Jan [2008], most
of which were recorded in Barangays [neighborhoods] Rincon and Gen T de Leon.
This steep increase in dengue cases jolted the city government into
intensifying its information and cleanup drive against the potentially
fatal illness. The Valenzuela City government started Wednesday [23 Jan
2008] an intensive campaign to residents to clean their surroundings, after
health officials voiced alarm over the sudden rise in dengue cases.
Valenzuela City epidemiologist Manuel Mapue appealed to local residents to
rely on themselves instead of the government to avoid acquiring the
disease. This, even as the city government ordered a door-to-door campaign
encouraging residents to keep their surroundings clean and dry, to prevent
dengue-carrying mosquitoes from breeding.
Since last year [2007], health authorities had declared dengue a year-round
threat, not just during the rainy season. They also warned against
unnecessary fogging operations, which they said may just drive mosquitoes
to other areas.

facility that takes in dengue cases from all over Metro Manila, capital
region of the country. Tayag said that of the 380 cases, 5 have already
died. The health official said the number could rise as the DOH has yet to
check other hospitals in Metro Manila.
"What's alarming is the increase of dengue cases as early as (this month
[January 2008]) in Metro Manila areas compared to last year," he said. The
official said that due to the alarming increase in dengue cases, the DOH
has decided to launch an anti-dengue drive this month. Tayag said that as
early as this month [January 2008], hospitals in Metro Manila may put up
express lanes in anticipation of dengue victims to pour into medical
facilities this month.
Tayag said the increase in dengue cases in Metro Manila can be attributed
to the abnormal weather conditions in the country. He mentioned that
dengue-carrying mosquitoes could have been spreading because of the rain
showers in the past few days.
The health official reminded parents to immediately take their children to
hospitals for checkup once they catch fever or show early signs of dengue.

[16] Saudi Arabia: (Jeddah)

Health officials in Jeddah registered 16 confirmed cases of dengue fever
this month [January 2008]. A total of 342 cases of the illness were
detected last year [2007], according to a source at the Health Affairs
Administration in Jeddah on Monday, Al-Eqtisadiah daily reported yesterday
[Tue 22 Jan 2008]. The spread of dengue has been linked to standing water,
which is more prevalent in the winter months. Residences that have standing
water in cisterns are also at risk of spreading dengue.
Dr Nabeel Abu Khutwah, a specialist on environmental science at the King
Abdul Aziz University and a consultant at the Jeddah Mayor's Office, said
that all the detected cases of dengue fever were treated and healed. "While
the laboratory under the Jeddah Mayor's Office detected 21 varieties of
mosquitoes, it also found that the 2nd most common variety in the area was
the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito which carries the dengue virus," Abu Khutwah said.
The scientist observed a sharp reduction in the disease last year [2007]
compared to 2006 when the number of registered cases was 1314. He did not
attribute any death to the disease in 2007. However he noted that an
average of 8.2 cases were reported over the last 5 weeks of 2007 while the
weekly average in the 5 weeks previous to it was 3.4.
