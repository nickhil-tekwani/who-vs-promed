THREE GORGES DAM, HEALTH RISKS - CHINA
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 23 May 1998

An article in The Lancet (351, May 16 1998, page 1449) by A. Sleigh and S.
Jackson (Australian centre for International Tropical Health and Nutrition
and Department of Economics, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia)
discusses possible disastrous implications of the Three Gorges dam, being
built across the Yangtse River in China. In addition to useful information
about the size of the dam and the lake it will form, the number of people
it will displace, the building cost, and other fascinating factoids, The
Lancet article suggests that in the area of the dam site, there already are
inadequate health services, drinking water, and sanitation and high
incidences of rheumatic fever, hepatitis B, pneumonia, measles, and
diarrhea and that increases may be expected in epidemic infections, such as
malaria, paragonimiasis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, Japanese
encephalitis, leptospirosis, and schistosomiasis, as well as Keshan disease
(commonly fatal cardiomyopathy linked to low selenium soils, enterovirus
infections, moldy grains, and diet in endemic areas). Fluorosis from use
of fluorine-containing coal and ground water also are a threat. The large
work force building the dam has coincided with increased HIV infection,
gonorrhea (the third major infectious disease in China).
At the same time, The Lancet states, there is no program in China to combat
these threats to public health. The article ends by saying that "A bad
Three Gorges result could become the Chernobyl of hydropower".
