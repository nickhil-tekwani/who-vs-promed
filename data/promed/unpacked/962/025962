- Affected children. Fri 8 Mar 2019. (reported) As the children of what's sometimes called the "Generation Zika" turn 3, they continue to suffer from a broad range of problems. Symptoms include muscle stiffness and weakness, seizures, vision impairment, and trouble swallowing. Most toddlers with CZS [congenital Zika syndrome] cannot walk or talk, and may never be able to. Doctors do know that specialized therapy can help, but the variety of symptoms require visits to multiple specialists many days a week. Unfortunately, health and money challenges are not the only issues to overcome. The outbreak left hundreds of mothers struggling emotionally as well. Many told CBS News they felt left behind or forgotten.

ref: Melo A, Gama GL, Da Silva Junior RA, et al. Motor function in children with congenital Zika syndrome. Dev Med Child Neurol. 2019. doi: 10.1111/dmcn.14227
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Aim
To evaluate gross motor function and associated factors in children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS).
Method
In this study 59 children (30 males, 29 females) with CZS at a mean (SD) age of 14.7 (3.9), months (range 5-29mo) were evaluated using the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) and classified according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Neurological damage was evaluated by neuroimaging. The mothers' sociodemographic characteristics and general data on the children were obtained from interviews with the mothers and from the children's medical records. Correlational and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with these children's motor function.
Results
In 81% of the children, motor function impairment was severe, classified as GMFCS level V. The overall GMFM score ranged from 5 to 210 (median 18; interquartile range 11), with only 4 children receiving scores in the D and E dimensions. The factors found to affect motor function were the presence of severe malformations of cortical development and small head circumference at birth.
Interpretation
Although motor impairment may be mild in some children, it is generally severe. Severe malformations of cortical development and small head circumference at birth were factors associated with poorer motor function, reflecting the greater severity of brain damage.
What this paper adds
- Motor impairment is severe in most children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS).
- Motor skills are adequate or close to adequate for age in 7% of children with CZS.
- Severe malformations of cortical development are associated with poor motor control.
- Small head circumference at birth is also associated with poor motor control.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The Zika virus outbreak in Latin America resulted in congenital malformations, called congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). For unknown reasons, CZS incidence was highest in northeastern Brazil; one potential explanation is that dengue virus (DENV)-mediated immune enhancement may promote CZS development. In contrast, our analyses of historical DENV genomic data refuted the hypothesis that unique genome signatures for northeastern Brazil explain the uneven dispersion of CZS cases. To confirm our findings, we performed serotype-specific DENV neutralization tests in a case-control framework in northeastern Brazil among 29 Zika virus-seropositive mothers of neonates with CZS and 108 Zika virus-seropositive control mothers. Neutralization titers did not differ significantly between groups. In contrast, DENV seroprevalence and median number of neutralized serotypes were significantly lower among the mothers of neonates with CZS. Supported by model analyses, our results suggest that exposure to multitypic DENV infection may protect from, rather than enhance, development of CZS.

[The risk of prior dengue infection for contributing to antibody-dependent (ADE) Zika virus infection severity and CZS has been a topic of considerable interest and debate. The study above suggests that multiple dengue infections may be protective and reduce the risk of CZS. The question of dengue vaccination of women who have not had prior dengue infections being at risk of ADE and more severe Zika infections of themselves and their fetuses is an open question. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Exposure of the developing fetus to Zika virus (ZIKV) results in a set of brain abnormalities described as the congenital Zika syndrome. Although microcephaly is the most obvious outcome, neuropathologies such as intracranial calcifications and polymicrogyria can occur in the absence of microcephaly. Moreover, the full impact of exposure on motor, social, and cognitive skills during development remains uncharacterized. We examined the long-term neurobehavioral consequences of neonatal ZIKV exposure in 4 genetically divergent inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, FVB/NJ, and DBA/2J). Male and female mice were infected on postnatal day 1, considered comparable to exposure late in the 2nd trimester of humans. We demonstrate strain differences in early susceptibility to the virus and the time course of glial reaction in the brain. These changes were associated with strain- and sex-dependent differences in long-term behavioral abnormalities that include hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and motor incoordination. In addition, the adult brains of susceptible mice exhibited widespread calcifications that may underlie the behavioral deficits observed. Characterization of the neuropathological sequelae of developmental exposure to the Zika virus in different immunocompetent mouse strains provides a foundation for identifying genetic and immune factors that contribute to long-term neurobehavioral consequences in susceptible individuals.
Significance statement
Developmental Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is now known to cause brain abnormalities in infants that do not display microcephaly at birth, and the full impact of these more subtle neuropathologies has yet to be determined. We demonstrate in a mouse model that long-lasting behavioral aberrations occur after developmental ZIKV exposure. We compare 4 divergent mouse strains and find that the effects of Zika infection differ greatly between strains, in terms of behavioral changes, sex differences, and the intracranial calcifications that develop in the brains of susceptible mice. These findings provide a foundation for identifying susceptibility factors that lead to the development of abnormal behaviors secondary to ZIKV infection early in life.

[This study provides yet another consequence of fetal Zika virus infection in a mouse model. It will be interesting to see if similar neurobehavioral consequences occur in the early life of children infected with Zika virus in utero but without resulting microcephaly. If these abnormal behaviors do result, it will place additional burdens on the parents of these children and with the schools that will deal with their education. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Much work has been done in recent years to determine the vector competence of _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse) for Zika virus (ZIKV). If competent, _Ae. albopictus_ could become an important vector in the spread of ZIKV to areas which until now have been considered safe from the virus. Despite much speculation about _Ae. albopictus'_ competence for ZIKV, there have been, to date, no quantitative syntheses of _Ae. albopictus'_ competence, nor have the potentially confounding differences between studies been addressed.
Methodology/ principle findings
This study represents a quantitative meta-analysis of the literature surrounding this topic by examining infection rates (IR) and transmission rates (TR) among sample populations of _Ae. albopictus_ at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) across 15 journal articles comprising 23 studies. Our analyses examined potentially confounding variables in the studies contained therein, including: geographic origin of viral strain or mosquito population tested, whether sympatry of the tested viral strain and mosquito population was important, and freshness of blood meal. Our results suggest 1) _Ae albopictus_ is a competent vector for ZIKV and 2) that origin of _Ae. albopictus_ population and origin of viral strain had significant effects on the competence of _Ae. albopictus_ to transmit ZIKV.
Conclusions/ significance
These results indicate a need to further explore the effects of methodology on vector competence studies and to examine in more detail the geographic variation in the competence of _Ae. albopictus_ for ZIKV as well as the underlying causes of said variation. The ability of _Ae. albopictus_ to carry and transmit ZIKV also points to a need to create new vector control strategies in case of a ZIKV outbreak in an area where _Ae. albopictus_ is prominent. Finally, this study represents a potential template for future meta-analyses in the field of vector competence, where this type of study has been under-utilized despite the abundance of relevant studies.

[The authors make an important point that vector competence of _Ae. albopictus_ populations may vary geographically and may depend as well as the strain of ZIKV in circulation. Although an aggressive biter, it has a wider range of host preferences than does _Ae. aegypti_ a more strictly human feeder. ZIKV infected _Ae. albopictus_ may bite hosts that are incompetent for ZIKV, breaking the transmission chain.

The authors also make a compelling point about the utility of meta-analysis in capturing and evaluating information from the existing published literature. - Mod.TY]

[6] Diagnostic tests
Date: Tue 28 May 2019

https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/34070-fda-authorizes-first-zika-diagnostic-test-for-marketing/


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has permitted the 1st test to locate Zika antibodies in human blood to be marketed.

The ZIKV Detect 2.0 IgM Capture ELISA is the 1st Zika diagnostic test that has been authorized for marketing in the United States. Until now, 18 other active tests have existed but were only allowed under emergency use.

"At the onset of the Zika virus outbreak, when little was known about the disease or how to diagnose it, the FDA worked quickly with manufacturers to encourage the development of diagnostic tests and ensure they were available using our emergency use authorities," FDA Acting Commissioner Ned Sharpless said. "Today's marketing authorization is a great demonstration of the FDA's work to protect the public health in emergency response situations. We ensured there were tests made available quickly under EUA [emergency use authorization], but we continued to work with diagnostic manufacturers to take the next step of ensuring products were FDA reviewed for safety and effectiveness and authorized under our traditional premarket authorities."

The new test detects the proteins produced by the body's immune system when it tests for Zika virus infection in the blood. [FDA] authorized it following review of a clinical study of 807 test samples and various analytical studies. That said, the test will only be usable by those patients with clinical signs and symptoms of Zika infection, or who have traveled to regions with active Zika transmission.

There is, however, a margin of error in the test. Negative results are possible in samples taken before the fourth day of symptom onset, or after IgMs are no longer detectable.
Marketing authority for the test has been granted to InBios International, Inc.

[It is reassuring to lean that a Zika antibody diagnostic test has been FDA approved and can now enter the market in the USA. The above report states that the test will only be usable by those patients with clinical signs and symptoms of Zika infection, or who have traveled to regions with active Zika transmission. Since about 80% of Zika virus infections are asymptomatic, it is important for those asymptomatic individuals, both men and women, to know if they have been infected. Pregnant women especially need to know because of the risk of fetal infection and both men and women do too, since Zika virus can be sexually transmitted. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The latest Zika virus (ZIKV) pandemic caused great international concern from explosively proliferating throughout the Americas. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent Zika virus infection and available tests rely on antibodies or RNA. Unfortunately, antibody-based detection systems can result in false positive results and RNA-based detection systems are costly, time-consuming, and impractical for testing in remote regions. In this study, a potential point-of-care (POC) diagnostic system was developed using a chip-based potentiometric sensor to detect Zika virus using a 3D molecular imprinting technique. This chip-based potentiometric sensor system was able to detect 10^-1 PFU mL^-1 ZIKV in a buffered solution under 20 minutes without any sample manipulation. This sensor was tested against Dengue virus at clinical viral loads and showed no sign of cross-reactivity. When tested against human saliva samples containing clinical viral loads, this sensor was able to detect 10 PFU mL^-1 ZIKV among the pool of bio-macromolecules. The high sensitivity and high selectivity demonstrated here proved that this lab-on-a-chip diagnostic has the potential to become a POC detection system for rapid and accurate screening of flaviviruses.

ref: Sharp TM, Fischer M, Munoz-Jordan JL, et al. Dengue and Zika virus diagnostic testing for patients with a clinically compatible illness and risk for infection with both viruses.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Dengue and Zika viruses are closely related mosquito-borne flaviviruses with similar transmission cycles, distribution throughout the tropics and subtropics, and disease manifestations including fever, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. For patients with suspected dengue or Zika virus disease, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are the preferred method of diagnosis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody testing can identify additional infections and remains an important tool for the diagnosis of these diseases, but interpreting the results is complicated by cross-reactivity, and determining the specific timing of infection can be difficult. These limitations are a particular challenge for pregnant women in determining whether Zika virus infection occurred during or before the pregnancy.
This report summarizes existing and new guidance on dengue and Zika virus diagnostic testing for patients with a clinically compatible illness who live in or recently traveled to an area where there is risk for infection with both viruses. CDC recommendations for screening of asymptomatic pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure are unchanged. For symptomatic nonpregnant persons, dengue and Zika virus NAATs should be performed on serum collected 7 days or less after symptom onset. Dengue and Zika virus IgM antibody testing should be performed on NAAT-negative serum specimens or serum collected more than 7 days after onset of symptoms. For symptomatic pregnant women, serum and urine specimens should be collected as soon as possible within 12 weeks of symptom onset for concurrent dengue and Zika virus NAATs and IgM antibody testing. Positive IgM antibody test results with negative NAAT results should be confirmed by neutralizing antibody tests when clinically or epidemiologically indicated, including for all pregnant women. Data on the epidemiology of viruses known to be circulating at the location of exposure and clinical findings should be considered when deciding which tests to perform and for interpreting results.
Patients with clinically suspected dengue should receive appropriate management to monitor and treat shock and hemorrhage. Women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy and their infants should be evaluated and managed for possible adverse outcomes. Dengue and Zika virus disease are nationally notifiable conditions, and cases should be reported to public health authorities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editorial
---------
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that was most likely introduced into Latin America back in 2013 (Rodriguez-Morales, 2015), but did not cause identifiable outbreaks until its massive emergence in Brazil in 2015, when it rapidly spread across the Americas and the Caribbean (Weaver et al., 2016). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ZIKV epidemic a public health emergency of international concern (PHEC) at the height of the pandemic in 2016 (Rodriguez-Morales, 2015, Rodriguez-Morales, 2018), after identifying clusters of ZIKV-associated Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) (do Rosario et al, 2016), and more significantly due to its association with outbreaks of microcephaly among newborn infants in which a causal link between ZIKV infection and birth defects was reliably demonstrated (Rasmussen et al, 2016). The clinical manifestations of congenital ZIKV infection extend beyond microcephaly and comprise a distinct constellation of birth defects and manifestations known as the congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) (Nogueira et al, 2018, Moore et al, 2017).

The ZIKV pandemic in the Americas and Caribbean was known to cause over one million cases and there were reports in which the virus was found to cause severe, life-threatening complications in addition to GBS and CZS, especially among patients with associated comorbidities (Rodriguez-Morales, 2018). From a clinical standpoint, until 2013, ZIKV was generally considered to cause a mild, self-limiting illness, which did not pose a serious public health threat (Rodriguez-Morales, 2015, Rodriguez-Morales, 2018, Martinez-Pulgarin et al, 2016). However, it was not until 1st non-perinatal death was identified in a 15-year-old girl from northern Colombia in October 2015, (Arzuza-Ortega et al, 2016) that an increasing number of ZIKV-associated fatalities were reported in the literature.

The case from Malaysia reported by Rajahram et al (2019) in the current issue of the International Journal of Infectious Diseases, confirms that ZIKV infection can result in atypical disease and lead to severe and even fatal outcomes (Rodriguez-Morales, 2018). It also demonstrates, as seen in other studies (Sarmiento-Ospina et al, 2016, Soares et al., 2016, Zonneveld et al, 2016, Azevedo et al, 2016), that this neurotropic virus can disseminate to multiple organs and tissues, in addition to the central nervous system, while inflicting pathological effects. Previous to this report, the majority of fatalities associated with ZIKV infection were almost invariably linked to acute neurological complications (Sarmiento-Ospina et al, 2016, Soares et al, 2016, Azevedo et al, 2016). However, amongst those exceptional fatalities without neurological involvement, the question was raised as to whether ZIKV could cause renal and cardiac involvement, as was observed on autopsy examinations of the case described in this issue. Renal and cardiac complications have been reported in atypical, severe (Villamil-Gomez et al, 2016a, Alvarez et al, 2017), and fatal cases (Hoz et al, 2015, Mercado et al, 2018) of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. Conversely, cases of ZIKV infection with documented renal or cardiac complications have been reported on rarely and have usually lacked detailed histopathological evaluation as well as molecular confirmation of the presence of viral RNA within the renal or cardiac tissues during routine autopsy of fatal cases (Mercado-Reyes et al, 2019).

ZIKV infection has previously been reported to cause cardiovascular compromise as a consequence of systemic infection, as revealed by electrocardiographic and echocardiographic alterations (Villamil-Gomez et al, 2018, Schwartzmann et al, 2017), even including venous thromboembolism (in ZIKV and CHIKV infections) (Ramacciotti et al, 2019), as well as demonstrating myocardial inflammation secondary to viral infection (Villamil-Gomez et al., 2018). Autopsy examinations of a heart transplant recipient who developed ZIKV infection revealed plasma cell infiltrates in the myocardial tissue, along with perivascular and endovascular damage (Schwartzmann et al, 2017).

Nevertheless, publications in the literature on cardiovascular manifestations in adult patients with ZIKV infection are scarce, and the case report by Rajahram et al (2019) is timely in underscoring how this arboviral infection can produce unexpected clinical complications with renal and cardiovascular involvement. Previous reports have suggested an association between cardiovascular complications and ZIKV during the acute phase of the infection (Villamil-Gomez et al, 2018, Li et al, 2016, Minhas et al, 2017). However, only a limited number of studies have addressed this potential association (Martinez-Pulgarin et al, 2016, Minhas et al, 2017). Findings in patients (Abdalla et al, 2018) and non-human primates (Li et al, 2016) have provided evidence that ZIKV has a broad tissue tropism, which includes renal and heart tissues (Rajahram et al, 2019, Li et al, 2016). Nevertheless, further investigations are needed in order to delineate the underlying pathogenic processes in which ZIKV affects myocardial tissue and to characterize the spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations caused by this emerging arboviral infection (Musso et al, 2018).

A review of the literature identified a total of 84 fatal cases of ZIKV infection during the recent pandemic in the Americas (Rodriguez-Morales et al, 2018). However, few of these reported cases underwent an in-depth tissue assessment and molecular characterization during autopsy, as was performed in the case report by Rajahram et al, (2019).

It should be emphasized that the pathogenesis of severe ZIKV infection remains poorly understood. In vitro and experimental animal models have provided evidence that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) may play a role, but clinical correlates for this phenomenon still need to be confirmed in human ZIKV infection (Ngono and Shresta, 2018, Andrade et al, 2019). Recent studies suggested that preexisting high antibody titers to dengue virus were associated with a reduced risk of acquiring ZIKV infection and disease. In this sense, the landscape of ZIKV immunity that now exists may affect the risks of future transmission (Rodriguez-Barraquer et al, 2019). Additionally, cases with arboviral co-infections/co-detection (dengue and chikungunya) have been reported in Colombia and Brazil (Villamil-Gomez et al, 2016b, Sardi et al, 2016), as well as concurrent infections with other microorganisms such as Leptospira (Neaterour et al, 2017) and co-infections with other arboviruses (Mercado-Reyes et al, 2019). Co-circulation with other arboviruses and ADE pose a challenge for physicians and public health authorities, given the potential to confound and delay diagnosis and possibly influence poorer outcomes in patients with previous exposure to other flaviviruses (Ngono and Shresta, 2018). As a result, multiple research networks on ZIKV and arboviruses in general have been established, which can leverage protocols, methodologies, and multidisciplinary approaches to inform treatment, prevention, and control strategies. Although recent advances have greatly contributed to our understanding of ZIKV pathogenesis, systemic involvement and the expanding tissue tropism of this virus and its potential relationship to different lineages highlight important aspects for future investigation. Finally, it is worth considering the setting for vaccine development and preparedness for other emerging arboviruses in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, such as Ross River, Mayaro, Oropouche, Madariaga, West Nile, and the Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Eastern equine encephalitis viruses.

Summary
-------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is implicated in severe fetal developmental disorders, including microcephaly. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally regulate numerous processes associated with viral infection and neurodegeneration, but their contribution to ZIKV pathogenesis is unclear. We analyzed the mRNA and miRNA transcriptomes of human neuronal stem cells (hNSCs) during infection with ZIKV MR766 and Paraiba strains. Integration of the miRNA and mRNA expression data into regulatory interaction networks showed that ZIKV infection resulted in miRNA-mediated repression of genes regulating the cell cycle, stem cell maintenance, and neurogenesis. Bioinformatics analysis of Argonaute-bound RNAs in ZIKV-infected hNSCs identified a number of miRNAs with predicted involvement in microcephaly, including miR-124-3p, which dysregulates NSC maintenance through repression of the transferrin receptor (TFRC). Consistent with this, ZIKV infection upregulated miR-124-3p and downregulated TFRC mRNA in ZIKV-infected hNSCs and mouse brain tissue. These data provide insights into the roles of miRNAs in ZIKV pathogenesis, particularly the microcephaly phenotype.

Nielsen-Saines K, Brasil P, Kerin T, and al. Delayed childhood neurodevelopment and neurosensory alterations in the second year of life in a prospective cohort of ZIKV-exposed children. Letter. Nat Med 2019. doi: 10.1038/s41591-019-0496-1

Abstract
--------
We report neurodevelopmental outcomes in 216 infants followed since the time of PCR-confirmed maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy during the Rio de Janeiro epidemic of 2015-2016. Neurodevelopment was assessed by Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (Bayley-III; cognitive, language and motor domains) in 146 children and through neurodevelopment questionnaires/neurological examinations in 70 remaining children. Complete eye exams (n=137) and hearing assessments (n=114) were also performed. Below-average neurodevelopment and/or abnormal eye or hearing assessments were noted in 31.5% of children between 7 and 32 months of age. Among children assessed by Bayley-III, 12% scored below -2 s.d. (score less than 70; a score of 100 +/- 2 s.d. is the range) in at least one domain; and 28% scored between -1 and -2 s.d. in any domain (scores less than 85-70). Language function was most affected, with 35% of 146 children below average. Improved neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted in female children, term babies, children with normal eye exams and maternal infection later in pregnancy (P=0.01). We noted resolution of microcephaly with normal neurodevelopment in 2 of 8 children, development of secondary microcephaly in 2 other children and autism spectrum disorder in 3 previously healthy children in the 2nd year of life.

[The adverse effect of intrauterine Zika virus infection continues to be documented in the cohort of infants described above. If the 216 infants in this study are representative of the other infants infected in utero in Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas, the physical, emotional, and financial damage is considerable, and will last a lifetime for many of these infants and their parents. One wonders if underreporting occurred and the number of affected children is greater than thought previously. Interestingly, in a study to determine completeness of fatal congenital Zika syndrome reporting in Mexico, the authors examined data from the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography. They found that an estimated 50% more infants died from microcephaly attributable to congenital Zika syndrome during 2016-2017 than were reported by the existing surveillance system (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/8/19-0106_article). It would be interesting to know how many affected non-microencephalic children in Mexico and elsewhere in Zika virus outbreak areas were not counted. - Mod.TY]
