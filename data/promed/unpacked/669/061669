PRRS in Sweden
--------------
As reported previously [see OIE (World Organization for Animal
Health) notification in ProMED-mail posting 20070803.2518], porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was detected in Sweden
this summer [2007]. This is the 1st occurrence of the disease in the country.
After many years of serosurveillance in breeding herds and at
slaughter, positive samples were found in one herd in the beginning
of July [2007]. Immediate actions were taken, including tracing and
investigations in all contact herds as well as farms in the vicinity.
An intensified serosurveillance in the entire country is presently ongoing.
A total of 8 herds have been found infected. All animals on the
positive holdings have been slaughtered and cleaning, disinfection,
and a holding period of 21 days have been required before any new
animals may be introduced onto the premises.
So far, the epidemiological investigations have been inconclusive and
the source of the infection remains unclear. Extended sequencing of
the viral genome from all positive samples, as well as detailed
examinations of the results from serological investigations in the
infected herds, are underway.
The veterinary authorities are reluctant to jump to any conclusions
but so far the infection does not appear to be widespread and it may
have been detected just in time to enable successful eradication efforts.
