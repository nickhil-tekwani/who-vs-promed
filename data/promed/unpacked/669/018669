Diabetics are being warned by the Food and Drug Administration to avoid
five brands of Chinese herbal products because the herbs illegally contain
prescription drugs. Makers of the products say they contain only natural
Chinese herbs. But after a diabetic herb user had several episodes of
hypoglycemia, California investigators discovered the products also contain
the prescription diabetes drugs glyburide and phenformin.
Consumers can receive a dangerously high amount of the drugs from the
affected herbs, Californias health department concluded  and herb users
particularly are at risk if they also take regular diabetes medicine.
"People with diabetes should avoid these products and consult their
physician if theyve been taking them," the FDA warned Thursday. In
particular, people who suffer fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating
or numbness after taking the herbs should call a doctor.
Affected Products:
Diabetes Hypoglucose Capsules, sold by Chinese Angel Health Products of
Santa Monica, Calif.
Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules, imported by Sino American Health Products Inc.
of Torrance, Calif., but also sold by Chinese Angel.
Tongyitang Diabetes Angel Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules, and
Tongyitang Diabetes Angel Hypoglycemic Capsules; sold by Sino American.
Zhen Qi Capsules, sold by Sino American.
The FDA has stopped imports of the products and is investigating how the
drugs were added to the herbs and whether any other herbal products are
contaminated. Chinese Angel and Sino American have agreed to recall the
products, which may be returned to the place of purchase for a refund.
