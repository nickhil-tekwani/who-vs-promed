2001/049 First report of cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus in
Portugal
----------------------------------------
In autumn 1998, symptoms of chlorotic mottling, yellowing, and stunting
were observed on cucumbers (_Cucumis sativus_) in an experimental plot in
Algarve, Portugal. The first symptoms appeared 3 weeks after planting and
were associated with heavy infestation by _Bemisia tabaci_ (EPPO A2
quarantine pest). Plants that showed early infection produced few and small
fruits.
Molecular studies revealed the presence of cucurbit yellow stunting
disorder crinivirus ([CYSDV, EPPO Alert List). CYSDV was also detected in
samples of cucumber, melon (_Cucumis melo_), and watermelon (_Citrullus
lanatus_) collected during summer 1999 in commercial greenhouses. This is
the first report of CYSDV in Portugal. The situation of CYSDV in Portugal
can be described as follows: present: found in only a few areas.

[There are several whitefly-transmitted viruses in the new genus
Crinivirus. These include lettuce infectious yellows [LIYV, the type
member, CYSDV, tomato infectious chlorosis [ToCV, tomato chlorosis [TICV,
sweet potato chlorotic stunt [SPCSV, and possibly lettuce chlorosis [LCV,
and beet pseudo-yellows [BPYV. BPYV, transmitted only by _Trialeurodes
vaporariorum_ is found worldwide. CYSDV, transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_,
causes significant crop losses in cucurbits in the Mediterranean region and
the Middle East. TICV and ToCV have been recognized as important pathogens
in Puerto Rico. According to Stephan Winter (BBA, Braunschweig, Germany),
SPCSV-infected plants have been found recently in Portugal and Spain and
other (new?) criniviruses are being recorded in Europe. SPCSV is endemic in
parts of Africa, including Nigeria, and was reported in 1996 to be present
in the sweet potato cultivar "White Bunch" at the USDA/ARS Plant Genetic
Resources Conservation Unit, Griffin, GA. Chris Clark (Department of Plant
Pathology, LSU, Baton Rouge, LA) says in a recent note to me that he has
never seen any sweet potato plants expressing symptoms of sweet potato
chlorotic stunt disease in Louisiana fields, despite the presence of the
ubiquitous, aphid-transmitted sweet potato feathery mottle potyvirus which,
in combination with SPCSV, causes the stunting disease.
