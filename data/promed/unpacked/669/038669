STUDIES ON THE RISK ASSESSMENT OF LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES
Journal Of Food Protection 61: 244-248, Feb. 1998

ABSTRACT
Humans are frequently exposed to _Listeria monocytogenes_, and high numbers
may be ingested during consumption of certain types of food. However,
epidemiological investigations show that listeriosis is a rare disease.
Risk assessment studies using an animal mouse model indicate that almost all
_L. monocytogenes_ serovars present in food have clear virulent properties.
The intravenous dose causing infection in 50% (IV ID50) of mice not
previously exposed to _L. monocytogenes_ (non protected mice) was 1.8 log10
units. For mice previously exposed to _L. monocytogenes_ (immunologically
protected mice), the IV ID50 was 5.6 log10 units. The ID50 of orally exposed
non protected mice amounted to 6.5 log10 units. And no significant effects of
type of food (water/milk) and storage time at 5C (milk) were observed. The
oral ID50 of immunologically protected mice was >9.0 log10 units.
Furthermore, there was approximately 1-2 log10 difference between the ID50
and the lethal dose causing death in 50% (LD50).
The results show that both the intestinal barrier and the specific immune
defense mechanism are highly effective in preventing infection of mice
orally exposed to _L. monocytogenes_. Delaying the immune defense had no
effect on the protective activity of the intestinal barrier, indicating that
these protective mechanisms operate independently. The risk assessment
results obtained in the mouse model support the epidemiological finding that
listeriosis is a rare disease in humans, despite frequent exposure to the
organism.
