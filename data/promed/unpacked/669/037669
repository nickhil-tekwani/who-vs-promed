Bluetongue detected in Suffolk
------------------------------
Since 22 Sep 2007, laboratory tests have detected the presence of
bluetongue in animals on a number of different premises in Suffolk.
These premises are all under restrictions and the infected animals
have been culled. On 28 Sep 2007, Defra confirmed that bluetongue
disease is circulating between the local animal and midge population
in East Anglia.
As from midnight Saturday 29 Sep 2007, the existing Temporary Control
Area is replaced with a Bluetongue Control Zone around the area where
cases have been identified, and a larger Bluetongue Protection Zone.
An illustrative map sets out the areas that will be covered, with
accompanying integrated guidance with FMD (foot-and-mouth disease)
areas. The precise areas will follow boundaries such as roads.
Surveillance and epidemiological investigations are continuing.
All movement licence conditions for both bluetongue and
foot-and-mouth disease must be complied with.

[The double jeopardy of having to fight both bluetongue and FMD is
truly unfortunately as movement control zones differ depending on
which disease is specified. A large map of the new control zones for
bluetongue can be found at the end of the official declaration available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-bt-pzcz290907.pdf>.

[2] New bluetongue control zones

New bluetongue control-and-protect zones came into place at midnight
[on 30 Sep 2007] following the announcement that there are now 11
cases of the disease.
The new zone comprises parts of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Cambs
[Cambridgeshire]. It replaces a temporary area brought in on Tuesday
[25 Sep 2007] after the outbreak started at a farm near Ipswich.
The protection zone also includes London and parts of Lincs, Leics,
Northants, Beds, Bucks, Herts, Kent, Berkshire, Surrey, and Sussex.
Rachel Carrington, of the National Farmers' Union in East Anglia,
said there were "a number" of potential bluetongue cases being
investigated. There were "unconfirmed cases" in Norfolk, Essex, and
Cambridgeshire.
Professor Philip Mellor, from the Institute of Animal Health, said it
was important to develop a vaccine against the strain of bluetongue
affecting livestock.

[The terms 'cases' and 'animals' used in these postings should be
clarified because a case often refers to an animal but can, in the
context of disease control, refer to a farm. Additionally, an
infected premises (IP) or farm outbreak can be used to describe a
farm which has suffered individual cases of bluetongue or any
relevant disease. Similarly, animals in this situation could likely
be either sheep or cattle, if the outbreaks on the continent serve as
a useful guide to which types of animals are mostly affected by
BTV-8. If both are not affected, then it might be useful to clarify
whether bovines, sheep, or other animals such as goats or deer are
affected. - Mod.PC]
