Pandemic triage plan addresses tough ventilator decisions
-----------------------------------------------
Canadian infectious disease and critical care experts, working on
behalf of Ontario pandemic planners, have developed one of the 1st
triage plans for pandemic influenza. The protocol is designed to
guide clinicians' triage decisions for patients with and without
influenza during the 1st days and weeks of a pandemic when the
critical care system is overwhelmed and resources are scarce. The
report was published in the November [2006] issue of the Canadian
Medical Association Journal (CMAJ). [Christian MD, Hawryluck L, Wax
RS, et al. Development of a triage protocol for critical care during
an influenza pandemic. CMAJ 2006;175(11):1377-1381, - Mod.CP]
In developing a protocol for pandemic influenza triage, the group
used components from other types of triage plans, such as severity
scoring systems. The pandemic triage plan has 4 components: inclusion
criteria, exclusion criteria, minimum qualifications for survival,
and a color-coded prioritization tool.
The inclusion criteria identify patients who may benefit from
critical care treatment, focusing on respiratory failure. Exclusion
criteria place patients in 3 different categories: those who have a
poor prognosis despite critical care, those whose care demands
resources that can't be provided during a pandemic, and those who
have underlying advanced medical conditions such as malignant cancer
or end-stage organ failure that complicates their critical influenza
status.
The authors write that they struggled with the decision to put an age
cutoff in the plan's exclusion criteria. They did not include one in
their original protocol draft because they claim age may not strongly
predict critical care outcomes. "However, we received strong and
consistent feedback from both expert and stakeholder consultations
that an age criterion should be included," they wrote. Age above 85
is listed among the exclusion criteria, but the authors suggest that
the topic of age cutoff requires more research and community input.
The "minimum qualifications for survival" component attempts to place
a limit on the resources used for any one patient. "This is a concept
foreign to many medical systems in developed countries but one that
has been used in war zones and refugee camps," the authors write. In
the triage protocol, patients are reassessed at 48 and 120 hours to
identify early those who are improving and those likely to have a
poor outcome.
A tool for prioritizing patients for admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU) and access to ventilation is based on a color scheme used
for disaster triage plans: blue or black, red, yellow, and green.
Patients in the red category have the highest priority for ICU care
and ventilation, if needed. Those at the lowest category -- blue or
black -- may receive expectant care or palliative care on the medical
ward.
The prioritization tool incorporates the Sequential Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA), which allows emergency department personnel to
assign patients a score on the basis of physiologic parameters and
simple laboratory tests. The authors write that SOFA scores are easy
to calculate and have been validated for a variety of critical care
conditions. "The goal is to optimize the effectiveness of the triage
protocol so that every patient who receives resources will survive,"
say the authors.
Though they consulted a bioethics guide, Stand on Guard for Thee,
produced by the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics
[see: University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics report on
ethical considerations during a pandemic
<http://www.utoronto.ca/jcb/home/documents/pandemic.pdf>],
to develop the triage protocol, the authors note that limited
resources during a pandemic will mean not all patients receive the
intensive care they need. Communities should review, discuss, and
refine the protocol before it is implemented in a pandemic setting,
they say.
In an editorial in the same issue of CMAJ, 2 bioethicists from
Dalhousie University in Halifax say it isn't clear how bioethics
principles shaped the development of the pandemic triage protocol,
which they say gives the document a utilitarian focus. "We must be
clear why certain values are privileged and others not. This paper
contributes to the project, but there is much tough work yet to be
done," the editorial states. [See: Melnychuk RM, Kenny NP. Pandemic
triage: the ethical challenge. (Editorial) CMAJ 2006;175(11):1393].
They commend the protocol developers for calling for more community
involvement but say the document does not address how to accomplish
this goal.
John Hick, MD, a disaster medicine expert and emergency medicine
physician at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, told
CIDRAP News that the pandemic triage report contributes to the
growing discussion about the decision tools clinicians need in order
to make tough decisions about allocating ventilators during a
pandemic. He said that while the authors' use of SOFA scoring is
justified because it is easier to use than other systems, there are
little data about what difference in SOFA score warrants taking one
patient's ventilator to give to another who might have a better
prognosis. "Is a difference of 1, 2, or 5 enough to justify such
action? At this time, we do not have good guidance," Hick said.
"Pandemic-specific epidemiological response to treatment will also
have to inform these types of systems," he said, adding that
clinicians may have to account for overwhelming mortality for certain
age-groups as they use the triage tools. Hick said it would be useful
to know how the authors chose the cutoffs for the triage categories
and why they included refractory hemodynamic instability in their
inclusion criteria in addition to respiratory failure. "The
combination of these 2 factors alone results in a very high
mortality, and the limited inclusion criteria may not "include"
enough patients to aid decisions when many patients require
ventilatory support," he said. Another component of pandemic triage
that would be helpful, Hick said, is an assessment of a patient's
response to a trial of mechanical ventilation. Such an assessment
would help clinicians decide whether the patient should remain on the
ventilator when resources are scarce, he noted.
Hick said this and other papers that address pandemic triage are
useful for helping to shape triage decisions and spur more
discussion. "There is clearly a need to improve the science of triage
and to establish institutional and governmental processes that will
facilitate these decisions, regardless of the actual tool or criteria
that may be most appropriate for the event."
