Lorikeets on the Northern Rivers are being struck down by a disease which affects their ability to fly.

Chrisy Clay from the Northern Rivers Wildlife Carers said the beak and feather virus was not uncommon but that it had increased suddenly in recent weeks [August 2014].

"Beak and feather disease is [caused by] a virus found in both wild and pet parrots that affects the growth and development of their feathers and beak," Ms. Clay said. "The disease, although life-threatening to parrots, doesn't affect humans."

Ms. Clay said the disease mostly affected young birds, which still have dark beaks but are missing tail feathers and the longer flight feathers on their wings. "Without those important flight feathers, the birds are unable to fly and are commonly referred to as runners," she said. "Often, these birds are brought into care as seemingly tame lorikeets or as babies that haven't yet learnt to fly."

Ms. Clay said they had sought advice from the Currumbin Wildlife Hospital, but there is no cure for the disease. "It is highly contagious and is spread via feces, feather dust, blood and crop contents of infected birds.

"The virus is so contagious that it can be passed on to young birds while still in their nests, with hollows remaining infected for many years."

Wildlife Carers is calling for assistance from the community with managing this disease.

[Psittacine beak and feather disease is a viral disease affecting all Old World and New World Parrots. The virus belongs to the family Circoviridae. The virus attacks the feather follicles and the beak and claw-growing cells of the bird, causing progressive feather malformation and necrosis. In later stages of the disease, the feathers develop constrictions in feather shafts and cease development early until eventually all feather growth stops. The disease was 1st diagnosed in Australia early in the 20th century.
