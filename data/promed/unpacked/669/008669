I am responding to questions raised in the recent posting on findings of
bovine tuberculosis in wild cervids in and around Riding Mountain National
Park (RMNP) in Manitoba, Canada.
Surveillance for bovine tuberculosis in wild cervids in and around RMNP
consists of 2 elements: a capture-collar-test program that is used inside
the park where hunting is not permitted; and a hunter-harvest sampling
program that is used outside the RMNP boundaries where hunting is permitted.
Blood tests are a component of the capture-collar-test program only,
wherein wild elk are captured using a net-gun fired from a helicopter, a
radio-collar is attached to the elk, and whole blood and serum are
collected. If a rapid test is being conducted on the blood sample, any
positive animal is humanely destroyed at the time of capture. Otherwise the
collared elk is released and the results of the blood tests are awaited. If
the results require the animal to be destroyed, the radio-collar is used to
locate the animal by helicopter, the animal is recaptured and humanely
destroyed, the carcass necropsied, and tissue samples are collected for
histopathology and culture which is carried out by the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) Laboratory.
The blood tests that were performed by the CFIA Laboratory on whole blood
and serum samples collected from the captured wild cervids were the
lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) and the fluorescent polarization assay
for bovine tuberculosis (FPA-TB). Another test, a proprietary rapid test
developed by Chembio Inc., was performed on-site by Parks Canada staff. Not
all cervids received all tests.
Gamma-interferon assays were not used in the testing or decision-making
with respect to the wild cervid surveillance in the Riding Mountain area in
winter/spring of 2006-07. While a gamma-interferon assay (Bovigam) is
routinely used as an ancillary test in the surveillance program for cattle
and bison in the Riding Mountain area, there is currently no reliable
gamma-interferon assay available for Cervidae. While it may be true that
the gamma-interferon test is equal to or better than the skin test in
bovine species (cattle and bison), the same cannot be said at this time for
cervids, the species that is the subject of this thread.
In the absence of a reliable gamma-interferon assay for use in cervids, the
capture-collar-test program relies on the LST as developed by the CFIA in
the 1980s. This assay was shown to have an estimated sensitivity of 76 per
cent and estimated specificity of 77 per cent when it was evaluated in the
early 1990s when Canada experienced a large outbreak of bovine tuberculosis
in farmed elk (1). The depopulation of more than 400 elk from several
infected farms provided an opportunity to evaluate this assay as well as
tuberculin testing. The LST relies on the uptake of radio-labeled thymidine
by stimulated cells rather than on the production of gamma-interferon.
The FPA-TB test uses an MPB70 protein as the antigen to detect serum
antibodies specific to _Mycobacterium bovis_. The CFIA has been working
with Diachemix to develop and validate the FPA-TB for cervids, which
appears to detect infected cervids that are not detected by the LST.
During the course of eradicating bovine tuberculosis from an infected herd
of farmed cervids in Ontario in early 2006, the FPA-TB classified 13 of 16
elk/red deer with confirmed _M. bovis_ infection as positive or suspect,
while only one animal was positive on the LST (in publication, O Surujballi
et al).
During the winter/spring of 2007, a total of 101 wild cervids (98 elk and 3
white-tailed deer) were captured and blood tested. The reference to 128
captured animals in previous postings refers to the fact that 27 animals
(all elk) were recaptured for removal and necropsy, resulting in a total of
128 capture events associated with a total of 101 different cervids.
The 3 captured deer were negative on all blood tested performed and were
not recaptured. Of the 98 elk captured and tested, a total of 33 elk were
necropsied, consisting of 27 elk recaptured after a positive or suspect
result on one or more blood tests, 3 capture mortalities that also happened
to be positive or suspect on one or more blood tests, and 3 capture
mortalities that were negative on all blood tests performed.
Of the 33 elk subjected to necropsy and tissue collection for
histopathology and culture, _M. bovis_ was isolated from the tissues of 3
elk. Correlating the blood test results for these 3 culture positive elk: 3
of 3 were positive on the LST; one of 3 was positive on the FPA-TB; and
none of the 3 was positive on the rapid test. All isolates were found to be
of the same strain that is unique to the Riding Mountain area, on the basis
of spoligotyping.
In addition to the 30 elk with a suspect or positive blood test result that
were recaptured and necropsied (27) or that were capture mortalities (3),
10 elk with a non-negative blood test result were not recaptured or removed
in 2007: one suspect elk had dropped its radio-collar and could therefore
not be located and identified for recapture; and 9 elk located in the core
infected western part of the park that were negative (5) or unfit for
testing (4) on the LST, negative (9) on the rapid test, and had a weak
suspect FPA result (9) were not removed because they are part of an ongoing
elk movement research project.
Whenever the rapid test is performed on samples collected from
radio-collared elk, this test is run during the evening, which means that
all captured elk are released following collection of the blood sample and
attachment of the radio-collar. Those elk with a positive rapid test result
are recaptured, humanely destroyed, and necropsied the following day.
Consideration will be given to recapturing and retesting these elk,
particularly the 4 animals with an 'unfit' LST result, at the end of the
movement study in early 2008. During the fall/winter of 2006-07, 330 elk
and 723 were examined for bovine tuberculosis under the hunter-harvest
surveillance program in the area around Riding Mountain National Park.
Approximately 80 per cent of these samples were classified as quality
samples (head and lungs in good condition) with the remaining 20 per cent
being heads only. These body parts were brought to a field laboratory and
examined for the presence of visible lesions suggestive of the presence of
_M. bovis_ infection.
Of the 330 elk examined, suspect lesions were observed in 7 animals and
these were submitted to the CFIA laboratory for culture together with
samples from 112 older elk without observable lesions. Of the 723 deer
examined, suspect lesions were observed in one animal and these were
submitted to the CFIA laboratory for culture together with samples from 14
older deer without observable lesions. Because of the time of year during
which hunting takes place and the Canadian climate, hunter-harvest samples
are invariably frozen. For this reason, these samples are subjected to
culture assays only -- not histopathology.
The findings of 3 culture positive elk in the capture-collar-test program
and the hunter-harvest sampling program in winter/fall/spring of 2006-07
bring to 41 (34 elk and 7 white-tailed deer) the total number of wild
cervids confirmed to be infected with _M. bovis_ in the Riding Mountain
area since routine surveillance of wild cervids began in 1997.
During this period, approximately 8000 elk and deer have been examined
under the hunter-harvest sampling program and approximately 735 elk and
deer have been captured and tested under the capture-collar-test program.
(A confirmed case of bovine tuberculosis in a wild cervid requires either
the isolation and identification of _M. bovis_ in culture, or a positive
signal for _M. tuberculosis_ complex on a PCR assay conducted on tissue in
which acid-fast bacilli have been observed on microscopic examination.)
The last confirmed case of bovine tuberculosis in a wild elk in the Riding
Mountain area detected through the hunter-harvest sampling program occurred
in September 2003, and for wild deer in November 2004.
During the last 2 years/seasons of wildlife surveillance in the Riding
Mountain area (2005-06 and 2006-07), a total of 4 confirmed cases of bovine
tuberculosis have been detected, all of them in elk, all of them through
the capture-collar-test program, and all of them located in the core
infected area in the western part of RMNP.
