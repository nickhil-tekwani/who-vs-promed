A study shows that growing numbers of domestic cats are infected with bovine TB. It is feared one in a thousand could be carrying the mycobacteria, a much higher number than 1st thought.

Cats are thought to catch the disease from rodents. There is a risk that cats could pass TB to humans because Britons are no longer routinely inoculated against TB. The nationwide school vaccination programme was scrapped controversially in 2005.

Professor Danielle Gunn-Moore, who led the research team from Edinburgh University, said: "The potential incidence of feline mycobacteriosis is higher than previously thought. My biggest concern is this is spilling over from cattle and badgers into cats. We are seeing about one per cent of samples sent to labs infected with mycobacterium, which is scary."

The research is published in the Journal of Transboundary and Emerging Diseases: "The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of mycobacterial infections in cats in Great Britain (GB). This was performed using the proxy measure of feline tissue samples submitted to diagnostic laboratories in GB that were found to have histopathological changes typical of mycobacterial infection (MYC). 16 primary diagnostic laboratories were asked for information on the number of feline samples submitted in 2009, the number with MYC, the number undergoing Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, and, for comparison, the number diagnosed with lymphoma.

"Eight laboratories provided full data for the whole year: 11 782 samples; lymphoma 3.2 percent (mean, 95 percent; CI: 2.89, 3.5), MYC 1.16 percent (0.98; 1.37) and ZN-positive 0.31 percent (0.22; 0.43). Data on 1569 samples from 7 laboratories that provided partial data on samples for the whole year revealed similar results, although all changes were more frequent: lymphoma 5.42 percent (4.35; 6.66), MYC 2.36 percent (1.66; 3.23) and ZN-positive 0.77 percent (0.40; 1.33). One laboratory only provided data for part of the year (4.5 months), reporting all 3 types of histopathology less frequently: 18 232 samples; lymphoma 0.2 percent (0.18; 0.32), MYC 0.07 percent (0.04; 0.12) and ZN-positive 0.05 percent (0.02; 0.09). The reasons for low reporting rates in this high-throughput laboratory are unclear.

"In total, 187 samples were reported as having MYC. Five Reference Laboratories were also contacted, reporting 174 feline tissue submissions in 2009, with mycobacteria being cultured from 90.

"The study shows that MYC are frequently reported in tissue samples from cats in GB, being reported in one percent of samples, with confirmation as ZN-positive in 0.3 percent. Lymphoma is recognized as a common disease in cats, being seen in 3 percent of samples in this study. When compared against MYC, lymphoma was reported only twice as frequently. This confirms that far from being rare, clinically significant mycobacterial infections occur commonly in cats in GB."

[The paper, referred to in the above report, is D.A. Gunn-Moore, C. Gaunt and D.J. Shaw. Incidence of Feline Mycobacteriosis in Britain. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases. 60 (2013) 338-344; Link to publication: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2012.01352.x/abstract.

The following (edited, references excluded) fragment, derived from the discussion chapter, is a candid complementary contribution to the evaluation of the presented results:

"There are a number of significant caveats to this study, which mean that the findings must be considered as only an estimate of incidence, not a true finding:

1. While histopathology is useful at establishing the initial diagnosis of a mycobacterial infection and differentiating lesions from other conditions such as other infections or neoplasia, this is not a definitive diagnosis and different pathologists may interpret changes differently. While finding typical Acid fast bacteria (AFB) provides additional information, ZN staining is notoriously unreliable for detecting mycobacterial infections, especially when the number of bacteria in the lesions is small, which is often the case with _M. microti_ and _M. bovis_ infections.

2. Samples will not have been received from all potential cases of feline mycobacterial infection that occurred in GB in 2009. This was because a large number of steps had to be taken before a sample was submitted to the primary diagnostic laboratory, and even more before a sample was submitted for specialist culture. These included the following:
- the lesions have to be large enough for the owner to notice and/or the cat to be sufficiently ill;
- the owner has to be able to afford to take their cat to a veterinary surgeon; the veterinary surgeon has to send the sample off to a diagnostic laboratory for histopathology;
- the laboratory has to recommend that the primary clinician collects a 2nd sample and sends it for specialist culture; the cat has to have another lesion suitable for biopsy;
- and the owner has to be willing to pay for the repeat procedure.

Unfortunately, few veterinary surgeons have mycobacterial infections on their differential diagnosis list when they collect the primary sample, so it is only when the Primary Laboratory reports their findings that the veterinary surgeon knows they need a fresh sample for culture.

3. The data can at best be considered a subset of the total data for the laboratories in GB, as there were difficulties in retrieving data from some of the laboratories in this study. Only 21 of the 26 laboratories that accepted feline samples supplied data. Owing to lack of manpower, time, funds or to the limited search capability of their computer systems, much of the information received was incomplete. Two of the main diagnostic laboratories in the UK could not provide us with any information, while others relied on the keywords "feline," "cat," "mycobacterial infection" and "lymphoma" to search their record sheets, so some samples may not have been detected.

The results from the 8 laboratories that supplied their full data set are believed to be the most robust, while those from the 7 that supplied only partial data on samples for the year were weaker. Laboratory 16 was only able to supply data for part of the year because of pressures of work, associated with a very high throughput of cases. The frequencies with which this laboratory reported changes typical of mycobacteriosis, ZN-staining AFB or lymphoma were 10 times less than the other laboratories. The reasons for the low level of diagnoses in this high-throughput laboratory remain unclear."

It will be interesting to obtain information on investigations into the zoonotic aspects of feline bTB infections in the UK. - Mod.AS
