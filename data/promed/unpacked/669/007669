A 9-year-old Georgia boy developed a rare tick-borne infection from a blood transfusion, according to a report of his case.

The case is the 1st time this infection, called ehrlichiosis, was spread by a transfusion, said Dr. Joanna Regan of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacterial infection, though rare, is serious and can be fatal, Regan said. Ehrlichiosis can go undetected because routine tests don't look for it, and many people do not realize they were bitten by a tick. In this case, which occurred during the summer of 2011, the boy's condition deteriorated over the course of 10 days until a pathologist discovered the infection.

While ehrlichiosis is easily treatable with the antibiotic doxycycline, the drug is generally less powerful than other options, so it is often not the 1st treatment doctors give when they suspect a patient has some type of infection, Regan said. Indeed, the boy in this case was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics when he was admitted to the hospital, but he remained ill.

The child's family had no reason to suspect a tick-borne infection; he had acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had not been playing outside. The cancer is the most common cancer among children and is highly curable; 85 percent of children who are treated for the condition are cured. But chemotherapy treatments had left the boy suffering from anemia, and he had received 3 transfusions in the previous month. He went to his oncologist with fever, vomiting and a rash.

"He had classic signs -- rash, low white blood cell count, low platelets -- but with no possibility of tick exposure, they didn't think of this," Regan said. "There are many things that were more likely to be making him sick," such as common bacterial infections, or pneumonia, she said. Finally, a pathologist found the telltale sign of bacteria within the boy's white blood cells. As soon as doctors administered doxycycline, the boy rapidly improved and went home.

Health officials tracked down the donors of the 3 transfusions, and one of those donors reported frequent tick bites. That donor lived in Florida, and further tests showed the person had antibodies against _Ehrlichia_ bacteria, according to the report. 8 other people had received transfusions from the donor; 3 died within a few days of unrelated causes, the other 5 tested negative for ehrlichiosis, according to the report.

"The donor had no symptoms; that's what made it so difficult," Regan said. Routine lab tests of the donor's blood appeared normal, although the person reported being bitten by ticks repeatedly, she said. The case shows that doctors should be aware that this infection can be transmitted through blood transfusions. In 2011, the CDC reported that 162 cases of the tick-borne disease babesiosis over 3 decades were traced to blood transfusions. Lyme disease could also theoretically be transmitted via a transfusion, but no case of this has been reported, according to the CDC.

Cases of ehrlichiosis have risen in recent years, from 200 in 2000 to 740 in 2010. The condition is fatal in 1-2 percent of cases, according to the CDC. The infection is most common in the southeastern and south-central United States. People should try to avoid tick bites, Regan said. The CDC recommends using repellant products that contain at least 20 percent DEET, examining the skin for ticks after being outside, and showering soon after outdoor activities.

The case report was published on 19 Mar 2013 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.

[Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne zoonotic disease that is caused by rickettsia-like obligate intracellular bacteria.

The following is mostly extracted from a CDC publication available at http://www.cdc.gov/ehrlichiosis/:

Human ehrlichiosis is a disease caused by at least 3 different ehrlichial species in the United States: _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_, _Ehrlichia ewingii_, and a 3rd _Ehrlichia_ species provisionally called Ehrlichia muris-like (EML). _Ehrlichia_ are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick. The lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_) is the primary vector of both _E. chaffeensis_ and _E. ewingii_ in the United States.

Most cases of ehrlichiosis have been reported from the southern and south-central United States, corresponding to the geographic distribution of the lone star tick, _Amblyomma americanum_. The lone star tick is found throughout the eastern, southeastern and south-central states. The distribution, range and abundance of the lone star tick have increased over the past 20-30 years, and lone star ticks have been recorded in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma (http://www.cdc.gov/stari/disease/).

The tick bite is usually painless, and about half of the people who develop ehrlichiosis may not even remember being bitten by a tick. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Rash occurs in up to 60 percent of children but less than 30 percent of adults. Usually, these symptoms occur within 1-2 weeks following a tick bite.

Ehrlichiosis is diagnosed based on symptoms, clinical presentation, and later confirmed with specialized laboratory tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in whole blood is most sensitive in the 1st week of illness, and quickly decreases in sensitivity following the administration of appropriate antibiotics. During the 1st week of illness, a microscopic examination of blood smears may reveal morulae (microcolonies of ehrlichiae) in the cytoplasm of white blood cells in up to 20 percent of patients. Culture isolation of _Ehrlichia_ is only available at specialized laboratories.

Antibodies to the _Ehrlichia_ are usually observed by 7-10 days after illness onset. The gold standard serologic test for diagnosis of ehrlichiosis is the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using _E. chaffeensis_ antigen, performed on paired serum samples to demonstrate a significant (4-fold) rise in antibody titers. The 1st sample should be taken as early in the disease as possible, preferably in the 1st week of symptoms, and the 2nd sample should be taken 2 to 4 weeks later. IgM antibodies are less specific than IgG antibodies and more likely to result in a false positive.

The severity of ehrlichiosis may depend in part on the immune status of the patient. Persons with compromised immunity caused by immunosuppressive therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, cancer chemotherapy, or long-term immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplant), HIV infection, or splenectomy appear to develop more severe disease and may also have higher case-fatality rates.

The 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages is doxycycline. Ehrlichiosis is a serious illness that can be fatal if not treated correctly, even in previously healthy people. Severe clinical presentations may include difficulty breathing, or bleeding disorders. The estimated case fatality rate (i.e. the proportion of persons who die as a result of their infection) is 1.8 percent. Patients who are treated early may recover quickly on outpatient medication, while those who experience a more severe course may require intravenous antibiotics, prolonged hospitalization, or intensive care.

E. chaffeensis_ has been shown to survive for more than a week in refrigerated blood. Several instances of suspected _E. chaffeensis_ transmission through solid organ transplant have been investigated, although, to date, no cases [before this one] have been confirmed that can be attributed to this route of transmission.
