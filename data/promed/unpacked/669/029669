Regarding the outbreak of equine illness in Iceland, many subscribers may be
unaware of the events surrounding the introduction of Karakul rams into
Iceland in 1932. The rams were imported (after a quarantine period) in an
effort to produce pelts for commerce by breeding with Icelandic sheep (that
had arrived on the island in about 1000AD). After several years sheep on
the recipient farms began to behave strangely and began dying of
respiratory distress. About ten percent of these sheep became demented and
wasted. These two symptoms were first thought separate and two names were
assigned, maedi (=dyspnea, pronounced my-thee) for the interstitial
pneumonitis and visna (=wasting) for the dementia.
Through brilliant work by Bjorn Sigurdsson and his colleagues, the first
lentivirus was isolated, characterized, and a series of unsuccessful
vaccines were produced. After Sigurdsson's untimely death control efforts
were continued also without success and a final solution was achieved in the
1960s by eradicating the sheep population entirely and restocking. Despite
the fact that maedi virus is an excellent model for that other lentivirus,
HIV, little use has been made of this animal model.
Let us hope that the outbreak of disease among Icelandic "ponies" is not a
repetition of introduction of a foreign virus into a pristine insular
population. In either case, Icelandic scientists have repeatedly proved
their abilities in handling introduced disease.

[Cecil describes what is now a classic series of events in veterinary
medicine. Readers unaware of Iceland's climate should know that a
characteristic of their animal management is the need for extended housing.
In the 1930s the housing was traditional and not of the standards that can
be seen today. This increased the chances of transfer of agents between
animals by a number of routes, especially respiratory. Armchair diagnosis is
a great temptation and I wondered whether this might be an epidemiologically
atypical equine grass sickness, but one of the reasons I am an
epidemiologist is that I am not a clinician. - Mod.MHJ
