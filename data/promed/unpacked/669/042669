Anthrax outbreak cases reach 15
-------------------------------
A further case of anthrax has been confirmed in a drug user in Scotland,
bringing the total number of cases in this outbreak to 15. The new case of
the potential killer was confirmed to have taken place in the National
Health Service (NHS) Ayrshire and Arran area. So far, the number of anthrax
related deaths stands at 7 with cases confirmed in 6 NHS boards.

Investigations are continuing into whether contaminated heroin or a cutting
agent may be responsible. Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at
Health Protection Scotland, said: "Heroin users all across Scotland need to
be aware of the risk that their supply may be contaminated. They should
seek medical advice urgently if they experience signs of infection such as
redness and swelling of an infection site or high fever. I would urge all
drug users to stop using heroin immediately and contact local drug services
for support."

In addition, any users who continue to inject heroin are strongly
recommended not to re-use filters, but to use a fresh filter each time they
inject.

[This new case has been confirmed today, 22 Jan 2010, by Health Protection
Scotland: <http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/anthrax/index.aspx>

This is the 1st case in Ayrshire and Arran -- the affected area is
expanding. Previous cases have been in Fife (1), Forth Valley (1 died),
Greater Glasgow and Clyde (7 cases, 4 died), Lanarkshire (3), and Tayside
(2, both died).

At this time 9 suspicious heron-related deaths are being reported in
Coimbra, Portugal, but that means nothing until there is confirmation other
than there is widespread awareness of the risk in Europe. As heroin in the
Americas does not come from Afghanistan the perception of risk in the
Americas is seen as minimal for the present.

Various related documents have been published, which members may read if
they wish. They are discussions on what is or might be going on. Remember
that if heroin-associated cases outside Scotland are or are not the same
genotype as the Scottish heroin infections the arguments change accordingly:
