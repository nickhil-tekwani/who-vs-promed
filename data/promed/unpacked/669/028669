Take part this November 2022 in the leading Infectious Disease Congress that convenes clinicians, allied health professionals, and scientists to share world-class expertise to address global challenges. Our developing scientific program includes session topics that range from updates on personalized and integrated approaches across infectious diseases therapy and prevention, to new developments on AMR challenges in the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 eras. Join colleagues from around the world for:

- opportunities to ask scientific experts questions in our meet-the-expert sessions;
- presentations from world-renowned speakers;
- workshops and debates on infectious disease hot topics, such as monkeypox, the role of the pharmacist in infectious diseases, and how to use social media to combat misinformation;
- exposure to career opportunities with industry sponsors; and
- social events!

Attendees will have the opportunity to earn up to 28 CME credits onsite.

After 2 long years, we welcome you back to join us in-person in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, or virtually. We can't wait to see you!
