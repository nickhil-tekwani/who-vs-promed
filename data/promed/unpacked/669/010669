Foot and mouth disease threatens Corbett animals
------------------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease is threatening the animals in the Corbett Reserve
area. An estimated 22 animals in the villages surrounding Uttar Pradesh's
Jim Corbett National Park have contracted the disease.
Animals from the villages often wander inside the national park to graze,
and officials are worried that many animals inside Corbett may get
infected. In 2001 the disease practically destroyed Britain's beef export
business. The director of the Corbett Foundation has said that immediate
action must be taken to ensure that the disease is not allowed to spread in
the region.
