Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a vector-transmitted orthobunyavirus related to the Shamonda and Akabane viruses. Initially reported in November 2011, it has since been detected in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Italy, the United Kingdom and Spain, where it has been associated with foetal congenital malformations and stillbirths in cattle, sheep, and goats.

Serological testing is essential for disease surveillance and epidemiological studies. While antibodies can be detected by virus neutralization and immunofluorescence, these techniques are time-consuming, difficult to implement for large numbers of samples, and do not offer standardized result interpretation.

This week, the animal health laboratory of the French agency ANSES (Maisons-Alfort, France), after a collaborative study, has approved an indirect ELISA, based on a recombinant SBV nucleoprotein antigen developed and produced by IDvet.

This kit is currently being evaluated by other European national reference laboratories.

External validation studies indicate excellent test specificity (99.75 percent, n=1179), and high correlation with other serological techniques (98.9 percent with respect to VNT), making this ELISA an efficient tool for epidemiological studies.

[The above message, received from ANSES (the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety, a public authority reporting to the Ministries of Health, Agriculture, the Environment, Labour and Consumer Affairs, founded in 2010), may become good news. ProMED-mail's normal policy is not to be engaged in reports dealing with commercial products; the current deviation from the policy is based upon the urgent need for such a test (as expressed by the OIE on 16 Feb 2012), and the kit is not endorsed by us. If/when certified for field use, such kits may facilitate the performance of animal mass-testing in the 8 infected countries and elsewhere to study the epidemiology of SBV as well as to support safe international trade. A validated serological test may allow an update of the recommendations endorsed by the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases on 16 Feb 2012 (see 20120217.1045067).

Development of sero-tests for SBV has been undertaken by other laboratories as well. In this context, we would wish to convey to our subscribers the response of the Robert Koch Institute in Germany to our commentary in posting 20120402.1088492 concerning cross-sectional seroprevalence study in shepherds living in the epidemic area in Germany (North-Rhine Westphalia). Reportedly, the RKI developed an immunofluroscence test (IFAT) and a neutralisation test (NT) for SBV tests in humans. IFAT was performed initially and NT in case of borderline results. All blood samples tested negative for specific antibodies against SBV. In view of this clarification, our suggestion that human sera from SBV-contact persons "will also undergo serological tests when the test becomes available," was, in fact, redundant. - Mod.AS]
