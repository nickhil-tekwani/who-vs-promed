The number of people who either stayed or visited the Sheraton Atlanta and were sickened with legionnaires' disease has climbed from 6 to 9, according to the Georgia Department of Health.

The Sheraton Atlanta on Courtland Street shut down last [Mon 15 Jul 2019] after 3 guests who recently stayed at the hotel tested positive for the disease, which causes serious lung infections. The Georgia Department of Public Health reported 3 more people who were either guests or visited the hotel had also tested positive last week. [Mon 22 Jul 2019], the Health Department added 3 more to the total.

The hotel announced [Fri 19 Jul 2019] it will remain closed until at least [11 Aug 2019] after several guests were sickened with legionnaires' disease, and testing to determine the source of the outbreak continues. In an e-mailed statement last week [week of 15 Jul 2019], Sheraton Atlanta General Manager, Ken Peduzzi, said the following about the status of the _Legionella_ testing: "Immediately upon notification from local authorities concerning a possible _Legionella_ exposure, the hotel retained outside environmental consultants and is presently collecting samples at the hotel. At this time it remains unknown if the source of the exposure is located within the hotel. Samples will be collected from various areas of the hotel, including the pool, hot tub, fountain, and chillers. These samples will be sent for _Legionella_ testing." Peduzzi also said the hotel management is working to help employees find temporary jobs while the Sheraton Atlanta is closed.

Legionnaires' disease is caused by the _Legionella_ bacterium, which is found naturally in freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But, the agency says, it can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made building water systems. Hot tubs, air conditioning units, and mist sprayers at grocery stores also are prime breeding grounds for the bacterium. It can multiply in water fountains and ice-making machines, as well. You can't catch legionnaires' disease from person-to-person contact. Instead, most people get sick when they breathe in mist or steam and the bacterium makes its way into the lungs.

The Sheraton Atlanta closed voluntarily, Georgia Department of Public Health spokeswoman Nancy Nydam said. The number of legionnaires' cases is on the rise. Nearly 7500 people contracted legionnaires' disease in 2017, a more than 5-fold increase in the number of cases since 2000 (when it was about 1100) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is believed the actual number is far higher since many people got sick and never got care or tested. A variety of factors may be contributing to the increase according to the CDC, including more awareness, improved testing, an aging population more susceptible to legionnaires' disease. Another factor could be more _Legionella_ in the environment. But it's unclear which of these factors are driving the increase or whether it's a combination of them, according to the CDC.

In Georgia, there has been close to 90 confirmed cases of legionnaires' in Georgia, according to the state Department of Public Health. Last year [2018], there were 180 confirmed cases and 9 suspected cases in the state. That's up from 41 in 2008.

Nydam said guests who stayed at the hotel between 12 Jun 2019 and 15 Jul 2019 should contact their healthcare provider if they are suffering from respiratory illness. About one in 10 people who come down with legionnaires' disease die due to complications from their illness, the CDC said. One in 4 who contract the disease while staying in a healthcare facility will die, as their immune systems are already compromised. Those who get the sickest and face complications tend to be over 50 years old, have medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or diabetes, or have a history of smoking.

The disease got its name after a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Of the more than 2000 members who attended the convention, 182 came down with the serious, atypical form of pneumonia, and 29 died.

Nydam said [Tue 16 Jul 2019] that testing for _Legionella_ bacteria at hotels typically begins in pools, hot tubs, and water fountains, the most likely culprits of the bacterium. The investigation can expand well beyond those water sources, stretching in to the hotel's water supply system, including the plumbing system, she said. The team of investigators will look for clues -- such as whether all the sickened guests stayed on the same floor -- that could help in finding the contaminated source. Until testing is complete, health officials say they can't be sure that the hotel is the source of the outbreak, though no other locations are being tested for _Legionella_.

It is believed all 6 [?] people sickened with legionnaires' were attending the same conference at the Sheraton Atlanta. Nydam said epidemiologists are reaching out to individuals who stayed at the hotel and may be experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness. Those symptoms include a cough, fever, and muscle aches. Legionnaires' disease can also be associated with other symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and confusion. Symptoms usually begin 2 to 10 days after being exposed to the bacteria, but it can take longer. People should watch for symptoms for about 2 weeks after exposure.

[The number of people who "visited or stayed" at the Sheraton Atlanta Hotel in downtown Atlanta and have developed legionnaires' disease is now 9. Initially we were told that the affected individuals had attended a convention at the hotel "a couple of weeks ago" (see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (14): (GA) hotel 20190717.6573167); the incubation period for legionnaires' disease is 2 to 10 days, but has been even more days in some outbreaks settings (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/legionellosis).

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 9 cases of legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

According to the US CDC, about 20-25% of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms.

The Sheraton Atlanta is a hotel with a conference/meeting center, fitness center, pool, and heated whirlpool, located in downtown Atlanta, Georgia (https://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-information/fitness-center/atlxs-sheraton-atlanta-hotel/). A map showing its location can be found at https://www.marriott.com/hotels/maps/travel/atlxs-sheraton-atlanta-hotel/.

We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak. - Mod.ML
