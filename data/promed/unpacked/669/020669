NSW Health has confirmed that 2 people with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) are being treated in hospital and is continuing to urge the public to be vigilant and safeguard themselves against mosquito bites.

Both people are residents of the NSW-Victoria border region: a man from the Corowa area and a child from the Wentworth area in the far southwest of NSW. They are being treated in hospitals in Victoria.

The man remains in a serious condition in ICU. The child has been discharged from ICU but continues to receive hospital care due to the serious nature of their illness.

Several more people in NSW are undergoing further testing, and more cases are expected to be confirmed over the coming days and weeks.

NSW Health has confirmed one highly probable case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in an NSW resident and is warning the public to be vigilant and safeguard themselves against mosquito bites.

The person is in ICU in a stable condition. They are a resident in the NSW-Victoria border region.

Several more patients in NSW are undergoing further testing, and more cases are expected to be confirmed over coming weeks.

Locally acquired cases of JEV have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans. JEV is usually only found in far northern Australia and neighbouring countries.

JEV can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions, and reduced consciousness in some cases.

There is no specific treatment for JEV.

JEV is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes. It can infect animals as well as humans and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.

The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.

NSW Health Acting Chief Health Officer Marianne Gale said the best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn.

"NSW Health is cautioning people undertaking outdoor activities such as camping and fishing to carefully consider their plans. This is especially important for people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present, particularly the Murray River and its branches," Dr Gale said. "People should be particularly vigilant given the recent wet weather conditions, which have led to very high mosquito numbers that may increase further in the coming days and weeks."

NSW Health is working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other state and territory agencies to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating, through animal testing and mosquito monitoring.

Mosquito control activities are being carried out in the vicinity of farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV, and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.

Simple actions you can take to avoid mosquito bites include avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure), use repellent, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, and reduce all water-holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed, as mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.

The warning follows detection of a mosquito-borne disease Ross River virus found in mosquitoes at Picnic Point, a suburb north of the Georges River, on 2 occasions in the past month.

[The state of New South Wales (NSW) now has 2 confirmed human cases of Japanese encephalitis. One of these, currently in serious condition in the hospital's ICU, appears likely to be one of the patients reported in a 3 Mar 2022 post (see item [1] in Japanese encephalitis - Australia (03): (VI, QL) spread 20220305.8701785). Pigs in NSW have also tested positive for JE virus infection (see Japanese encephalitis - Australia (02): (QL, NS, VI) pig, OIE 20220304.8701778). Pigs are JE-virus-amplifying hosts and capable of providing infectious blood meals to many mosquito vectors.

No reports have been issued yet of the frequency and locations where JE virus has been found in vector mosquitoes, although vector surveillance is doubtless going on. Given the reports of flooding and rains in eastern Australia, mosquito populations are likely to remain abundant with ongoing JE virus transmission to people and pigs. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure, other than vaccination, for people to avoid JE virus infections. - Mod.TY
