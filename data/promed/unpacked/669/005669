A botulism outbreak that has struck 2 villages in Armenia has sickened 2 people, according to the Armenian press. The source of the infections has been linked to homemade canned marinade.

Less than a day after consuming the marinade, the victims presented with symptoms of botulism. They were taken to the hospital, where they are being treated. One is in serious condition, according to the report.

Food borne botulism is a severe intoxication caused by eating the pre-formed toxin present in contaminated food. It occurs when the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin in food that is later eaten without sufficient heating or cooking to inactivate the toxin. Botulinum toxin is one of the most potent neurotoxins known.

Typically, in a few hours to several days after you eat the contaminated food, you will start to show the classic symptoms; blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty in swallowing. Gastrointestinal symptoms may or may not occur. If untreated, the paralysis always descends through the body starting at the shoulders and working its way down. The most serious complication of botulism is respiratory failure, where it is fatal in up to 10% of people. It may take months before recovery is complete.

If the disease is caught early enough, it can be treated with antitoxin. If paralysis and respiratory failure happen, the person may be on a ventilator for several weeks.

[When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared, as in this case. It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is pre-formed in the food when ingested. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) is caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_. - Mod.LL
