Wyoming: 4th Fatal Case of Hantavirus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A Lovell man has become only the 4th person in Wyoming to die of hantavirus
infection, state health officials said Thu 24 Jul 2003. The man died on Sat
[20 Jul 2003], but test results did not confirm hantavirus until Tuesday.
Scott Seys, deputy state epidemiologist, planned to hold a meeting in
Lovell on Thursday night to educate the public on the virus and ways to
reduce exposure, department spokesman Ross Doman said.
Hantaviruses are usually contracted by breathing dust contaminated by the
saliva, urine, or feces of infected rodents, usually deer mice. It cannot
be spread by person-to-person contact. "While the disease is very rare, the
recent death serves as a poignant reminder that people need to be alert to
their surroundings and be very cautious in their approach to cleaning areas
which may be infected with deer mice," health department director Dr. Brent
Sherard said.
The Lovell man's death is the 4th in Wyoming since the disease was first
detected in 1993. A Casper woman died in 2002, while the other 3 deaths
were reported in Lincoln and Fremont counties. Up to the end of June 2003,
339 cases have been reported nationwide, with about 38 percent of these
resulting in death. The disease has surfaced in 31 states, including
Montana, where 2 people have died this year.
According to health officials, high-risk activities for contracting
hantavirus include cleaning or occupying rodent-infested barns, cabins, or
vacant buildings; living in or visiting areas with a large rodent
population; and disturbing rodent-inhabited areas while camping or hiking.
"Do what you can to prevent aerosolization and inhalation of dust particles
by watering down the area or wearing a proper mask before implementing the
cleanup procedure," Sherard said. Hantavirus symptoms can take 2-3 weeks to
appear. They include fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea, difficulty
breathing, and flu-like symptoms. Death usually occurs once the disease
progresses to the respiratory system and it is too late for treatment.

[With regard to a statement attributed to an official in Wyoming in 2002,
Charles Calisher wrote the following. "If what is meant by a "simple
woodworker's mask" is one of those paper masks painters wear, this is not
at all correct. These things will keep most large objects (elbows, fingers,
cigars, some paint, wood dust) from one's nose and mouth, but viruses are
not large objects. People who intend to enter areas in which hantaviruses
might be in aerosol form should be advised to wear fitted respirators with
adequate filtration systems." - Mod.CP]
