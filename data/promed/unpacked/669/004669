At least 8 water buffaloes of Asiatic breed reportedly died due to an unknown disease at New Tusom village in Ukhrul district. Speaking to this correspondent, a cattle owner [AH] of New Tusom confirmed that 8 buffaloes were found dead in Laitram forest in the south west region of New Tusom village. The cattle were reared by 5 different people in the mountain range of the village.

The villagers expressed concern that a dreadful disease might have spread in the village and infected more buffaloes that flock/herd together in the region. [AH] said that the carcasses were first spotted on [23 Mar 2022] at Laitram forest area. The villagers hardly have any knowledge for treatment of this dreadful disease.

The buffaloes showed extreme body weakness and excreted faecal waste mixed with blood.

It may be mentioned that over 256 water buffaloes of Asiatic breed reared at Wahong, New Tusom, Tusom CV, Tusom Khullen, Kharasom and Razai Khullen fell victims to an unknown disease in October and November [2021].

[AH] said that the State Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Department have collected samples from the dead buffaloes for future diagnosis but the reports are yet to be provided. He then urged the department concerned to initiate immediate preventive measures so as to prevent possible spread of the disease.

Reportedly, more than 3500 Asiatic buffaloes are being domesticated in areas under Jessami Block of Ukhrul district.

[A previous undiagnosed event in cattle (likely, buffaloes) in Manipur was reported by ProMED as an RFI in December 2021 (20211225.8700472). Since vaccination was, reportedly, applied during the earlier stage of the event in "some cattle that were found off-feed"; the identity of that vaccine was requested but has not become available.

Though the current report addresses mainly the (8) water buffaloes found dead; anthrax deserves to be excluded. On the other hand, the noted "extreme body weakness" may reflect observed clinical signs in live, sick animals as well. Such signs, combined with haemorrhagic diarrhea, could be attributed to various infectious (bacterial, viral, helminths, protozoan) or non-infectious agents.

The gross pathology changes seen when samples were collected from the dead animals; results of the laboratory investigations, and -- in case available -- data of the morbidity and mortality rates in the affected population, are requested. - Mod.AS
