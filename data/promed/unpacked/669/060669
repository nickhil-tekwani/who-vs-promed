[1] India: endemic, commentary
Date: Wed 10 Nov 2021

Many countries are reeling under the burden of continuing COVID epidemic -- 3rd, 4th, or 5th wave not abating as yet, in spite of over 50% 2-dose vaccination coverage.

The prevalent virus variant is delta (B.1.617.2) with very high R0 [reproductive naught] and very high Herd Immunity Threshold (namely 85-90%) required for the Epidemic phase to transition into Endemic phase.

India reached the Herd Immunity Threshold in late June-early July 2021 and transitioned from Epidemic to Endemic phase of COVID cases, nearly 20 weeks ago. The low and steady daily numbers of COVID cases shows that the current R is approximately 1 with a tendency for very slow downward pattern of daily cases.

Let me give you actual data (available from Worldometer Corona India, as seven-day moving averages). The 2nd wave peaked on 6 May 2021 with approximately 400 000 cases and declined to less than 50 000 cases per day (7-day moving average) on 27 Jun 2021 -- lasting 73 days till 8 Sep 2021, when daily numbers fell below 40 000 for 16 days (24 Sep 2021), below 30 000 for 13 days (8 Oct 2021), below 20 000 for 18 days (27 Oct 2021) and below 15 000 for 15 days as of today (10 Nov 2021). Thus for 135 consecutive days, daily average number of COVID cases remain low and steady, R = 1, with slow downward shifts after 2 or more weeks.

The antibody survey valid for early July 2021, conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), showed 67.4% antibody prevalence in all above 6 years, with even distribution in urban and rural communities. Earlier, ICMR had shown that antibody survey under-estimates immunity induced by past infection (confirmed with rT-PCR). Only two-thirds of such persons were detected in serosurvey. That informs us that the true immunity prevalence in July 2021 had been at least 90%, meeting and surpassing delta herd immunity threshold, to explain the transition to endemic prevalence.

The profile of case numbers is a subset of the silent background of infections. Re-infections in previously infected and break-through infections in previously vaccinated are by and large subclinical and contributes only very little to COVID case numbers in the endemic phase.

Twenty weeks of this pattern and the knowledge that these 20 weeks more people are daily getting infected adding to the pool of immune persons and also that vaccination coverage is slowly increasing (2.5% population covered per month) -- hence pool of susceptible (to disease) is shrinking -- are reassuring that the current endemic phase is for the long term. India is thus the world's very first country to reach the expected endemic prevalence while the pandemic is still on in other countries.

Some sleep disorders may lead to worse COVID-19 outcomes
----------------------------------------
Adult COVID-19 patients with sleep-disordered breathing and related low oxygen levels had a higher risk of hospitalization and death, finds a study today [10 Nov 2021] in JAMA Network Open.

A team led by Cleveland Clinic researchers conducted a case-control study of 5402 patients who had a sleep study record and were tested for COVID-19 in health system sites in Ohio and Florida from 8 Mar-30 Nov 2020.

Average patient age was 56.4 years, 55.6% were women, 60.3% were White, 31.4% were Black, 15.2% were of other races, and 35.8% tested positive for COVID-19. The study backdrop was controversy over whether to continue positive-airway pressure (PAP) treatment for sleep-disordered breathing because of concern over virus aerosols.

While sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-related hypoxia (low oxygen levels) weren't linked with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection, sleep-related hypoxia was associated with a 31% higher risk of hospitalization and death, even after accounting for the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, and smoking exposure.

Relative to uninfected patients, those who tested positive for COVID-19 had higher Apnea-Hypopnea Index scores (median, 16.2 vs 13.6 events per hour) and more total sleep time (TST) at less than 90% oxygen saturation (median, 1.8% vs 1.4%). Apneas are pauses in breathing, and hypopneas are periods of shallow breathing.

While sleep-disordered breathing wasn't tied to COVID-19 positivity, median TST at less than 90% oxygen saturation was associated with worse World Health Organization (WHO)-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcomes (adjusted odds ratio [OR), 1.39), even after adjusting for patient characteristics, body mass index, underlying illnesses, smoking history, and health system site.

Relative to those with TST at less than 90% oxygen saturation of 1% or less, those with TST at less than 90% oxygen saturation of 1.8% to 12.8% and greater than 12.8% had 54% and 55% greater odds, respectively, of higher WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scores (OR, 1.54 vs 1.55).

Similarly, patients with a TST at less than 90% of 1.8% to 12.8% and greater than 12.8% had a 42% and 38% higher risk of hospitalization and death, respectively, than those with a TST at less than 90% of less than or equal to 0.1% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.42 vs 1.38).

The risk of hospitalization and death fell 19% and 6%, respectively, for each 5% increment in average and low arterial oxygen saturation (HR, 0.81 vs 0.94). When average arterial oxygen saturation increased by 5%, odds of a high WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale score fell 27% in the fully adjusted model (OR, 0.73).

The researchers said that strategies are needed to better identify sleep apnea-specific hypoxia, such as the use of sleep apnea-related hypoxic burden as a more sensitive indicator of sleep apnea-related hypoxia, which is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular death.

"Furthermore, understanding how sleep-related hypoxia may influence vaccine efficacy as well as elucidating underlying hypoxic mechanisms portending more severe COVID-19 disease and mortality are salient future directions," they wrote.

The authors called for interventional studies to determine whether early, effective PAP or supplemental oxygen use in patients with high hypoxic physiological stress at night improves COVID-19 outcomes.

"If sleep-related hypoxia indeed translates to worse COVID-19 outcomes, risk stratification strategies should be implemented to prioritize early allocation of COVID-19 therapy to this subgroup of patients," they concluded.

Abstract
--------
"Importance
The influence of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-related hypoxemia in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and COVID-19 outcomes remains unknown. Controversy exists regarding whether to continue treatment for SDB with positive airway pressure given concern for aerosolization with limited data to inform professional society recommendations."

"Conclusions and relevance
In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes."

Conclusions
-----------
"Results of this case-control study revealed that SDB and sleep-related hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes. Strategies to better discern sleep apnea-specific hypoxic stress are needed, such as use of sleep apnea-related hypoxic burden as a more sensitive biomarker of sleep apnea-related hypoxia, as the latter is recognized to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, understanding how sleep-related hypoxia may influence vaccine efficacy as well as elucidating underlying hypoxic mechanisms portending more severe COVID-19 disease and mortality are salient future directions. The current findings set the stage for interventional studies to identify whether early, effective PAP or supplemental oxygen administration in those with high nocturnal hypoxic physiological stress improves COVID-19 outcomes. If sleep-related hypoxia indeed translates to worse COVID-19 outcomes, risk stratification strategies should be implemented to prioritize early allocation of COVID-19 therapy to this subgroup of patients."]

[A] Impact on measles

WHO, CDC warn COVID disruptions could stall measles battle
----------------------------------------------------------
Missed measles vaccine doses for babies and deteriorating surveillance for measles during the pandemic are setting up a perfect storm for the disease to come roaring back, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned today.

In other developments, global COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to trend upward, mainly driven by rises in the European region, the WHO said in its latest weekly update on the pandemic.

The groups aired their concerns today in their latest report on progress against measles, which looks at the latest immunization, illness, and surveillance trends. They published their findings in an early online edition of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). [Dixon MG, Ferrari M, Antoni S, et al. Progress toward regional measles elimination -- Worldwide, 2000-2020. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2021; 70: 1563-1569; http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7045a1]

In 2020, the 1st year of the pandemic, more than 22 million infants missed their 1st dose of measles vaccine, 3 million more than 2019. It marked the largest increase in 2 decades. Alongside that vaccination gap, 24 measles campaigns in 23 countries that were planned for 2020 were postponed, putting more than 93 million people at risk.

Cases also dropped, by 80%, compared to 2019, but the groups said surveillance activities also took a nosedive, with the lowest number of specimens sent for testing in over a decade. The authors said the decline in surveillance prevents health officials from preventing and monitoring outbreaks.

In 2020, major outbreaks were reported from 26 countries, which accounted for 84% of all the cases reported.

Kevin Cain, MD, the CDC's global immunization director, said in a WHO statement that large numbers of unvaccinated children, measles outbreaks, and the diversion of surveillance and testing resources to support the COVID-19 response increase the likelihood of measles complications and deaths. [see reference above]

"We must act now to strengthen disease surveillance systems and close immunity gaps, before travel and trade return to pre-pandemic levels, to prevent deadly measles outbreaks and mitigate the risk of other vaccine-preventable diseases," Cain said.

The WHO and CDC warned that the drop in cases in 2020 shouldn't mask the growing threat of measles to kids across the world.

Kate O'Brien, MD, who directs the WHO's Department of Immunization, Vaccines, and Biologicals, said it's critical to vaccinate against COVID-19 as quickly as possible, but the effort requires fresh resources that don't drain essential immunization programs. "Routine immunization must be protected and strengthened; otherwise, we risk trading one deadly disease for another," she said.

[COVID has not only jeopardized measles vaccination campaigns, but in addition, neglected tropical diseases (NTD) have not been adequately addressed during COVID and basic surveillance throughout the world has suffered.

"A recent survey indicated that, as of early 2021, disruptions occurred in 44% of countries (48/109); this percentage was second only to services targeting mental, neurological, and substance use disorders. In addition, the proportion of countries reporting severe disruptions of NTD activities was the highest among all health services (19%).

"NTD disruptions have been mainly reported from middle- and low-income countries, where health services already face a number of challenges. Countries in the South-East Asian, America, Eastern Mediterranean and African regions are the most hit.

"The mechanisms through which the COVID-19 pandemic has affected NTD programmes include:
- Disruption of community-based interventions (mass treatment/preventive chemotherapy; active case finding; vector control; veterinary public health; WASH, awareness and health education campaigns; support for self-care, rehabilitation and psychosocial services); notably, mass treatment/preventive chemotherapy is both the most frequently and most severely affected of all NTD services;
- Delays in diagnosis, treatment and care and other health facility-based services (including surgery, morbidity management and disability prevention);
- Discontinuation of monitoring & evaluation activities, including routine surveillance and population-based surveys;
- Delays in manufacture, shipment, transport and delivery of NTD medicines and consumables to endemic countries and in their distribution within countries;
- Diversion of financial resources and reassignment of NTD personnel to support the COVID-19 response, and absence from work of NTD personnel due to illness, care-giving responsibilities and government-mandated movement restriction.

"The main public-health consequences of these disruptions have been:
- A (projected) increased burden of NTDs, in terms of both mortality and morbidity;
- Delays in achieving the public-health goals set for relevant NTDs, including elimination as a public-health problem, elimination of transmission and eradication;
- Reduced collection, analysis and utilization of epidemiological data for planning purposes."

- In Europe, Slovakia today [10 Nov 2021] reported its highest daily number of cases since the pandemic began, while Russia reported record deaths in its surge and is anticipating oxygen shortages in 12 of the country's regions. And in France, officials yesterday [9 Nov 2021] said people ages 65 and older will need to get their booster shots in order to maintain their health pass, which allows people to visit cafes, restaurants, and other indoor spaces.

- South Korea is experiencing a jump in serious and critical COVID-19 infections, mainly in those older than 60, which has prompted a call for ramped up delivery of booster doses.

- The United States spearheaded a deal between Johnson & Johnson and COVAX to provide vaccine to conflict areas, according to Reuters. The J&J vaccine is easier to deploy in resource-challenged settings, because it is designed as a one-dose vaccine that can be kept in the refrigerator. (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-covax-usa/u-s-brokers-jj-covax-deal-to-send-vaccines-to-conflict-zones-blinken-idUSKBN2HV1S9)

- The global total today climbed to 251 257 948 cases, along with 5 070 151 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/)

Dexamethasone tied to lower risk of death, severe COVID-19
----------------------------------------------------------
The corticosteroid dexamethasone was associated with a 56% lower risk of death and intensive care unit (ICU) admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and is safe to use in monitored diabetes patients, according to research presented at this week's Society for Endocrinology annual conference in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The unpublished observational study involved data from 1372 COVID-19 patients admitted to Imperial College NHS Trust hospitals during the 2nd pandemic wave (1 Nov 2020-31 Jan 2021), when dexamethasone was routinely used in COVID-19 patients, and 889 patients admitted during the 1st wave (9 Mar-22 Apr 2020), before the anti-inflammatory drug was used in these patients.

Dexamethasone was tied to a 56% lower risk of death by 30 days and a 56% lower rate of ICU admission. And while patients with diabetes who take dexamethasone are at higher risk of high blood glucose (odds ratio, 22.5) and poor COVID-19 outcomes, the risk of death or ICU admission in the study was not higher in patients with these complications. These patients did, however, require the use of extra medications to control blood glucose and prevent serious diabetes complications.

The death rate was significantly lower in 2nd-wave than in 1st-wave patients (18.8% vs 27.6%), for a 31.8% reduced risk. Risk factors for death included male sex, high blood pressure, frailty, and impaired kidney function.

Rates of ICU admission were not different between the 2 pandemic waves, which the authors said could be attributed to the emergence and dominance of SARS-CoV-2 variants during that time.

The researchers noted that dexamethasone has been used routinely in patients needing supplementary oxygen and mechanical ventilation since it was shown to improve their outcomes in the RECOVERY trial in 2020. [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/07/trial-data-support-dexamethasone-not-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19]

Senior author Victoria Salem, MBBS, PhD, said in a Society for Endocrinology news release that the team had been worried that dexamethasone could be a "double-edged sword" for diabetes patients.

"And while we did see an increase in steroid-induced diabetes and worsened diabetes, deaths were significantly reduced in wave 2 for all patients," she said. "We now feel confident using dexamethasone for patients with diabetes in the future, just with the caveat that it may result in a short-term worsening of their condition."

Previous SARS experience does not assuage healthcare COVID-19 stress
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A study today [10 Nov 2021] in PLOS One shows that healthcare workers' (HCWs') previous experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak neither prevented them from experiencing emotional distress nor increased their distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study was based on an online survey from May-July 2020 of 3852 HCWs in the greater Toronto area, including 1256 nurses, 345 physicians, 1034 allied health staff, and 1243 non-clinical staff. Almost 30% had worked in healthcare during the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in Canada.

Half of respondents (50.2%) exhibited signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 31.5% had symptoms of depression. Those who worked during the SARS outbreak experienced lower scores of PTSD (P = 0.002) and depression (P < 0.001), but these differences were not significant after adjusting for age and career experience. Non-clinical staff were more likely to suffer PTSD, depression, and anxiety, a trend also seen in studies based on workers in Singapore and the United States.

"Non-clinical staff may experience less control over their work situations and lower self-efficacy as it relates to core medical knowledge and receive less dedicated education relating to the pandemic compared to clinical HCWs which may account for this observed difference," the authors wrote.

In an accompanying author interview, first author Rima Styra, MD, MEd, of University Health Network, Toronto, said survey respondents also reported new or increasing use of alcohol and sedatives, and new sleep disturbances.

"Sleep disturbances may signal that wellbeing is impacted," she said.

[It is equally important to assess and treat the emotional or psychological consequences of a serious disease as much as the physical state of being. Substance abuse, eating disorders, disturbed sleep patterns all increased during COVID-19. The sense of not being in control of one's situation exacerbates underlying insecurities. Previous experience with SARS -1 in 2003 apparently had little effect on the mental state of workers whose job it is to respond to SARS-CoV-2, the latter being a much more prolonged pandemic. - Mod.LK]
