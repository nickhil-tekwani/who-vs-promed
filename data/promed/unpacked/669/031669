There is an outbreak of anthrax infection in human beings in Warrap after laboratory analysis showed positive results, state health officials have declared.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus_. The disease occurs naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. People can also get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

Dr. John Akol, the acting director general at the ministry, said they made the declaration after samples of 20 patients suspected of anthrax, which were taken to Uganda for further laboratory tests, were confirmed positive. Akol reveals the local authorities are in coordination with the national ministry of animal resources to contain the spread of the disease.

Some of the suspected cases under investigations were reported at Alek, Kuach North, and Payams in Gogrial West County in March [2022]. "Now the ministry of health and ministry of animal resources and fisheries in the state will work together to see the way forward to contain this disease," Akol told Sawa Sawa Network on Wednesday [27 Apr 2022].

He cautioned the residents to be much careful in eating [dead] animals. "The community should avoid eating dead animal meat, because anthrax is a disease for animals, but it affects humans when you eat it," he continued.

For his part, the UN FAO head of field office in Kuajok (state capital), Paul Thon, stated that the disease has been present in Kuajok since last year [2021] between October to December before FAO vaccines could reach the state. Thon said: "But starting from February...the vaccination campaign has been going on in Gogrial West, Twic, Gogrial East, Tonj North, Tonj East, and Tonj South."

In 2021, widespread flooding had a bigger impact on agro-pastoral and pastoral communities in South Sudan than in 2019 and 2020. An estimated 10 million livestock were affected by floods, and around 800 000 animals died across the country. Most deaths were due to drowning, starvation, and water-borne diseases.

Health authorities have reported outbreaks of 3 diseases in Gogrial West County of Warrap State. The diseases, including measles, rubella, and anthrax, were reported in Kuac North, Kuac South, and Akon payams. The State Minister of Health, Abak Yel Madot, disclosed this in an exclusive interview with Radio Tamazuj on Friday [29 Apr 2022] in Kuajok Town.

Abak said samples from the 3 diseases that were sent to the national laboratory in Juba all turned positive. "Yesterday (Thursday [28 Apr 2022]) we were celebrating World Malaria Day and jointly declared the outbreak of measles, anthrax, and rubella," she said. "They were found through samples sent to Juba in the last 2 weeks to laboratories, and the result came out as there is the outbreak of these 3 diseases," Abak added.

The state minister stated that her ministry has held a meeting with health partners in the area to address the health situation. "The way forward is that we have held a meeting with Food and Agriculture Organization and ministry of animal resources and fisheries, and the meeting discussed how we can rescue the situation," he said. "So we hope FAO will help to vaccinate livestock, and for measles and rubella we asked our partners to provide us with vaccines." she added.

The minister advises caregivers to report any suspected case of the disease to the nearest health facilities for help. The 1st cases of the diseases were 1st reported in Warrap State in February [2022].

[South Sudan is struggling, but they are working hard to upgrade the quality of their health and agriculture services.

"Warrap State comprises an area of 31 027 sq km [11 980 sq mi]. Kuajok is the capital of Warrap state. All states in South Sudan are divided into counties, each headed by a county commissioner appointed by the president of the Republic of South Sudan" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrap_(state)). The 6 counties mentioned comprise the whole of Warrap State.

In March [2022], samples from the 20 persons afflicted with these diseases were sent to Uganda for laboratory testing. The most recent sampling in the past 2 weeks all came just from Gogrial West. However. FAO is initiating livestock vaccination in all 6 counties in Warrap, so there is an obvious concern with the disease being widespread.

That none of the affected people have died, having been successfully treated, and that there is an official caution with eating dead animals suggests that the anthrax cases have been cutaneous and related to livestock cases, most probably cattle. Anthrax is a livestock disease that spills over into humans. Control it successfully in your livestock, and human cases do not occur.

We wish our Sudanese colleagues success in establishing an efficient livestock program. It is hard work, whoever you might be, and we wish them well. - Mod.MHJ
