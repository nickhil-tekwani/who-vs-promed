PSEUDOMONAS, UNUSUAL VIRULENCE FOR NEONATES - USA, BOSTON
*********************************************************

An unusually virulent, and possibly new, strain of the bacterium
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ killed 3 newborn babies in July and August while
critically ill with other ailments in the neotatal intensive care unit of a
Boston hospital. In addition, a 4th _P. aeruginisa_ fatality 15 months ago
could have been caused by the unusual strain. In this death the strain was
not identified, as it subsequently was -- in Feb 1997 when a 5th infant was
infected but recovered. [In essence, this suggests that the strain may have
been present in the NICU for at least 15 months with a total of 4
fatalities, while the hospital was "taking the unit apart" trying to locate
the source of infection-dp]
Dr. Bela Matyas, medical director of the epidemiology program for the
Massachusetts Dept. of Health said "This organism in this particular
setting is very hardy, and it causes death quickly." However, because the
bacterium is not unusual in hospitals and routinely causes treatable
infections, "We are assuming we are dealing with a new strain."
Dr. Edward O'Rourke, medical director of infection control at the hospital,
said "There is no question this strain is behaving quite unusally."
The hospital closed the NICU on 29 Aug and issued a statement on Sunday, 14
Aug to say that it was trying to isolate the bacteria which produced
overhelming infections in the bloodstreams of the children. Two infants
infected by a less harmful strain are still in the hospital and are expected
to recover. [To recap: in Boston, a total of 7 infants infected by
_Pseudomonas_ -- 5 thought to be a new strain, 2 a less virulent strain; in
Detroit, last spring, a total of 8 infants infected causing 3 deaths --
thought to be a strain different from the one in Boston - dp]
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ is a commonplace bacterium found in moist soil,
often moving to fresh fruits and vegetables, and from there to humans who
rarely become sick. But, even at its normal level of virulence, it can
cause illness in premature infants and immuno-compromised persons. No
employees of the Boston hospital have become sick notwithstanding the
detection of the bacterium on the hands of several workers.
[A flurry of news reports, local and national, have implied that this
cluster of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_-related fatalities may signal the
emergence of a new, "hardy" strain with increased virulence. To date,
neither Dr. Matyas or Dr. O'Rourke have offered specific characterizations
of the organism to support this. They have reported that the isolates lack
the antibiotic resistance markers that often characterize nosocomial
isolates of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_. Perhaps there is nothing new here.
Does anyone have information about other unusual clusters of nosocomial
_Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infection that suggest increased virulence? - es]
