-----------------------------------------------------
Turning to the situation on bluetongue, current evidence suggests
that the disease is broadly contained within the Protection Zone. Up
until winter we can expect to continue to see further cases in this
area due to local animal movements and spread via midges, as well as
sporadic cases outside this zone. These cases will continue to be
reflected where necessary with adjustments to the boundaries of the
zones.

We are continuing to monitor our approach to the control of this
disease as well as decisions on zones and movement controls in
discussion with industry. This disease is quite different to FMD and
it is important that decisions on control are taken by the industry,
and not just by Ministers. Our objective, agreed with the industry,
remains to contain the disease within the currently affected areas.

I very much recognise the growing economic pressures on those farmers
caught within the zones. Animals are allowed to move within the
zones. From 14 Oct 2007, in discussion with industry, we allowed
markets to take place within the zones and animals to go to slaughter
at specified slaughterhouses outside the zones. Animals have been
allowed to move through the zones since 18 Oct 2007.

New EU rules came into force on 1 Nov 2007 which created a clearer
and more harmonised approach to dealing with this disease. One
immediate effect was to change the name of the zones, so that they
now mirror the zones used for other diseases. The new rules required
us to apply some new conditions to permitted movements. We accepted
the views of the industry that the requirement for pre-notification
of movements was administratively burdensome and have taken this up
with the Commission. In the meantime we are not applying this
condition.

We continue to discuss with industry on a regular basis, whether we
should move to the next stage of our control strategy which would see
the UK as a single large zone. However, current analysis of the
epidemiology and cost benefit of such a move indicates that the
potential benefits of trying to control the spread of disease still
outweigh the costs. We are working with delivery partners and the
industry to seek urgent solutions to problems that are occurring with
welfare and movements to winter grazing out of the Protection Zone.

We are developing our surveillance strategy to determine disease
spread and to plan for the possibility that the disease may re-emerge
next year [2008]. With that in mind, on 1 Nov 2007 Defra issued a
tender for between 10 to 20 million doses of Bluetongue vaccine. No
suitable vaccine is currently available for the strain of Bluetongue
circulating in England. However, several companies have vaccines
under development and these are expected to be available from next
summer [2008]. In keeping with the principles of our control strategy
which we published in August 2007, we are developing a detailed
vaccination plan for approval by the European Commission and
livestock keepers will be offered the opportunity to purchase vaccine
from the bank. I am sure the benefits of vaccination will make real
economic sense to many farmers. The vaccination plan is being
developed with scientific experts (including those external to
Defra), representatives of the farming industry and others.
Discussions are also continuing on possible approaches to vaccination
with the European Commission and other Member States affected by
Bluetongue.

Although we are approaching the end of the vector season, it is vital
that farmers in the zones continue to be vigilant, and for the sake
of their industry, continue to report all suspicion of disease.

Working Group on an EU harmonised strategy on vaccination against Bluetongue,
Brussels 5 Nov 2007 - Outcome of the meeting
----------------------------------------------
Summary:
--------
Wide consensus was reached on:
- CommonEU approach: Commissiontaking the lead as regards harmonisation.
- Double goal: 1) reduce clinical disease and losses and 2) contain
the disease.
- Mass vaccination is the option preferred: vaccination of all
susceptible and reachable animals in the restricted zones (affected
areas and in buffer zone).
- Use of all available vaccines: inactivated and modified live virus vaccines.
- Duration: vaccination should be maintained for several years based
on experience.
- It is necessary to send a clear message to the pharmaceutical
industry on the EU preferred strategy.
- Bluetongue should be addressed in an economical context.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The full report on the outcome of the working group is available on
the above URL. The report was distributed during the meeting of the
SCoFCAH on 6 Nov 2007 and discussed during the meeting of the CVOs on
7 Nov 2007. The fax, including the report, was distributed to the
CVOs of all Member States and of Norway, Iceland, Croatia, Turkey and
Switzerland, asking them to provide estimates of the number of
animals to be vaccinated (by species) and of doses (by serotype).

The most significant recommendation of the Working Group is the use
of all available vaccines, inactivated and modified live virus
vaccines, maintained for several years. The full report includes the
following explanatory passage: "Regarding the type of vaccine to be
used, it was agreed that it is not wise to stick to inactivated
vaccines if they are not available on time and in enough quantity to
cover the goals and strategy chosen".

Indeed a timely and clear, commendable science-based decision.

It remains to hope that the BTV-8 vaccines will be manufactured and
undergo the required testing for their safety and efficacy within the
coming 3-4 months, ready for field application within a prior to
summer 2008. Safety issues for the live modified virus vaccines,
particularly for pregnant animals, should be addressed. - Mod.AS]
