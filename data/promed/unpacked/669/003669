Puppies from Puerto Rico tested positive for leptospirosis after they got sick. Leptospirosis is caused by the _Leptospira_ genus of bacteria and can infect humans and different kinds of animals.

Several puppies brought to New Hampshire and Vermont from Puerto Rico tested positive for leptospirosis after getting sick. Individuals who interacted with the infected puppies are advised by authorities to consult their healthcare providers.

On 9 Nov 2017, a Vermont dog rescue non-profit brought 10 puppies to Vermont and New Hampshire from hurricane devastated Puerto Rico in hopes of finding a good home for them. A couple of days later, the puppies were taken to the outdoor patio at Ramunto's Brick and Brew Pizzeria so that the patrons and customers could interact with them.

Soon after, 5 of the 10 puppies had fallen ill, with one of them testing positive for leptospirosis. That said, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) states the puppy testing positive for leptospirosis was not at the restaurant, and as they were merely stationed at a designated area outside the facility, the restaurant is deemed as safe. Out of the 5 puppies that got sick, 2 have been euthanized.

As such, DHHS are investigating and contacting the households that received any of the puppies. What's more, they are also encouraging any persons who may have been in contact with the puppies to contact their healthcare providers. Those who were at the pizzeria but did not come in contact with the puppies are not at risk of infection, as it takes direct contact with the infected animal's urine to be infected.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection capable of infecting humans and various kinds of wild and domestic animals including dogs, horses, cattle, and rodents. The bacteria causing leptospirosis, _Leptospira,_ spp. is spread through the urine of infected animals which may seep into soil or water where it can live for up to weeks and even months. Animals that are infected by the bacteria often do not display any signs but may continue to excrete the bacteria once in a while for up to several years.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests taking care of rodent problems to protect the household from contracting leptospirosis, and even having pets vaccinated. But if a veterinarian has confirmed that your pet does have leptospirosis, antibiotic treatments are available. Early treatment may allow your pet to recover faster and prevent more serious damage to your pet's organs. Direct contact with your pet's blood, urine, and tissues during the infection must be avoided.

Although leptospirosis is rare in the United States, it is the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world, with 50 percent of cases occurring in Puerto Rico.

[It is likely the puppies were moved because of issues following the hurricane that hit the island of Puerto Rico. However, this is one of the risks when relocating animals following disasters. During a disaster and its aftermath, animals may not get the best of care and may be exposed to contaminated waters and food as well as other harsh conditions. So, when animals are relocated, they are relocated with potential diseases, distress, and toxin exposure. In the case of the animals from Puerto Rico, the disease was leptospirosis.

"Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs.

Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness, some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, a veterinarian may recommend a number of other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _Leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection" https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/Leptospirosis.aspx.

Groups offering to relocate animals in hopes for better homes than the place of the disaster often do not have the resources to test for a variety of diseases. Hopefully, this disease was caught early and none of the workers or those interacting with the puppies will have any clinical signs of the disease. - Mod.TG
