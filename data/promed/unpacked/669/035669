-----------------------------------------------
At least 9 people were killed in an outbreak of sleeping sickness in
Katakwi district, some 240 km northeast of the Ugandan capital Kampala, The
New Vision reported on Monday [13 Dec 2004]. Local official Geoffrey Okaka
was quoted by the state-owned newspaper as saying that 27 adults had been
admitted to Lwala Hospital. He added that the health ministry of the
country has given the eastern district 2000 tsetse fly traps, the insect
that transmits the often fatal disease. In August of this year [2004],
sleeping sickness broke out in Kaberamaido district, bordering Katakwi,

the main reservoir. Control remains difficult, and this outbreak is
localized in the northern part of Uganda close to the area affected by the
civil war. - Mod.EP]
