The Department of Health is today [Mon 4 Dec 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as at Fri 1 Dec 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 158
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 164
(The next table will be published on Mon 8 Jan 2007).
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Nov
2006, the total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged
and stands at 158. The overall total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains unchanged at 164.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, and 5 in
2005. The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD in the UK
during the first 11 months of 2006 remains at 5.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in 2005 and 2006
----------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 1 Dec 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 123
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 65 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 7 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from vCJD.
The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 11 months of 2006 are:
98 referrals, 53 deaths from sporadic CJD, 5 from vCJD, 5 from
familial CJD, 3 from GSS and one from iatrogenic CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was first diagnosed, up to the
present there have been 953 deaths from all forms of CJD including
the 158 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD.

[The gradual increase in sporadic and other forms of CJD in the USA
throughout this period may merely reflect improvements in
surveillance and diagnosis rather than a real increase in incidence.
For example, according to the tables above, there were approximately
1 per million cases of sporadic CJD in the USA during 2005, compared
with 2 cases per million in the UK during the same period. This
difference could be indicative of a real difference in incidence or a
difference in efficiency of diagnosis. - Mod.CP]

[4] The Netherlands - 2nd death
Date: Thu 16 Nov 2006
From: Mary Marshall <tropical.forestry@btinternet.com>
Source: iol.co.za Medical, Reuters report, Thu 16 Nov 2006 [edited]
<http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=117&art_id=qw116369190368S433>

A 2nd Dutch person has died from the human variant of mad cow disease
following the death of a woman last year, health authorities said on
Thu 16 Nov 2006. The Dutch Institute for Health and Environment
(RIVM) give no details about the victim, but Dutch television
stations said he was a 16-year-old boy.
A spokeswoman for the RIVM said the victim died from the
brain-wasting [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), the human
form of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) about 2 weeks ago. She
did not explain why the RIVM had waited 2 weeks to confirm the death,
which was reported in Dutch media on Thursday. The RIVM diagnosed the
person with the human variant of mad cow [disease] in June and said
at the time that the patient had most probably become infected by
eating contaminated meat products. It was the 2nd Dutch death from
the human variant of mad cow disease after a 26-year-old woman died
in May 2005.
The disease is fatal and incurable. It is thought to be caused by
eating food tainted with material from cattle with BSE, a progressive
neurological disorder. More than 150 cases of vCJD have been reported
around the world, mostly in Britain, but also in France, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States. Mad cow disease first
emerged in Britain in the 1980s and has forced the destruction of
millions of cattle.

Confirmed Case of Variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) in the
United States in a Patient from the Middle East
---------------------------------------------------
The Virginia Department of Health
[<http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/Alerts/vCJD.htm>] and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention announced the recent confirmation
of a vCJD case in a U.S. resident. This is the 3rd vCJD case
identified in a U.S. resident. This latest U.S. case occurred in a
young adult who was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and has lived in
the United States since late 2005. The patient occasionally stayed in
the United States for up to 3 months at a time since 2001 and there
was a shorter visit in 1989. In late November 2006, the Clinical
Prion Research Team at the University of California San Francisco
Memory and Aging Center confirmed the vCJD clinical diagnosis by
pathologic study of adenoid and brain biopsy tissues. The 2
previously reported vCJD case-patients in U.S. residents were each
born and raised in the United Kingdom (U.K.), where they were
believed to have been infected by the agent responsible for their
disease. There is strong scient!
ific evidence that the agent causing vCJD is the same agent that
causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly known as mad
cow disease).
Variant CJD is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder that
emerged in the United Kingdom in the mid-1990s. Although experience
with this new disease is limited, evidence to date indicates that
there has never been a case transmitted from person-to-person except
through blood transfusion. Instead, the disease is thought to result
primarily from consumption of cattle products contaminated with the
BSE agent. Although no cases of BSE in cattle have been reported in
Saudi Arabia, potentially contaminated cattle products from the
United Kingdom may have been exported to Saudi Arabia for many years
during the large U.K. BSE outbreak.
The current case-patient has no history of receipt of blood, a past
neurological procedure, or residing in or visiting countries of
Europe. Based on the patient's history, the occurrence of a
previously reported Saudi case of vCJD attributed to likely
consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle products in Saudi Arabia, and
the expected greater than 7 year incubation period for food-related
vCJD, this U.S. case-patient was most likely infected from
contaminated cattle products consumed as a child when living in Saudi
Arabia (1). The current patient has no history of donating blood and
the public health investigation has identified no risk of
transmission to U.S. residents from this patient.
As of November 2006, 200 vCJD patients were reported world-wide,
including 164 patients identified in the United Kingdom, 21 in
France, 4 in the Republic of Ireland, 3 in the United States
(including the present case-patient), 2 in the Netherlands and 1 each
in Canada, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Spain. Of the 200
reported vCJD patients, all except 10 of them (including the present
case-patient) had resided either in the United Kingdom (170 cases)
for over 6 months during the 1980-1996 period of the large UK BSE
outbreak or alternatively in France (20 cases).
As reported in 2005 (1), the U.S. National Prion Disease Pathology
Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University confirmed the
diagnosis in the one previously identified case of vCJD in a Saudi
resident. He was hospitalized in Saudi Arabia and his brain biopsy
specimen was shipped to the United States for analysis. This earlier
vCJD case-patient was believed to have contracted his fatal disease
in Saudi Arabia (1).

[There is inconsistency in the number of vCJD cases attributed to the
United States. The Virginia Department of Health/CDC report cited in
the above list 3 cases -- 2 cases probably contracted in the U.K. and
the young adult described above who was born and raised in Saudi
Arabia. The EUROCJD data for October 2006 in part (2) above also
lists 2 U.S. cases, both assumed to have been contracted in the
U.K. The U.S. National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center
Data published on 8 Nov 2006 (part 3 above), on the other hand, list
only a single U.S. case believed to have been contracted in the U.K. - Mod.CP]
