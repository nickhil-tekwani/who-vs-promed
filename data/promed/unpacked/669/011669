Geese die in droves in Keizer; experts baffled
Bodies of water don't appear to be the cause
------------------
Geese are literally falling from the sky in and around Keizer, and wildlife
experts don't know why.
About 150 Canada geese were found dead Friday at a private pond off
Wheatland Road owned by Morse Bros. Rock Products in rural Marion
County. 30 or so other dead birds were discovered 3 months ago near Staats
Lake, a private lake in Keizer.
State wildlife officials visited both sites to investigate. The officials
suspect that the birds may have died from something they ate, because it
doesn't appear that anything in the pond or lake killed the birds.
"Reports of one bird here or one over there is not cause for alarm," said
Will High, a wildlife biologist for the Oregon Department of Fish and
Wildlife. "But when you have 10 or 20 or 30 or 100 of them all of a sudden
die in one day, well, that's just not normal."
Only cackling Canada geese, a small subspecies of the larger Canada goose,
were affected, High said. Other varieties of birds, including ducks, gulls
and 3 other species of geese were alive and well in both bodies of water.
The dead birds were found floating in the water. They appeared to swim with
their heads under water, High said. Others were found on dry ground lying
on their stomachs with wings flared out.
The goose carcasses have been sent to the National Wildlife Health Center
in Madison, Wis., to be tested. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
federal agency that regulates migratory birds, also was notified.
5 years ago, large numbers of dead geese were discovered in Staats Lake.
The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife studied the problem, but
couldn't track down the cause. Tests showed that the birds weren't dying of
infections or disease; the results were inconclusive about whether the
birds died from something they ate.
Wildlife officials said that in recent weeks, large numbers of dead geese
also have been found in Monmouth and McMinnville. They don't know if the
incidents are related.

[There are a number of possibilities here, including Avian cholera. It is
unlikely that toxins are the cause, as the deaths seem to be dispersed over
a relatively large area. We would appreciate an authoritative report. - Mod.TG]
