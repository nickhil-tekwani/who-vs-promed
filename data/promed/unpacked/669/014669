Fusarium Wilt of Tomato Caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp.
_lycopersici_ Race 3 in Baja California Sur, Mexico.
R. J. Holguin-Pena, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del
Noroeste, Mar Bermejo 195, Col. Playa Palo de Santa Rita, La Paz,
Baja California Sur 23090, Mexico. Plant Dis. 89:1360, 2005;
published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1360C. Accepted for
publication 31 Aug 2005.
Vascular wilting diseases have become one of the most serious
diseases of tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) throughout the Baja
California Peninsula. Since the winter of 2004, a disease with
symptoms characteristic of those caused by a Fusarium species has
been observed in commercial fields near La Paz and Todos Santos in
the state of Baja California Sur (BCS). Symptoms include typical
one-sided wilting and dark brown vascular discoloration.
Upper stem tissues and wilted seedlings were disinfested by immersion
in a 1.0 percent aqueous solution of sodium hypochlorite for 2 min,
rinsed in sterile water, and placed on Komada's medium (pH 6.8) at 22
plus/minus 3 deg C. After 72 h, hyphal growth was recovered and
subcultured on carnation leaf agar and potato dextrose agar and
incubated at 25 deg C in 12-h light/dark cycles.
Identification was based on colony morphology, conidial
characteristics, and molecular techniques. White cottony mycelium,
reddish coloration of the medium, ovoid 2-celled macroconidia, and
large macroconidia, all characteristic of _F. oxysporum_, were
observed (2). Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment
length polymorphisms with restriction enzymes EcoRI, RsaI, and HaeIII
were used to characterize 24 isolates (sampled during January 2005)
from La Paz (Fol-LaP) as _formae speciales lycopersici_ and assigned
to vegetative compatibility group 0030 (1).
Confirmation of pathogenicity and race determination for the Fol-LaP
isolates were as described previously (3). Mexican isolates of races
2 and 3 (one each) were included as positive controls. Conidial
suspensions of 700 000 CFU/ml were used to inoculate differential
tomato cvs. Bonny Best (Millington Co., universally susceptible),
Tequila F1 (Vilmorin, race 1 resistant), Rio Grande (Harris Moran,
race 1 and 2 resistant), and Sebring (Rogers, race 1, 2, and 3 resistant).
Plants at the first true-leaf stage were inoculated by dipping their
roots in the conidial suspension. Inoculated seedlings were
transplanted into pots containing a sterile 5:1:1 mixture of
sand/vermiculite/soil (v/v/v) and maintained in the greenhouse at 25
to 28 deg C under natural daylight. An equal number of plants of each
cultivar dipped in water were used as controls. The experimental
design was a completely randomized type with 6 replications (pots)
containing 4 seedlings per pot. The test was done twice.
The most susceptible plants inoculated by root-dipping developed
typical symptoms of wilt, slight vein clearing on outer leaflets,
stunting, dark brown vascular discoloration, and death. _F.
oxysporum_ was recovered from all symptomatic plants, whereas
noninoculated tomato seedlings showed no symptoms. According to
differential infection and symptomatology observed on infected
cultivars, 62.5 percent of the isolated strains were identified as
race 2, 25 percent as race 3, and 12.5 percent as an undetermined
race isolated from Sebring.
The presence of race 3 in BCS has important epidemiological
implications, since it has been reported on tomato in Sinaloa (4).
The potential spread of the pathogen on introduced transplants
represents a risk to tomato crops on the peninsula.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _F. oxysporum_ f. sp.
_lycopersici_ race 3 in the state of BCS, Mexico.

[Fusarium wilt, caused by 3 races of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.
sp._lycopersici_ [Fol] is one of the most important diseases of
tomato. Races 1 and 2 are distributed worldwide, whereas race 3 has a
more limited geographic distribution with no report thus far in
Brazil. 7 Fol isolates were obtained from wilted tomato plants of
race 1 and 2-resistant hybrids 'Carmen' and 'Alambra' in Venda Nova
do Imigrante (State of Espirito Santo), Brazil. Results of virulence
assays using a set of race differential cultivars showed that
'Ponderosa' were susceptible to all races, 'IPA-5' was resistant to
race 1, 'Floradade' was resistant to races 1 and 2 and 'BHRS-2,3' was
resistant to race 3. All isolates were highly virulent to
'Ponderosa', 'IPA-5' and 'Floradade' and were able to infect only a
few plants of 'BHRS-2,3'. An additional virulence test was conducted
including the same set of cultivars plus _Lycopersicon pennellii_
'LA716'. Identical results were obtained with _L. pennellii_
displaying an extreme (immune-like) resistant response.
These results indicated that all 7 isolates could be classified as
Fol race 3. This new Fusarium wilt might became an economically
important disease, since race 3-resistant cultivars adapted to Brazil
are not yet available.
This is the 1st formal report of race 3 in Brazil, extending the
geographical range of this pathogen. Fol can be introduced into new
growing areas via contaminated seeds. The presence of race 3 in
geographically isolated tomato-growing areas in Brazil could be the
result of either pathogen introduction via contaminated seeds or the
occurrence of an autochthonous (indigenous) race 3 isolate. In fact,
recent results indicate that new race 3 isolates could have
originated from genetic changes in the local populations of native
Fol isolates. Additional studies employing molecular fingerprinting
systems and/or vegetative compatibility groups with a world-wide
collection of Fol isolates could provide some indication of whether
this pathogen is endemic to Venda Nova do Imigrante or if it was
introduced and, if so, from which geographical area.
This new Fusarium wilt might became an economically important disease
since race 3-resistant cultivars adapted to Brazilian conditions are
not yet available. In addition, screening trials searching for new
sources of resistance seems to be necessary, since the genetic
plasticity associated with selective pressures due to the use of race
3 resistant cultivars might cause the establishment of new pathogenic
races of this fungus. These screening trials are already under way in
Embrapa Hortalicas, and new resistance sources have been found.
Management strategies for Fol include disinfestation of the soil and
planting material with fungicidal chemicals; crop rotation for
several years, but Fol is long-lived; planting non-hosts of Fol; and
using resistant cultivars. Limit the spread of infested soil by
cleaning farm equipment. Avoid root knot nematode infestations,
because nematode feeding can overcome plant resistance to Fusarium wilt.
