Malaria makes a comeback in Sri Lanka
-------------------------------------
Sri Lanka Ministry of Health says that the spread
of malaria in the island has increased by 25 percent.

In 2010, Health Ministry statistics reported 580
malaria cases, says Dr. Sarath Deniyage, the
Chairman of the Dengue and Malaria Carrier
Suppression Committee. He further stated that a
number of reasons have caused the increase of malaria cases in Sri Lanka.

Health sources say that global warming also has
an effect on spread of mosquito born diseases
like dengue and malaria. The Ministry of Health
has planned to expand the network of clinics in
the areas affected by the disease in the country.

Dry Zone districts such as Anuradhapura,
Polonnaruwa, Hambanthota, Ampara and the Northern
and Eastern Provinces are the worst affected by
malaria, Health Ministry sources say.

[Sri Lanka is classified as being in the
"pre-elimination" phase by the WHO (World Malaria
report 2009). Global warming is an elusive
explanation and other explanations like a
declining use of impregnated bed nets could also play a role. ­ Mod.EP]
