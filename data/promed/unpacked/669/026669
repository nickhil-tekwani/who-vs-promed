Tamiflu Approved for Prevention of Influenza in Children Under Age 12
-----------------------------------------------
On Wed 21 Dec 2005, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the use of Tamiflu (oseltamivir phosphate) for prevention
(prophylaxis) of seasonal influenza ("flu") in children one to 12
years of age who had close contact with an infected individual. This
is the 1st drug approved for prevention of both influenza A and B
[human influenza virus infection] in pediatric patients.
Tamiflu is an oral anti-viral drug previously approved by FDA for
both the prevention and treatment of influenza in adolescents, 13
years and older, and in adults. Tamiflu also is approved for
treatment of influenza in pediatric patients older than one year of
age.
A study of the spread of flu in households involving over 1100 people
included 222 children one to 12 years of age. When someone in the
household was diagnosed with seasonal flu, other family members
received either Tamiflu once a day for 10 days or no Tamiflu at all
unless they became ill. The rate of children developing fever and
other symptoms confirmed to be flu was reduced from 17 percent in the
group receiving no preventative treatment to 3 percent in the group
that received Tamiflu as a preventative measure. The benefit in
children mirrored the benefit seen in older individuals in this and
earlier studies. The effective use of Tamiflu to prevent influenza in
immunocompromised patients has not been established.
In the studies, side effects from Tamiflu, when taken for prevention,
were similar to those from patients who took the drug for treatment.
The most common side effects were nausea, vomiting, headache and
fatigue. Vomiting was reported more frequently in people receiving
the twice daily treatment dose compared to once daily prophylaxis. In
the current study, children reported higher rates of vomiting than
adults, but this was observed to be dose-related. Although no new
side effects occurred in these studies, FDA has requested additional
post-market study data from the drug maker to support the long term
safety of the drug.
A comprehensive review of post-marketing safety reports for Tamiflu
indicated rare reports of severe rash and allergic-type skin
reactions that may be drug-related. As was discussed at the FDA
Pediatric Advisory Committee, on 18 Nov 2005, FDA required that new
safety language regarding serious skin/hypersensitivity reactions be
added to the Tamiflu product label. Patients should be cautioned to
stop taking Tamiflu and contact their health care providers if they
develop a severe rash or allergic symptoms.
Tamiflu is not a substitute for the [seasonal] flu vaccine. Patients
should continue receiving an annual flu vaccination according to
guidelines on immunization practices.
Tamiflu is manufactured and distributed by Roche Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. of Nutley, New Jersey.

[Previously, a U.S. government safety investigation of the antiviral
drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) reviewed 12 deaths in Japanese children
who had received the drug, but a U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) advisory panel concluded that the deaths were not related to it
(see ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human - East Asia (179):
Tamiflu 20051122.3396"). This new U.S. FDA press release further
extends approval of the use of the anti-neuraminidase inhibitor
Tamiflu to include prophylactic treatment of children under 12 years
of age known to be exposed to infection with either A or B type human
influenza viruses. However, the increased frequency of vomiting in
treated children indicates a need for careful control of dosage. -
