Two people have died and 18 others have been hospitalized after a "respiratory outbreak" at a Virginia retirement community, according to officials. The Fairfax County Department of Health said that 54 individuals had become ill with "respiratory symptoms, ranging from upper respiratory symptoms (cough) to pneumonia" in the last 11 days at Greenspring Retirement Community in Springfield.

In a letter Wednesday [10 Jul 2019] to residents obtained by ABC News affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington, DC, Greenspring described symptoms as "fever, cough, body aches, wheezing, hoarseness and general weakness."

Benjamin Schwartz, a health department director, told ABC News on Thursday [11 Jul 2019] that the outbreak had been reported in the assisted-living and skilled-nursing sections. He said the outbreak began with the 1st case on [30 Jun 2019]. The specific cause of the outbreak had not yet been identified, but additional tests of samples were being done, according to Schwartz.

The assisted-living and skilled-nursing facility in Greenspring is home to 263 residents, Schwartz said. He said the 2 patients who died in the outbreak had been hospitalized with pneumonia but were "older individuals with complex medical problems."

"One of the things about skilled-nursing facilities and assisted-living facilities is [that] when you have a lot of people in close proximity, who have underlying medical conditions, there is an increased risk for outbreaks," he said. "Seeing a respiratory outbreak in a long-term care facility is not odd. ... One thing that's different about this outbreak is just that it's occurring in the summer when, usually, we don't have a lot of respiratory disease."

Of those initially hospitalized, 7 have returned to the retirement home, said Courtney Benoff, regional communications manager for Erikson Living, which owns the retirement home. The health department said that although there had been no new hospitalizations in the "past couple of days," residents were still getting sick in the outbreak.

In a statement, Greenspring said that its "highest priority is the welfare of those who live and work on campus."

"In keeping with this commitment the community has acted with an abundance of caution, and in partnership with the Fairfax County Department of Health, has taken all necessary measures to fully implement proven infection prevention and control strategies. We remain vigilant in our response and will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates to residents, staff and family members," the retirement home said in a statement.

The Fairfax County Health Department said it is investigating the incident.

The department said that appropriate measures had been taken to reduce the risk of infection and keep residents safe, including closing the facility to new admissions, cancelling group activities, keeping ill residents in their rooms and increasing cleaning. Residents experiencing any of those symptoms were urged to call the community's medical center.

[The above news article reports an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness that has affected 54 individuals, 18 of whom were hospitalized, 2 with a fatal pneumonia, in the past 12 days in the assisted-living and skilled-nursing sections of a retirement community in northern Virginia. Symptoms included fever, cough, body aches, wheezing, hoarseness and general weakness. The specific cause of the outbreak has not yet been identified.

Acute respiratory infections occur more often during the winter, but some respiratory pathogens occur year-round or are most common in the summertime. Infections due to various enteroviruses are more frequent in the summertime. Similarly, legionellosis (Legionnaires' disease [LD] and Pontiac fever) is also more common in the warm and humid summer months, when the _Legionella_ bacteria may rapidly increase in cooling towers and spread through aerosolized water droplets leaving the towers. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16288369, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5652433/). People who are prone to aspiration can also develop LD following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water.

People at greater risk for respiratory infections and their complications include the elderly, debilitated or those who have pre-existing respiratory or cardiac conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Outbreaks can be facilitated in nursing homes because of close contact of persons at risk for transmission by respiratory droplets expelled through coughing and sneezing (e.g., influenza) or by fecal-oral means (i.e., contaminated fingers or fomites to mouth) (e.g., enteroviruses) or because of the congregation of large numbers of people at risk who can inhale aerosols or aspirate contaminated water (e.g., _Legionella_).

Legionellosis is caused by various species of _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_. LD is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis, and Pontiac fever is the non-pneumonic form. Fever, malaise and muscle aches are less severe in Pontiac fever than in LD, and symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Pontiac fever develops hours to 3 days after initial infection vs 2 to 10 days for LD. Attack rates for Pontiac fever are high; up to 95% of exposed persons become ill vs less than 5% for LD. Unlike LD, there appear to be no predisposing host conditions for Pontiac fever. Risk factors for LD include age greater than or equal to 50 years, smoking (current or historical), chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD), immune system disorders due to disease or medication, systemic malignancy, and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html).

_Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae_ and _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ infections occur year-round, but are characterized by their slow spread through closed populations, unlike the outbreak described in the news article above.

Although influenza is usually a wintertime illness, large summertime outbreaks of influenza have been reported (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11393483, https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/36/9/1095/311347). Also the 12-day time interval in the Virginia outbreak is consistent with the rapid spread of influenza through a community of susceptible individuals due to the short interval in time (about 2 days) between when a person becomes infected and when that person can infect the next person.

Greenspring is a retirement community, with independent living, assisted living, memory care, short- and long-term nursing care units, supported by a staff of more than 1200 in Springfield, Fairfax County in northern Virginia (https://www.ericksonliving.com/greenspring/about). Springfield, along with collective areas with Springfield addresses, having an estimated population of more than 100 000 residents in 2010, is located in the Washington Metropolitan Area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Virginia). A map showing the location of Springfield can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Springfield,+VA.

Rapid respiratory pathogen screening tests, e.g., influenza, should be available. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
