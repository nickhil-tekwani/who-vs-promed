Cereal Rust Bulletin, Report for 2006 No. 2
--------------------------------------------
[As of April 4 2006]
- Wheat leaf rust is widespread throughout the southern U.S.
- Wheat stripe rust is at low levels in Texas but heavier in Louisiana.
- Wheat stem rust has not been reported in the U.S.
Wheat leaf rust.
--------
In late March 2006 in central Texas, commercial wheat fields had low levels
of leaf rust infections and moderate levels in nurseries which had
sufficient moisture for rust development due to recent rains. Susceptible
cultivars growing in plots that had been irrigated in southern Texas
nurseries had high severity levels of leaf rust. However, no leaf rust was
found in southern Texas fields because of the drought conditions. In late
March 2006, wheat plots in central Oklahoma had low levels of leaf
rust. Wheat leaf rust has been found in fields and plots in the southern
soft red winter wheat area from southern Georgia, southern Alabama to
southern Arkansas. In late March 2006 in wheat plots at Alexandria,
Louisiana, 20 percent leaf rust severities were observed on the lower
leaves of susceptible cultivars. Some of the fields infected with rust
have been sprayed for rust control in the southern U.S. Leaf rust will
continue to increase rapidly with adequate moisture and warm weather, and
will provide rust inoculum for the wheat growing areas further north. In
late March 2006, the cultivar McCormick in southeastern North Carolina
plots had low levels of leaf rust on lower leaves. This is an early
observation for wheat leaf rust in North Carolina and is presumably due to
over-wintering in that area.
Wheat stripe rust.
----------
In late March 2006, wheat fields and plots in southern and central Texas
had low levels of wheat stripe rust infections (Fig. 2). When compared to
2005 at this time, stripe rust is much lighter throughout Texas. Weather
conditions have not been favorable for rust development (limited moisture
and few cool nights) in Texas. By the end of March 2006 no stripe rust had
been reported in Oklahoma. In late March 2006, stripe rust was active in
Louisiana and some fields were sprayed for rust control. In wheat plots in
south central Louisiana, susceptible cultivars had 60 percent stripe rust
severities. Higher day and night temperatures during the last week of
March 2006 slowed stripe rust development. In late March 2006, stripe rust
was light in fields in southern Arkansas.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_). These are
all caused by species of the fungus Puccinia: wheat stem rust (_P. graminis
f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P. recondita f. sp.
tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f. sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since the
1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are still a
possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul,
MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts in the USA during the crop
season. Each report gives detailed state-by-state information, including a
summary map, all in pdf file format (see link to main article).
