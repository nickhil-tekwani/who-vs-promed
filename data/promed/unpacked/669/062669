A Rusape [Makoni District, Manicaland Province] family was robbed of its child, who died after succumbing to a rabies infection following the minor's attack by a rabid dog. The rabid dog that bit the minor is said to have attacked several other dogs in the town's surrounding farming area, raising a rabies scare and serious concerns over the safety of children. Makoni District Medical Officer Dr Alfred Kumbirai on Wednesday [5 Mar 2014] confirmed the minor's death. "It is true we had a case in which a minor died of rabies, having been attacked by a rabid dog," said Dr Kumbirai.

Dr Kumbirai could not furnish this paper with finer details of the case and referred further questions to Rusape General Hospital's medical superintendent, Dr Tembo. Dr Tembo refused to comment and asked this publication to approach the administrator, Mr Ngwaru, who is not a medical expert, to comment on the story. Sources at the hospital also confirmed that the minor succumbed to the infection a fortnight ago [around 21 Feb 2014].

"The child was delirious. Her parents delayed in seeking medication, and by the time they eventually did so, the situation was helpless. As you know, rabies is not curable. There was foam coming out of the mouth. The child regularly went into shock. The child was shaking and very agitated," said a source at the hospital.

Last year [2013] another child succumbed to rabies as a result of the bites. [Not recorded by OIE.]

Children are at particularly higher risk because of their proximity to domestic animals. Shots given immediately after contact with saliva from a rabid animal can easily prevent death. But once symptoms appear, treatment is useless.

Statistics at hand show that Buhera has recorded 128 bites by vaccinated dogs, 97 by unvaccinated dogs and 280 by dogs whose vaccination status is unknown. At 505 bites, Buhera becomes the most risky district. Chimanimani has recorded 190 bites, Chipinge 312 bites, Makoni 501 [where the child presumably lived and was exposed.], Mutare 484, Mutasa 454, Nyanga 229, Mutare City 132.

Efforts to get a comment from the provincial veterinary officer, Dr Charles Guri, were fruitless as his mobile phone went unanswered. Sources at the provincial offices said Dr Guri was attending a training workshop in Harare.

It was not immediately clear if the department had moved in to kill the infected dogs or conducted mass vaccinations.

[In 2012, the last year for Zimbabwe provincial rabies data provided to OIE, there were 160 animal rabies cases reported from every province; there were only 1st 6 months reports for Manicaland Province, and those involved 2 jackals and 1 dog, and no reports at all for July through December. Zimbabwe has not provided OIE with any data for 2013. The usual status of the human disease in the country is "+" but without any numbers except for 2007, when there were 7 human deaths. So I think we can safely presume that this is a serious zoonotic problem awaiting proper management. The news report was very polite when it stated, "It was not immediately clear if the department had moved in to kill the infected dogs or conducted mass vaccinations." It is not stated whether the attack dog was caught and tested for rabies. Absence would suggest that this did not happen.

Urban rabies is readily and cheaply controlled by annual vaccination of dogs. Wildlife rabies control is more complicated and expensive as it involves oral vaccination using baits designed to attract the target species (singular or plural) that is driving the problem. This has been achieved by a number of countries in Europe, and the US and Canada.
