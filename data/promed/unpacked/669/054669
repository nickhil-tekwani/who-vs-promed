[1] West Java: suspected case (30-year-old woman)
Date: Sun 23 Sep 2007

An Indonesian woman suspected of being infected with bird flu has
died in the West Java city of Bandung, hospital sources there said
Sunday [23 Sep 2007]. Samples from the 30-year-old woman have been
sent for testing in Jakarta, said a staff member at Bandung's Hasan
Sadikin general hospital who only identified himself as Herdi. A
total of 2 tests must come back positive for the H5N1 virus before a
victim is confirmed as part of the official bird flu death toll in
Indonesia, which is the highest in the world at 85 [deaths among 106
cases. - Mod.CP]
The woman, who died on Saturday [22 Sep 2007], was showing symptoms
of bird flu infection, such as fever, coughing, breathing
difficulties, and low red blood count. Herdi declined to give further
details, but the Koran Tempo [newspaper] said that the victim fell
sick a few days after one of her pet birds died. Transmission usually
occurs directly from birds to humans. The kind of bird involved has
not been identified.
If confirmed to be infected with the H5N1 strain of the virus, the
woman would be the 86th human fatality in the country; 21 other
people have been infected by the deadly H5N1 virus strain that causes
bird flu, but have so far survived. H5N1 is endemic in birds across
nearly all of Indonesia.

[According to local media on Mon 24 Sep 2007,] 2 Indonesian children
were in critical condition at a hospital in Riau Province with
doctors strongly suspecting them of having developed bird flu
symptoms in the country where 84 [85 according to WHO as of 10 Sep
2007 - Mod.CP] people already died of the virus.
The 2 boys, ages one and 3, are being treated in isolated rooms at
the Arifin Ahmad Hospital in the provincial capital of Pekanbaru,
leading news website Detikcom said. [Detikcom quoted Dr. Azizman Saad
with the hospital as saying, "They are suffering high fever and
respiratory problems," and, "the condition of their lungs is
deteriorating, with excessive liquid production."
Laboratory tests by the hospital indicated that the 2 patients had
bird flu but further tests in Jakarta are needed for confirmation.
Over the last 2 years, bird flu killed 3 people in Riau alone.

[If these suspected cases of H5N1 avian influenza are eventually
confirmed by further laboratory testing they will become the 107th,
