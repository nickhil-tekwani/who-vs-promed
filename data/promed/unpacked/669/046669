A medical person has been diagnosed to have Lassa fever at the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan [Oyo state], the fever transmitted through multi-mammary gland rats. The medical person, who was brought in from Oke-Ogun area of the state, was diagnosed with the fever after samples of his blood were sent for screening in Lagos.

Professor Abiodun Otegbayo, UCH's Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee, said he was admitted with fever and other symptoms suggestive of a viral flu and the tendency to bleed from openings on the body.

The don, who suggested that the medical personnel could have contracted Lassa fever from his work as doctor, stated, "we are on top of the situation and the patient is currently stable on admission." He assured, "the patient is isolated for treatment. We use what is called personal protective equipment from the Federal Ministry of health. We have drugs to treat the condition and the patient has been on the drugs and is stable."

Professor Otegbayo, however, said the medical person's contact, including medical personnel that attended to him while on hospital admission at UCH, Ibadan, will need to be screened to be sure they were not infected with the ailment [virus].

He then advised people to ensure their houses are not infested with rats and to maintain communal hygiene, saying rats that carry the problem must be prevented from having direct contact with food.

According to him, individuals with viral infections like the flu that has lasted for more than one week should promptly seek medical attention rather than self medicate, thinking the problem will go [away]. He declared: "Flu means you have fever, which will be persistent. You have nasal discharge; there could be sneezing, headaches, redness of eye, body pains and a general feeling of unwell."

Meanwhile, Oyo State Ministry of Health Deputy State Epidemiologist, Dr Abass Gbolahan, said the state swung into action immediately [after] it was notified of the Lassa fever case. Dr Gbolahan, saying that a case of Lassa fever is an epidemic because the disease spreads rapidly, said, "we are already positioned to curtail the problem. We have all the required materials, including drugs to treat Lassa fever."

While declaring that some required materials like gloves and personal protective equipment and drugs for treating Lassa fever had already been supplied by the state ministry of health, Dr Gbolahan said contact tracing had also been carried out in Saki and Ago-are where the doctor works and resides.

In addition, he said the people and health workers within Saki and Ago-are were sensitised on the signs and symptoms of Lassa fever, urging that anybody with fever that persists after medication should report immediately to the hospital.

[An expert in the treatment of Lassa fever stated that the disease has spread from 6 states of the country in 2009 to 23 in 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140116.2178284). It was reported that at least 93 persons have died from complications associated with Lassa fever between January 2011 and September 2013.

Lassa fever virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the multimammate rat (_Mastomys_ spp). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.
