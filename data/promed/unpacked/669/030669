Cadbury's [chocolate] was the most likely cause of a salmonella
poisoning outbreak said the Health Protection Agency. Up to 37 of
the 56 cases of salmonella food poisoning reported in England and
Wales between Mar and Jul 2006 were linked to the products.
In a statement, the Health Protection Agency said 13 of the people it
had interviewed reported eating Cadbury's products and another person
said they had eaten confectionary, but did not know the brand. The
National Public Health Service in Wales also reported a person who
had eaten a Cadbury's product.
The agency's Outbreak Control Team (OCT) said: "After carefully
considering all the available evidence the OCT concluded that
consumption of products made by Cadbury Schweppes was the most
credible explanation for the outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Montevideo."
The agency also noted the number of cases of reported salmonella
dropped following the firm's voluntary product recall and said the
geographical distribution of cases suggested the outbreak was caused
by a nationally distributed food.
In Jun 2006 the chocolate manufacturer recalled 1 million chocolate
bars because of salmonella fears. At the time it said it recalled the
bars as a precautionary measure. A leaking pipe at Cadbury's
Marlbrook plant in Herefordshire was blamed for the contamination.
Cadbury's agreed to improve its testing procedures after the Food
Standards Agency said they were not up to modern standards, and a
cleaning operation began at the plant to ensure no salmonella remained.
In a statement issued today Cadbury's said: "We're sorry to hear that
people have been unwell. We've already announced that we have changed
our protocol because we understood that the consumers' desire for no
risk at all is paramount. Any product showing any traces of
salmonella will be destroyed."
