The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) has confirmed the outbreak of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in the Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces. The department said it has received reports of die-offs of wild rabbits and hares from the Karoo areas in the Western and Northern Cape.

"State veterinary services, private veterinarians, and the Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment were involved in field investigations. Post-mortems were performed and samples collected to confirm the cause of the deaths. Diagnostic tests were performed at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Laboratory, and the cause was confirmed as rabbit haemorrhagic disease," the department said in a statement.

RHD is a disease caused by a virus, calicivirus, resulting in a high number of deaths in rabbits and hares, and the sudden death of animals due to bleeding in the organs including the liver, kidney, and spleen.

The department said this is the 1st detection of the disease in South Africa, and at this stage it is still unclear how the disease could have entered the country, since the importation of rabbits and hares is not allowed. The department said investigations are under way to determine whether illegal importation could be the source.

"Control of RHD in rabbitries relies mainly on vaccination, but the vaccine is not available in South Africa. This increases the importance of biosecurity measures in rabbitries and anywhere where rabbits or hares are kept. Biosecurity measures are difficult to implement in wild populations. The occurrence of RHD in the Karoo is therefore of great concern, as our indigenous Red Rock rabbit, endangered Riverine rabbit and hare species are highly susceptible to this disease," the department said.

The department warned that carcasses of RHD-infected rabbits might be a major source for viral spreading, since the virus seems to be highly resistant and stable, even when exposed to harsh environmental conditions. Rabbit owners have been advised to ensure that their rabbits are secured and must prevent any contact with other rabbits or hares, either directly or indirectly through people or equipment. Members of the public have also been encouraged to report any dead or dying rabbits or hares to the nearest state veterinarian for investigation.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a serious and extremely contagious viral disease of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). Morbidity and mortality rates are high in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all naive rabbits may die. ... The disease caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it was first introduced...

"Classical RHDV and/or RHDVa are endemic in some areas with wild European rabbits, including Australia, New Zealand, some islands (e.g., Cuba), parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Susceptible wild lagomorphs do not exist in most of North America, though feral European rabbits do occur in a few locations. RHDV was found in both domestic and wild rabbits in South America (Uruguay) in 2005, but there are no reports of its occurrence since that time, and Uruguay reported itself to be free of rabbit hemorrhagic disease as of 2012.

"As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia, and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits." (https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf) - Mod.CRD
