_Pythium_ damping off disease has been rampant on soybeans this
spring [2011] throughout eastern and central Kansas. _Pythium_ is most
active on soybeans that emerge into cool, wet soils. Producers in
eastern and central Kansas who planted their soybeans in mid-May ran
into this problem in many cases.

Certain fungicide seed treatments will help protect against _Pythium_
for about 10-14 days. But if the disease pressure is high enough,
_Pythium_ can overwhelm the seed treatment.

[2] Sudden death syndrome - Michigan

Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is a fungal disease of soybeans
traditionally thought to occur following prolonged periods of wet and
cold conditions at planting. However, some highly productive irrigated
fields in southwest Michigan have seen significant infection of SDS,
regardless of soil conditions following planting. Soybean cyst
nematode (SCN) populations are thought to be an important factor in
these infections.

The disease is fairly new to Michigan, with widespread incidence and
fairly low severity, occurring recently during the 2010 growing
season.

We would encourage producers that saw SDS in fields for the 1st time
in 2010 to monitor for the disease. There is no treatment to control
SDS in infected soybeans. However, selection of varieties that are the
most tolerant of the disease can impact the timing that the beans show
foliar symptoms and subsequent yields.

[A number of species of _Pythium_ fungi can cause pre- and
post-emergence damping off of soybeans during cold and wet weather in
spring. The fungi are soilborne and can also be dispersed by water and
mechanically. Crop rotation is not always effective in controlling
_Pythium_ diseases because its effect on pathogen populations can
vary. Fungicides, seed treatments, biocontrol agents, and use of
resistant crop varieties may be useful for disease management.

Sudden death syndrome of soybean (SDS) was first discovered in the
USA (Arkansas) in 1972 and has now become widespread in soybean
growing regions in the United States, Argentina, and Brazil. Plants
turn yellow and die quickly after pod set and symptoms often appear in
patches in a field. Yield losses may be more than 80 per cent,
depending on variety and timing of infection. The fungus _Fusarium
virguliforme_ has been described as the cause of SDS in North America
and _F. tucumaniae_ in South America. Foliar symptoms are thought to
be the result of a fungus-produced toxin. Soybean cyst nematode (SCN)
is reported to exacerbate symptoms.
