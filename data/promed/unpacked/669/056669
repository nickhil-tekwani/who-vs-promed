[This is a re-posting of an earlier report that was titled incorrectly
indicating that the typhoid fever outbreak was in the United Arab Emirates.
This was an editorial error, and we apologize for the inconvenience. Thanks
to Dr. Badrinath for calling the error to our attention. - Mod.ES

According to Gulf News more than 100 people have contracted typhoid in a
region of Saudi Arabia already hit by Rift Valley Fever (RVF). "Okaz" (an
Arabic daily) said 118 people, including 3 Pakistanis, have caught typhoid
in the southern region of Jizan, which borders Yemen. However, no deaths
have yet been reported.

[Dr. Badrinath also inquired as to whether anyone had observed an
epidemiological link between RVF and typhoid. I know of no reason to
suspect that this would be the case. A prior report from Kenya, cited
above, indicates a coincidence of typhoid and RVF outbreaks, but does not
suggest a relationship between the two. - Mod.ES
