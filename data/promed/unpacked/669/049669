RI health officials say 11 treated for rabies

Smithfield, R.I.-Eleven people in Rhode Island have been treated for
rabies as a precaution after a pet cat tested positive for the
disease. The cat lived with its owners in Smithfield. It had signs of
rabies when it died.

The people treated are all known to have come into contact with the
cat. One dog has also undergone treatment.

State officials say anyone else in the area of Birch Road in
Smithfield should contact the state health department if they have had
contact with the female orange-grey calico cat. State health officials
say the case shows the importance of vaccinating cats and dogs against
rabies.

Infected horse prompts rabies alert
OCALA, Fla. (AP) — Health department officials have issued a rabies
alert in Marion County.
Authorities said Monday that an infected horse prompted the alert,
which began on Nov. 20.
The Orlando Sentinel reports the horse was found in an area about 15
miles northwest of Ocala.
Health officials advise residents to avoid any contact with
free-roaming animals. They say pet food should not be left outside and
that people should make sure their pets’ rabies vaccinations are
current.

The Sentinel reports that a rabies alert is also in effect for parts
of Seminole County after 3 raccoons tested positive.

[Pet owners should follow the veterinarian’s recommendation and keep
their animals vaccinated. The state regulations differ and the
veterinarian should know them.

There is a 1 year and a 3 year vaccination for dogs and cats, however
some states do not recognize the 3 year vaccine.

Livestock owners should vaccinate their animals annually. Horses,
cattle, especially show cattle, and any other livestock, including
goats and sheep should be vaccinated against rabies.

Rabies vaccination is a very cheap form of insurance for yourself and
your family. Skunks and raccoons as well as bats can bite your pet,
regardless of what size they are, and thus expose your animal to a
disease for which there is no cure. That animal can then expose you to
the same deadly disease.

The lesson from these articles is to vaccinate your animals. –
