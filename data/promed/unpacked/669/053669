[This past week seems to have been a quiet week for polio with no newly confirmed cases of either WPV or cVDPV. There also seems to be a decrease in environmental samples with only Pakistan having positive environmental samples for the WPV1 circulating in the region. The not-so-good news is that while there were only 4 positive samples, there was 1 from each of the 4 provinces, so the virus is still in circulation in all 4 provinces of the country.

For a map showing the locations of cases of WPV and cVDPV, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

[2] Pakistan - polio worker killed
Date: Tue 9 Apr 2019

https://www.dawn.com/news/1474905


A union council polio officer associated with the World Health Organisation was shot dead by unknown persons in the Ghazi Baig area of Haleemzai tehsil in the Mohmand tribal district on Monday [8 Apr 2019].

According to sources, the victim official, Wajid Khan, was on his routine duty in the Ghazi Baig area near his home when unknown persons opened fire on him, injuring him seriously. He succumbed to his injuries while being shifted to the district headquarters hospital, Ghalanai. After the incident, the local administration officials rushed to the spot and took a suspected man into custody and sent him to Ghalanai lockup for investigation.

Local ANP president Nisar Mohmand led protesters and confirmed that Wajid was killed during his official polio duty. The polio official was shot dead at about 10:45 a.m.

Additional deputy commissioner Syed Saiful Islam and assistant commissioner Upper Mohmand Waseem Akhtar reached the spot and held negotiations with the protesters. Later, an FIR was registered against the suspect, Zubair Khan, a resident of Namdar Kor in Ghazai Baig, who was said to be a polio refusal case. It was said that Wajid had gone there to persuade him to allow vaccination of the children.

[The threat to safety of polio workers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan is very disturbing. This individual is not the 1st member of the vaccination personnel to be attacked and killed, an act that is reprehensible, to say the least.

In Afghanistan, the Taliban have been providing security to the workers, but in media articles today, they have now banned the Red Cross and WHO from working in areas under Taliban control, areas that were in the middle of vaccination campaigns (see https://www.kff.org/news-summary/taliban-bans-red-cross-who-from-operating-in-afghan-areas-under-its-control/ for links to the media reports).

It is hard for me to understand how any country or subset of political activists, whether deemed insurgents or mainstream political parties, can hold children's health and well-being hostage to political actions. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Pakistan - parental vaccination refusal
Date: Mon 8 Apr 2019
Source: Urdu Point [edited]
https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/parents-refuse-to-vaccinate-children-against-589171.html


More than 10 000 children of KP provincial Capital Peshawar haven't [been administered] anti-polio drops, as their parents refused to vaccinate their children against polio.

As many as 16 408 children have been deprived of anti-polio drops due to some other reasons. According to detail, police had registered a number of cases for refusing to vaccinate their children against polio during the ongoing drive in the provincial capital. The anti-polio drive was started in 18 districts on [25 Mar 2019].

The number of polio cases detected in the current year [2019] is 6 [in Pakistan]. The government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had started an all-age polio vaccination campaign on Pak-Afghan border at Tourkham from [25 Mar 2019]. During the campaign, a total of 260 000 frontline workers were going door-to-door across all provinces and towns to ensure more than 39 million children under the age of 5 receive 2 drops of the vaccine, which will protect them against the poliovirus.

[This last article shows the challenges faced by the teams with vaccine refusals. More than 16 000 susceptibles in the province is a "pocket" large enough to sustain viral transmission and somewhat explains why the WPV continues to be isolated in environmental samples and cases are occurring with 6 cases reported since 1 Jan 2019, with 2 reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 2 reported from KPTD (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal District), and 1 each from Sindh and Punjab provinces. The sad observation related to the vaccine refusals in Pakistan was originally that the refusals were due to rumors about the vaccine being a plot by the West to sterilize children in the region, but more recently, the more educated class has been targeted by the antivaccer-movement social-media posts, and there is a growing antivaccer movement with the same fears of autism that are circulating in Western countries.
