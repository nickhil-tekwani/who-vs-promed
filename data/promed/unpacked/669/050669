Measles in Taiwan: Imported with local transmission
---------------------------------------------------
The Taiwan CDC [Centers for Disease Control] is continuing to
investigate 2 import-related measles outbreaks in northern and
central Taiwan that started in early February 2009. As of 2 Mar 2009,
a total of 11 cases had been confirmed, aged 8 months to 9 years.
None of them had received measles-containing vaccines.

The index case of the northern outbreak was reported on 11 Feb 2009.
Because significant effort had been focused on eliminating measles,
Taiwan CDC started extensive investigation to find the source of
infection. The source case was later identified to be a girl who had
shared the same room in a community hospital with the index case, and
had traveled to China during the possible exposure period. In
addition, 6 more cases were confirmed through contact tracing.

The index case of the central-Taiwan outbreak traveled to China
during the period 18 Dec 2008 to 3 Feb 2009, and had rash on 7 Feb
2009. 2 of his contacts turned out to be confirmed cases.

All of these cases were infected in the hospital. Phylogenetic tree
analysis confirmed that these 2 outbreaks are caused by 2 distinct
viruses of the H1 genotype.

The coverage rate of 1st dose MMR [measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine] in Taiwan is above 95 percent. However, the frequent
traveling between Taiwan and China places Taiwan at continual risk
of imported measles and further import-related clusters among the
unvaccinated population.

Taiwan CDC had implemented strategies targeting 4 main aspects of
disease control. The 1st is to start contact tracing to give proper
post-exposure prophylaxis and education. So far, more than 700 had
been contacted. The 2nd is to minimize nosocomial transmission of the
disease by alerting all the hospitals and clinics. The hospital where
the northern outbreak took place had set up a screening station for
all children with fever and rash, as well as a special clinic for
those who need post-exposure prophylaxis. The 3rd strategy aims at
increasing the vaccination coverage by contacting all children aged
above 12 months-old to get their 1st dose of MMR on time. Policy to
vaccinate infants 9 to 12 months and a catch-up campaigning is also
under consideration. Lastly, Taiwan CDC provides a 24/7 hotline, among
other public communication measures, for all related inquiries.

These outbreaks highlight the importance of imported measles in
Taiwan. Taiwan CDC alerted all parents that children should keep their
vaccinations up to date, particularly before entering China. For these
2 outbreaks, active surveillance will continue up until the end of
March 2009.

[Taiwan is vulnerable to importation of measles infection on account
of the volume and frequency of travel between Taiwan and mainland
China, despite the high level of measles immunisation in Taiwan.
According to the Taiwan CDC, measles in mainland China over the past 3
years has become a more serious problem, with the annual number of
cases rising from 100 000 to 130 000 over that period. Some 4600
people have been infected with the disease in China since January 2009
(<http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=875662&lang=eng_news&cate_img=49.jpg&cate_rss=news_Society_TAIWAN>).
Consequently special emphasis needs to be directed to ensuring that
travellers from Taiwan to China are adequately immunised before they
leave Taiwan, to prevent reintroduction of measles virus infection.
