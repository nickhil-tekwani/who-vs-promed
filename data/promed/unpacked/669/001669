Measles in an Adopted Child from China leading to Potential Airline
Exposure - Missouri, June 2004
-------------------------------------------------
On 18 Jun 2004, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services
(DHSS) contacted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to
report a laboratory-confirmed case of measles in a recently adopted child
from China. The child was part of a group of 35 families from 16 states and
the United Kingdom who traveled from China to the United States with their
adopted children. The investigation is ongoing to determine whether any of
the other adopted children or family members in this group may have
developed measles. CDC has also contacted Chinese officials to obtain more
information.
The 14-month-old child with confirmed measles had onset of rash on 10 Jun
2004 and was likely infectious while traveling from China to the United
States on the following flights: China Southern Airlines flight CZ327
arriving in Los Angeles (LAX) from Guangzhou, China on 8 Jun 2004 and
Southwest Airlines flight 1979 from Los Angeles (LAX) to Kansas City,
Missouri on 9 Jun 2004. Due to challenges in obtaining timely and accurate
passenger contact information, CDC is providing the flight information in
lieu of individual passenger notifications.
Although measles transmission is known to have occurred on commercial
aircraft, available data suggest the risk of transmission to other
passengers is low. Passengers seated adjacent to a measles-infected person
appear to have an increased risk of infection.
In general, measles is a highly infectious disease that can have severe
complications. The incubation period from exposure to rash onset for
measles is approximately 10 days (range 7-18 days); on rare occasions the
incubation period can be as long as 19-21 days. Persons on these flights
who develop fever and/or rash on or before 30 Jun 2004 should be evaluated
by a healthcare provider for measles. Persons with these symptoms should
notify their healthcare provider of the possible exposure to measles before
visiting a health care facility so that preparations can be made to avoid
exposing other susceptible persons to measles. Possible cases of measles
should be reported to state health departments. State health departments
are asked to report any possible cases under investigation to CDC
(404-639-8763 or 770-488-7100). Adoptive parents should ensure that they
and their families are appropriately immunized before traveling abroad for
adoption and should be aware of the potential for communicable diseases in
children adopted from international regions.
