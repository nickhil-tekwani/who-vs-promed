Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Einsiedeln, Schwyz
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Jan 2020
Outbreak status: resolved on 3 Feb 2020
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 68 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 1.5 / 0 / 0 / 1.5
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments
Confirmation of atypical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a cow [on 3 Feb 2020]. The 13 year old cow from a holding in the canton of Schwyz was subject to emergency slaughter [on 23 Jan 2020]. Samples of the brain stem were sent in for analysis and confirmed at the Swiss National Reference Laboratory for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The sample tested positive in the rapid test for BSE "PrioStrip BSE" and was confirmed by western immunoblot. The pathological prion protein could be classified as (L)-type BSE and therefore as an atypical case of BSE. The entire carcass was disposed of as category 1 material.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Reference Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / western blot / 3 Feb 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Atypical BSE occurs rarely and spontaneously, typically in cattle that are 8 years old or older. There is no association of atypical BSE with contaminated feed or ingestion of infected materials. Instead, a spontaneous change in the prion proteins in older adult cattle causes atypical BSE. Because changes in prion proteins are sporadic and very rare, scientists do not fully understand what causes prions to change from normal to abnormal forms.

"Scientists are currently studying whether genetics or environmental factors may contribute to atypical BSE. As part of this research, scientists typically examine the offspring of animals diagnosed with atypical BSE and animals born in the same location at the same time as affected animals."

Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country; therefore, this detection will not change the negligible risk status of Switzerland. - Mod.CRD
