AEDES JAPONICUS - USA (OHIO)

Four female and two male specimens of _Aedes japonicus japonicus_
(Theobald) have been identified among mosquitoes reared from an ovitrap
collection made in Jackson County, Oak Hill, Ohio. The ovitrap was set on
August 23 and egg specimens picked up on 5 Sep 1999. The ovitrap was set
by students of William Romoser, Ph.D., Ohio University, who have been
participating with the Ohio Department of Health in a program of
surveillance for the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse). The
collection was sent to the Ohio Department of Health, Vector-borne Disease
Program, where they were reared and identified by Robert Restifo and
Richard L. Berry, Ph.D.
The location where this ovitrap was set is a tire retreading business
specializing in large off-road vehicle tires. _Aedes albopictus_ was
discovered there in 1987 and has persisted ever since, despite strong
efforts to eliminate it. We believe _Ae. j. japonicus_ was transported to
Ohio via used tire commerce from New York or New Jersey, where is was first
discovered in 1998 (Peyton, et al. 1999. J. Amer. Mosq. Control Assn.
15(2):238-241). Thus it has managed to leap over the Appalachian Mountains
one year since its discovery in the United States.
The specimens were identified using characters described by Bruce A.
Harrison, Ph.D., North Carolina Dept. of Environment and Natural Resources
in a manuscript distributed over CDC's VectorList this year. Bruce's
prediction ".. programs conducting _Ae. albopictus_ surveys and
surveillance work on La Crosse encephalitis are most likely to intercept
and establish new records for _Ae. j. japonicus_ in the United States" was
right on the money!
_Ae. j. japonicus_ is not known to be a vector species in nature, but
laboratory experiments have shown it capable of transmitting Japanese
encephalitis virus.

[Thanks to Dick for this report. Given that imported tire inspections have
ceased, we can expect even more such incursions to be recognized by
superior surveillance programs, such as that of the Ohio Department of
Health. - Mod.CHC]
