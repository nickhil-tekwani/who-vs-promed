Polio cases reach 20 in Xinjiang
--------------------
The number of polio cases recorded in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region since an outbreak was confirmed in August [2011] has
reached 20, local health officials said Wednesday [14 Dec 2011].

The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention had been testing
samples taken from patients in the region diagnosed with Acute Flaccid
Paralysis (AFP), a common indicator of polio, to check for the
disease. On [5 Dec 2011], the tests uncovered 2 new polio cases, said
the officials.

One of the samples was taken from a 53-year-old patient from Aksu
prefecture who died on [23 Oct 2011], taking the confirmed number of
deaths from polio in the Xinjiang outbreak to 2.

Poliomyelitis, or polio, is a viral disease of the brain and spinal
cord that mainly affects children under five years of age. One in 200
infections leads to irreversible paralysis, usually in the legs.

AFP is a sudden onset of weakness or paralysis, as is commonly found
with polio.

Local health officials said the 1st 3 cases of this year's [2011]
polio outbreak came from abroad [The virus was identified as
genetically similar to those currently circulating in neighboring
Pakistan. See prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - worldwide (11):
China 20110827.2625 for more information. - Mod.MPP]

Xinjiang neighbors 3 of the 4 polio-endemic countries in the world:
Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan (for a map showing the
proximity of Afghanistan, India and Pakistan to Xinjian, see
http://www.sacu.org/maps/provmap.png. - Mod.MPP]

The local government has conducted large-scale vaccinations in
response to the region's polio epidemic that started in August, when
the 1st cases of the disease in China since 2000 were discovered.

Health authorities said 4 regions in Xinjiang -- the prefectures of
Hotan, Kashgar, Bayingolin and Aksu -- were classified as epidemic
zones.

[See below official note from the Polio Eradication Initiative (in
section [3]) on these newly confirmed cases. The most recent date of
onset of these cases is 9 Oct 2011. Prior to these new cases, the
most recent date of onset of confirmed cases was on 18 Sep 2011. It
appears as though there is a delay in confirmation of cases so it may
be too early to conclude that transmission of the Wild poliovirus
(WPV) has been interrupted.

Health workers have recorded 6 new polio cases in Pakistan, bringing
the number of polio-infected children to 173 so far this year [2011],
officials said [15 Dec 2011].

Doctors found 4 new cases in Balochistan and one each in Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa and Frontier Region Kohat, Dr. Altaf Bosan, head of the
prime minister’s Polio Eradication Cell, told Central Asia Online.

Pakistan is the biggest contributor to the world’s 565 polio cases
reported so far in 2011, he said.

Media reports have linked the number of polio cases to a campaign by
the Taliban to prevent parents from getting immunisations for their
children. The Taliban claim that polio vaccines are a conspiracy by
the West to sterilise Muslims, thus reducing the Muslim population.

[As mentioned in a prior ProMED-mail post (Poliomyelitis - worldwide
(18): Pakistan, global 20111208.3552), the mention of a smear campaign
on the part of fundamentalists in Pakistan is a deju vu of what
happened in northern Nigeria in 2003/2004 which was responsible for
reintroduction of wild poliovirus (WPV) into many countries which had
previously interrupted transmission of WPV.

Case count as of 14 Dec 2011:
Total cases: Year-to-date 2011 / Year-to-date 2010 / Total in 2010
Globally: 571 / 874 / 1352
- endemic countries: 281 / 211 / 232
- non-endemic countries: 290 / 663 / 1120

Nigeria
One new case was officially reported this week - a case of WPV3
reassigned from Cameroon (onset of paralysis on [6 Oct 2011]) to a
district of Borno (Bama) which had not previously reported a case of
WPV this year. The total number of cases for 2011 is now 46. The
country's most recent case, a WPV1, had onset of paralysis on [29 Oct
2011] in Jigawa. ...Genetic sequencing of the case reassigned from
Cameroon indicated that the virus had been circulating, undetected,
for over a year.

Pakistan
Six new cases were reported in the past week (all WPV1s), bringing the
total number of cases for 2011 to 173. The most recent case was
reported in Killa Abdullah, Balochistan, with onset of paralysis on
[27 Nov 2011]. A case reported this week in the Harnai district of
Balochistan is that district's 1st case for the year [2011].

Angola
No new cases were reported in the past week. The country has reported
a total of 5 cases in 2011, the most recent of which had onset of
paralysis on [7 Jul 2011] in Uige in the country's north.

Chad and CAR
No new cases were reported in Chad this week. The total number of
cases reported in Chad in 2011 remains 125 (122 WPV1s and 3 WPV3s).
The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [26 Oct 2011] (WPV1
from Logone Oriental).

No new cases were reported from the Central African Republic (CAR) in
the past week - the total number of cases for 2011 therefore remains 2
(both WPV1s). CAR's most recent case had onset of paralysis on [6 Oct
2011] in Region Sanitaire 3 (RS3), in the country's north.

China
Although not yet included in official data, 2 new adult cases have
been reported by the China Centre for Disease Control, both from the
outbreak area in southern Xinjian Uygurh Autnomous Region. The cases
are an 18-year old man from Hetian prefecture (which has reported the
majority of cases to date) and a 53 year-old man who is the 1st case
reported from Aksu prefecture; the latter tragically died in late
October [2011]. While the officially reported total case count for
2011 remains 18 (all WPV1), it will go up to 20 once both cases have
been formally reported, with the Aksu case the most recent case (onset
of paralysis [9 Oct 2011]).

While the scale and speed of China's initial outbreak response was
impressive, the country continues to be at risk of continued
circulation of wild poliovirus. All residents of southern Xinjiang up
to the age of 39 are being targeted with OPV during a measles
vaccination campaign currently being conducted. However, so far no
other vaccination rounds have been confirmed between now and early
March 2012.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
One new case was reported in the past week - a case of WPV1 with onset
of paralysis on [3 Nov 2011] in Nyunzu district in Katanga province
(this is the country's most recent case). The total number of cases
for 2011 therefore rises to 88 (all WPV1s).

Horn of Africa
A case of WPV1 with onset of paralysis on [30 Jul 2011] in Nyanza
province, western Kenya, remains the only case to be reported in the
Horn of Africa this year [2011].

West Africa
One case was reported in Niger this week - a WPV3 with onset of
paralysis on [30 Oct 2011] in Diffa district, Diffa province, near to
the border with Nigeria. This is the most recent case in west Africa.
The total number of cases for 2011 in the west African region is now
49 (36 from Cote d'Ivoire, 3 from Guinea, 7 from Mali and 3 from
Niger). All cases are WPV3, except for one WPV1 case from Niger.
Genetic sequencing found the case in Diffa, Niger to be most closely
related to WPV3 most recently seen in Borno, Nigeria on [17 Sep 2011].

[From the above information, unfortunately it appears as though there
is continued transmission of WPV in both countries classified as
endemic for polio as well as countries classified as non-endemic for
polio. The disconcerting bits of information in the newswires and
Polio Eradication Initiative weekly summaries relate to the false
rumors surrounding vaccination in Pakistan and the observation that
there continue to be areas with "silent" transmission of WPV. In the
former case, the false rumors surrounding effects of the vaccine in
Pakistan are leading to reduced acceptance of vaccination which in
turn is paving the way for continued increased transmission and
increased numbers of cases due to WPV infection in Pakistan, and now
in neighboring countries (China). In the latter case, the "silent"
transmission of WPV has led to a false sense of security in areas such
as the Horn of Africa, where WPV was circulating for more than one
year before a clinical case was detected and confirmed. This false
sense of security applies to both the official public health sector as
well as the population who may "forget" the importance of vaccination
against polio in the absence of active cases in the area.

associated polio cases during 2011, see the 2011 map link on the Polio
Eradication Initiative website at:
