-----------------------------------------------------
There is no outbreak of Nipah in Kerala now. You have used an article that was published in Economic Times in 2019. This is an old report.

Kindly note that this mistake was made previously, and you provided a correction then (Nipah virus - India (09): (KL) corr 20191206.6827082, published 6 Dec 2019).
