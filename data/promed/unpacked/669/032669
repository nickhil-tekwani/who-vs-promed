Dangerous nematodes have been detected in Germany on ware potatoes imported from Cyprus. The Department of Agriculture, Food Security and Fisheries in Rostock (state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania) stressed that _Globodera rostochiensis_ and _G. pallida_ can cause severe damage to potato and tomato crops. They warned growers specifically about pale cyst nematodes which so far do not occur in the state. An introduction must be prevented at all costs.

They advised consumers to dispose of peel from imported potatoes and adhering soil with household refuse and under no circumstances to compost the waste. They issued a strict warning against using potatoes imported from Cyprus, Egypt, or even other EU countries for planting. Only certified seed tubers should be used.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material (such as seed potatoes). Disease management may include exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races and nematicides. Control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below economic thresholds. Both PCNs have been included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

In the Eurasian area, golden PCN is widespread but pale PCN has a more restricted distribution and its detection in specific areas is considered of significance to the respective region.

It is not clear from the report above which of the PCNs was detected in Germany, or if both were found. It is also not clear whether the detection occurred in specific consignments on import or in samples taken after distribution to local retailers.]
