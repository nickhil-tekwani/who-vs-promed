Lassa fever situation report -- epidemiological week 2 (11-17 Jan 2021)
------------------------------------------------------------
Key points:
Current week (02) (11-17 Jan 2021) / Cumulative week 1 / Cumulative 2020 week 1
Suspected cases: 117 / 226 / 255
Confirmed cases: 14 / 23 / 82
Probable cases: 0 / 0 / 0
Deaths: 2 / 4 / 14
Case fatality rate (CFR [%]): 14.3 / 17.4 / 17.1
Number of states affected: 3 / 5 / 8
Local government areas (LGAs) affected: 8 / 12 / 13

Highlights
- In week 2, the number of new confirmed cases increased from 9 in week 1, 2021 to 14 cases. These were reported from 3 states (Edo, Taraba and Ebonyi) (Table 3).
- Cumulatively from week 1 to week 2, 2021, 4 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 17.4%, which is higher than the CFR for the same period in 2020 (17.1%).
- In total for 2021, 5 states have recorded at least one confirmed case across 12 LGAs (Figures 2 and 3).
- Of all confirmed cases, 83% are from Edo (61%), Ondo (13%) and Ebonyi (9%) states.
- The predominant age-group affected is 21-30 years (range, less than 1 to 70 years; median age, 30 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:0.8 (Figure 4).
- The number of suspected cases has decreased compared with that reported for the same period in 2020.
- No new healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 2.
- The national Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Technical Working Group (TWG) continues to coordinate the response activities at all levels.

Response activities
- The national Lassa fever emergency operations centre alert mode activated [in] 2020 for effective multisectoral, multi-disciplinary coordination of Lassa fever response.
- Surge staff (doctors, nurses, laboratorians and hygienist) deployed to ISTH and FMC Owo.
- State Public Health Emergency Operations Centre activated in affected states.
- The 5 Lassa fever molecular laboratories in the NCDC network are working at full capacity to ensure that all samples are tested and results provided within the shortest turnaround time.
- NCDC is working to support every state in Nigeria to identify one treatment centre, while supporting existing ones with care, treatment, and IPC commodities.
- Risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies.
- Implementation of Lassa fever environmental response campaign in high-burden states by the Federal Ministry of Environment.

Notes on this report
Data source: Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national Lassa fever emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
- Suspected case: any individual presenting with one or more of the following: malaise, fever, headache, sore throat, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, myalgia, chest pain, hearing loss, and either
a. history of contact with excreta or urine of rodents;
b. history of contact with a probable or confirmed Lassa fever case within a period of 21 days of onset of symptoms; or
c. any person with inexplicable bleeding/hemorrhage.
- Confirmed case: any suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, PCR, or virus isolation).
- Probable case: any suspected case (see definition above) who died or absconded without collection of a specimen for laboratory testing.
- Contact: anyone who has been exposed to an infected person, or to an infected person's secretions, excretions, or tissues within 3 weeks of last contact with a confirmed or probable case of Lassa fever.

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[There were 14 new confirmed and 117 new suspected cases in week 02 (11-17 Jan 2021), indicating that Lassa fever (LF) virus transmission is continuing. The graph in Figure 6 indicates that a peak of cases occurred in week 7 last year (10-16 Feb 2020). There are now 2 deaths among confirmed cases for the 2nd week of 2021. Fortunately, there are no newly infected healthcare workers during the current week (week 02).

The report above confirms that Ondo, Ebonyi, and Edo states have the most cases so far this year (2021). The area affected is 5 states, and the number of local government areas increased from 6 to 8 with at least one case. Nigeria is entering the period of the year when cases begin to peak, as illustrated in the graph in Figure 6. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (January-March) over the past 4 years, and will likely be the case again for year 2021.

Transmission of LF virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir host excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It is encouraging to learn that risk communications and community engagement activities have been scaled up across states using television, radio, print, social media, and other strategies for avoidance of contact with rodent virus reservoirs and their excreta.
