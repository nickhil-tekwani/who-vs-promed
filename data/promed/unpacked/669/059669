The following is a response to an EpiCore RFI:

The 12 human cases (and the environmental positive samples) were confirmed by Dr Boly DIOP, head of the Surveillance and Immunisation division at the MoH. (Ministere de la Sante et de l'Action sociale) and reported by media quoting the local authorities, including the APS (Agence de Presse Senegalaise). Cases documented in 2021 were from the following districts: Touba (6), Diourbel (1), Tivaouane (2), Sokone (1), Thies (1) et Mbao (1). More details below:

[In French, trans. by Mod.MPP]
- From January 2021 to the present, there have been 17 cases of polio identified: 12 in humans and 5 [positive environmental samples].
- This information was provided by Dr. Boly Diop, Chief of the vaccine surveillance and response division of the Ministry of Health and Social Action.
- The presence of the poliovirus was discovered through sampling wastewater from the Camberene treatment facility as part of epidemiological surveillance for polio.
- And our investigations permitted us to identify cases in multiple regions of the country: in Diourbel (Touba and Bambey localities), Thies (Tivaouane), Dakar (Mbao) and Sokone, reported by Dr. Ousseynou Badiane, Coordinator of the Expanded Program of Immunizations (EPI).
- A situation which led the Ministry of Health and Social Action to initiate polio vaccination catch up days on 17-19 Jun 2021 [conducted by] the EPI throughout the country, with the exception of the Diourbel region.

The EPI announced on Wednesday [9 Jun 2021] a polio national vaccination campaign for 17-19 Jun 2021 using the inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV] "to capture all children up through 5 years of age who were never vaccinated."

"Since 2016, we have been conducting environmental surveillance. The poliovirus was identified through environmental surveillance in the wastewater treatment station in Khourounar (Pikine) and has been circulating in the sub-region [West Africa] and in neighboring countries during the past 5 years," according to doctor Ousseynou Badiane.

This was announced at a meeting of the National Service for Education and Health Information (SNEIPS).

He revealed that "cases of poliomyelitis were identified in children in Camberene, Sokone, Diourbel and Tivaouane." According to him, the vaccination catchup is targeted at children who have not been vaccinated in the past 5 years throughout the country.

"The virus discovered in Dakar has never been seen in Senegal. This virus in Dakar came from Conakry Guinea, and the virus found in Touba came from Mali. We realized that the children with signs of handicap [AFP - acute flaccid paralysis] in Touba had never been vaccinated against polio," he declared.

He reported that, as of now, 12 children had contracted poliomyelitis "with 6 cases in the Touba district, 1 case in Diourbel, 2 cases in Tivaouane, 1 case in Sokone, 1 case in Thies, and 1 case in the Mbao district."

"If we do not have expected results [using the IPV], we will use the oral vaccine during the national vaccination days."

Dr. Boly Diop, chief of the Epidemiologic Surveillance Division of the Preventive Department of the Ministry of Health and Social Action announced that a census of susceptible children [unvaccinated] will be conducted.

All health districts will review their records, and all children who have not been vaccinated against polio will be enrolled for the vaccination days on 17-19 Jun 2021," he explained.

On behalf of partners, Dr. Awa Bathily from UNICEF called for "the support of the population to eradicate poliomyelitis in Senegal, a disease that leads to a partial or total handicap of children," she warned.

This meeting included participation of the Senegal Association of Imams and Oulemas, the network of Traditional Communicators in the communities, the Association of Health Bloggers, and the Association of Health, Population and Development (AJSPD), and the Division for Medical and Schools (DCMS).

[ProMED would like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance project member for helping to clarify the current situation with cVDPV2 outbreaks in Senegal.

Note that there appear to be 2 different strains of virus, one genetically related to a virus circulating in Conakry Guinea, and a 2nd one genetically related to a virus circulating in Mali, suggesting at least 2 separate introductions.

Repeating what was said in the moderator comment in Poliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001 about the initial report on the situation in Senegal: "While Senegal is currently involved with ongoing discussions related to verification of eligibility to use the nOPV2 (https://www.unicef.org/executiveboard/media/5501/file/2021_AS-SFS-Polio_Global_Overview-Information_note-EN-2021.05.20.pdf), it appears as though the country is opting to use IPV (trivalent) to raise immunity levels and interrupt transmission of the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak. One suspects they are hoping to avoid the vicious cycle of mOPV2 control followed by cVDPV2 outbreak associated with the mOPV2 used to interrupt a prior outbreak. One also suspects the game plan is to try using IPV, and if that doesn't work, the country will have been verified for nOPV2 use. A commendable strategy based on lessons learned in other countries."
