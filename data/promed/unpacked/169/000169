Dozens of pigs in Barahona died from a rare disease
---------------------------------------------------
Dozens of pigs have died in the last few days in 2 populations [farms] in this province, of a strange disease, that has led to concern among the people who raise pigs. Ruddy Medina who made the complaint said that the farmers of La Hoya and Habanero reported the situation and were requesting the intervention of Ministry of Agriculture authorities.

He said that in his opinion, the disease responsible for these deaths is a type of KC2, which is determined as a consequence of the animals [having seizures].

He said that a farmer from the La Hoya community had 9 pigs, of which overnight 5 deaths occurred and one had [tembladera] of KC2. Medina said that 3 days later, of the 3 remaining pigs, 2 died and the 3rd had to be sold by the pound in a business he had [presumably after being butchered. - MHJ].

"The authorities have to take action on the situation, because one can't leave these poor rural folks to suffer these extreme losses of all they have to survive," he pointed out.

He said that the KC2 disease affected the porcine population of the Dominican Republic during the years 1979 and 1980, when thousands of pigs died in the whole country, which led to an alarm among the population [of the country].

"One person alone had 9 pigs die, another had 3 die, another 2 and another 4, and another 3 died, in the communities of La Hoya and Habanero in the province of Barahona," he highlighted.

[Congenital trembling piglets is characteristic of classical swine fever but this would appear to be not the condition here as indications are of adult pigs being affected and dying acutely. I believe that there were outbreaks of African swine fever in the Caribbean and Brasil during 1979 -- traced to food waste from ships. And any "new" disease appearing in the Dominican Republic would have had to have introduced from somewhere else or have been lurking quietly in the back country. Any information from our members on "KC2" would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]

[There was a major outbreak of African swine fever in the Dominican Republic during the period 1978-1982 which virtually decimated the swine population in the country (see http://www.mongabay.com/history/dominican_republic/dominican_republic-livestock.html and http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y0510E/Y0510E02.htm).
