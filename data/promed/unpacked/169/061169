Michigan has 1st case of equine encephalitis since 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
A horse from Lapeer County has become Michigan's 1st case this year
of Eastern equine encephalitis. A diagnostic laboratory at Michigan
State University confirmed the 2-year-old mare died of the
mosquito-borne virus last week [13-17 Aug 2007], Michigan's 1st case
since 2005, Jennifer Holton, a spokeswoman for the Michigan
Department of Agriculture, said Thursday [23 Aug 2007].
Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is called "sleeping sickness"
because it causes animals infected with it to enter into a coma.
Horses that develop it rarely survive. Both EEE and West Nile virus
(WNV) are carried in bird populations and transmitted by mosquitoes.
The equine virus can infect people but is rare and cannot be directly
transmitted from infected horses to other horses or humans.
James McCurtis, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Community
Health, said there have been no human cases of EEE since 2002. That
year, there were 6 cases but none was fatal.
He said precautions for people are the same for both viruses and
include applying insect repellent and wearing long-sleeve clothing.
People can protect horses with vaccines, insect repellent and keeping
horses in stables at dusk and dawn.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley
[A combination vaccine of Eastern, Western equine encephalitis and
West Nile virus is available in a single injection to protect the
horse. There is also a combination vaccine with Eastern, Western and
Venezuelan equine encephalitis and West Nile virus all available in a
single injection. Both of these combination vaccines are usually
given as an initial injection followed by a second injection about 3
weeks later and annually thereafter.
