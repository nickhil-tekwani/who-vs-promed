Minas Gerais has now registered 6266 dengue cases in the 1st 6 weeks
of this year [2009]. There are 16 suspected DHF cases and 2 that are
confirmed. But the number of victims could be even greater.

The death of a woman of 46 years in Coronel Fabriciano in Vale do Aco
is being investigated as a suspected DHF [case]. A [laboratory]
report from the Ezekiel Dias Foundation should be issued within 20
days indicating the cause of death.

This year [2009], 2700 suspected cases of dengue were reported in Belo
Horizonte [the state capital]. Just in the past week, 5 cases were
recorded.

The number of dengue cases in the state of Bahia had an increase of
5000 cases in a period of 2 weeks. According to the bulletin released
Monday (2 [Mar 2009]) by state Epidemiological Monitoring, up to the
3rd week of February [2009] there were 11 570 reported cases of the
disease in Bahia. Up to the 1st week of February [2009], 6567 cases
had been reported [an increase of 5000 cases in 2 weeks, or 57 percent.
- Mod.JW].

According to the Secretariat of Health of the State of Bahia (SESAB),
the increase is 248 percent over the same period in 2008 (3919
[cases]). With respect to the types of serious disease [DHF, DSS], 291
cases were recorded in 50 municipalities of the state. Of these, 85
cases were confirmed in 21 municipalities.

In the state, 160 (38 percent) of the municipalities reported the
disease, including 29 of 45 priority municipalities for the National
Program for Control of Dengue. The municipalities of Jequie, Porto
Seguro, Itabuna, Itororo, Jacobina, Ipiau, Presidente Dutra,
Barriers, and Salvador Andarai are 10 municipalities with the highest
number of reported [cases], with a concentration of 73 percent of
cases in the state.

The highest rates of incidence of reported cases were registered in
Jequie, Presidente Dutra, Itororo, Quixabeira, and Andarai Mirante.

Since the end of 2008, an outbreak of dengue has been identified in
the district of Joaquim Romao, on Jequie. This municipality in the
1st 7 weeks of the year [2009] has registered 5307 suspected cases,
accounting for 45 percent of total notifications in the State.

Salvador reported 209 suspected cases of dengue fever and 21 cases of
severe dengue in 2009, and 36 percent of these are located in the
district Cabula-Beiru, especially in the Arenoso and Mata Escura
neighborhoods.

Bolivia revealed Tuesday [3 Mar 2009] that 35 500 people have
contracted the benign strain of the mosquito transmitted dengue
disease [virus], while 20 have died from the deadly haemorrhagic
variant [DHF]. There are also fears that before the rainy season is
over 50 000 people could be infected. [Individuals who have suffered
severe myalgia of "breakbone" dengue fever would hardly call dengue
virus infection "benign." - Mod.TY]

Bolivia dengue cases could reach 50 000 by end of March [2009]
--------------------------------------------------------------
"This is the most serious outbreak of the disease we have experienced
in the last 10 years," said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia, adding that
the worst hit area was to the east of the country in Santa Cruz
province, with 14 deaths and 25 000 confirmed cases.

"Although the majority of cases are under control, we are concerned
with the 106 haemorrhagic dengue infections" that can be deadly and
are the result of a double bite from the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
[By "double bite," one presumes that the article is really referring
to secondary infections, that is dengue virus infection following an
infection years earlier with a different, heterologous, dengue virus, and
not repeated bites by a single mosquito. - Mod.TY/JW]

Santa Cruz city, the most populated of Bolivia, and a boom town
because of the oil industry and rich farmlands, has seen its hospital
and clinics system virtually collapse under the number of people
demanding medical attention.

Experts from Cuba, Venezuela, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador and the
Pan-American Health organization are helping to combat the dengue
disease.

President Evo Morales has made a national appeal for a general
mobilization to impede the spread of the disease by eliminating
stagnant water and garbage where the larvae of the mosquito
proliferate during the rainy season in the tropical regions of
Bolivia.

This coming weekend [7-8 Mar 2009], all citizens from Santa Cruz city
have been
requested to get involved in a "clean and clear up" neighbourhood campaign.

"It's the responsibility of every Bolivian to help fight a disease
that is causing so much harm to families; it's the responsibility of
the authorities and officials but also of every head of family and
citizen to impede the spread of the disease," said Morales during an
official ceremony.

Bolivian sanitary authorities fear the number of cases could balloon
to 50 000 by the end of the month [March 2009].

Monday [2 Mar 2009], there was a [dengue] death in Tartagal. So far
this year, 703 [individuals] have been infected [by this virus
transmitted by] mosquitoes.

The national Ministry of Health is helping various municipalities to
"achieve a deceleration of the dengue outbreak," which was declared
in [the provinces of] Jujuy, northern Salta and western Chaco, stated
the national Director of Epidemiology, Doctor Hugo Fernandez. Also,
there have been a significant number of cases in the city of
Catamarca [Catamarca province], although not connected to the
previously mentioned cases. The health authorities are focused on the
703 local cases so far this year [2009] that are in people who have
contracted the disease [virus infection] from mosquitoes with dengue
virus within the country. These 4 provinces constitute "a zone of
proven local [virus] circulation, where all the cases were produced
by dengue [virus] serotype 1," said Hernandez.

On Monday [2 Mar 2009], the 1st fatal case of dengue was reported in
a retiree of 65 years, in Tartagal.

Salta is the province where the most [dengue] cases have been
diagnosed this year [2009]: 46 laboratory confirmed and another 435
epidemiologically [related], most concentrated in Oran (299 [cases]
total), Tartagal (109) and Salvador Mazza, on the border of Bolivia
(46). It is exactly this country [Bolivia] that is suffering a
[dengue] epidemic with a suspected 35 000 cases and 20 deaths from
DHF. It is the continuous traffic [from Bolivia] that keeps the
[Argentine] health authorities on alert.

Cases are occurring in various parts of the provinces [specific
localities are given in the article. - Mod.TY]. The epidemiologists
are most worried about the foci north of Salto, "due to the current
circulation of virus and for having had [dengue virus] circulation
there before," said Fernandez. "The flooding in Tartagal complicates
[the situation], but much of the control [program] has now been
re-implemented. This implies "surveillance intensification for
febrile syndromes, in order to discover them rapidly," he added.
"Each case is a control focus; they go house-to-house; they do
cleanup (elimination of unused objects that accumulate water), and
fumigate houses and peridomestic areas." In the 4 provinces,
personnel of the National Vector Control Coordinating [agency] are
helping with the cleanup and area spraying in order to accelerate
control of mosquito breeding sites.

Regional health directors (DIRESA) of Lambayeque sent a brigade of
specialists to evaluate the situation in the Naupe area, in the Olmos
district, in response to a suspected dengue outbreak. The head of the
Lambayeque DIRESA, Victor Echeandia Arellano, announced that so far
this year [2009], 3 positive dengue cases have been registered, and
there are another 16 possible cases under study. "In Naupe, the
locality where supposedly there is a dengue outbreak, there is just
one positive case, and while checking the outbreak fumigation will
proceed," he added.

Also, Echandia stated that they are carrying out a public education
campaign where they will apply the strategies of [mosquito] larval
habitat [detection] where waste objects, flower vases, plates, old
tires and bottles will be eliminated to avoid a dengue outbreak. To
conclude, regional authorities recommended that the population cover
water storage containers, cover windows with screens, sleep under
mosquito nets, use [insect] repellants and replace water with wet sand
in flower vases in the cemeteries.

It is worth noting that in Lambayeque department, there are 20
confirmed [dengue] cases and 187 cases under study.

Dengue cases as of epidemiological week [EW] 8 [through February 2009]:
Cases / nat. incidence 100 000 pop. / DHF & complication cases /
deaths / case fatality rate percent / virus types
Bolivia 36 758 / 337 / 108 / 20 / 18.5 percent / DEN 1,2,3
Brazil 30 008 / 17 / 71 / 3 / 4.2 percent / DEN 1,2,3
Paraguay 679 / 12 / 0 / 0 / 0 percent / DEN 1,3

[The difference in case fatality rates (CFR) is striking -- more than
5 times higher in Bolivia than in Brazil. It is not clear what the
higher Bolivia CFR is due to, perhaps due to underreporting of cases
or less experience treating cases in Bolivia. It is also possible
that more virulent dengue viruses or greater predisposition of the
population for DHF could account for the difference, but
underreporting seems most likely.

Bolivia
-------
The prevalences of clinical cases per 100 000 population for
the departments [state or province equivalents] are: Pando (1285),
Santa Cruz de la Sierra (1105), Tarija (600), Beni (393) and
Cochabamba (214). The trend of the outbreak continues to increase.
This outbreak is occurring in a geographic area with a large
population. Santa Cruz has 2 million people, so the outbreak can be
extended.

Paraguay
--------
The prevalences of clinical cases per 100 000 population
for the departments [state or province equivalents] are: Concepcion
(61.0), Amambay (24.1), Bloqueron (3.6), Caaguazu (3.3), Central (1.6)
and Asuncion (1.5). The trend in cases increased during 2009 but
decreased in epidemiological week 8. The detection of the outbreak
was timely, and the response to it has been intense.

Brazil
------
Despite the nation-wide low prevalence of clinical cases per
100 000 population (17.3), the rates for the states reflect another
reality: Acre (514.4), Roraima (322.0), Espiritu Santo (29.0), Amapa
(73.0), Bahia (47.7), and Minas Gerais (22.9). Some 71 percent of the
[dengue] cases are concentrated in these states. The occurrence of
cases in Roraima state is epidemiologically important, because it is
on the border of Venezuela where dengue virus 4 exists, a serotype
that has not been introduced into Brazil.

Dengue outbreaks in the [Caribbean] subregion
---------------------------------------------
Dengue cases as of epidemiological week [EW] 8 [through February 2009]:
Cases / nat. incidence 100 000 pop. / DHF & complication cases /
deaths / case fatality rate percent / virus types
St. Bartholomew 46 / 575.0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / DEN 1,2
French Guiana 807 / 474.7 / 1 / 1 / 1 percent / DEN 1,2,4
St. Martin 68 / 161.9 / 0 / 0 / 0 percent / DEN 1,2,4

French Guiana
-------------
The [dengue] epidemic began the 1st week of 2009. It
has affected almost all of the municipalities: Sur L'Ile de Cayenne,
Korou and St. Laurent. Up to EW 6, 807 [dengue] cases have been
reported, in comparison with a total of 704 cases in [all of] 2008.

St. Martin and St. Bartolome (St. Barth)
----------------------------------------
In St. Martin, the dengue outbreak began in September 2008 (EW 39),
and in St. Bartholomew it began on EW 43 of the same year [2008].
Since then, there has been an important increase in dengue cases with
a high circulation of the virus. Since EW 7 of 2009, the number of
estimated cases has significantly diminished, with only sporadic
dengue transmission, and consequently an end to the epidemic.

Guyana
------
According to the Guyana Minister of Health, so far in 2009,
807 [dengue] cases have been reported, which is a significant
increase over the 665 cases reported in all of 2008.

Suriname
--------
Since the beginning of the year [2009], the number of
recorded cases is higher than in previous years (103 suspected cases
since January 2009 [versus] 405 in all of 2008 and 303 in 2007). The
[dengue virus] serotype circulating is not available. The last
[dengue] epidemic in Suriname occurred in 2005 (1571 suspected cases).

Queensland Health has confirmed an elderly woman has died from dengue
fever in Cairns, in the 1st fatality since the epidemic began last
year [2008]. A statement from Queensland Health says the woman from
Manoora died earlier this week in Cairns Base Hospital. The statement
says although the woman had other health problems, she tested
positive for dengue, and the disease probably contributed to her
death.

More than 600 cases of the mosquito-borne [virus] disease have been
reported in recent months, with 556 in Cairns. The epidemic has also
seen outbreaks in Townsville, Port Douglas, Yarrabah, Injinoo and
Innisfail. Queensland Health says it is doing all it can to try to
contain the outbreak.

"Dengue outbreaks have become more and more common here in the past 2
decades, particularly with the increase in international travel," Dr
Hanna said. "This means more north Queenslanders will be at risk of
developing dengue fever and its complications."

He says Queensland Health has been working with several other
agencies such as local councils on intensive mosquito control
measures since the epidemic began. "This means getting rid of
mosquito breeding sites in your yard, such as pot plant bases,
discarded tires and any other water-holding containers," he said.
"People should also use surface spray in their house, wear insect
repellent and see their doctor if they have any of the symptoms of
dengue fever."

Symptoms of dengue include fever, pain in muscles and bones, skin
rash, headache (usually behind the eyes), diarrhoea and vomiting.

This outbreak is the 1st time all 4 types of dengue [virus] have been
recorded at the same time.

[9] New Caledonia & neighbor islands
Date: Mon 2 Mar 2009
Source: CDNN [edited]
<http://www.cdnn.info/news/travel/t090302.html>


New Caledonia's health department has confirmed on Tuesday [2 Mar
2009] its 1st fatal case this year [2009] of the mosquito-borne dengue
fever epidemic that is still spreading at an alarming rate in the
French Pacific territory.

The person who died as a result of the serotype 4 dengue virus has
been described as a 59-year-old man who was residing in the Magenta
district, on the outskirts of the capital Noumea, near the domestic
airport.

Director of Health Dr Jean-Paul Grangeon told local Radio
Nouvelle-Caledonie the number of known new cases of dengue was
increasing steadily and was now estimated at over 1400 since the
beginning of this year [2009]. Of particular concern was the pace
of some 80 new cases per day: less than 3 weeks ago, the number of
cases was only about 500; 2 weeks later, that figure had nearly
doubled. And over the past 7 days, over 300 new cases have been
detected.

The [dengue virus] serotype 4 of the disease remained prevalent, as
opposed to previous years, when it was the type 1 [virus] that had
been responsible for most cases (over 1100 cases for the whole of
2008).

The main hotspot of the epidemic is the capital Noumea and its
greater area. But many new cases have also been reported in other
parts of the French Pacific territory, including the south of the
main island.

Since last year [2008], when the type 4 virus appeared around
September 2008, awareness campaigns and targeted spraying of
insecticides do not seem to have had a significant impact on the
progression rate of the disease.

Since last year [2008] also, New Caledonian authorities have stepped
up preventive measures to detect any imported case of dengue. The
measures include heat-sensitive cameras that are now screening
inbound passengers at the Noumea-La Tontouta International airport.
Any passenger with a detected unusually high body temperature is
approached by health officials and asked to fill in a form and to get
immediate medical attention. [This approach will detect early febrile
cases but not those very early dengue virus infections that have not
yet developed a fever. - Mod.TY]

The other concern is the combination of the quasi-endemic serotype 1
of the virus and the newly-arrived serotype 4 [virus], to which
residents have not been exposed for the past 30 years, which makes
them more vulnerable [to developing DHF] if they have previously been
infected by the type 1 virus.

New Caledonia, just like most of the Southwestern Pacific islands,
has experienced particularly hot and humid weather in the past few
weeks, a regular feature in this southern hemisphere hot tropical
season. The situation has been further complicated by an unusual
abundance of tropical depressions that have brought torrential rains
and have caused severe, deadly and destructive flooding in
Australia's State of Queensland, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon
Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji.

In all of these countries, where a post-flooding situation still
exists, local public health authorities are still struggling to
contain an upsurge of water-borne diseases and dengue fever.

As a result, since last year [2008], the type 4 dengue fever [virus]
has also appeared on a larger scale in neighboring Fiji (over 2000
cases), Samoa, American Samoa, Kiribati and Palau.

Since the beginning of last week [23 Feb 2009] and to date, 11 new
cases of dengue [virus] 4 [infection] have been laboratory-confirmed
by the Louis Malarde Institute and reported to the Directorate of
Health. This brings to 13 the number of cases officially recorded in
French Polynesia. These people all reside on the islands of Tahaa (3
cases) and Bora-Bora (8 cases), except 2 cases having only traveled
[elsewhere in French Polynesia]. These people are being treated or
have recovered. In order to slow down the development of the epidemic,
it is essential that each person implement the measures for individual
prevention.

Following the detection of 2 cases of dengue type 4 [virus] last
January [2009], in Tahiti (Mahina), no instances of secondary
transmission had been registered after the implementation of
preventive measures (insecticide treatment of the district, protection
of patients against bites and home maintenance), said the Directorate
of Health in a news release.

"Given that these cases were not secondary [transmissions] grouped
within the same families, the Health [authorities] have established
wide prevention [measures] on all islands of Bora and Tahaa:
1. Insecticide spraying by the health team throughout the islands of
Tahaa and Bora Bora in 2 to 3 days, repeated 10 days later (1st
passage made last week [23 Feb 2009] in Bora Bora and currently Tahaa).
2. Information for all health professionals of the Leeward Islands for
vigilance.
3. Information for tourism professionals to strengthen [application]
of insecticide in hotels.

Furthermore, said the press release, 3 cases among the 13 have
resided during their potentially contagious [viremic] period of the
disease [virus] in Moorea at Ua Pou (Marquesas) and Pamata (Tahiti).
Actions for vector control have also been done in places frequented
by these people.

"To slow down the dengue fever epidemic in French Polynesia, it is
essential that each individual implement preventive measures:
- Fight against the sites where mosquitoes lay eggs by systematically
destroying all collections of stagnant water,
- Protect themselves against mosquito bites by using repellents, nets,
coils, etc.

In case of suspected [dengue] disease -- appearance of sudden
unexplained fever, headache, bodily aches -- individuals are asked to
consult their doctor as soon as possible, stating the date of signs
and any recent travel. The doctor will need a blood [sample for a]
test that will quickly confirm the diagnosis.

In confirmed cases of dengue fever, the doctor will ask for isolation
at home and careful protection against [mosquito] bites in order not
to transmit, in turn, disease [virus] to those around them via the
mosquitoes.
