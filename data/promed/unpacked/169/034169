The virtual event "Stop ASF: Public and private partnering for success" has just been launched. The agenda and other relevant information of the event may be accessed at http://www.fao.org/3/cb4552en/cb4552en.pdf.

Join us at the event and you will have the chance to build your network and engage with global experts and industry leaders, all of whom share a strong will to work together to stop the spread of ASF [African swine fever].

On the event platform, you will find useful information for the development of public-private partnerships [PPPs] for the control of ASF. As of today [15 Jun 2021], more than 800 participants from all over the world have already registered.

If you have not yet registered, simply click on the link here: https://stop-asf.gf-tads.org. Once logged in, you will be able to access prerecorded materials on PPP, their importance for the control of ASF, and experiences from the different regions; navigate on the website; or go to PPP in action. You can also network with other participants, answer our survey, and consult useful resources proposed by the speakers.

Do not forget to also log in for the 2 live events on 21 Jun 2021 (12:30 pm - 2:00 pm CEST) and 28 Jun 2021 (12:30 pm - 2:00 pm CEST) where we will be inviting international speakers to share their experiences in ASF control and PPPs. Interpretation in English, French, and Spanish will be available.

We thank you for contributing to the success of this event and hope to interact with you during the next 3 weeks. We count on you to also disseminate this message to those in your network who are interested in ASF control and the development of PPPs.

This event is organised by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in collaboration with the International Meat Secretariat under the umbrella of the FAO/OIE global framework for the progressive control of transboundary animal diseases (GF-TADs).

[The Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) is a joint initiative of FAO and OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health), with the expected participation of WHO for the zoonoses, to achieve the prevention, detection, and control of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) and, in particular, to address their original and global dimensions.

GF-TADs is a facilitating mechanism which will endeavour to empower regional alliances in the fight against transboundary animal diseases (TADs), to provide for capacity building, and to assist in establishing programmes for the specific control of certain TADs based on regional priorities.
