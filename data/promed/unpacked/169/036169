Confirmed: A case of community-acquired infection (1st case in Japan) of a new delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) with N501S mutation

So far, we have confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 strains with various mutations from COVID-19 patients who have been admitted to or visited the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital since late November 2020. Reported (University Press Release 1-4).

In addition, since January 2021, it has been confirmed that the number of cases of community-acquired infections with R.1 strains having an "antigenic escape mutation (E484K mutation)" has increased, and in early April 2021, it was involved in the increase in transmission. We have confirmed multiple cases of community-acquired infections of alpha strains (B.1.1.7 strains) with mutations (N501Y mutations) (University Press Release 5th report).

In early May 2021, we confirmed a case of community-acquired infection of a delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) with a new mutation (L452R) related to increased transmission (University Press Release 6th report). During the period from early May to early July 2021, we confirmed continuous community-acquired cases of alpha strain (B.1.1.7 strain).

Not only was it confirmed that the number of community-acquired cases of delta strains (B.1.617.2 strains) increased from the end of June [2021], but also delta strains (AY.4 strains) that were classified as British regional epidemic strains. We have confirmed the cases of community-acquired infections (University Press Release, 7th report).

This time, as the 8th report, we confirmed a rapid increase in community-acquired cases of delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) from patient-derived specimens that had been hospitalized or visited from the beginning of July to the end of July 2021.

Furthermore, we confirmed a case of community-acquired infection of a new delta strain having the N501S mutation, which is a similar mutation to the major alpha strain mutation (N501Y), from patient-derived specimens in mid-August 2021].

The patient in whom the strain was detected had no history of overseas travel.

[Significance of this finding]

From the results of whole-genome analysis using specimens derived from our university, it was confirmed that the number of cases of community-acquired infections to the delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) has increased since the end of June 2021, and the UK regional epidemic. We also confirmed community-acquired cases of delta strains (AY.4 strains).

This may suggest that community-acquired cases of multiple strains classified as delta strains may have coexisted.

However, since only B.1.617.2 strains have been confirmed for delta strains since mid-July [2021], it is considered that the contribution of AY.4 strains to the spread of community-acquired infections by Delta strains at present is low.

It was found that the new delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) having the N501S mutation, which is a similar mutation to the major alpha strain mutation (N501Y) confirmed this time, is highly likely to have acquired a new mutation in Japan rice field.

Only 8 cases of delta strain (B.1.617.2 strain) with N501S mutation have been reported in the world, and this is the 1st case in Japan.

However, at present, it is difficult to determine the cause of mutation, and further property analysis and epidemiological investigation are required.

We believe that it is important for public health decision-making to continue strong infection prevention measures and at the same time monitor the transition of community-acquired strains and understand the actual state of virus epidemics.

[2] South Africa: new variant
Date: Sun 29 Aug 2021 10:47 p.m. IST
Source: India.com [edited]
https://www.india.com/news/world/south-africa-detects-potential-covid-variant-of-interest-c-1-2-compares-it-to-delta-beta-strains-4922084/


South Africa has identified a potential variant of interest (VOI) of COVID-19 that is assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. The variant, first identified in May 2021 during the 3rd wave of COVID in the country, has since been detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and in 7 other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia, and Oceania, researchers at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform said in their report.

The study [see citation below] is yet to be peer-reviewed and is posted on the pre-print server medRxiv. Meanwhile, India has also reported the presence of a new sub-lineage AY.12 of the delta variant, which was recently classified in Israel. According to a recent report by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), many cases in India that were earlier classified as delta are now being reclassified as AY.12.

C.1.2 is "associated with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralisation sensitivity" wrote the team, including Cathrine Scheepers, from NICD, in the abstract. Compared to C.1, the new variant has "mutated substantially" and is more mutations away from the original virus detected in Wuhan than any other variant of concern (VOC) or VOI detected so far worldwide.

The potential VOI has 41.8 mutations per year, according to the study. It is approximately 1.7-fold faster than the current global rate and 1.8-fold faster than the initial estimate of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. A similar short period of increased evolution was also associated with the emergence of the alpha, beta, and gamma VOCs, said the researchers, suggesting that a single event, followed by the amplification of cases, drove a faster mutation rate.

About 52% of the spike mutations identified in C.1.2 have previously been identified in other VOIs and VOCs. The study also showed consistent increases in the number of C.1.2 genomes in South Africa on a monthly basis, rising from 0.2% in May to 1.6% in June and 2.0% in July [2021], similar to the increases seen in beta and delta in South Africa during early detection.

As of 20 Aug 2021, 80 sequences that match the C.1.2 lineage have been listed on the open-access database GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data). More study is needed "to determine the functional impact of these mutations, which likely include neutralising antibody escape, and to investigate whether it confers advantage over the delta variant," Scheepers said.

"Abstract
---------
SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest have been associated with increased transmissibility, neutralization resistance, and disease severity. Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance worldwide has improved our ability to rapidly identify such variants. Here we report the identification of a potential variant of interest assigned to the PANGO lineage C.1.2. This lineage was first identified in May 2021 and evolved from C.1, one of the lineages that dominated the 1st wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in South Africa and was last detected in January 2021. C.1.2 has since been detected across the majority of the provinces in South Africa and in 7 other countries spanning Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The emergence of C.1.2 was associated with an increased substitution rate, as was previously observed with the emergence of the alpha, beta, and gamma variants of concern (VOCs). C.1.2 contains multiple substitutions (R190S, D215G, E484K, N501Y, H655Y, and T859N) and deletions (Y144del, L242-A243del) within the spike protein, which have been observed in other VOCs and are associated with increased transmissibility and reduced neutralization sensitivity. Of greater concern is the accumulation of additional mutations (C136F, Y449H, and N679K), which are also likely to impact neutralization sensitivity or furin cleavage and therefore replicative fitness. While the phenotypic characteristics and epidemiology of C.1.2 are being defined, it is important to highlight this lineage given its concerning constellations of mutations."

With the intensity of virus transmission in recent weeks and the immunity present in the population putting pressure on the virus, it should be no surprise that variants of concern are being detected with some frequency. And this new variant C.1.2 mutates faster than earlier variants:

From Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing):
"NEW VARIANT - a new #SARSCoV2 variant C.1.2 just identified in South Africa & several countries, with concerns it could be more infectious and evade vaccines. C.1.2 also has mutation rate that is nearly **twice as fast** as the rate of the other variants."

[3] Antibody in response to mRNA vaccines
Date: Mon 30 Aug 2021

Citation: Steensels D, Pierlet N, Penders J, et al. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Response Following Vaccination with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. JAMA. 2021; doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.15125.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) have each shown more than 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 illness (1,2), but to our knowledge, humoral immune responses have not been compared directly.

Methods
Health-care workers at a tertiary care center (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Belgium) who were scheduled for vaccination with 2 doses of either mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 were invited to participate in this prospective cohort. Serologic testing was performed prior to vaccination as well as 6-10 weeks after the 2nd dose (between 27 Apr and 20 May 2021). Total immunoglobulin levels to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 S enzyme immunoassay (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics International Ltd). After vaccination, antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein were determined. Previous infection was defined as anti-nucleocapsid positivity at any point, anti-spike positivity before vaccination, and/or a history of positive polymerase chain reaction results on nasopharyngeal swab.

Antibody levels were compared after the 2nd dose of each vaccine for the entire cohort; for those previously infected vs uninfected; and by age group (less than 35, 35-55, and greater than 55 years) among previously uninfected individuals, using the t test after log10 transformation. Correlation between age and log10-transformed antibody levels was assessed with Pearson correlation. To adjust for confounding, a multiple linear regression was fitted with inclusion of age, sex, previous infection, and time between vaccination and serologic testing. All tests were 2-sided with statistical significance set at a = .05. Analyses were performed using RStudio (version 1.2.1335). This study was approved by the local institutional review board; participants provided written informed consent.

Results
Of 2499 health-care workers who received 2 doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, 1647 participated in this study. A total of 688 were vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (mean age, 43.2 years; 76.7% women; 21.8% previously infected with SARS-CoV-2), and 959 with BNT162b2 (mean age, 44.7 years; 84.9% women; 13.2% previously infected).

Higher antibody titers were observed in participants vaccinated with 2 doses of mRNA-1273 compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2 (geometric mean titer [GMT], 3836 U/mL [95% CI, 3586-4104] vs 1444 U/mL [95% CI, 1350-1544]; P less than .001) (Figure, A).

Previously infected participants had higher antibody titers (GMT, 9461 U/mL [95% CI, 8494-10 539]) compared with previously uninfected participants (GMT, 1613 U/mL [95% CI, 1539-1690]) (P less than .001). In both groups, those vaccinated with mRNA-1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2 (previously uninfected: GMT, 2881 U/mL [95% CI, 2721-3051] vs 1108 U/mL [95% CI, 1049-1170]; P less than .001; previously infected: GMT, 10 708 U/mL [95% CI, 9311-12 315] vs 8174 U/mL [95% CI, 6923-9649]; P=.01). The difference in antibody levels according to previous infection was higher than the difference between the 2 mRNA vaccines (Figure, B and Table).

Antibody levels negatively correlated with age in previously uninfected participants (correlation coefficient, -0.22; P less than .001), being highest among those younger than 35 years. Across all age categories, previously uninfected participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 had higher antibody titers compared with those vaccinated with BNT162b2 (P less than .001 for all comparisons; Figure, C).

The type of mRNA vaccine remained independently associated with the log-transformed antibody titer in a multiple linear regression (P less than .001, Table).

Discussion
This study demonstrated a significantly higher humoral immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna) compared with the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), in infected as well as uninfected participants, and across age categories. The higher mRNA content in mRNA-1273 compared with BNT162b2 and the longer interval between priming and boosting for mRNA-12733 (4 weeks vs 3 weeks for BNT162b2) might explain this difference.

A relationship between neutralization level after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and protection against COVID-19 has been demonstrated by several studies (4). As such, the height of the humoral response after vaccination, which correlates with neutralizing antibody titers (5), might be clinically relevant.

Limitations of this study include the lack of data on cellular immunity and on neutralizing antibodies, as well as the specific focus on health-care workers. Whether the observed difference in antibody level translates to a difference in the duration of protection (4), the protection against variants of concern, and the risk of transmission (6) needs further investigation. Future research should also address the relevance for patients with reduced antibody response after vaccination.

[The results seem odd since both vaccines protect greater than 90% of those immunized. It would be helpful to see a comparison of neutralizing antibody and cell mediated immunity to better evaluate biological relevance of the findings.

However, as further evidence of the difference between the 2 vaccines, Bloomberg News (Jason Gale; https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QYOJPTT0G1L1) reported that Moderna's vaccine was associated with a 2-fold risk reduction against breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to Pfizer's in a review of people in the Mayo Clinic Health System in the US from January to July [2021]. The results were reported in a separate study [see citation and abstract below, 3rd version, dated 21 Aug 2021] released ahead of publication and peer review:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
----------
Although clinical trials and real-world studies have affirmed the effectiveness and safety of the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines, reports of breakthrough infections and persistent emergence of new variants highlight the need to vigilantly monitor the effectiveness of these vaccines. Here we compare the effectiveness of 2 full-length Spike-protein-encoding mRNA vaccines from Moderna (mRNA-1273) and Pfizer/BioNTech (BNT162b2) in the Mayo Clinic Health System over time from January to July 2021, during which either the alpha or delta variant was highly prevalent. We defined cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals from Minnesota (n = 25 589 each) matched on age, sex, race, history of prior SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, and date of full vaccination. Both vaccines were highly effective during this study period against SARS-CoV-2 infection (mRNA-1273: 86%, 95%CI: 81-90.6%; BNT162b2: 76%, 95%CI: 69-81%) and COVID-19-associated hospitalization (mRNA-1273: 91.6%, 95% CI: 81-97%; BNT162b2: 85%, 95% CI: 73-93%). In July [2021], vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization has remained high (mRNA-1273: 81%, 95% CI: 33-96.3%; BNT162b2: 75%, 95% CI: 24-93.9%), but effectiveness against infection was lower for both vaccines (mRNA-1273: 76%, 95% CI: 58-87%; BNT162b2: 42%, 95% CI: 13-62%), with a more pronounced reduction for BNT162b2. Notably, the delta variant prevalence in Minnesota increased from 0.7% in May to over 70% in July [2021] whereas the alpha variant prevalence decreased from 85% to 13% over the same time period. Comparing rates of infection between matched individuals fully vaccinated with mRNA-1273 versus BNT162b2 across Mayo Clinic Health System sites in multiple states (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona, Florida, and Iowa), mRNA-1273 conferred a 2-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 (IRR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.39-0.64). In Florida, which is currently experiencing its largest COVID-19 surge to date, the risk of infection in July [2021] after full vaccination with mRNA-1273 was about 60% lower than after full vaccination with BNT162b2 (IRR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24-0.62). Our observational study highlights that while both mRNA COVID-19 vaccines strongly protect against infection and severe disease, further evaluation of mechanisms underlying differences in their effectiveness such as dosing regimens and vaccine composition are warranted." -Mod.LK]
