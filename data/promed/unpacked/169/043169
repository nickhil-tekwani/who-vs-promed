Third victim of vCJD linked to same village
-------------------------------------------
A third victim has been linked to a former mining village that is at the
centre of an inquiry into a possible cluster of deaths from the human form
of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). A former RAF corporal, who ate
roast beef dinners on Sundays for many years at his grandmother's home in
Armthorpe, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, became the 16th person in Britain to
die from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in Feb 1997 when he was
aged 24. This week it was disclosed that 2 other victims of vCJD - a 28
year old woman, who died in September this year, and a 19 year old male who
died in March 1997 - both lived in the same street in Armthorpe. Both
attended the same local comprehensive school and had played together. It is
now known that the 24 year old RAF Corporal was a regular visitor to his
grandmother's house 3 streets from their homes in Wickett Hern Road.
Experts from the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh are being called on to
examine any links between the 3 deaths. The father of the third victim, who
was born and brought up in Armthorpe, called for an inquiry. He said that
"All 5 members of his family (parents and 3 children) used to visit his
mother most weekends. We always had a traditional Sunday roast beef dinner
with Yorkshire pudding. My son was a big beef fan, he loved his meat. We
never thought about the link with Armthorpe until news of this possible
cluster arose. My mother still lives there, and many members of my family
still live there. The link is there and it could mean that contaminated
meat from a single source was sold to [the families of all 3 [victims.
