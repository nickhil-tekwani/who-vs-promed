Flaccid Trunk Paralysis
Comments by Louise Martin in Kenya that the disease was reported in Samburu
are not substantiated. The rumours may relate to the odd elephant with
snare damage to the trunk with resulting problems feeding.
To my knowledge the problem is isolated to the Lake Kariba region and only
one zone within that area. Very few elephants in the Zimbabwe population
has been affected. [Estimates are 0.0006%. Toxins are suspected.
I suggest, we try and be objective about this issue and keep it in context.
In fact wire snare injury is a far more significant cause of injury and
death in elephants - perhaps we should be spending more energy on this
problem?
