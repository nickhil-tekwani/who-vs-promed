The Baringo County government does not have drugs to treat an outbreak of a bacterial disease among camels, county veterinary director John Wameyo has said. "Going by the symptoms, we have identified the deadly disease as enterotoxaemia -- [a] bacterial disease spread as a result of animals drinking dirty water," he told the Star on Tuesday [9 Jul 2019] [see comment]. "The disease requires special antibiotics and vaccination. As a department, we don't have any stock of medication at the moment."

The camels drank dirty water during the prolonged drought in the county, resulting in the outbreak. A sick camel loses appetite, becomes weak and emaciated, breaths heavily and produces a lot of saliva, resulting in death.

Wameyo spoke on Tuesday [9 Jul 2019] in Moigutwo, Baringo North subcounty, during the launch of a vaccination targeting more than 800 000 cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys, dogs and cats. The animals are being vaccinated against foot and mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and rabies.

The one-month drive will be carried out at 517 sites in Baringo North, Baringo Central, Tiaty, Baringo South, Mogotio and Eldama-Ravine subcounties. The synchronised vaccination project has also been done in the neighbouring Samburu and Laikipia counties. The vaccination is funded by the World Bank and the national and county governments.

Ripko-Kositei MCA Daniel Tuwit said more than 200 camels have died in Chesitet, Kapaw, Kongor, Silale, Amaya, Chesakam, Riongo, Ameyan, Kasakaram and Lorwatum villages in Tiaty subcounty since April [2019]. Agriculture executive Richard Rotich urged the farmers to take the vaccination seriously because diseases reduce productivity of the animals. "I am encouraging all livestock farmers from the region to turn out in large numbers for their livestock to get vaccinated against such livestock diseases," said Dr Rotich.

Last week, Tuwit said many residents have fallen sick after eating the carcasses of dead or sick camels. He said the majority [of] people who ate the meat started vomiting and having diarrhoea. "As more camels continue dying, many illiterate people are eating uninspected meat. ... I call upon the government to dispatch health experts to address the situation," Tuwit said.

[The above media report is composed of 2 mixed news items, related to animal and/or public health in Kenya's Baringo county, as follows:

1. Since April 2019, more than 200 camels have died in 10 (named) villages in the Tiaty subcounty (map at https://tinyurl.com/y37ed4hv). The veterinary authorities suspected enterotoxaemia, "a bacterial disease", which "spread as a result of animals drinking dirty water during the prolonged drought in the county". The disease description included inappetence, weakness, emaciation, heavy breath with salivation and death. It was also stated that "The disease requires special antibiotics and vaccination". It was also argued that "many residents fell sick after eating the carcasses of dead or sick camels".

The above description somewhat deviates from the acute, even peracute, course and nervous signs, in published descriptions of enterotoxaemia in camels, though cases characterised by diarrhoea have been described as well. Enterotoxaemia is caused by enterotoxins produced by strains of _Clostridium perfringens_, of which several types are recognised. The diagnosis of enterotoxaemia is usually based on clinical signs and pathological findings, but identification of toxins in intestinal contents is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Most outbreaks of enterotoxaemia in livestock, worldwide, affect sheep (pulpy kidney, lamb dysentery, overeating). Cattle and goats are also known to suffer _C. perfringens_-related enterotoxaemia.

Results of veterinary investigations, confirming (or otherwise) enterotoxaemia in the affected camels in the Tiaty subcounty, preferably supported by laboratory tests, would be helpful. The claimed connection between the disease in camels and sickness in humans deserves special attention and to be thoroughly investigated.

2. A mass animal-vaccination project has been launched in Baringo North on Tue 9 Jul 2019. The project, aiming at the vaccination of 800 000 animals in all 6 subcounties of Baringo (map at https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Map-of-Baringo-County-showing-Marigat-and-Mogotio-as-the-study-areas_fig1_325631282), in 517 sites, is funded by the World Bank and the national and county governments. The project targets, reportedly, an unusually heterogenous animal population -- cattle, goats, sheep, donkeys, dogs and cats. This melange is, reportedly, to be vaccinated against 3 diseases: foot and mouth disease (FMD), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and rabies. The FMD vaccine is, most likely, covering cattle; PPR vaccine, immunizing sheep and goats; and rabies destined for the vaccination of dogs, cats and donkeys. Confirmation of the said guess, as well as the number of doses used in each of the populations, will add meaning to the data.

Baringo is situated in the Rift Valley; during the Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak in Kenya in 2006-2007, 24% of human cases were reported in this province. The disease was reported there also in May-July 2018 (20180507.5788496, 20190301.6341784, 20180609.5847976). Inclusion of RVF vaccines in the current project deserved consideration. - Mod.AS
