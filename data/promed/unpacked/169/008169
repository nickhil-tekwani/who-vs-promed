A total of 15 Newcastle disease cases have been reported at poultry farms
in Taiwan so far this year, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said on
Tuesday. The number was far higher than those reported in previous years,
COA officials said, adding that local poultry farmers should heighten alert
over the contagious disease which mainly infects chickens.
In 1998, 23 Newcastle disease cases were reported around the island, while
only eight cases were reported in 1997.
COA officials said this year's first Newcastle disease case was reported in
Taitung in eastern Taiwan. Similar cases were then reported in the
neighbouring Hualien county, the central county of Changhua and also Taipei
county.
The latest case was reported in Taipei county's Shuanhsi township,
according to COA official. On June 17, the operator of a poultry farm in
Shuanhsi found that 300 chickens raised in his ranch died of unknown
reason. A few days later, another 4,300 chickens at his farm also died.
Taipei county animal disease control officials then conducted a careful
examination of the deceased chickens. Initial examinations showed that the
chickens were infected with Newcastle disease virus.
On June 23, the Taipei County Government ordered the poultry farm operator
to slaughter all surviving chickens to prevent further spread of the deadly
virus.
