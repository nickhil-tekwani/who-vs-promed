1. Background
On 30 Aug 2007, the Italian Ministry of Health notified, through the Early
Warning and Response System (EWRS) and under the revised International
Health Regulations [IHR(2005)], the EU Member States, the European Centre
of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the IHR contact point of the
World Health Organization (WHO) regional office for Europe, about a
laboratory confirmed outbreak of chikungunya fever in the region of
Emilia-Romagna in north eastern Italy. At the time of notification, 131
suspected cases had occurred since the 1st (then known) case with onset of
symptoms on 4 Jul [2007]. The majority of cases were reported from 2
neighbouring small villages (Castiglione di Ravenna and Castiglione di
Cervia) in the province of Ravenna.

3. Main findings
3.1. Epidemiological situation
Time line: epidemic curve
Between 15 Jun and 21 Sep [2007], a total of 292 suspected cases were
reported, 125 of whom had been confirmed at the time of the visit. The
chikungunya outbreak started in Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di
Ravenna, 2 small neighbouring villages in the province of Ravenna,
separated by a small river. These villages are situated 6 km [3.7 miles]
from the Adriatic coast, and together have a population of 3767. The index
case of the epidemic is resumed to be a resident of the region, who
travelled to the State Kerala, India, in June 2007, and presented with 2
episodes of fever on 15 Jun and 23 Jun [2007]. During the 2nd fever
episode, he visited his cousin in Castiglione di Cervia for several hours.
The cousin, the 2nd reported case, had an onset of symptoms on 4 Jul
[2007]. The epidemic curve shows the presumed index case with onset of
symptoms on 15 Jun [2007], followed by waves of subsequent cases,
compatible with a secondary vectorborne transmission.

Geographical extent
The outbreak spread throughout the 2 villages of Castiglione di Cervia and
Castiglione di Ravenna, affecting residents and a small number of persons
who came to visit family or friends. However, since the end of August
[2007], cases with no known potential exposure in the 2 Castiglione
villages have been reported, providing evidence of local transmission in
adjacent areas. These include, based on the currently available
information, Cervia, Cesena, Ravenna and Rimini where one confirmed case
was reported with onset of symptoms on 12 Sep [2007]. In addition, in spite
of strong vector control activities, transmission of chikungunya virus was
still ongoing during the 3rd week of September in the original 2 affected
villages of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna, where a few
recent, confirmed cases had been reported (date of onset 6 Sep [2007]). A
total of 10 additional suspected cases have been reported from 3 other
regions, but all travelled to Emilia-Romagna and were therefore potentially
exposed there. These cases, awaiting lab confirmation, are not included in
the total reported.

Persons affected
The median age of cases is 59 [years] for confirmed cases, ranging from 3
to 95, and 53 for suspected cases, ranging from 1 to 92. This apparent
over-representation of older persons is potentially explained by the rural
nature of the two initial villages where most cases occurred. However, a
reporting bias (older people seeking medical care more often), a severe
clinical presentation or a higher exposure to mosquitoes in this age group
cannot be excluded. The M/F sex ratio is 0.83. The symptoms presented by
the confirmed cases are similar to those presented by cases during the
outbreak in La Reunion, with 95 per cent having arthralgia. One 83 year old
patient, presenting with underlying conditions, died. One patient is
currently comatose; both PCR tests for viral RNA in the liquor turned out
negative.

Entomological situation
_Aedes albopictus_ in Italy
In response to the reported presence of _Aedes albopictus_ in Genoa
(Liguria region) in 1990, a surveillance and control programme was
established by the Ministry of Health, under the coordination of the ISS.
In 1992, the establishment of _Aedes albopictus_ in the Veneto region was
traced back to the importation of used tires from Atlanta, GA, in the USA.
The tiger mosquito then reached other Italian regions through gradual
colonization of the bordering areas and through short and long distance
passive transfer of eggs or different mosquito evolution stages. Guidelines
for the control of _Aedes albopictus_ were issued by the Ministry of health
in 1994. _Aedes albopictus_ was 1st reported in Rome in 1997. In 1998, it
was established in 22 Italian provinces in 9 different regions.

_Aedes albopictus_ in Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna
In March 2005, all municipalities of the Emilia-Romagna region received the
guidelines for the control of tiger mosquitoes. _Aedes albopictus_ is known
to be present in the 2 Castiglione villages since 2006. The 2 villages are
separated by a river with relatively stagnant water resulting from the
presence of a lock. Conditions around the houses seem optimal for vector
development and expansion. Houses are typically low (ground and second
floor), surrounded by small gardens with many flowers, plants and flower
pots. In the streets, drainage systems are visible, reflecting open
stagnant water underground.

The available data indicated an increase of vector presence in the area
over the recent years corresponding to the establishment of the vector in
the area, and reached a plateau level in 2007. The favourable conditions
for local transmission were present in the 2 Castiglione villages, and it
is very likely that such conditions exist in other areas of the Ravenna
province and Emilia-Romagna region. The appearance of new cases in Ravenna,
Rimini and Cesena, who had no history of exposure to the initially affected
area, suggests that transmission has spread through infected mosquitoes to
at least 3 urbanized areas. This finding needs to be taken into account in
the risk assessment, surveillance and response to the outbreak.

Mosquito activity is expected to continue until the end of October [2007],
but may extend into November according to the weather conditions. However,
even if no adult mosquitoes circulate during winter time, the recent
evidence of trans-ovarian (vertical) virus transmission gained from studies
done in la Reunion possibly increases the risk for re-appearance of
infected mosquitoes in the spring of 2008. Timely detection of this
potential re-appearance through surveillance, with rapid implementation of
vector control measures in close collaboration with the local population,
will be essential to control a potential recurrence of the virus in 2008.

Control measures implemented
Since 18 Aug [2007], vector control measures have been implemented in the 2
villages of Castiglione di Cervia and Castiglione di Ravenna, and were
gradually extended according to the progress of the outbreak. Measures
include both the control of breeding sites and the use of insecticides. In
addition to targeting public areas, door-to-door control activities are
implemented within a radius of 100m around each suspected case, or within a
radius of 300m [328 yards] around every cluster of cases. Private companies
carry out the vector control measures, under the supervision of
entomologists of the regional public health service.

Blood donation
On 31 Aug [2007], blood donation from people living in the municipalities
of Ravenna and Cervia was suspended "till new order" through a ministerial
circular. In addition, blood donation was suspended from people who stayed
in affected areas for 21 days after leaving the area. On 3 Sep [2007],
exclusion measures were extended to Cesena and Cesenatico.

Risk assessment for Europe
The current outbreak of chikungunya in Italy is the 1st documented
vectorborne transmission of the virus in continental Europe. The
autochthonous transmission has extended beyond the initial 2 villages,
resulting in the establishment of at least 3 secondary transmission foci by
local mosquitoes. In addition, the transmission in the 2 initial villages
had not yet ceased at the time of our visit, more than 2 months after the
initial case occurred. The importance of this event should not be
underestimated and its comprehensive documentation is crucial to ensure a
maximal benefit to control its spread and for future preparedness in case
of similar occurrences of mosquito-borne disease transmission, in Italy and
elsewhere.

Risk for sustained virus transmission of Chikungunya virus in Italy
Several factors seem to have contributed to the establishment of local
transmission in continental Europe:
- the presence in high density of _Aedes albopictus_ in an area of the
Emilia-Romagna region where it had appeared relatively recently and was
therefore not yet covered by the vector monitoring system;
- an ecological situation favourable for the development of the vector and
for virus transmission, considering the dense local vegetation and domestic
backyards with plant pots and potential water containers in the 2 villages;
- the introduction of the virus by a visitor returning from a chikungunya
high endemic area;
- sufficient (human) population density.

Based on the available data, it is likely that the transmission of
chikungunya virus will persist in the coming weeks, probably until the end
of October 2007 when the local vector activity should disappear. This may
result in additional chikungunya fever cases occurring and being reported
until then. It cannot be excluded that, in case of a particularly mild
winter, local vector activity may persist during winter, especially in
urban settings, potentially resulting in few sporadic cases which would,
however, maintain mosquito-to-human transmission cycles until the spring.
In addition, considering the existence of vertical (trans-ovarian)
transmission, reported "in natura" in a tropical region, mosquitoes
infected with Chikungunya virus may re-appear in the spring of 2008, when
mosquito eggs hatch and vector activity starts again after the winter.
