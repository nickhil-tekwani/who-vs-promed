Six residents of the village of Mihaylovka, where there has been an
outbreak of rabies in cattle, have been hospitalised on suspicion of
exposure to rabies virus infection. According to Sergei Hanhareyev,
Chief of the Russian Epidemiological Surveillance Centre in Buryatiya,
these 6 people had contact with rabid cattle and with a rabid fox that
probably was the source of infection of the cattle (bovines).

Ten people in total were in contact with infected animals; none of
them developed any symptoms; however, doctors decided to vaccinate 6
of the 10 and keep the other 4 under observation.

According to preliminary information, the cattle became infected as a
result of contact with a rabid fox that was subsequently killed. As a
result, 3 of the cows developed signs of rabies. These animals were
euthanized after rabies virus infection was confirmed by laboratory
tests carried out at the Irkusk Veterinary Laboratory. Anti-epidemic
measures are in progress. 1200 people live in Mihaylovka village, and
the animal population comprises 2700 cattle, 500 sheep and goats, 400
horses, and 1300 domestic birds.

[The following information is reproduced from a commentary by Mod.AS
accompanying a report of a similar incident in Ukraine (see: Rabies -
Ukraine: (VI) bovine, human exposure 20101009.3668)

"Generally, rabies in herbivores is, like in humans, a dead-end
disease. An owner, handler or an attending veterinarian may become
exposed to rabies themselves by searching, bare handed, for an
offending foreign body in a choking animal. Rabies may present in
cattle in either of 2 forms. In the furious form, normally docile
animals may attack humans and other animals, though biting is rather
rare. Milk production ceases abruptly in dairy cattle. The cow may
appear hypersensitive and will follow sounds and movements intensely.
The affected cattle may exhibit abnormal bellowing which may continue
intermittently, or voiceless attempts to bellow described as yawning.
Those who have heard this sound once will recognize it readily. In the
paralytic form, the 1st sign may be paralysis of the throat. Drooling
of saliva, grinding of the teeth, extension of the head, and bloat may
occur. The cow may appear to be choking. Laryngeal paralysis can cause
a change in vocalizations, including the aforementioned abnormal
bellow, though this is more common in the furious form. Weakness in
the hindquarters may occur and is always accompanied by decreased
sensation to the affected area. Paralysis of the anus and penis in the
bull may be seen. Eventually, the animal will go down and be unable to
get up as paralysis becomes complete. These animals do not attack
others." - Mod.AS]
