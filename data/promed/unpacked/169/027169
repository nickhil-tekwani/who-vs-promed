For [SHP], a former university chancellor, and her husband, [JDL], a retired physicist, the 2017 Toyota Avalon was a sensible purchase. It was a model she and her husband had owned before, but the new version had electronic sensors and other advanced features.

"The Avalon is very safe," Mr. [L]'s daughter [SL] recalled hearing [SHP] say. Last month [May 2019], one of those features proved fatal.

[SHP], age 81, and [JDL], age 88, were found dead at their home in Sarasota, Florida, poisoned by carbon monoxide, according to preliminary tests by the local medical examiner. [SL] said after the car -- which had a keyless ignition -- pulled into the garage attached to their house, the engine had continued to run.

The deaths highlight a hazard regulatory and legislative efforts have yet to remedy: Without the motion of turning a physical key, some car owners, especially older ones, forget to turn off a vehicle.

Based on news reports, lawsuits, police and fire records, and research by advocacy groups, at least 36 people have been killed in the USA in such incidents since 2006, including 7 in the past 6 months. Dozens of others have been injured, some left with brain damage.

The deaths of [SHP] and [JDL] were all the more striking because of their accomplishments in academia and science. Before retiring to Florida, [SHP] was the 1st woman to serve permanently as chancellor of the University of Massachusetts Boston and held other leadership roles in the UMass and State University of New York systems. [JDL], an expert on magnets, spent decades as a researcher at General Electric and taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The couple collaborated on a book about Martha Wright, a women's rights figure in the 1800s who was [JDL]'s great-great-grandmother.

"These are very smart people," [SL] said. "This kind of situation can happen to anybody."

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which oversees the auto industry, proposed a rule for keyless vehicles in 2011 mandating a one-second audible external warning to drivers to turn off the ignition. The rule would cost the auto industry USD 500 000 a year, according to an agency estimate. But after lobbying from the industry, the proposal has remained in limbo.

Asked recently for comment, the agency repeated earlier guidance, pointing consumers to a safety video about the use and potential dangers of keyless ignitions.

Some keyless models activate audible warnings or flashing lights inside or outside the car if the door is opened while the motor is running. The Toyota Avalon, for example, is designed to beep once internally and 3 times externally in such circumstances. But as the deaths of [SHP] and [JDL] indicate, such alerts are not always adequate.

"I think if they bought a different car, they'd be alive," [SL] said.

Contacted for this article, the automaker said, "Toyota vehicles meet or exceed all regulatory safety standards."

An investigation by The New York Times last year [2018] highlighted the extent of the hazard with keyless ignitions and the regulatory inaction. Soon after, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, demanded during a hearing the highway safety agency adopt its proposed rule and require carmakers to make vehicles shut off automatically after a set period of idling. Earlier this year [2019], Mr. Blumenthal introduced a bill to do just that.

The Senate legislation, the Park It Act, has yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing. But this month [June 2019] a group of House members -- 3 Democrats and a Republican -- introduced an identical bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee.

"This is something we clearly have the technology to prevent," Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat and the bill's lead House sponsor, said of the carbon monoxide deaths.

Ford and General Motors (GM) have announced their support for the legislation.

Some automakers, including Ford, have added an automatic shut-off on all its keyless vehicles since the 2015 model year. GM retrofitted some of its vehicles to add the automatic shut-off, at USD 5 a piece, the company told regulators.

Toyota, whose vehicles have been involved in half of the fatal incidents, has announced that its 2020 keyless models will come with an automatic shut-off function. It would not say whether it supported the congressional legislation.

Hyundai said it backed the legislation and it planned to install the auto shut-off technology in new models, but did not offer a timeline for doing so.

A representative of Fiat Chrysler said the company was reviewing the legislation, but added "statistics show no increase in such injuries when compared with vehicles featuring conventional rotary-key ignition systems," and "automatic shut-off technology may have unintended consequences."

Nissan, Daimler, Mazda and Subaru declined to say whether they had a position on the legislation. Several automakers did not respond to inquiries.

While mandated safety features remain elusive, millions of cars with keyless ignitions are on the road. The feature is now standard in more than half of the vehicles made each year, according to the auto information website Edmunds.

"Those cars might be out there 7, 8, 10 years," [SL] said. "What about all those other people that might die?"

- A New York Times report tells the story of a couple who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after their 2017 Toyota Avalon, equipped with a push-button keyless ignition, was mistakenly left running inside their garage.
- The story outlines the problem of modern keyless-ignition systems making it more difficult to be certain whether a car's engine is running.
- The NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration] and SAE International [Society of Automotive Engineers International] have both recommended warning systems be added to push-button ignition systems, but more driver attentiveness is a powerful remedy, too.

Are all the electronics in your car a good thing? When it comes to safety features such as anti-lock brakes and stability-control systems, the answer is yes. Convenience features like touchscreens, however, can add distraction and, at worst, can be dangerous. It's difficult to know where to draw the line, but The New York Times suggests in a recent story keyless-ignition systems pose an overlooked risk because sometimes, the driver fails to switch the car off or doesn't realize it's still running. It's a follow-up to a larger investigation citing the dangers that can happen when you don't have to physically turn off a key to be sure your car is shut down.

The latest Times piece cites the unexpected death of [SP] and [JL], a married couple who passed away from carbon monoxide poisoning after accidentally leaving their 2017 Toyota Avalon running inside a closed garage. In addition to keyless ignition, the Avalon features a stop/start function in which the engine will turn off while the ignition is still on to save fuel. Carbon monoxide poisoning is rare, with only a few hundred cases reported every year, but running an internal-combustion engine in an enclosed space can create deadly concentrations in a matter of minutes -- even faster with a cold engine. With an attached garage, a running car can make even the air inside a home fatal. The Times estimated that, since 2006, 36 people have died in incidents similar to this one in the USA and "dozens of others" have been injured.

Keyless ignition is popular and rapidly becoming a standard feature because it's convenient. The driver can leave the key fob in a pocket or purse, never worrying about locking the keys in the car. Because it communicates wirelessly with the car's computer, a keyless system is more secure than an old-fashioned key where the number of combinations are a physical constraint. And with fewer moving parts than an ignition tumbler, keyless ignition can be less expensive for the automaker to produce.

General Motors (GM) adopted push-button ignition across all its cars after its major ignition switch recall. With no key to turn, there's far less danger of shutting off a car while in motion, whether accidentally or due to a faulty part (the latter being the major factor for GM).

In GM's case, keyless ignition was a safety enhancement. But with all technology, there are unexpected consequences. In this case, keyless ignition combined with automatic stop/start increases the risk of drivers leaving their cars on accidentally. When that happens inside a garage, the results can turn serious.

The issue here is how to avoid that, and, as with any tragedy, it's complicated. The Times says half of the carbon monoxide injuries and fatalities it identified were Toyota and Lexus models, even though Toyota uses an audible beeping warning. The Toyota Avalon does not feature the kind of automatic shutoff function other automakers employ, which happens after either a set time limit or through some combination of unbuckling the seatbelt, opening the driver's door, and exiting the vehicle with the key. Toyota has said it will add an automatic shutoff feature on its 2020 models with keyless ignition.

Both SAE International and the NHTSA have proposed standards requiring more warnings or an automatic shutoff with keyless ignitions, but the auto industry, as always, is known to resist attempts at regulation adding any cost or complexity.

Car and Driver, true to our name, would like to respectfully suggest the Times is missing an important factor: the people who drive, park, and own the vehicles in question. It is not drivers' fault that it's harder to tell whether or not their car is on or off these days. Even so, it is their responsibility to learn how to tell what "on" and "off" are like on the cars they own and drive.

The evolving technology requires a mental shift: Now since you don't mechanically stick a key in the ignition and hear engine noise when the car is running, you need to pay closer attention to whether you've shut off the vehicle. It's clear we can't trust automakers to protect us from every scenario, any more than we can trust the internet to protect our personal data. As cars become more appliance-like and consumers become less and less engaged with how cars work, the risk of problems like this only becomes more likely. It's a reminder of the most important safety feature in a car, as always, is you.

[While the real issue here is carbon monoxide, I really like having a key in my hand.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas most often associated with the fumes from burning fuel in some type of engine: a car, a small engine, a boiler, a gas furnace, or a generator. CO can build up, particularly indoors, and be the source of a poisoning of multiple people.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by inhaling combustion fumes. CO is produced by burning gasoline, wood, propane, charcoal, or other fuel. Improperly ventilated appliances and engines, particularly in a tightly sealed or enclosed space, may allow carbon monoxide to accumulate to dangerous levels.

Carbon monoxide poisoning occurs when CO builds up in your bloodstream. When too much CO is in the air you're breathing, your body replaces the oxygen in your red blood cells with CO. This prevents oxygen from reaching your tissues and organs and can lead to serious tissue damage or even death. If you think you or someone that you're with may have carbon monoxide poisoning, get into fresh air and seek emergency medical care.

Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include the following:
- Dull headache
- Weakness
- Dizziness
- Nausea or vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Confusion
- Blurred vision
- Loss of consciousness

Carbon monoxide poisoning can be particularly dangerous for people who are sleeping or intoxicated. People may have irreversible brain damage or even die before anyone realizes there's a problem.

Various fuel-burning appliances and engines produce carbon monoxide. The amount of carbon monoxide produced by these sources usually isn't a cause for concern. But if they're used in a closed or partially closed space -- cooking with a charcoal grill indoors, for example -- the carbon monoxide can build to dangerous levels. Proper ventilation is critical when running engines including generators in closed spaces. Smoke inhalation during a fire also can cause carbon monoxide poisoning.

Carbon monoxide may be particularly dangerous for:
- Children -- Young children take breaths more frequently than adults do, which may make them more susceptible to carbon monoxide poisoning;
- Older adults -- Older people who experience carbon monoxide poisoning may be more likely to develop brain damage;
- People who have chronic heart disease. People with a history of anemia and breathing problems also are more likely to get sick from exposure to carbon monoxide; and
- Those in whom carbon monoxide poisoning leads to unconsciousness. Loss of consciousness indicates more severe exposure.

Depending on the degree and length of exposure, carbon monoxide poisoning can cause
- Permanent brain damage;
- Damage to your heart, possibly leading to life-threatening cardiac complications; or
- Death.

To the list of those most susceptible to carbon monoxide we might include those who have silent running cars and become unaware of the car still running in the garage. - Mod.TG
