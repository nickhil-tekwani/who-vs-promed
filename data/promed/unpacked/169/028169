At least 2 people have died in a _Listeria_ outbreak linked to chilled smoked trout fillets in the Netherlands.

All 6 sick people have been hospitalized, and 2 died from their infections. Another person has died, but no information about the cause of death was given.

Patients became ill between the beginning of February and mid-June [2020]. Their age range is 42 to 85 years old with a median of 78 years old.

The outbreak was reported by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Wageningen Food Safety Research (WFSR) institute, who jointly monitor clustering of _Listeria_ isolates from patients and foods, when only 3 people were affected.

As part of listeriosis reporting, several fish consumption questions are usually asked. This information is currently available for 5 of the outbreak patients. They all ate fish, while 4 of them stated smoked fish, and one explicitly mentioned trout.

In the 3rd week of June [2020], 4 products were recalled: smoked trout fillets from Vis Marine, Albert Heijn and 2 fish items from Bond Seafood. Shelf life dates ranged from 20 Jun to 5 Jul 2020. An NVWA spokesman said it was not clear which of the products have caused illness, and all were made by the same production process.

The NVWA was notified that 3 food isolates and 3 patient isolates formed a cluster, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses. "Following this notification, the outbreak investigation pointed toward a single production process as the source for this outbreak. It was concluded that the safety of products produced by this process could not be guaranteed, leading to the recall," the NVWA spokesman told Food Safety News. Furthermore, steps have been taken by the producer to remove possible sources of contamination. As all involved food business operators have voluntarily taken all expected actions, no measures towards them were taken by the NVWA. As the recall was initiated on 19 Jun [2020], and given the potentially long incubation time for _Listeria_ [infection], we cannot exclude that more cases related to this outbreak will be identified."

The Vis Marine 125-gram product was sold at Boon, Boni, Coop, Hoogvliet, Jan Linders, Nettorama, Plus, Poiesz, Spar and Vomar stores. Two products from Bond Seafood were sold at Jumbo Supermarkten, and the AH trout fillet was available for purchase at Albert Heijn stores.

[The above news report describes a cluster of 6 listeriosis cases in the Netherlands, at least 2 of which were fatal, linked to chilled smoked trout fillets. Whole genome sequencing on 3 of the patients' isolates matched that of 3 food isolates. All the smoked trout fillet products were recalled, since all were said to be made by "the same production process." Refrigerated, ready-to-eat, smoked fish is a classic food item responsible for listeriosis outbreaks. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods, because _L. monocytogenes_ can multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease. - Mod.ML
