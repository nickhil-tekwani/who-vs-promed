CHOLERA - HAITI (08): SOUTH ASIA ORIGIN

Medical detectives working in Haiti believe the original source of
the bacterium that caused the recent cholera epidemic was someplace
in south Asia.

The analysis isolated DNA from bacterial samples taken from cholera
victims in Haiti. All 13 of those samples were identical, showing
that the outbreak in Haiti most probably comes from a single strain.
When that strain was compared to strains from around the world, it
most closely matched one that originated in south Asia.

More studies may be able to pin down the source more precisely,
though experts say that's only a possibility. The work was a
collaboration between Haitian public health workers and the CDC.

"Although these results indicate that the strain is non-Haitian,
cholera strains may move between different areas due to global travel
and trade," Dr. Alex Larsen, Haiti's Minister of Health, said in a
statement. "Therefore, we will never know the exact origin of the
strain that is causing the epidemic in Haiti. This strain was
transmitted by contaminated food or water or an infected person."

Rumors have been circulating in Haiti that a contingent of United
Nations peacekeepers from Nepal brought the bacterium into the
country. UN teams say they've tested those peacekeepers, and found no
traces of cholera.

[Although Nepal is part of south Asia, and cholera is endemic there,
it is yet unclear if the isolate is closer to Nepalese strains (if
available) as compared to strains from India, Pakistan or from those
countries in the Mekong River area where the disease has also been
active. - Mod.LL]
