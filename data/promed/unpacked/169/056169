[Egypt and UAE are experiencing a surge in cases and deaths due to COVID-19 during what might be the 2nd wave of the pandemic. During this month, December 2020, both countries have announced that they have started a COVID-19 vaccination campaign using the Sinopharm vaccine produced by a Chinese company, but the protective effect of such vaccine may not appear in such a short time; moreover, a false sense of security may prevail among the public, which may drive them to neglect other essential control measures such as wearing face masks and social distancing. - Mod.MM

[1B] Thailand update
[a] National: 81 new cases, 37 local cases
Date: Fri 25 Dec 2020

https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30400218


The Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) reported 81 new cases over a 24-hour period on Friday [25 Dec 2020].

Of the 81, 37 were domestic cases, with 26 patients linked directly to the Samut Sakhon cluster, 11 yet to be confirmed, and 35 migrant workers who tested positive as part of a proactive COVID-19 search operation. Most of the workers who have tested positive are asymptomatic.

Separately, 6 Thais and 3 foreigners who have recently entered the country tested positive in quarantine. The returnees include one Thai who returned from Myanmar, one from Switzerland, one from the United Arab Emirates, and 3 from the USA. Foreigners included a German dentist and 2 Russian men.

Meanwhile, 21 patients have recovered and been discharged.

The total number of confirmed cases in Thailand has risen to 5910 (1943 returnees and 1308 found domestically), 1713 of whom are in hospital or ad-hoc quarantine facilities, while 4137 have recovered and been discharged. The death toll remains unchanged at 60.

According to Worldometer, as of 10 am, the total number of confirmed cases globally had risen to 79.72 million (up by 665 189). Of them, 56.12 million have recovered, while 21.85 million are active cases (106 250 in severe condition) and 1.75 million have died (up by 11 718).

Thailand ranks 144th for most cases in the world, while the USA tops the list with 19.11 million, followed by India 10.14 million, Brazil 7.42 million, Russia 2.96 million, and France 2.52 million.

CCSA spokesperson Dr. Taweesin Visanuyothin said as part of the search for active cases, 8810 people have been tested so far and 1308 found infected, accounting for a 15% positive rate. Of this group, 3 patients are at risk -- 2 are suffering from severe diarrhoea and one is a pregnant woman close to delivery.

As for Samut Sakhon locals who are against the setting up of a field hospital, he said there are enough personnel and security officials to ensure the safety of communities around the site.

So far, patients linked to the Samut Sakhon outbreak have been found in 31 provinces, namely, Bangkok, Chachoengsao, Nakhon Pathom, Pathum Thani, Phetchaburi, Samut Prakan, Saraburi, Uttaradit, Petchabun, Suphanburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Prachin Buri, Krabi, Phuket, Ayutthaya, Kamphaeng Phet, Khon Kaen, Chai Nat, Samut Songkhram, Udo Thani, Phichit, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Surat Thani, Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Sawan, Nonthaburi, Ang Thong, Ratchaburi, Songkhla, Loei, and Ubon Ratchathani. Dr. Taweesin has suggested that people keep DMHT in mind, namely, distancing, mask, handwashing and temperature testing.

As for panic over seafood from Samut Sakhon, he said he wants people to calm down because many provinces have temporarily stopped the movement of products, though seafood can be safely consumed provided it is cooked properly, in line with good hygiene guidelines.

The Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) resolved on Thursday [24 Dec 2020] to classify provinces in different colours depending on the level of COVID-19 risk and the strength of measures taken in each province.

A map of the country with provinces marked out in red, orange, yellow, or green will be released by the CCSA on a daily basis [see the map at the source URL above].

So far, of the 30 provinces where COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, Samut Sakhon is the only one marked out in red. Provinces marked out in orange, signifying more than 10 cases, include Bangkok, Samut Songkhram, Ratchaburi, and Nakhon Pathom.

Provinces marked out in yellow, where fewer than 10 cases have been found, are Saraburi, Samut Prakan, Suphanburi, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Uttaradit, Chachoengsao, Kamphaeng Phet, Phetchabun, Ayutthaya, Phuket, Phetchaburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Prachinburi, Krabi, Khon Kaen, Chai Nat, Udon Thani, Phichit, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Surat Thani, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chaiyaphum, Nakhon Sawan, and Ang Thong.

The rest of the provinces were marked in green to show no COVID-19 cases have been reported in the new wave of infections.

CCSA spokesperson Dr. Taweesin Visanuyothin said no gatherings will be allowed in provinces marked red, while residents in orange-coded provinces will only be allowed small personal gatherings.

However, small events will be allowed in yellow- and green-coded areas.

[A 30-bed field hospital was set up in the central shrimp market in Samut Sakhon province where the cluster of COVID-19 was identified with over 1000 confirmed cases (https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2040771/field-hospital-opens-at-notorious-shrimp-market). Since a previous newswire reported that healthy and infected migrant workers were locked in together inside the dormitories of the central shrimp market and many of them did not receive the laboratory results (see prior ProMED-MBDS posting COVID-19 update (153): Thailand, local 20201223.8041442), more cases might be detected hereafter. Hence, the field hospital will be a crucial medical facility to reduce morbidity and mortality in the affected community.

According to the local media, the provinces that detected the 1st domestic cases of COVID-19 since the last update are as follows:
- Trang (https://www.posttoday.com/social/local/641237 in Thai);
- Ubon Ratchathani (https://www.thairath.co.th/news/local/northeast/2001579 in Thai);

- Ratchaburi (https://www.nationthailand.com/news/30400222); and
- Loei (https://www.posttoday.com/social/local/641155 in Thai).

Detection of other clusters in provinces highlights the breach of physical distancing and preventive measures during this pandemic. Thus, risk communication in public and disease prevention rules in public areas should be enforced and intensified. - Mod.YMA

Citation: McGurnaghan SJ, Weir A, Bishop J, et al. Risk of and risk factors for COVID-19 disease in people with diabetes: a cohort study of the total population of Scotland. Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol. Epub 23 Dec 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(20)30405-8

Summary
------
Background: We aimed to ascertain the cumulative risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes and compare it with that of people without diabetes, and to investigate risk factors for and build a cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 among people with diabetes.

Methods: In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the 1st wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from 1 Mar 2020, when the 1st case was identified, to 31 Jul 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated 7 Feb 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation.

Findings: Of the total Scottish population on 1 Mar 2020 (n = 5 463 300), the population with diabetes was 319 349 (5.8%), 1082 (0.3%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by 31 Jul 2020, of whom 972 (89.8%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0.1%) of 5 143 951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of 31 Jul 2020, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1.395 (95% CI, 1.304-1.494; p less than 0.0001) compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2.396 (1.815-3.163; p less than 0.0001) in type 1 diabetes and 1.369 (1.276-1.468; p less than 0.0001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p less than 0.0001), and have been a smoker (p = 0.0011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0.85 (0.83-0.86).

Interpretation: Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.

----
Research in context
Evidence before this study: We searched PubMed and the META database for studies examining risks of COVID-19 associated with diabetes that had appropriate comparator populations, and for studies among those with diabetes exploring what risk factors predict COVID-19, using the terms ("COVID-19" OR "novel coronavirus" OR "SARS-CoV-2") AND "diabetes", until 5 Oct 2020, restricted to English language. Case series have reported a high prevalence of diabetes among those hospitalised and a high test-positivity rate for diabetes among those tested. However, diabetes is a common condition, so to quantify the risk ratios for COVID-19, comparison with the background population is needed. Only 4 such studies were found; these reported relative risks of 2.04 for type 2 diabetes and 3.5 for type 1 diabetes for COVID-19 hospitalised death, and 1.9 for COVID-19 hospitalisation and 2.4 for COVID-19 hospitalised death, respectively, for all diabetes. The range of potential determinants explored in these studies has been low.

Added value of this study: In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the 1st wave of the pandemic in Scotland, i.e., from 1 Mar 2020, when the 1st case was identified, to 31 Jul 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. Including critical care-treated and out-of-hospital deaths from COVID-19 for the 1st time, as well as hospitalised deaths, we showed that the risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 is increased by 2.4 times in type 1 diabetes and 1.4 times in type 2 diabetes. For the 1st time, to our knowledge, we have shown that people with recent admissions history for hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis have an increased risk of severe or fatal disease. People with a history of smoking had increased risks. Prior specific comorbidities, including heart disease, liver disease, and chronic lower respiratory disease, also increased risk. We showed for the 1st time, to our knowledge, that being exposed to more drug classes and having more previous hospital admissions are markers of risk. A risk prediction model achieved a C-statistic of 0.85. We provided a Shiny app to give the reader a sense of how individual risk factor profiles in people with diabetes translate into elevated risks compared with those without diabetes.

Implications of all the available evidence: During phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the effective reproduction number is high, those people with diabetes who are most at risk might warrant special protection measures. A risk prediction score based on medical history can usefully identify those with diabetes who are most at risk, and we provide an example of such a score.

[The authors mentioned that "Only one study (13) has explored determinants of COVID-19 risk among people with diabetes to any extent, and Black and south Asian ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, poorer glycaemic control, and previous cardiovascular disease are reported to increase risks (13,14). Beyond age, sex, and diabetes duration, BMI was the only other predictor for being hospitalised with COVID-19 in a large French case series (16)."

..."Among people with diabetes in Scotland, the risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 increased with age (Table 1). Just 30 (2.8%) of 1082 people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were younger than 50 years (all aged more than 20 years) and 972 (89.9%) were aged 60 years or more. The overall risk was 0.4% in males and 0.3% in females. Overall, 51 (0.1%) of 34 383 people with type 1 diabetes and 1008 (0.4%) of 275 960 with type 2 diabetes developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 (Table 1)."

The authors identified risk factors for serious/fatal outcomes, including:
- Number of previous hospitalisations for hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, in the preceding 5 years
- Increasing HbA1c (hemoglobin A1C -- a measure of the average blood sugar levels over the preceding 3 months)
- Lower systolic blood pressure
- Retinopathy
- History of smoking (risk was not significantly higher in current vs never smokers)
- Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton-pump inhibitors and anti-coagulants
- Use of more diabetes drug subclasses in the past 3 years
- Use of insulin or sulphonylureas associated with the highest risks

Interestingly, the use of antihypertensives was found to be protective -- highest among those on thiazides and angiotensin 2 receptor antagonists or blockers.

These results are not surprising, as they implicate longer periods of suboptimally controlled diabetes, which is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as other risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, an identified high risk for serious and fatal COVID-19 disease. - Mod.MPP]

Japan has confirmed its first 5 cases of the new, faster-spreading variant of the coronavirus in passengers arriving from the UK as Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urges the nation to spend a "quiet New Year" period.

Health Minister Norihisa Tamura announced the cases late on Friday [25 Dec 2020] after his meeting with Suga, adding that the premier called for strict quarantine measures at airports and on those returning from the UK. Japan has banned entry from the UK, with the exception of returning Japanese nationals and those with residence permits.

The New Year period is an extended national holiday in Japan, with many people usually travelling back to their hometowns and spending time with family and friends. Earlier on Friday [25 Dec 2020], Suga called for a quiet New Year without the usual social gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which has been breaking infection records almost on a daily basis.

Health authorities in France have confirmed the country's 1st case of the coronavirus variant that prompted strict lockdown measures in the UK and global travel restrictions.

The French health ministry said a French man who arrived in France from the British capital, London, on 19 Dec 2020 had tested positive for the new variant on Friday [25 Dec 2020]. He had no symptoms and was isolating in his home in the central city of Tours. Authorities have carried out contact-tracing for the health professionals taking care of the patient, the ministry said. Any of their contacts that were seen as vulnerable would similarly be isolated, it said.

In addition to this 1st case, several other positive samples that "may suggest the VOC 202012/01 variant are being sequenced" by the specialist laboratories of the national Pasteur Institute, the statement added.

Italian authorities have detected the new strain in a patient in Rome, while the World Health Organization reported that 9 cases have been detected in Denmark and one each in the Netherlands and Australia.

Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tony Holohan has said the new variant of COVID-19 in the UK has been detected in Ireland. Dr. Holohan said that further testing in the coming days and weeks would establish the extent to which it is present here.

He urged people to avoid social contact and all forms of non-essential travel.

Dr. Holohan said the new UK variant of SARS-CoV-2 had been detected by whole genome sequencing at the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD. "Further testing in the coming days and weeks will establish the extent to which it is present here. In the meantime, it is vitally important that we each stay at home, avoid social contact and avoid all forms of non-essential travel," he added.

"It is particularly important that those who have arrived from the UK strictly self-isolate for a full 14 days following arrival. They should not interact with others, visit others, socialise or go shopping." Dr. Holohan said the HSE is making arrangements to test recent arrivals from the UK.

Earlier, Dr. Holohan renewed his appeal for people to limit their contacts as much as possible over Christmas. He said none of the indicators of the virus are showing encouraging signs and Ireland now has the fastest growing incidence rate in the EU.

The best present people can give to their loved ones this Christmas is to strictly adhere to the public health advice, he added.

German authorities on Thursday [24 Dec 2020] confirmed the presence of the new coronavirus variant on German soil, adding to fears that it could start spreading beyond the UK and South Africa.

A woman who flew in from London Heathrow this Sunday [20 Dec 2020] tested positive at the Frankfurt airport. Further genetic analysis of the sample at a lab in Berlin identified a case of B.1.1.7, as the variant is known, said authorities in the German state of [Baden-Wuerttemberg] in a statement. "It is the 1st known case in Germany," they said.

The woman, who flew to Germany to visit family, was picked up from the airport by relatives and has isolated at the family's home in Baden-Wuerttemberg since then, the state's health ministry said. She has since developed mild symptoms. Three individuals who have been in close contact with the woman have also quarantined, the statement added.

[I suspect we are now in a "seek and ye shall find" mode: Countries are looking at new arrivals from the UK and are finding. I suspect if they start sequencing more isolates, they may very well find cases that arrived earlier before the alarm was sounded.

In fact, Denmark has been doing a retrospective look and on Wednesday (23 Dec 2020), the SSI announced that 33 infections had been found on tests conducted between 14 Nov 2020 and 14 Dec 2020. They found 0.4% of infections tested thus far, but only 13% of tests had been sequenced. Positive samples were found in the North Jutland Region, the Capital Region, the Zealand Region and the Region of Southern Denmark (https://www.ssi.dk/aktuelt/nyheder/2020/statens-serum-institut-udgiver-opdaterede-tal-for-den-engelske-covid-19-virusvariant in Danish).

[With Christmas holidays, the weekend decrease in reporting has started. In the past 24 hours, there has been a 29.5% decrease in the number of reported new cases and a 29.8% decrease in reported deaths. Countries not reporting today (25 Dec 2020) include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Canada (only one case was reported), Costa Rica, and Oman, among others. Other countries had marked reductions in reporting over the past 24 hours -- the USA reported 49.1% fewer cases than yesterday (24 Dec 2020), Germany 30.3% fewer cases, the UK 16.2% fewer cases, Belgium 19.6% fewer, Lebanon 21.1% fewer, Austria 35.0%, Brazil 61.0% fewer, Lithuania 29.1% fewer, Nigeria 22.7% fewer, Czech Republic 68.9% fewer, Latvia 47.6% fewer, Poland 30.8% fewer, Paraguay 41.6% fewer, ... etc.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (98 840), UK (32 725), and Russia (29 018) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8300 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Dec 2020). Noteworthy is that Peru has reported more than 1 million cumulative cases, making it the 17th country to have reported more than 1 million cases. Eight countries have reported more than 2 million cases cumulatively.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, Brazil, India, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Colombia, South Africa, Netherlands, Ukraine, and Argentina. A total of 54 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 54 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 8.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.3%. The USA is showing reduced reporting with Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Ohio, Connecticut, North Carolina, Utah, Missouri, and Minnesota, among other usual reporting units, not reporting any cases or deaths in the past 24 hours. Similar comparative averages for the USA show a decrease of 17.0% in reported cases and a decrease of 3.7% in reported deaths -- good examples of the impact of a single day major reporting decrease.

In spite of the reduced reporting, globally there have now been more than 80 million cases reported with over 1.7 million deaths reported as due to COVID-19. And given the record travel seen leading up to this holiday period, a major increase in cases will probably be seen beginning 7-14 days following the end of the holidays. - Mod.MPP]
