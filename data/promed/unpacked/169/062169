Hepatitis is taking the shape of an epidemic in most parts of Sambalpur town. Doctors have attributed the reason for spread of the disease to contaminated drinking water.

Sources said the drinking water pipeline network, which passes near some of the drains in the town, has been damaged at several places resulting in waste getting mixed with water. The contaminated water is the cause of spread of the disease, the sources added. Though the number of deaths due to hepatitis is yet to be ascertained, sources said an employee of the State Bank of India (SBI) died due to the disease a few days back in a hospital in Bhubaneswar, where he was undergoing treatment. In fact, panic has gripped the employees of SBI Main Branch after 6 clerical and 7 supervisory employees were diagnosed with hepatitis.

A cloth merchant of Sambalpur town said that 4 of his 8-member family are suffering from the disease. There are several families in his area who are afflicted with the disease, he claimed. A packaged drinking water supplier said more families are opting for packaged drinking water after the hepatitis scare. He said that recently, 8 families have joined his list of customers.

Maintaining that water purifiers cannot save people from hepatitis, Medicine Specialist Dr Kabirdas Purohit said about 30 patients are visiting him daily with complaints of hepatitis. He said people using water purifiers should instead drink boiled water.

Similar sentiments were echoed by Medicine Specialist Dr Manoj Nanda of Police Hospital. He said around 10 hepatitis patients from Police Reserve Line are visiting him daily, and their numbers are on the rise.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.

In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

Because of this, the cause of this outbreak is likely to be the other food/waterborne form of viral hepatitis, hepatitis E. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in persons aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses has been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. - Mod.LL
