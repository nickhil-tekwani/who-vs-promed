Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive. _B. anthracis_ spores in the soil.
Epidemiological comments: so far, the disease has been reported in
wild animals. To date, 92 hippopotamuses and 9 buffaloes have been
reported dead. The National Park extends into 2 administrative units,
the districts of Kasese and Bushenyi, hence the quantitative figures
have been subdivided.

Anthrax outbreaks within Queen Elizabeth National Park normally occur
during the dry season when pastures are scarce. The last outbreak of
anthrax in hippopotamuses in Uganda occurred in this park in
2004-2005; a total of 300 hippopotamuses died (10 percent mortality rate).

Currently massive sensitization of the public has been undertaken.
The dead animals are being buried in a 3-meter-deep [10 ft] pit, and
a surveillance programme has been instituted in and around the park.
Monitoring of the disease in domestic animals around the affected
areas is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Animal Disease Diagnostic and
Epidemiology Centre (national laboratory)
Tests and results

Future reporting
