New "superbug" found in hospital: the ESBL bacterium can break down
antibiotics
--------------------------------
A new "superbug" which can neutralize antibiotics and cause fatal blood
poisoning [bacteremia -Mod.LL] has been found at a Lanarkshire hospital.
The extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) superbug is reported to have
claimed the life of one patient at Hairmyres in East Kilbride, one of
Scotland's most modern hospitals, which opened in 2001.
A study by consultant microbiologist at Hairmyres, Dr Dugald Baird, found
that 41 patients contracted the bacteria -- which produce enzymes that
break down common antibiotics -- between July 2001 and April 2002.
Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has refused to confirm that a patient
had died as a result of the bacteria.
The report, published by the Scottish Centre for Infection and
Environmental Health
<http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/scieh/PDF/weekly_report.pdf>, claims it could
become the new MRSA (methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_), a
superbug because it is particularly resistant to antibiotics.
Last month, cardiac surgery at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was halted after
it emerged that 13 patients had contracted the superbug [an ESBL or MRSA? -
Mod.LL]. Dr Baird said "Initially a lot of the MRSA bacteria were not
thought to be very harmful and it may be that we are seeing a similar sort
of thing with ESBL producers [The term "superbugs" reflects the
antimicrobial resistance pattern and the organism may be about equal to or
less pathogenic than its sensitive "cousin" but not usually more virulent.
-Mod.LL]. You have to be concerned when you see bacteria mutate into
resistant strains before your eyes." [The selection of ESBL producing
strains under antimicrobial pressure can be rapid but not in minutes -
Mod.LL] Baird said the ESBL infection had definitely "contributed" to the
death of an Hairmyres patient.
A spokesman for Lanarkshire Acute hospitals NHS Trust said: "The trust
welcomes the report by Dr Baird, which has clearly identified areas for
further research that in the long term will bring benefits to patients
being treated in hospitals throughout the country. The data gathered on
ESBL isolates in Hairmyres Hospital has highlighted the problem faced by
hospitals all over the world regarding antibiotic resistant organisms."

[ESBLs are often derivatives of the parent enzymes referred to as TEM and
SHV, although lineages from other enzymes (such as OXA and CTX-M) are also
found. These enzymes hydrolyze many of the extended-spectrum penicillins
and cephalosporins, limiting the therapeutic alternatives of physicians.
Enterobacteriaceae, particularly _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, may contain these
enzymes. The organism or organisms in the cluster described above are not
identified. The observation that a newly opened health care facility in
Scotland has developed a cluster of this infection is not a surprise. The
antimicrobial pressure for selection of these resistant organisms is not
less in newer facilities, and admission or transfer of patients colonized
or infected with such bacteria acquired in another hospital is commonplace.
First described in Europe in the early 1980s, ESBL-containing Gram negative
bacilli have become a widespread problem (1) especially in western and
southern Europe. In one report of ESBL containing intensive care unit
isolates from 1996, most were from Belgium, France, Germany, Holland,
Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Turkey but some were from the UK (2).
Outbreaks, however, have occurred in Ireland (3) and the UK (4).
Control of these isolates involves the same measures as those used for MRSA
and vancomycin resistant enterococci control: (1) prudent controlled use of
antimicrobials to minimize overutilization and exceeding the required
spectrum of therapy; and (2) aggressive infection control to limit
patient-to-patient spread. The overuse of extended-spectrum cephalosporins
-- rather than that of penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations --
seems to be a selection factor for these organisms.
