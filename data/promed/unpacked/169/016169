Today [15 Oct 2008], the Mississippi State Department of Health
(MSDH) reports one case of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in Lamar County.

Jamestown Canyon virus cases are occasionally reported in
Mississippi; the most recent case was reported in 2006. Symptoms of
JCV infection vary from no symptoms to a mild fever to, in extreme
cases, encephalitis.

The Jamestown Canyon virus circulates among deer, horses, and other
wild and domestic large mammals by way of mosquito bites. It is also
transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. The virus is relatively
rare, but occasionally may be carried by several Mississippi
mosquitoes, including the tree hole mosquito, _Ochlerotatus
triseriatus_. This is the same mosquito that carries LAC, which
breeds around homes in tree holes, old cans, tires and other
artificial containers. [Laboratory experiments have shown that _O.
(Aedes) triseriatus_ , the LAC virus vector, is refractory to JCV
infection. Other _Aedes_ mosquitoes such as _A. hendersoni_ are
competent vectors. The Asian tiger mosquito, _Ae. albopictus_, which
is now present in the USA, is susceptible to both LAC and JC viruses,
and reassortment between these 2 viruses has been demonstrated in the
laboratory. - Mod.TY]

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is endemic and widely distributed in
the USA from the Rocky Mountains eastward, causing sporadic cases of
febrile disease and encephalitis in humans. As Drs. Charles Calisher
and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED archive no. 20040807.2171,
JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human
disease, and provided the following references:
