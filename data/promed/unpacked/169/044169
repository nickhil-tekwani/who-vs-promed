Virus could be 'game changer' for watermelon industry
-----------------------------------------------------
A suspected case of a virus that could decimate the Northern Territory's AUD 50 million [about USD 45 million] watermelon industry has been detected on a commercial farm south of Katherine. The virus, cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, has the potential to have major impacts on watermelon yields and fruit quality and can also affect other crops, including cucumber and squash.

Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries' Dr Andrew Tomkins said every watermelon farm in the NT was being examined to determine how widespread the problem was. "We're trying to survey all the melon farms in the NT. There are about 5 to 7 strains of the virus, so different strains can affect different hosts. We've got to clarify which strain we've got."

Dr Tomkins said that, if CGMMV was confirmed and the virus spread, it could put a big dent in production. "It can have quite a significant impact on yield. You end up with a fruit that breaks down inside, in the case of watermelons, so the 2 problems are that the yield is down and the fruit is not much good."

The NT is the country's 2nd-largest producer of watermelons, behind Queensland.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 percent. The virus has a narrow host range limited to the Cucurbitaceae. The type strain affects cucumber and occurs in Europe; a watermelon strain is reported from Japan; unspecified strains are reported from India (gourds, muskmelon), China (multiple hosts) and, recently, the US (muskmelon; ProMED-mail post 20131219.2124396). Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. They may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines and internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, in water and contaminated soil. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices, and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (including watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

If CGMMV can be confirmed, it would be important to identify the source and route of entry into Australia to prevent further incursions, and also to address the potential risk of spreading the virus with commercial seed or by discarded seed from commercial seeded fruit within the country.
