Regarding epidemiology situation for Chikungunya in Madagascar, the

As of 23 Mar 2010, the official situation in the region of Vatovavy
Fitovinany regarding chikungunya is as follows:

Average rate of suspected cases over total [medical] consultations: 45 percent

Since 15 Feb [2010], the number of suspected cases is decreasing to
reach 35 suspected cases over 326 consultations from 15 - 19 Feb 2010.

The 2 regions affected are on the East coast (Vatovavy Fitovinany and

[ProMED is very appreciative of this update from Dr. Heraud on the
chikungunya outbreak on Madagascar. It is good to learn that the
trend in incidence is declining.
