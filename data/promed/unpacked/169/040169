[As was mentioned in the epidemiological comment, "The state of Ceara is not part of the classical swine fever free [CSF] zone and the outbreak is located more than 500 kilometers [about 311 mi] away from the limits of the free zone. There are already movement restrictions of animals and their byproducts between the disease-free zone and the non-disease-free zone."

According to information available from the OIE web page (http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/classical-swine-fever/list-of-csf-free-member-countries/), Brazil is recognized as having a zone free from CSF according to the provisions of Chapter 15.2. of the Terrestrial Code (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_csf.htm):
- One zone composed of the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina as designated by the Delegate of Brazil in a document addressed to the Director General in September 2014;
- One zone covering the States of Acre, Bahia, Espirito Santo, Goias, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Sao Paulo, Sergipe, and Tocantins, Distrito Federal, and the municipalities of Guajara, Boca do Acre, South of the municipality of Canutama, and Southwest of the municipality of Labrea, in the state of Amazonas as designated by the Delegate of Brazil in a document addressed to the Director General in September 2015.
