I concur that antibiotic resistance "emergence" is less a product of rapid
evolution under selective pressure and more a product of acquisition by
genetic transfer under selection. I have two points.
1. The presence of antibiotics or related compounds in any environment,
from the soil to the farm to the human body, serve as effectors of
antibiotic resistance transfer among bacterial populations not only because
they select for recipients of such transfers, but also because these
compounds may stimulate these transfers in the first place. Examples of
both plasmids and chromosomal elements with transfer mechanisms that are
induced by low levels of antibiotic have been described.
2. Plasmids carrying resistance are the main concern, but transmissible
chromosomal elements (conjugal transposons) have also been described that
carry antibiotic resistance, mediate self-transfer and can transfer plasmids
and other chromosomal DNA that are not self-transmissible. These transfers
occur between even distantly related bacterial groups (Salyers et al.,
Microbiol. Rev. 59:579-590, 1995). We presented evidence that these
elements disseminating antibiotic resistance naturally between the normal
flora of livestock and humans, and also to human pathogens (Appl. Environ.
Microbiol. 60:3255-3260, 1994).
There is a world of gene transfer out there we little understand. I am
tempted to throw up my hands when the antibiotic resistance problem is
discussed. It is a critical issue, however, for public health. Limiting
the use of antibiotics as much as possible (to include farm use) seems a
relatively inexpensive step that can be made to slow antibiotic resistance
dissemination.

of those who have worked in countries that permit the use of avoparcin in
livestock production. Contributions would be appreciated, now that we have
revived this thread. - Mod.ES]
