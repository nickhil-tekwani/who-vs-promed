Savannah area resident bitten by rabid bat
------------------------------------------
A bat has tested positive for rabies in the Savannah area.

The Coastal Health District said the bat bit a resident on the hand. That person is receiving post-exposure rabies treatment and is expected to fully recover.

The bat's exact home location isn't known. The resident hit the bat with their car on a commute from downtown Savannah to Whitemarsh Island and was bitten when removing the bat from the car windshield.

The resident then notified the health department so the animal could be tested for rabies.

Several species of wild animals which are native to coastal Georgia -- including raccoons, foxes, and bats -- can carry rabies. Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that is primarily spread by infected animals.

Following these tips can protect you and your family from rabies:
- Avoid contact with animals you don't know.
- Make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines after 12 weeks of age, followed by a booster shot within 1 year and vaccination every 1-3 years depending on veterinary recommendation and vaccine used.
- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or by leaving pet food out at night.
- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance.
- Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone" is a good principle for children to learn.

Cat in Oneida County tests positive for rabies resulting in euthanasia of exposed animal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Five people and 6 animals were exposed to a cat testing positive for rabies in the Town of Forestport, resulting in 1 exposed animal being euthanized, the Oneida County Health Department announced Friday (7 Oct 2022).

The cat was sent to the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center for testing and positive results were reported on 5 Oct 2022, officials say.

Two people were directly exposed to the cat and have received post-exposure treatment.

Officials say 3 additional people had secondary exposure to the rabid cat and also received treatment.

A total of 6 cats and dogs were exposed to the rabid cat, officials said. One cat was unvaccinated, and as a result, had to be euthanized and tested for rabies. Those results are pending. Two other animals were not up to date with their rabies vaccines and are now in quarantine for 6 months.

The 3 other exposed animals were up to date with vaccinations and received booster doses.

Department officials are urging residents to look out for signs of rabies in animals, including strange behavior, shyness or willingness to get unusually close, and drooling or foaming at the mouth.

If an animal is displaying this behavior, department officials say your local animal control should be contacted for help.

Under NYS Public Health laws, all dogs, cats, and ferrets must be vaccinated by 4 months old with updated booster doses in the years following.

Rabid Cat Prompts NJ Health Warning, Entire 'Colony' of Feral Felines Likely Exposed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabies is spread through the bite of an affected animal and affects the central nervous system, meaning it can be fatal in humans if not treated immediately.

Health officials in New Jersey are sounding the alarm after a feral cat found in Woodbridge Township tested positive for rabies and scratched 2 people, potentially infecting them as well, authorities say.

The cat was found last Friday [7 Oct 2022] on Edward Street in the Iselin section of the township when animal control officers responded to a call about a feline acting abnormally during daylight hours. It also appeared sick.

The calico-colored critter was safely captured and taken to a forensic lab, where tests showed it was positive for rabies. Now authorities are directing their attention to an apparent "colony" of feral cats in the area which may have been exposed -- and 2 people who live on Edward Street who were scratched by the rabid animal are being monitored closely.

The state has instructed animal control officers to capture any feral cats in the Edward Street vicinity.

Rabies is usually spread through an animal bite, though human cases are rare. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle spasms, paralysis, mental confusion and other problems. If you think you've been bitten, seek immediate medical attention. Rabies affects the central nervous system and can be fatal in people without urgent treatment.

The CDC says pet vaccination and staying away from wild animals are the best preventive measures.

Any Woodbridge resident who may have seen or come into contact with any of the neighborhood cats around Edward Street is advised to call the health department. Health officials also offered these tips:
- Don't come into close contact with stray or wild animals which can spread rabies, including cats, raccoons, foxes, skunks, groundhogs, dogs or cats;
- Don't let kids play with or feed feral cats or other wildlife
- Make sure trash, garbage and recycling containers are closed tightly
- Be cautious when you see feral cats or other wild animals acting erratically. If you notice odd behavior, call the health department's animal control division.
- Make sure your pets are up to date with their vaccination. If not, take them to the vet immediately for a rabies vaccine
- If you're bitten by an animal, especially one acting abnormally, contain it if you can safely do so or get a good description, cleanse the wound and seek medical attention for yourself

Bat found in North Charleston tests positive for rabies; 2 people exposed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) says a bat found in North Charleston tested positive for rabies, and 2 people were exposed to the infected animal.

The bat was located near Sentry Circle and Royal Palm Lane, officials say. On Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], tests on the bat came back positive for the virus.

The 2 people who were exposed were referred to their healthcare providers, according to DHEC.

"Never handle a bat or any wild or stray animal, alive or dead, with your bare hands," says Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader.

Health officials say because bats have relatively small teeth, it's not always easy to tell when someone or something has been bitten.

If you believe you, someone you know, or one of your pets have come into contact with a rabid animal, you are urged to call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Charleston office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or on the after hours and on holidays line.

OC officials issue warning as 2nd rabid bat is spotted in Orange County
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Orange County Health Care Agency (OC HCA) has reported 2 bats discovered in OC this past September [2022] have tested positive for rabies. The 1st bat was discovered on 14 Sep 2022 at approximately 10:30 am in a parking lot at Pickleball Court No. 1 at the Fountain Valley Tennis Center on 16400 Brookhurst St. in Fountain Valley, Calif.

About 2 weeks after the 1st bat was found, a 2nd bat was discovered outside the main lobby of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Building on Alton Parkway in Irvine, Calif on 29 Sep 2022.

The agency urges residents to remain alert and to avoid contact to ensure everyone is unscathed. Anyone who potentially had physical contact with a bat is advised to contact the OC HCA's Communicable Disease Control Division. After exposure with a bat, it is vital to wash the area of the bite or scratch thoroughly and immediately consult a clinical or public health provider to be assessed. Post-exposure treatment involves a rabies vaccine to be administered regardless of if you've already been given one in the past.

If any pet has been exposed or bitten, owners are also urged to contact their veterinarian to determine the risk for rabies.

"Do not approach bats, wildlife, or other mammals seen exhibiting odd behavior," health officials said. "Sick bats may be seen flopping around on the ground or otherwise acting unusual. If you find a sick bat or other sick wildlife on your property, take children and pets indoors."

The OC HCA and OC Animal Care officials immediate press release advised the following in order to mitigate the spread of the infection:
* Avoid all contact with wild animals
* Vaccinate all cats and dogs against rabies
* Do not sleep with open unscreened windows or doors
* If bats are seen inside the house or other structure, close off the area and contact animal control
* Do not leave pet food outside where it will attract wild animals
* Immediately wash all animal bites with soap and water, being sure to flush the wound well, then contact your doctor
* Report all animal bites to OC Animal Care
* Report stray animals to OC Animal Care

To report a bat in your home or an animal bite, contact OC Animal Care.

The rabies virus is found in a rabid animal's saliva; direct transmission often occurs through a bite from the rabid animal. Transmission can also occur when the saliva of a rabid animal comes into contact with the eyes, mouth, abrasions or an open wound. However, this transfer is rare.

Recent studies have shown the leading cause of human rabies in the United States is exposure to rabid bats, accounting for 70% of those infected. Since bats have extremely small teeth, a bite may go unnoticed.

After countless studies on the virus, researchers cultivated once the virus is introduced into a muscle, it then moves within the nerves to the spinal cord into the brain. This is the time between the initial transmission and when symptoms begin to materialize which is known as the incubation period.

During this period of time the virus is not contagious because it resides in the brain as it multiplies rapidly. Once the brain is inflamed the virus passes on to the salivary glands to the saliva and becomes transferable.

It takes anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months to develop symptoms, but once present the disease is often fatal because of the damage caused to the brain.

"Rabies is treatable if caught before symptoms appear, so identifying anyone who has had contact with the bat as soon as possible is important," medical epidemiologist at Public Health - Seattle & King County, Elysia Gonzales said.

[Bats are notorious for having the rabies virus. Be extremely cautious of bats. They can be beneficial for insect control and some species even help pollinate plants. However, they can carry the deadly rabies virus. If you find a bat in your home, or in any place where you are sleeping, it is possible you may have been bitten in your sleep and never felt it. Report any bat encounters to the animal health authority. If you know/suspect you have been bitten, then thoroughly wash the wound and seek medical attention. Rabies post exposure prophylaxis is needed. (For more information on this please see Rabies (44): Americas (USA) fox, bat, cat, horse, human exp, vacc update: 20221007.8706005 for more information on the updated rules of post exposure vaccination.)

Please be sure your pets are vaccinated against rabies. Even indoor cats can be susceptible to rabies, if a bat should get into your home or be brought in by another pet. Rabies vaccinations for your pets not only help protect the pets, but also yourself. If your pet has not been vaccinated or the vaccination date is unknown or out of date, please visit your veterinarian and protect your pet with a rabies vaccine. - Mod.TG
