Tick season crawls onto the calendar from early spring to autumn. If you live in the Czech Republic, this is important information to know as about one out of every 10 ticks is infected with some type of the 2 commonest transmittable illnesses: Lyme disease and tickborne encephalitis [TBE].

Prevention -- wearing long sleeves and protective clothing or using tick repellant when outdoors -- and proper tick removal are important safeguards, but vaccination is becoming an increasingly common way of preventing tickborne encephalitis (a vaccine for Lyme disease is currently in development in the United States but isn't yet approved).

The tickborne encephalitis vaccine is usually administered during the winter months only; however, it can be administered year-round (although winter is recommended). Canadian Medical is now implementing a fast-track vaccination program over the summertime months. In the fast-track program, the 2nd dose is administered just 14 days after the 1st vaccine. The 3rd and final dose is given after 5-12 months.

The fast-track tick vaccine can be administered from 6 years of age but strictly upon your pediatrician's approval. Patients seeking the vaccine should only get a jab at a time when they are healthy and haven't taken antibiotics in the previous 2 weeks. Setting aside a recovery time of 48 hours after the vaccine is necessary, and a top-up vaccine is recommended after 3 years, and every 5 years after that.

From January 2022, all people over the age of 50 (who have Czech health insurance) are entitled to free vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis. The standard price for this vaccine is around CZK 800-900 [USD 33-37]. Health insurance companies reimburse varying amounts (Czech public health insurance, for instance, reimburses CZK 500 [USD 20.60] to adults over 18 and CZK 700 [USD 29] for children under 18).

Of the commonest tickborne illnesses, 2 are encephalitis and Lyme disease, also called Lyme borreliosis. A recent study by biotech firm Protean, which examined over 12 000 ticks, found that 10.27% were infected with Lyme disease, and another 2.65[%] carried the encephalitis virus.

Tick bites can cause severe health consequences. Complications from encephalitis include chronic headaches, sleeping disorders, issues with concentration and balance, depression, tremors, and paralysis of facial muscles or limbs.

While tickborne encephalitis is an infectious disease of viral origin and can be vaccinated against, Lyme disease is of bacterial origin and can only be treated with antibiotics. It is often accompanied by muscle and joint pain, headache, fatigue, or fever.

Anyone who's bitten by a tick and starts to experience flu-like symptoms within 4 days up to 2 weeks should see a doctor. Symptoms to be concerned about include fever, headache, muscle ache, fatigue, and malaise. Keep an eye on the site of the bite, and if a red area with a diameter of 3-5 cm [1.2-2 in] develops, seek immediate medical attention.

[TBE [tickborne encephalitis] and Lyme disease are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ixodes ticks.

The proportion of ticks having TBE virus and Lyme disease bacteria is given; the number of cases so far this year (2022) is not stated. TBE virus is endemic in the Czech Republic, and cases occur there annually. A 2016 ProMED post indicated that although Central and Eastern Europe countries are endemic for the European subtype of TBE virus and cases occur there yearly, cases have declined significantly in Austria and remain low in Germany, Poland, and Slovakia, while remaining high in recent years in the Czech Republic (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Czech Republic (02): background 20160210.4009410).

The World Health Organization has stated that, "approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tickborne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total."

"Immunization offers the most effective protection against tickborne encephalitis. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively [and based on European strains of the virus], and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation [and based on Far Eastern strains]. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (https://www.who.int/news/item/19-02-2020-immunization-is-the-best-protection-against-tick-borne-encephalitis)

TBE is a viral infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). - Mod.TY
