The Dutch Health ministry has called for research to investigate
whether _Coxiella burnetii_ infection (Q fever) causes premature
births in humans. The disease has spread across a third of the
Netherlands. Q fever in humans causes flu-like symptoms and can lead
to pneumonia. In some cases it leads to death. This year [2009] alone
2200 people have contracted it, most of them in the southern rural
province of Brabant, and at least 6 people have died.

To prevent further spread of the disease, goats are to be vaccinated.
Agriculture minister Gerda Verburg says, "This is not a voluntary
measure. All measures are geared towards human health. An aborted goat
is a pity for a farmer, but it is starting to affect humans." The
results of this measure will not be visible until next year [2010].
The cabinet also wants to prevent farms where animals have Q fever
from expanding. And in areas with high numbers of human Q fever cases,
ministers even want farms to be closed for a year.

In a debate in the Lower House on Wednesday [11 Nov 2009], the
minister said it is not likely that people will be vaccinated against
the disease on a large scale. He has agreed to put the vaccine forward
for registration, although he pointed out that there are unpleasant
side effects in people who have already had the disease. Christian
Democrat MP Henk Jan Ormel pointed out that in Australia 55 000 people
had been vaccinated. There, he said, the worst side effect had been
itchiness.

A publication of the University of New South Wales reported that
vaccination of high risk groups (abattoir staff, farmers) with Q-vax
resulted in a 50 percent decrease of Q fever infections in Australia
from 2002 to 2006. Precautionary, only people who did not have
antibodies against Q fever were vaccinated. The vaccination program is
funded by the Australian government.

A total of 31 Q fever studies are underway. In 2008 and 2009, 3
million euros [approx USD 4.5 million] was spent on research, the same
amount is available for more international studies in the future.
