Twin outbreaks of a mystery flu and dysentery in a remote region of
Papua New Guinea (PNG) have killed 47 people and infected another 2000
villagers, a senior medical official said on Monday [31 Aug 2009]. And
a separate eruption of cholera in the Pacific island nation has killed
7 adults and sickened 73 other people, provincial health adviser Theo
Likei told AFP [Agence France-Presse].

27 villagers in the Menyamya district of Morobe province, on the
northeast coast, have died from an as yet unidentified influenza since
3 Aug 2009, while a further 20 were felled by dysentery. "Roughly 2000
people are sick in about 12 villages, and we suspect influenza and
dysentery are the cause," Mr Likei told AFP. "So far, there have been
about 47 deaths, about 90 per cent of them in the village of Akwanda,"
where 95 per cent of the reported flu and dysentery infections were
reported.

It was not immediately known whether the flu-like illness was the
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus or a seasonal H1N1 flu strain.
The World Health Organization has taken samples from stricken
villages, and test results could be available within days, a WHO
official said. "We cannot rule out swine flu [influenza pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus] at the moment, but the outbreak is in a
remote area, [so it] would be a little surprising if it is caused by
the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus H1N1," said the WHO representative in
PNG, Eigil Sorensen. "But the number of sick and fatalities are
certainly higher than normal, so we take both of these outbreaks
seriously," he told AFP.

Papua New Guinea has reported around 10 cases of swine flu [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection], but they were traced back and appeared
to have been imported into the country, Mr Sorensen said.
