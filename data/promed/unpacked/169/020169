Warning out on elk meat sold at Boulder farmer's market
-------------------------------------------------------
High Wire Ranch bought elk from a ranch that is now under quarantine

State health officials issued a warning Wednesday [24 Dec 2008] after
learning that unsuspecting consumers bought hundreds of pounds of elk
meat this month from an animal infected with chronic wasting disease.
The elk was sold 13 Dec 2008 at a farmer's market at the Boulder
County Fairgrounds. Although research has found no risk to humans who
eat infected elk, officials at the state and Boulder County health
departments recommended that the meat not be consumed.

"There's been now 10 years-plus of research looking at whether CWD
poses a human health risk, and the evidence to date suggests it does
not," said John Pape, epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of
Health and Environment. Still, he said, the research is not
definitive.

In all, 15 animals purchased at a commercial Colorado elk ranch were
processed in early December at a USDA-licensed plant. All those
animals were tested for the disease.

Test results obtained Tuesday [23 Dec 2008] indicated that one of the
animals was infected with CWD, one of several diseases thought to be
caused by misshaped proteins that inflict damage to nerve cells in
the brain. It is a cousin to both crapie in sheep and mad cow disease.

Label information on infected elk meat:
* Seller: High Wire Ranch
* Cuts: chuck roast, arm roast, flat iron, ribeye steak, New York
steak, tenderloin, sirloin tip roast, medallions and ground meat.
* Processor: Cedaredge Processing
* USDA triangle number: 34645

For more information, contact John Pape, Colorado Department of
Health and Environment, 303-692-2628.

from the same news release document. The Rocky Mountain News version
