A total of 5 people have fallen ill with mumps at Kamaile Academy, and there are 2 additional suspect cases, prompting officials to start the school's winter break early and extend it by 5 days. Officials said winter break at the public charter school in Waianae would begin [Tue 19 Dec 2017] and continue through [16 Jan 2018]. The school said starting the winter break 2 days early and extending it by a week "will allow us to get past the 25-day incubation period" for mumps.

So far in 2017, there have been 705 confirmed cases of mumps statewide, and 19 people have suffered from complications, the state Health Department reports. The large majority of those who have fallen ill have been on Oahu. 2017's outbreak is by far the largest number of cases Hawaii has seen in decades. In all of 2016, Hawaii saw just 10 total cases of mumps.

To tackle the growing outbreak of mumps, the state is recommending more people get vaccinated, even if they've already been vaccinated before. While mumps spreads easily, it's mostly preventable with a 2-dose vaccine. However, officials say mumps cases this year have been seen in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Hawaii has seen an influx of mumps cases since March 2017, when the Health Department was made aware of 9 people with the viral infection. Some people with mumps have very mild or no symptoms. The disease is not considered life-threatening, but there are some prominent manifestations, especially the swelling of one or both salivary glands.

[Waiʻanae is a census-designated place (CDP) in Honolulu County in the USA state of Hawaii.

My colleague Mod.LK has pointed out the lack of severe symptoms vaccinated individuals experience following infection with mumps in comments in the past that "even though mumps cases occur even in fully vaccinated children and adults, the occurrence of the more severe complications is relatively rare now, evidence of some protection afforded by the vaccine." Nonetheless, this is an important point to make frequently as it further supports the MMR vaccine's effectiveness even when full protection does not occur.

One paper among others that discusses the problem of genetic variation in the SH gene of mumps virus is Echevarría JE, Castellanos A, Sanz JC, et al. Mumps Virus Genotyping: Basis and Known Circulating Genotypes. The Open Vaccine Journal, 2010, 3, 37-41 (available at: https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVACJ/TOVACJ-3-37.pdf. Although the 12 genotypes of mumps virus currently recognized by the WHO are considered to be the same serotype, lack of full cross-protection between different genotypes has been reported and has been suggested as a cause of vaccine failure. However, other reports did not find this lack of cross reaction among different genotypes.

Jeryl-Lynn and Rubini vaccine strains belong to genotype A which is genetically distant from the other genotypes. Wild strains belonging to the A genotype used to be dominant before vaccination, but nowadays most MV wild strains belong to other genotypes. The genetic distance between genotype A vaccine strains and non-A wild strains has been proposed to be a determinant factor in vaccine failure. On the other hand, non-A vaccines have been more frequently associated with post vaccination meningitis and are considered less safe. Additional studies are needed to obtain a better balance between efficiency and safety in order to establish the best future strategy for achieving optimal vaccine efficacy. Data from neutralization experiments are still unclear. Another similar paper is Gouma S, Ten Hulscher HI, Schurink-van 't Klooster TM, et al. 2016. Mumps-specific cross-neutralization by MMR vaccine-induced antibodies predicts protection against mumps virus infection. Vaccine 2016, 34(35):4166 (abstract available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27372154).

Recent mumps outbreaks have been dominated by mumps genotype G virus strains, whereas the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain of the MMR vaccine belongs to genotype A. It has been shown previously that vaccinated persons develop sufficient neutralizing antibodies against wild type mumps genotype G virus, although the neutralization capacity is lower against the wild type strain as compared with the vaccine strain. However, no correlate of protection has been defined so far that distinguishes MMR vaccinated persons with sufficient immunological protection from those who are not protected against mumps virus infection. - Mod.LL
