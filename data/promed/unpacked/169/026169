[1] Latin America: cases surging
Date: Wed 10 Jun 2020 3:31 AM ET

The outbreak is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean, prompting Dr Carissa F Etienne, the director of the Pan American Health Organization [PAHO], to warn on Tuesday [9 Jun 2020] that the unfolding crisis had "pushed our region to the limit." Cases are surging in countries that took early isolation measures -- like Peru, which is just behind Italy in its case count -- and in those that ignored recommendations, like Brazil, which has the 2nd-highest tally worldwide, behind only the United States, according to a New York Times database [available at https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html].

Forced to choose between watching citizens die of the virus or of hunger, governments are loosening lockdowns, even as they watch infections climb. "We go to bed without eating, giving nothing to our children," said [a 22-year-old mother of 2 in Medellin, Colombia's 2nd-largest city. The country has more than 40 000 confirmed cases and 1300 deaths. [This woman] and her family, like millions across Latin America, collect cardboard, glass, and plastic for a living, selling it by the kilogram. Their buyers closed during the country's lockdown, just as she gave birth to her 2nd child. President Ivan Duque of Colombia recently relaxed lockdown rules, allowing local officials to make the final call on regulations. The national caseload subsequently surged.

Some countries have also suppressed information about the virus. In Mexico, the government is not reporting hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths in Mexico City. In Brazil, which has confirmed 700 000 cases, President Jair Bolsonaro's government decided to stop reporting the cumulative toll altogether; late Monday [8 Jun 2020], a Supreme Court justice ordered the government to stop suppressing the data.

New cases reached a new single-day global high on Sunday [7 Jun 2020]: 136 000, with three-quarters in just 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia. That adds to a global case tally of more than 7 million people worldwide and more than 400 000 deaths [See WHO and Worldometer case counts in sections [2] and [3] below for the latest figures - Mod.MPP]

[It is very painful seeing the explosion of cases in Latin America. In the global updates we do daily using Worldometer data, one sees the impact with Brazil and Peru (numbers 2 and 8 respectively) in the top 10 countries in terms of cumulative case counts, adding Chile and Mexico in the 11-20th group (numbers 13 and 14 respectively). Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Mexico are in the top 10 countries in terms of newly confirmed cases in the preceding 24 hours (numbers 1, 6, 7, and 8 respectively) and Colombia as number 16 and Argentina number 17 (according to data from 9 Jun 2020). In response to the political intervention of suppression of data in Brazil, the CONASS (Council of State Secretaries of Health) came out with a statement that CONASS would publish daily case counts so that information flow would not be interrupted. The politics of health is very difficult to watch around the world. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 9 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- More than 7 million cases of COVID-19 and over 400 000 deaths have now been reported to WHO. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening. On Sunday, more than 136 000 cases were reported, the most in a single day so far. In countries seeing positive signs, the WHO Director-General warned in his media briefing yesterday [8 Jun 2020] 'the biggest threat now is complacency'.

- The WHO Regional Office for the Americas has published a guide with recommendations on measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission among indigenous populations, Afro-descendants, and other ethnic groups. The recommendations focus on promoting hygiene, social distancing, and improving access to basic health services in these communities.

- WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely: as much as possible, keep at least 1 metre [3 feet] from others, clean your hands, cover your cough, and wear a mask if you attend a protest.

- WHO has published 14 new community and risk engagement posters on parenting during the pandemic. Some of the topics that these posters cover include: learning through play, keeping calm and managing stress, keeping children safe online, family budgeting in times of financial stress, and talking about COVID-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50.4% of the global newly reported cases and 60.6% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 34.5% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 32.5%, Peru 8.7%, Chile 8.6%, and Mexico 6.4%.

The European region reported 15.4% of the global newly reported cases and 15.6% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 51.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 7.2%, Turkey 5.9%, Belarus 4.9%, and Poland 3.6%.

Pakistan reported 27.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 19.6%, Iran 11.9%, Qatar 8.0%, Egypt 7.9%, and Iraq 6.5%. Note that for the 1st time, the Eastern Mediterranean region has reported a greater proportion of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours than the European region.

The African region reported 4.7% of the global newly reported cases and 3.3% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 51.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 6.2%, South Sudan at 5.6%, Ghana at 5.3%, Central African Republic at 4.2%, and Cameroon at 3.9%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 9 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia and which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has surpassed the European region, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 316 944, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.7% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.04 million confirmed cases, now represents 28.0% of the global cases of COVID-19 as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are increasing their numbers of cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 413 627 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5002 deaths in the past 24 hours (almost twice the increase seen yesterday 8 Jun 2020).

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, the UK (surpassed Spain in the past 24 hours), Spain, India, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran is number 10. China is number 18. Argentina and Afghanistan have been accelerating from 51st and 60th to 38th and 40th place, respectively, in terms of cumulative cases since 5 May 2020 and 13 May 2020, respectively.

In terms of most daily newly confirmed cases, Brazil is number 1, followed by the USA, India, Russia, Pakistan, Peru, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and Mexico reporting the 10th-highest 24-hour newly confirmed case numbers -- the same 10 countries just a changing of place number).

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region -- unchanged in the past 48 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 10 countries with most cumulative cases include 5 from the European region, 3 from the Americas region, and 1 each from the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions. - Mod.MPP]
