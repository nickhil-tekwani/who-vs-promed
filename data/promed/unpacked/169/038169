--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Patients with monkeypox can experience serious ocular complications, which are not well described during the current outbreak.

What is added by this report?
This report describes 5 cases of ocular monkeypox identified in the United States during July-September 2022. Patients with ocular monkeypox, including those with HIV-associated immunocompromise, have experienced delays in treatment initiation, prolonged illness, hospitalization, and vision impairment.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Healthcare providers and public health practitioners should be aware that ocular monkeypox, although rare, is a sight-threatening condition. Patients with signs and symptoms compatible with ocular monkeypox should be considered for urgent ophthalmologic evaluation and treatment. Prompt notification of public health officials can help support these efforts.

[4] Spain: transmission in piecing and tattoo establishment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 19 Jul 2022, a monkeypox outbreak linked to a piercing and tattoo establishment was reported to the Andalusian Epidemiological Surveillance System in Cádiz, Spain. There were 5 individuals who were diagnosed with monkeypox and all shared an epidemiological link. All 5 individuals had a history of ear piercing performed at the same facility, on 6 Jul 2022. Herein, we describe the clinical and epidemiological investigations of the 1st reported outbreak of monkeypox in a piercing and tattoo establishment in Europe, from 19 Jul to 3 Aug 2022.

Cases were notified to the Andalusian Epidemiological Surveillance System between 19 Jul and 3 Aug 2022. Vesicular lesion specimens were collected from each suspected case. Specific real-time PCR for monkeypox virus was performed and 20 individuals were identified to have the virus.

The piercing and tattoo establishment had only one worker, the owner. She did not present any epidemiological link or clinical picture related to the infection, nor did her family, pets, and social contacts. However, she reported being in contact with a possible index case on 6 Jul 2022. This client had travelled to Madrid for a social function in the previous days and, when attending the establishment, had inflammation of the area where the piercing was placed and generalised skin lesions, which he thought to be an adverse effect of taking antibiotics. It could not be confirmed whether this client had monkeypox because the owner had no list of clients; therefore, it was not possible to identify this person during the investigation. 6 Jul 2022 was considered to be the date of outbreak onset, given that the probable index case and all individuals with confirmed infection attended the establishment from 6 Jul 2022 onwards.

A total of 54 exposed individuals were identified and the attack rate was 37%. Among the 20 individuals with confirmed infection, 13 (65%) were women and 7 (35%) were men. Median age was 26 years [IQR 16-40; range 13-45 years). There were 8 (40%) individuals who were younger than 18 years.

The predominant clinical feature was rash, found in all 20 individuals in the area of piercing or tattoo, although it also affected other locations. The most frequent 1st clinical manifestation was piercing or tattoo rash (18 [90%] individuals). Lymphadenopathy was present in 11 (55%) individuals, and the cervical location was the most frequent location (5 [45%]). Fever was present in 8 (40%) individuals. In all individuals, clinical symptoms were mild and no one required hospitalisation.

A total of 19 (95%) individuals reported a history of piercing, of whom 18 (95%) had an ear piercing. One (5%) person had a tattoo done on their forearm. None of the individuals with confirmed infection reported vaccination against smallpox, immunodeficiencies, or concurrent diseases. All 20 individuals were unaware of or reported no contact with a known case of monkeypox. 96 close contacts were identified, with no secondary cases reported.

During the official inspection of the establishment, numerous sanitary irregularities were found, such as poor hygiene and aseptic conditions.

Surface sampling was performed on 22 Jul 2022, including 3 areas: the support work surfaces, the work tables and chairs, and sharps and other work instruments. All 3 samples were positive for monkeypox virus. A 2nd sampling was performed on 17 Jul 2022, focusing on sharps and work tools. 15 (94%) of 16 samples were found to be positive for the virus, with tweezers and scissors tips having the highest viral load according to cycle threshold values.

Together, these findings suggest that monkeypox virus can be transmitted through exposure to contaminated piercing or tattoo material and, potentially through contaminated hands, due to poor aseptic measures and handling of materials.

The epidemiological curve and the finding of monkeypox virus DNA on fomites and surfaces -- more than 2 weeks after the probable index case attended the establishment -- suggest an extended infectivity period of the virus.

Of note, a rash first developed at the site of exposure, similar to what was observed for genital lesions in individuals with confirmed infection after sexual intercourse.

To minimise the risk of further transmission, we continue to actively work with the community. This outbreak highlights that exposure to monkeypox virus during piercing and tattooing is a mechanism of viral transmission.
