Another suspected human case of bird flu was reported on Wed [23 Aug 2006]
in Simalungun regency near Medan, North Sumatra, despite the government's
assurances it is doing its utmost to bring the [H5N1] virus [outbreak]
under control.
A 35-year-old woman was admitted to Adam Malik Hospital after showing
symptoms of bird flu. Simalungun is close to Karo regency where 8 people in
one family died after contracting H5N1 last May in the world's largest
cluster of cases. If [samples taken from her prove] positive, the woman may
have contracted [infection] from chickens in her neighborhood which had
died suddenly and tested positive for the disease.
Almost all of the country's 62 confirmed human cases -- including 47
deaths, the world's highest -- have been traced to contact with infected
poultry. Experts say human infection will only be brought under control
when poultry outbreaks are reduced.
Head of Simalungun Husbandry Office S. Hutauruk said the spread of the
virus in the regency was [increasing] due to its location near Karo despite
the implementation of preventative measures. "We've culled over 24 000
chickens in 13 villages. This will continue in other areas," he said.
Besides Simalungun, Dairi and Deli Serdang regencies in North Sumatra are
also widening their poultry culls after discovering infected fowl. There
have been no reports of human deaths [or cases?] from the virus in the 2
regencies.
In Cirebon regency, West Java, the local administration is dispensing
Tamiflu pills to health clinics after an outbreak in several villages in
nearby Garut regency. The regency is also tightening controls on the
traffic of poultry into and out of West Java through the establishment of a
monitoring post in Losari, located on the border of West Java with Central
Java. Samples from the poultry will be tested, [and] birds suspected of
having the disease quarantined or exterminated. The post checks up to 40
trucks of poultry each day. Each truck usually transports around 1000 birds
from Central Java areas, such as Purbalingga, Purworejo, Semarang and Solo.
The administration also is disinfecting sites known to host H5N1, such as
poultry markets and neighborhoods with large backyard chicken populations.
In Garut, inspectors continued to make their rounds of 3 villages in
Cikelet district where 2 people died of bird flu late last week. More
makeshift health posts have been built in Cikelet, Kampung Tipar, Cibalong,
Pemeungpeuk and Cimari.
There are still 4 people suspected of having bird flu in Cikelet, but they
have not been hospitalized because their condition is improving. However,
another person suspected of having bird flu was admitted to Hasan Sadikin
Hospital in Bandung.
Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono urged households to keep chicken
coops clean to prevent the spread of infection. "We have some 30 million
households keeping poultry. We've tried our best, but people must be aware
of the issue of cleanliness." Anton said he believed that public
participation would help Indonesia be free of bird flu by 2008.

[2] Database proposal
Date: Thu 24 Aug 2006

Agreement has been reached in principle to release avian influenza data.
Researchers studying avian influenza say they have agreed to share data
that were previously being kept behind closed doors -- a move they hope
will speed insights into the virus that threatens to spark a human
pandemic. Some countries and organizations have come under fire for
hoarding genetic information about the virus. The data have been kept under
wraps partly because of concerns that other groups might use them and
publish scientific findings without giving due credit to researchers involved.
Now many leading avian influenza scientists have tentatively agreed to
share data as part of an effort called the Global Initiative on Sharing
Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). A letter outlining the agreement is
published online today in Nature1 [see:
<http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060821/full/060821-10.html#B1>] , signed
by 70 scientists and health officials, including 6 Nobel laureates. The
precise details of the agreement are still being thrashed out. But, in
essence, the participants have agreed to place genetic sequences into
secure sections (which have not yet been set up) of existing online
databases, as soon as possible after producing and analysing them. The
group proposes using the International Nucleotide Sequence Database
Collaboration, a network of 3 major public databases, for the collection.
The data will at first only be accessible to scientists who have signed the
agreement, but will become open to the public after 6 months at the most.
Scientists who sign up make a promise to share their sequences. They must
also agree to collaborate with, and appropriately credit, all other
researchers in publications and intellectual-property agreements.
By storing all the sequences in a designated place and allowing more open
access, the hope is that researchers will be able to carry out comparisons
quickly of one new strain against many others from both animals and humans.
This type of analysis can reveal whether a virus is acquiring mutations as
it spreads between bird flocks, or -- should the virus start spreading
between people -- whether it is becoming resistant to drugs.
"It's a very positive development," says Peter Palese, who studies
influenza viruses at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. There are
scientist signatories from many of the countries worst hit by bird flu,
including China, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. And the Indonesian
government has thrown its support behind free access to data. But Palese
questions whether the agreement will work without full involvement from all
these countries' governments. "You need these people on board," he says.
Until now, research organizations have tended to keep their own
repositories of avian influenza sequences. Access to many sequences was
restricted to a global network of 15 flu laboratories associated with the
World Health Organisation (WHO).
Veterinary virologist Ilaria Capua at the Vialle dell'Universita in Padova,
Italy, started something of a backlash against this system in March 2006.
Instead of placing her flu sequence data in the WHO-linked,
password-protected database, she chose to enter it into the publicly
available GenBank, and called on colleagues to do the same. "When you're
facing a pandemic, you have to get your priorities straight," she says.
The idea of favouring freely available databases then started to gain
ground. Capua joined forces with well-connected Peter Bogner, who runs an
advisory group called The Bogner Organisation in Santa Monica, California.
Bogner travelled around the world talking to scientists and policymakers
about the issue. The avian flu expert group formed by the World
Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of
the United Nations, called OFFLU, subsequently endorsed the idea.
Bogner's and Capua's efforts have resulted in this GISAID agreement, which
they put together with Nancy Cox, head of the influenza division at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, and
David Lipman, director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
in Bethesda, Maryland. Some organizations have already started to share
their flu sequences more openly. Earlier this month, the Indonesian
government announced that it would share its genomic data with scientists
worldwide. The CDC revealed earlier this week that it had released the
genetic sequence of 650 flu virus genes into an open database. Capua says
that she is "really happy with the result". Perhaps, she says, the same
framework could be used to distribute data for other emerging infectious
diseases in which information must be shared quickly. "If a new SARS knocks
on our door, we have a system in place," she says.

[Ilaria Capua, of Padova, Italy, is a veterinary virologist and outspoken
advocate for the public disclosure of H5N1 sequence data. In a 9 Mar 2006
letter to ProMED-mail [20060309.0750], she wrote: "It is important to
closely monitor the occurrence of adaptive mutations and compare genetic
sequences of viruses obtained in other parts of the world. The OIE/FAO
Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at the Istituto Zooprofilattico
Sperimentale delle Venezie in Padova, Italy invites other scientists to
follow the line of conduct of Italian, UK, French, Croatian and Slovenian
veterinary virologists to deposit H5N1 sequences into public databases as
soon as they are available and expresses its gratitude to governments that
grant permission to deposit sequences.
This increased availability of information in a timely manner appears to be
the only tool available to attempt to understand the genetic implications
of interspecies transmission and mechanisms of viral evolution in a rapidly
changing scenario."
ProMED-mail is pleased to have contributed in a small way to advancement of
this aim. By a happy coincidence, Ilaria Capua and Mary Marshall were
nominated for the 2006 ProMED-mail Award for Excellence in Outbreak
Reporting on the Internet. - Mod.CP]
