EU survey on Pepino mosaic potexvirus
-------------------------------------
Following the provisions of Article 4 of Commission Decision 2000/325/EC,
official surveys on the presence of Pepino mosaic potexvirus ([PepMV EPPO
Alert List) were carried out by the 15 EU Member States from April 2000 to
January 2001. [PepMV was not detected in tomato nurseries. However,
outbreaks were reported in several tomato fruit production sites: 3 in
United Kingdom, one in Germany, and 5 in the Netherlands. The virus was
also detected in Spain near Murcia, but no details on the total number of
outbreaks or their extent was given. Several countries (France, Sweden and
United Kingdom) intercepted [PepMV on tomato fruits imported from Spain
(including Canary Islands) and the Netherlands.
Reference: European Commission, DG Health and Consumers Protection,
Brussels, 2001-03.
Commission Decision (2000/325/EC) of 11 May 2000 authorising Member States
to take measures provisionally against the introduction into, and the
spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus as regards tomato
plants, intended for planting, other than seeds.

[According to the UK's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Pepino
mosaic virus (PepMV) is highly contagious and has a significant potential
to cause damage in protected tomato production. Yield losses have not been
quantified but evidence suggests that significant crop losses are possible
if action is not taken to eliminate infection. There is also a risk to
other solanaceous crops, especially potato, but this risk has yet to be
quantified. The virus is readily spread via contaminated tools, human hands
or clothing, and by direct plant-to-plant contact. It can also be
transmitted by grafting or when taking cuttings from infected mother
plants. Limited evidence suggests that the virus replicates better at
higher temperatures. A useful URL is the following:
