Reply to ProMED-mail article on the seropositive result for _Babesia
caballi_ from a horse in Hong Kong that had been imported from Australia
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and the Hong Kong
Jockey Club have communicated on this issue. The Hong Kong Jockey Club has
advised that a further 16 blood samples collected between 13 Dec 1995 and
18 Apr 2000 from the horse that tested positive for _B. caballi_ in Hong
Kong have tested negative by IFAT and CFT for both _B. caballi_ and _B.
equi_. It would appear that the positive result obtained on one occasion
was a false positive.

It should be noted that the Moderator's comments are incorrect. Australia
is free from _B. equi_ and _B. caballi_. The piroplasmosis "problem" did
not originate in Australia. The confirmed piroplasmosis positive horse
imported into Australia from Hong Kong was in fact from South Africa, a
country in which piroplasmosis is prevalent in the horse population. This
horse was positive for _B. equi_ not _B. caballi_ (note the false positive
result referred to above was in testing for _B. caballi_). This horse has
since been destroyed whilst in quarantine and all other horses in the
import consignment have tested negative.
There is no evidence to suggest that B. equi or B. caballi occurs in
Australia.

[I sincerely apologise for this mistake. On going back over the various
postings related to this incident I found I had confused the _B. caballi_
IFAT positive horse in 20000520232908 with the _B. equi_ IFAT positive
horse identified in 20000419225225. And as shown above the positive _B.
caballi_ result is now held to be a false positive. This thread is now cut.
