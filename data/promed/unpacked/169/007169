[[Previous outbreaks in South African ostriches were diagnosed in the Western Cape, South Africa last year and in 2006. In both cases, an H5N2 serotype was reported but in this case, we have H7N1. So far, no clinical signs have been reported but it will be important to continue to monitor the occurrence and changes of this virus in the ostrich population as time goes on. - Mod. PC]

[This OIE WAHID report indicates that the HPAI outbreak was picked up during routine surveillance in a commercial ostrich farm. According to OIE reports, in 2011 the Western Cape Province reported HPAI H5N2 outbreaks: 2 outbreaks in February, 8 in March, 10 in April, 1 in May, and 10 in June.

The location of the current outbreak can be seen on the map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.
