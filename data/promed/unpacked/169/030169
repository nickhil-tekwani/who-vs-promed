A few days ago suspect cases of cowpox were notified to the National
Surveillance System in Brazil. On 6 Aug 1999, Dr. Phyllis Romijn, a
veterinarian, on a visit to a farm in the northern area of Rio de Janeiro
state, detected 10 suspect cases of cowpox.
Of 68 cows examined 14.7% were sick. They presented with skin lesions
varying from vesicles to pustules and also cicatricial (the formation of new
tissue, usually associated with wound healing or scar forming) ones. They
affected mainly their teats and udders.
After the disease in the cows the 3 milkers on the farm presented with
typical lesions on their hands.
Doctor Romijn collected samples of the cattle lesions and also serum for
identification. We do not have the results at the moment.
An outbreak of poxvirus in cows was detected in Mato Grosso do Sul, west
central Brazil, from 1997 to 1998. There was a high morbidity for the cows
and 18 human cases presented also with systemic symptoms.
The differential diagnosis of cowpox (genus _Orthopoxvirus_) includes:
1. Bovine papular stomatitis (DNA virus, genus _Parapoxviridae_ , family
_Poxviridae_);
2. Bovine herpesvirus type 2 mastitis (infection of the udder);
3. Paravaccinia (DNA virus , genus _Parapoxviridae_ , family_Poxviridae_);
4.Vaccinia
