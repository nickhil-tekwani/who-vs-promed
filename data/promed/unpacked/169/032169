Re ProMED-mail Sarcocystis, pinnipeds - Canada: (NS) gray seal 20140217.2281787
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the ProMED posting on sarcocystis and toxoplasma -- this report is very confusing. As the moderator indicates how climate change can be linked to these findings is speculative. Gray seals breed on ice in the Gulf of St Lawrence or islands such as Hay Island off Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. During winter, coyotes, feral dogs, or other terrestrial and avian carnivores will feed on seal placentas or dead or live seal pups during the breeding season (December to February). These predators may cross to Hay Island on ice, for example, bringing infective stages of _Sarcocystis_ which may account for infections in gray seals. This seems plausible given that the new species is, according to the report, related to _S. canis_ from dogs. However, the report appears to suggest that gray seals acquire _Sarcocystis_ via contact with ringed seals when gray seals enter formerly ice-covered Arctic waters where ringed seals live. In fact ringed seals are known to move southwards along the Labrador coast, occasionally reaching the Gulf of St Lawrence where gray seals occur. Given these possible hypotheses above, it is not necessary to invoke climate change.

As for _Toxoplasma gondii_ in Arctic beluga, this parasite has been reported in St Lawrence Estuary beluga as well as in pinnipeds (based on serological data) on the east coast of Canada. It is unknown how transmission to marine mammals occurs -- it may be via _T. gondii_ from domestic cats (coastal runoff or contaminated sewage) or there may be a unique marine strain with unknown life cycle. Few Inuit own domestic cats but infected Canadian lynx may be found in northern boreal forests. Migratory geese may also transport _T. gondii_ above the treeline to Arctic waters. In short, infections of _T. gondii_ in Arctic wildlife including marine mammals and in Inuit populations subsisting on country foods (wild game, often eaten raw), are not fully understood in terms of transmission.

[Many thanks to Dr Measures for shedding light on some aspects of Arctic animal ecology that are relevant for parasites such as _T. gondii_ and _Sarcocystis_.

Indeed, climate change has been invoked irresponsibly and blamed for the emergence and re-emergence of a number of diseases. I concur with Dr Measures' words of caution. I did not intend to loosely implicate climate change in these findings, but rather I wanted to make the point that, should climate change be contributing to the transmission of pathogens in the Arctic, producing scientific evidence of such cause-effect relationships would be extremely challenging. Thus, most suggestions about the involvement of climate change can only be speculative.

But the absence of evidence is not proof of absence. If Arctic ecosystems are suffering drastic changes, a cascade of interacting effects impacting the dynamics of health of wildlife and the ecology of parasites is to be expected. While the explanations offered by Dr Measures are entirely plausible, they would not explain an emergence or resurgence of parasites, should the latter be occurring. Climate change should not be sloppily invoked, but neither loosely ruled out. - Mod.PMB
