The Ministry of Health announced this Sun 7 Feb 2021 a resurgence of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a statement sent to 7SUR7.CD, the communication unit indicated that the minister of health had received a medical report of a new case of Ebola virus disease in Biena, in the territory of Butembo in North Kivu.

According to the same source, the case is a farmer, wife of an Ebola virus disease survivor. On 1 Feb 2021, she presented with typical features and went to the Biena health center, where a sample was taken, before she was admitted to Matanda hospital in Butembo. She died on 3 Feb 2021, and the Gene Xpert result came back positive, the statement said.

The health ministry says that the provincial response team is already hard at work. It will be supported by the national response team, which will visit Butembo shortly.

On 18 Nov 2020, health authorities declared the end of the 11th Ebola epidemic in Equateur in the north west of the country.

[Thank you to Roland Hubner for sending this report and background information. We also received another report https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20210207-new-ebola-case-detected-in-eastern-dr-congo from Susan Baekeland. - Mod.SH

Biena is approximately 10 km NW from Butembo. See map at: https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/COD_BM_Butembo_region_A3P_180925.pdf.

Reported here is a new fatal case of Ebola in a female, confirmed by Gene Xpert, which is disturbing since the 11th Ebola outbreak was declared ended in Equateur on 18 Nov 2020. The victim's husband is an Ebola virus disease survivor. Although she was a farmer and likely exposed to wildlife, it may not be a new transmission event from wildlife sources. Sexual transmission from male to female has been observed with Ebola. The virus is able to persist in survivors in sequestered, immune privileged sites, such as testes, important in this case, as well as eyes and central nervous system. Because viral nucleic acid was found to persist in the semen for 101 days (infectious virus up to 81 days), WHO changed its recommendation for survivors to abstain from sex for 3 months, now to 12 months. (World Health Organization. Ebola virus disease: factsheet N 103, August 2015 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/). (Excerpted from reference: Mate SE, Kugelman JR, Nyenswah TG et al. Molecular evidence of sexual transmission of Ebola virus. N Engl J Med. 2015; 373:2448-2454. 17 Dec 2015 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1509773).

There was no information provided on the date of symptom onset of the husband, which would be useful to know. It is commendable that a response team is already at work. It is critical that proper precautions be taken to prevent spread of the virus inadvertently by healthcare workers or during preparation for burial, regardless of the cause.

Also see: ProMED. Ebola update (04): long term sequelae, antibody resurgence 20210131.8151988 for a discussion of a recent Nature paper on the topic. Long term sequelae are likely due to "chronic persistent infection, [where] disease is caused by an actively replicating virus, but presumably at low level. In contrast, in latent infection, replication has ceased, although the virus remains replication competent. This distinction is important since transmission of EBOVD occurs through direct contact, and thus the presence of replicating virus, in conjunction with the virus' duration, has implications for infectivity, for instance in the case of health workers treating EBOV survivors [and sexual transmission between partners]. Specifically, when can the virus-negative EBOVD survivor be considered not to be a health risk?"

Excerpted from Forrester JV. Ebola virus and persistent chronic infection: when does replication cease? Ann Transl Med. 2018;6(Suppl 1):S39. doi:10.21037/atm.2018.09.60.]

Cases following recovery from Ebola virus disease are important to study to determine with some confidence when one can be considered non-infectious. The findings also pertain to COVID, in which long term symptoms also occur after apparent recovery from COVID. That being said, transmission following recovery from infection with both viruses appears to be a rare event. - Mod.LK
