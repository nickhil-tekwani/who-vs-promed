A goose farm in southern Taiwan's Yunlin county was found to have been contaminated by a subtype of H5 bird flu virus and 2279 birds on the farm were culled, the 68th case of poultry farm infection this year [2018], according to the Council of Agriculture (COA) on [Sun 6 May 2018].

Several geese on the farm in Yunlin's Sihu Township were confirmed as having contracted the virus, the council's Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection and Quarantine said in a press release.

The bureau has reminded the farm's operators to disinfect the area following the standard operation procedure of destroying the geese.

Officials called on all poultry farm operators to keep their birds warm and in a place with good ventilation as temperatures vary considerably between daytime and nighttime.

Farm operators should also keep their poultry from coming into contact with local wild birds and migratory birds, said the bureau.
