A nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease, LSD] outbreak in cattle was detected in Xanthi, causing great concern to farmers in the region, according to local media. The disease made its appearance a few weeks ago in the Evros region, causing more than 3500 animals to be culled, while vaccination of livestock in the region is being applied.

At the same time, the county was quarantined, while the movement of animals, meat and milk products from the area has been banned to prevent the spread of the disease. However, it has been shown that in spite of the said measures, a new outbreak has been reported in Xanthi, said local media.

The outbreak was detected on a farm in Nea Kessani leading to the slaughter of the entire infected herd while the county was kept on standstill concerning animal movement.
