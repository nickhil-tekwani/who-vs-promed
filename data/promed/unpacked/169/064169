A, Harder T, Mettenleiter TC, et al:
Pathogenicity of highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus (H5N1) in adult mute swans. EID
14(8): 1267-1270]
-------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Adult, healthy mute swans [_Cygnus olor_] [were
experimentally infected with highly pathogenic
avian influenza [HPAI] virus A/_Cygnus
cygnus_/Germany/R65/2006 subtype H5N1.
Immunologically naive birds died, whereas animals
with preexisting, naturally acquired avian
influenza virus-specific antibodies became
infected asymptomatically and shed virus. Adult
mute swans are highly susceptible, excrete virus,
and can be clinically protected by pre exposure
immunity.

Conclusion
----------
We demonstrated that few adult swans might have
the ability to survive infections with HPAI virus
(H5N1). Survivors would most likely be older
swans in good health infected with a low dosage
(such as, less than 10 000 EID50 [50 percent egg
infective dose]/animal). However, because of
viral shedding for several days without showing
severe clinical symptoms, adult mute swans could
play a key role in the spread of HPAI virus
(H5N1), a conclusion that contradicts those of
other investigators (listed).

[This paper is worth reading carefully. Their
results show that naive birds succumbed to a high
dose exposure and with maximum cloacal shedding
on Day 6; all birds in this group died or had to
be humanely euthanised 5-9 days post-inoculation
including the birds with prior titres. Naive
birds with a low dose exposure have positive
swabs until Day 10 post exposure with cloacal
swabs, and with PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
testing some extended that to Day 14. Only one
bird of the low-dose group survived until the end
of the trial (21 days DPI -- days post
inoculation) and all other swans in this group
succumbed between Days 8 and 14 DPI.

I suspect that they demonstrate why adult swans
are found dead. The question is how far can a
sick swan fly -- 'sick' is a variable term -- and
survive, if it even wished to fly while
convalescing from this infection; to appreciate
risk this should be recalculated as the
prevalence rate of infected flying swans.
Migration carries a high stress load. Obviously
some swans decide to fly, as newly arrived
infected swans have been picked up, frequently
patently ill or dead. I would reword their
conclusion as "adult mute swans might play a role
in the spread of HPAI virus." - Mod MHJ

Circumstantial evidence on the role possibly
played by mute swans in the spread of HPAI H5N1,
has been accumulating since 2005; infected (not
necessarily dead) mute swans have been detected
in a significant number of countries, including
Russia, Ukraine (Crimea), Romania, Hungary,
Greece, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Denmark, the UK (England), France, and others. In
several cases, the detection of infected
commercial poultry flocks in the vicinity of the
positive swans led to discussions about the
source of infection and route of spread.

The Italian experience, cited by the authors
above, may provide supportive field-derived
evidence to the potential role played by mute
swans. Italy reported 14, practically
simultaneous, outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 during
February-March 2006, in the southern provinces of
Calabria, Sicily, and Puglia, and (1) in Umbria.
Thirteen of the outbreaks involved (20) mute
swans, of which 16 died. One outbreak, in the
Sicilia-Siracusa cluster, involved domestic birds
(20 animals of which 1 died; further data not
given).

For the summary report, with map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_fup_0000004540_20060921_175047.pdf>.

No additional HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, in wild or
domestic birds, have been reported from Italy
since 2006, or earlier in 2005.

According to the OIE/FAO (World Organisation for
Animal Health/Food and Agriculture Organisation)
and National Reference Laboratory for Avian
Influenza, Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale
delle Venezie, Italy, phylogenetic analysis of
the isolates from 16 swans in southern Italy
revealed a very high homology to other HPAI H5N1
isolates from wild birds in Asia and Europe
(Turkey, China-Qinghai, Croatia); see Ref 1
below. The authors concluded: "Information is
lacking on the incubation period, the duration
and extent of shedding, and other aspects of
infection, which makes any forecast of the role
of these birds in avian influenza epidemiology
impossible. The greatest concern is that
infection could have spread to resident wild bird
populations, generating an endemic cycle."

This moderator is of the opinion that the current
German results contribute in narrowing the
knowledge gap indicated by the Italian team.
Possibly, the distances and duration of migrating
swan flights should be taken into consideration
on top of the other factors discussed.
