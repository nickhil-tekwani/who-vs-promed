Officials on Koh Lanta believe a sick hawksbill sea turtle was the cause of a mass poisoning that may have contributed to the death of a 61-year-old man and resulted in 43 other villagers being admitted to hospital.

"Many people in the Urak Lawoi sea gypsy village on Koh Lanta Yai fell ill with an affliction that produced symptoms similar to hand-foot-mouth disease," Koh Lanta District Chief Suriyan Narongkul told the Phuket Gazette. The villagers were admitted to Koh Lanta Hospital for suffering from sore throat, nausea, and diarrhea, he added.

A 44-year-old local villager explained to the Gazette that he found a turtle weighing 30 kilograms caught in a fishing net just offshore. "I brought it home and cut it up to share with 10 families in the village, but immediately after eating it my whole family had sore throats, like we had swallowed sand," he explained. "We all went to see the doctor at the hospital. We felt better after taking some medicine, but everyone still has a sore throat after almost a month," the villager said. His 61-year-old father-in-law suffered more than any other family member. "His symptoms were like mine, but he was also vomiting blood. We took him to Koh Lanta Hospital, but he died last Thursday [8 Nov 2012]," the man said.

District Chief Suriyan said he had ordered staff from Koh Lanta Hospital, the District Public Health Office and the Koh Lanta District Fisheries Office to investigate the cause of the mass poisoning. "The villagers are feeling better now and 61-year-old man died in part from coexisting diseases, not necessarily from eating the turtle," he said.

"The villagers ate a hawksbill sea turtle, which is a protected species, but they didn't know that," Chief Suriyan explained. "In this case, we believe the turtle ate toxic plankton or toxic jellyfish before it was caught in the net and then taken home and eaten by the villagers," he added.

"We told the villagers that the turtle is a protected species," said Chief Suriyan. "If anyone finds a rare sea animal, they can report it to the Koh Lanta District Office," he added.

[Episodes of sea turtle poisoning can be found in the literature. An example of one episode was posted in the Sea Turtle List-serve (http://lists.ufl.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0101&L=CTURTLE&P=R14884) by a marine conservation officer in the Solomon Islands:

"28 people (20 children and 8 adults) of Niniveh Village in Marovo Lagoon, western province, Solomon Islands suffered nausea, vomiting, abdominal pains, needles and pins, and general weakness after eating turtle meat (which turtle species is yet to be confirmed) on the evening of 16 Jan 2001. The symptoms described occurred 4-6 hours after consumption of turtle meat. The said people consumed only turtle meat (no other protein source consumed). Those who did not consume turtle meat did not experience the symptoms.

6 people (all children between 3 months-11 years old) out of the 28 people died within 5 days. Observers reported that the turtle, when caught, was weak; upon being butchered, it was reported to have gut contents smaller than usual; there was a strong smell of urea/urine in the gut, and the meat was unusually soft."

Other citations include (both from Madagascar):
Yasumoto T: Fish poisoning due to toxins of microalgal origin in the Pacific. Toxicon 1998; 36(11): 1515-18: "From the meat of a turtle, _Chelonia mydas_, implicated in fatal intoxication, lyngbyatoxin A was identified. . . As turtles feed on sea grass, contaminating blue-green algae belonging to genus _Lyngbya_ were deduced to be the source of the toxin."

Abstract
--------
In December 1994, a mass food poisoning through ingestion of turtle affected about 60 persons on the northeastern coast of Madagascar. The prevailing clinical signs were digestive (nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, acute stomatitis) and might persist during several weeks. The poisoning attack rate was 48 percent with a lethality of 7.7 percent. Such [an] accident, even if rare in Madagascar, requires a structured organization to control sea products poisoning and to set up adequate prevention measures.

Turtle poisoning (chelonitoxication) appears to be caused by eating the flesh of certain marine turtles (green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle). Turtle meat is considered a delicacy in many countries. Hawksbills carry a toxin in their skin called chelonitoxin, which may be accumulated through the food chain as noted above. People who eat the skin and/or meat of the turtle can experience nausea, a burning sensation of the lips tongue and mouth, difficulty in swallowing and a tightness in the chest, skin rash, enlargement of the liver, or even coma and death. - Mod.LL]
