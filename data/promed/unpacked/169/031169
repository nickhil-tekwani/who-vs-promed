A sheep and beef farm near Cheviot [Hurunui district] in north Canterbury has been confirmed infected with the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_.

It is the 1st time the disease has been detected in the region, and brings the total number of farms infected throughout the country to 36.

Late last year [2017] the disease was discovered on a lifestyle block in Rangiora, north of Christchurch, but that is considered in Canterbury, whereas the new detection is in a new, separate region.

Biosecurity New Zealand, the new unit within the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said in a statement the mixed sheep and beef farm near Cheviot was under movement controls restricting the movement of any risk goods, including animals, on or off the property.

"The farm was identified through the tracing of animals from known infected farms. It is connected to other infected properties through animal movements."

_M. bovis_ response Incident Controller Catherine Duthie said the discovery of new infected properties was not because the disease was spreading off infected farms. "All the infected farms we know about are in quarantine lock down and no movements of risk goods, including animals, are allowed off them.

"Rather, the new finds are the result of our tracing uncovering historical movements of animals and then confirming the infection through testing. These movements, in many cases, took place before we even knew _M. bovis_ was in the country."

It was "very possible" that more infected farms would be found.

[The number of infected premises seems to be expanding. While it may be from trace outs, one has to wonder how long the disease was present before being detected and thus, resulting in the large number of trace outs. We applaud the diligence of the industry to continue the tracings. We wish them luck. - Mod.TG

The report doesn't specifically mention if the sheep on the premise also tested positive, or were presumed to be so as the result of the on-going cattle trace back testing. Any additional information on whether additional species on the sites are also being tested as part of the trace back would be appreciated since sheep can be infected with _Mycoplasma bovis_. Quarantine of all animals on a positive site as was done in this case is clearly indicated. - Mod.JH
