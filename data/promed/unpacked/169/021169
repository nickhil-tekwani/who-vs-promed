Nebraska is experiencing an increase in the number of deer testing
positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), as well as a wider
distribution, according to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.
There were a record 51 positives in 2010.

CWD is a disease that can affect deer and elk and is always fatal to
the affected animal. Humans have never been known to contract CWD.

There were 3645 lymph node samples collected from deer harvested
during the November [2010] firearm season. The 51 positives were the
most in Nebraska in one year.

The counties with the highest number of positives were: Sioux, 11;
Sheridan, 7; Dawes, 6; Garden, 6; Box Butte, 4; Scotts Bluff, 4; and
Morrill, 3. There were 2 positives each in Banner and Hitchcock
counties and 1 each in Hooker, Keith, Lincoln, Loup, Cherry, and Hall
counties. The counties in which CWD was found for the 1st time are:
Hitchcock, Hooker, Lincoln, and Loup.

No elk tested positive for CWD in 2010.

[According to the CWD-Alliance
(<http://www.cwd-info.org/index.php/fuseaction/recommendations.gmu>),
CWD has been in Nebraska in Deer Management Units Upper Platte,
Plains, Pine Ridge, Sandhills, and Buffalo within the counties of
Arthur, Banner, Box Butte, Cherry, Cheyenne, Dawes, Deuel, Hall,
Kimball, Morrill, Scotts Bluff, Sheridan, and Sioux.

This update indicates that Hitchcock, Hooker, Lincoln, and Loup are
new areas. So this represents and expansion of the disease in this
state.

What the article does not tell us is how many of these hunter killed
surveillance animals were nearby to any captive cervid facilities. -
