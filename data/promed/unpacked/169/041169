Utah to Test for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------
This summer, for the first time, mosquito abatement districts statewide, in
conjunction with the Utah Health Department and the State Health
Laboratory, will test mosquito-bitten chickens for West Nile virus. In a
proactive move, abatement officers will take blood samples from caged and
bitten chickens throughout the summer. These will be sent on to health
department officials for testing. "We don't feel that the virus is here
yet, but we are concerned about it," said Davis County Mosquito Abatement
manager Gary Hatch. "The potential that it will make it to Utah is
definitely there."
For years, abatement districts have tested cooped chickens, strategically
placed in mosquito-filled marshes, for encephalitis viruses. Encephalitis
is dangerous to humans, causing fever, weakness, confusion and sometimes
coma, and has been detected in Uintah County chickens during past years.
"If [West Nile virus does come [to Utah we will be ready to minimize the
potential for transmission to occur," said Hatch, who heads Utah's
encephalitis surveillance program. This summer 21 caged chicken flocks will
be monitored. Even if workers do find infected chickens, that doesn't
necessarily augur a Utah outbreak. "In areas where mosquitoes do carry the
virus, very few mosquitoes - much less than 1 percent - are infected," the
CDC reports. "If the mosquito is infected, less than 1 percent of people
who get bitten and become infected will get severely ill."

West Nile Virus, Mosquitoes and Waste Lagoons
---------------------------------------------
The North Carolina State University Medical and Veterinary Entomology
website carries a review entitled "West Nile Virus, Mosquitoes and Waste
Lagoons", by Mike Stringham, Extension Specialist, and Wes Watson,
Veterinary Entomologist. This can be accessed at:
<http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/ent/notes/Urban/wnv-lagoon.htm>
The review discusses the history of West Nile virus in the USA, the nature
of West Nile virus, and assesses the seriousness of the problem.
