A strange and serious disease of pigeons is sweeping through the
suburb of Hawiye, northern Taif Mndhu, [region of Makkah, Saudi
Arabia] during the past 2 weeks, according to one pigeon enthusiast.

The mysterious disease infects the eye, which swells and a few days
later this develops into an abscess by the eye. This disease is not
known and has not responded to his treatment. One of the
veterinarians confirmed he did not know the name of the disease.

The sample was taken from the diseased birds and was sent to the
laboratory to see if the disease could be identified and treated, as
there was no medicine for this. Sick birds are isolated in order to
avoid spreading the disease to other birds.

The veterinarian said that the lack of precautions in spraying
pesticides cause animal diseases. An insecticide spray called (5.0
percent) Sharper powder or substance known to be 15 percent
effective) had been used. [He explained] that when used breeding
birds must be kept away for at least half a day. Humans should stay
well away from any spray.

[The disease, quite possibly, caused by the bacterium _Mycoplasma
gallisepticum_, is tenacious. Usually, when a disease kills much of a
population, it tends to peter out because the population thins out
and infected animals die before they can pass the organism along. The
disease was unusual because it has persisted for so long.

_Mycoplasma_ has caused similar eye type lesions in song birds,
finches, and other birds in the US. The condition in Saudi Arabia
sounds similar. I do not know if it is related to the insecticide or not.

The only "sharper" insecticide that would loosely fit the description
of being only 15 percent effective is diatomaceous earth, because the
crystals have sharp edges. However, it would be very unusual for this
product to cause a swelling around the eye, unless the powder
actually got in the eye and set up some sort of irritation in the
conjunctiva of the eye, producing the swelling.

Diatomaceous earth (DE) is generally regarded as being very safe
around humans and children but perhaps not so safe if you are an ant
or other relatively soft body crawling through the sharp edges of the
DE. I have not known it to be used as a spray but I suppose one could
suspend the particles and spray them.

Some of the birds should be caught and swabs taken of the abscess and
submitted for culture, microscopic exam, and even for PCR. A good
diagnostic work up may reveal the supposed association with an
insecticide is only a coincidence.

If someone can shed some further light on this situation it would be
appreciated. - Mod.TG]
