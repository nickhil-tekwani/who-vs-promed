The discovery of a root disease on the western side of South
Australia's Eyre Peninsula is threatening to cut crop yields by up to
50 percent. Rhizoctonia root rot is a root shrivelling disease, which
occurs in low to medium rainfall areas where the soil is less fertile.
Agronomist Neil Cordon says because of cold weather the disease can be
clearly seen in early sown crops. "Obviously if the season keeps going
and if we get good rainfall you can get some compensatory growth from
the plants surrounding the rhizoctonia bare patches and that can limit
the yield loss, but some of the paddocks could [suffer] as high as 50
percent yield loss this year [2007]," he said.

Farmers on South Australia's western Eyre Peninsula are facing a
serious blow as they try to recover from the drought with a crop
disease, which could wipe out up to half their yields. Rhizoctonia
root rot, which causes roots to shrivel and reduces nutrient intake,
is taking hold in a region from Streaky Bay to Elliston.
Neil Cordon from the Minnipa Agriculture Centre says it is a difficult
problem to tackle. "Quite frankly we have not seen a silver bullet to
control it ... it is soil borne, it's a fungus that survives in the
soil ... over the years we've used some agronomic techniques to reduce
the likelihood of getting rhizoctonia," he said.
"Farmers have tried all those techniques and it's not uncommon to come
across farmers through the area that have tried this or do that as
part of their agronomic package and still get hit."

[The affected crop is likely to be mainly wheat. Rhizoctonia root rot
or bare patch is caused by _Rhizoctonia solani_ (current name
_Thanatephorus cucumeris_) and is a severe disease of cereals in
no-till cropping systems on many calcareous sandy soils of South
Australia. It has a wide host range making it difficult to control by
rotation, and it can also survive on roots of pasture grasses. The
practice of herbicides replacing the plough to improve soil
properties and prevent degradation has been widely adopted in
Australia. However, the resulting build-up of organic matter favours
the pathogen and it has become a serious problem associated with
direct-drilled cropping practices.
Disease management practices may include seed treatment, fertiliser
placement, timing of planting, resistant varieties, weed management
during non-crop periods, and selection of the style of seed drill.
_T. cucumeris_ (_R. solani_) is a ubiquitous soilborne fungus, which
causes damping-off, root rot, basal stem root (foot rot), and fruit
rot in a large number of crops. It survives in soil, compost, and
infected debris as mycelium. Many strains can infect wheat, one of
which causes the bare patch syndrome.
