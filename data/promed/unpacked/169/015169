All health centres in the N.W.T. [Northwest Territories, Canada] have been alerted to an outbreak of bacteria [Group A streptococci] that can cause scarlet fever. Wanda White, manager for N.W.T.’s Health Protection Unit, says strep throat is common at this time of year. "If it’s left untreated, it releases a toxin and it’s the toxin that goes throughout the body that causes that red, kind of sandpaper rash that you can see, like almost a sunburn but it feels rough,” she said. “And if you see that, that is a sure sign that your child, and usually it’s in children, has a strep throat that’s now going into what we call scarlet fever.”

More than 100 cases of the infection have been reported in Yellowknife [a city in the Northwest Territories]. Before antibiotics were introduced in the 1950s, scarlet fever was the leading cause of death among children.

“All the messages you usually hear, it’s about viruses,” she said. “If your child has a virus and they’re not as sick, keep them home, keep them hydrated and it will go away. Strep is very different. We want you to go to the doctor or nurse, get it diagnosed and get treated,” White added.

The bacteria are extremely contagious but treatable with antibiotics. If treated immediately, strep throat will not progress to scarlet fever, which can affect the heart, kidneys and other parts of the body. Anyone with symptoms of a sore throat, fever, and vomiting is being advised to see a doctor.

[_Streptococcus pyogenes_, also called Group A streptococci (GAS), are aerobic Gram-positive organisms that form chains and are important causes of pharyngitis and soft tissue infections. Scarlet fever is caused by strains of GAS that produce an erythrogenic exotoxin, which causes the red rash that is characteristic of the illness. Although scarlet fever usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, it may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or even the skin lesions of chicken pox. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 per cent.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is caused strains of GAS that produce one or more exotoxins that that act as superantigens. Superantigens are molecules that interact with the T-cell receptor in a domain outside of the antigen recognition site. Superantigens are thus able to activate large numbers of T cells resulting in massive cytokine release that consequently causes shock and multiorgan failure.
Tissue invasiveness of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive infection.

The city of Yellowknife, with over 100 cases of scarlet fever and a population of 18,700 (in 2006), has an incidence rate of over 535 cases per 100 000, although the time-line over which the cases are occurring is not given. For comparison, the annual incidence rates of scarlet fever reported for England and Wales in the years 1999-2009 is about 4 per 100 000 (http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1251473364307).

People who have GAS sore throat or skin infections are most likely to spread the infection; those who carry the bacteria but have no symptoms are less contagious (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm). Transmission of all types of GAS infection can be reduced by good handwashing, especially after coughing and sneezing and before preparing foods or eating. Early recognition and treatment of GAS infection is essential to prevent its spread to others.

Persons with GAS infection should stay home from work, school, or daycare until 24 hours after taking an antibiotic, at which time they should no longer be contagious. Treatment of scarlet fever, with antibiotics such as oral penicillin, cephalosporins, erythromycin, or clindamycin for 10 days, or one intramuscular dose of penicillin G benzathine, is no different than that of GAS pharyngitis,

The Northwest Territories, a federal territory located in northern Canada, borders Canada's two other territories, Yukon to the west and Nunavut to the east, and three provinces: British Columbia to the southwest, and Alberta and Saskatchewan to the south (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories). Yellowknife is the capital and largest city of the Northwest Territories (NWT) and is located on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, approximately 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowknife).
