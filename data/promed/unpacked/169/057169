Bangladesh: Nipah Virus Infection May Have Been Contracted from Fruit Juice
--------------------------------------------------
Nipah virus has returned to Bangladesh for the 4th successive year,
claiming at least 12 lives and infecting a further 32 people since it
was 1st reported on 10 Jan 2005.
According to Bangladesh's Department of Disease Control, the latest
outbreak began in Tangail district, north of Dhaka, where 13 people
developed a fever and became unconscious after drinking the juice of
local palm fruits. Researchers from the Dhaka-based Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) suspected Nipah
virus because last year's outbreak was caused by contact with fruit
bats, which carry the virus and can transmit it to people. The team
thinks the juice was made from fruit contaminated by fruit bat
droppings, or from fruit the bats had half-eaten.
The researchers sent samples of patients' blood to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, United States, which
confirmed Nipah virus infection in one of them. Bangladesh does not
have adequate research facilities for diagnosing the virus or working
on ways of controlling it. One constraint is that there are no
laboratories in which the virus can be studied safely, without a risk
of it escaping and infecting more people.
The IEDCR, however, is trying to find out how the outbreak began.
Although the researchers suspect fruit bats are the main carriers of
Nipah virus, they are also collecting samples of blood, tissue and
droppings from other species including cats, dogs, poultry, cattle
and rodents to see whether the virus has other hosts. By sampling
fruit trees, they hope to determine whether the virus can be
transmitted through contact with fruit touched by the bats. Mahmudur
Rahman, lead researcher and director of the IEDCR, told SciDev.Net
that climate might also play a role in patterns of outbreaks, as each
of the previous outbreaks also occurred in winter.
Strong evidence of human-to-human transmission of Nipah virus was
found for the 1st time during 2004's outbreak, according to research
published in the Health and Science Bulletin of the Dhaka-based
Centre for Health and Population Research. Because of this threat,
the Directorate of Health Services has advised healthcare officials
to wear masks and gloves when treating patients suspected of having
Nipah, and the public has been warned to avoid close contact with
infected people.
Symptoms of Nipah virus infection are similar to those of influenza,
such as fever and muscle pain. In some cases, inflammation of the
brain occurs, leading to disorientation or coma. Around half of the
symptomatic cases are fatal. Rahman thinks there could be a
connection between a recent increase in Bangladesh of cases of
encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and Nipah or a Nipah-like
virus. "We need extensive research on encephalitis," he says.
There is no cure for Nipah, but a vaccine is in development.
According to Bangladesh's Directorate of Health Services, Nipah virus
has infected a total of 211 people and killed 59 of them since 2001,
when the virus was 1st detected in the Bangladesh. The only
previously reported outbreaks of Nipah occurred in Malaysia and
Singapore between September 1998 and May 1999.

[The continuing investigation, together with the observation that
Nipah virus was detected in only one of the samples sent to the CDC
in Atlanta, suggests that doubt remains about the reservoir of Nipah
virus infection in Bangladesh and the circumstances surrounding its
transmission to humans. - Mod.CP]
