I would like to bring to your attention our latest research regarding white nose syndrome in North American bats providing new evidence that the causative agent of the disease is an introduced species originating from Europe (Leopardi et al. 2015, Current Biology).

A fungus that is wiping out millions of North America's bat population originated in Europe and probably spread to the USA and Canada through human activity such as migration and agriculture. That's according to new genetic research from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in partnership with the University of Greifswald and University College Dublin, which is to be published in the academic journal Current Biology.

White nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that was first found in North American bats in 2006. Since then it is estimated that it has killed more than 5 million of the animals across large parts of North Eastern America and Canada. The disease is named after the white fungus, _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ (Pd) [formerly known as _Geomyces destructans_], which infects the muzzle, ears, and wings of hibernating bats. The fungus has spread rapidly across the region with mass mortality up to 99 percent, with no treatment or practical way of halting the disease. Scientists and conservationists suspect that the origins of the Pd began in Europe and were brought to North America through human activity. This latest research provides new evidence yet that this is the case.

The joint study investigated Pd's origins on a molecular level. This allowed the researchers to evaluate the genetic similarity of European and American Pd and assess whether Europe was a likely source for the recent introduction of the pathogen to North America. It found a higher diversity of Pd within the European population of bats versus North America, demonstrating a long term presence in Europe, and strongly supporting the introduction of the fungus to the eastern region of the USA from Europe.

The RVC's Stefania Leopardi, one of the researchers on the project, said: "Given there is no bat migrating between North America and Europe, it is very likely that the fungus has been introduced to North America via anthropogenic activities. The introduction of new pathogens into native populations represents the undesired consequence of globalisation and the unprecedented movement of humans, animals and other things such as agriculture materials or ballast water."

Pd does not have the same mass mortality effect on European bats as it does in North America. Indeed, native European bats seem to have a resistance resulting from coevolution with the fungal pathogen. This was another key factor in suggesting Europe was the origin of the Pd fungus. "Demonstrating the European origin of the North America population of Pd is a 1st important step in better understanding factors underlying the emergence of this devastating disease. Our study paves the way for future research to uncover the exact site of origin in Europe, information that would likely shed light into the exact nature of the human activity responsible for the introduction" said Dr Sebastien Puechmaille, University of Greifswald, Germany and senior author of this paper.

Not only is WNS having a devastating effect on the bat population there is also wider consequences for the entire ecosystem of the region. Ms Leopardi added: "Hibernating bats in North America are mostly insectivorous and have fundamental roles in insect control, pest control and plant pollination. WNS might then disrupt a fragile equilibrium with ecological consequences well beyond the loss of a single species."

This paper was published in Current Biology on 16 Mar 2015.

[Previous research has shown that _Pseudogymnoascus destructans_ on bats throughout Europe did not differ from the North American Pd at 2 molecular markers (PLoS ONE, 5: e13853; Emerg Infect Dis. 16: 290-3; Emerg Infect Dis 16: 1237-42; PLoS ONE 6: e19167), suggesting an European origin or a holarctic distribution with a recent mutation/change in pathogenicity of North American strains. Later, experimental evidence supported the recent introduction of the pathogen to North America from Europe ('Novel pathogen hypothesis'), as exposure of North American bats to European and North American Pd ruled out a possible mutation or environmentally driven change that rendered the fungus more pathogenic.

This new research, published at http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215000792, provides important detailed genetic data showing that the fungus has been in Europe for a very long time, existing asdseveral haplotypes, whereas only one haplotype was found in North America. This haplotype introduced into North America is present in Germany and France, suggesting Western Europe as the most likely origin for North American Pd. - Mod.PMB]
