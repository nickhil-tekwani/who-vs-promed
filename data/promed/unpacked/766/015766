First Confirmed West Nile virus-infected Bird in Pennsylvania
-------------------------------------------------------------
HARRISBURG: Secretary of Health Robert S. Zimmerman Jr. today confirmed
that the first case of West Nile virus infection in Pennsylvania in 2001
has been found in a crow in Philadelphia. Since 1 Jan 2001, the Health
department has tested 211 birds and this is the first to test positive. In
addition to the birds, Pennsylvania has tested more than 5000 mosquito
pools and all those tests have been negative.
The finding is not unexpected. West Nile virus was identified in
Pennsylvania last year and has already been found in mosquitoes and birds
in several states including New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Virginia and
Ohio. [West Nile virus has been recorded also in the District of Columbia,
Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. - Mod.CP. A human
case has been identified in Florida.
Zimmerman said that: "No person has tested positive for West Nile virus in
Pennsylvania, nor [have any mosquitoes. This is not unexpected and should
remind Pennsylvanians to take steps in their own backyards to reduce
mosquito breeding areas by removing standing water. Mosquitoes breed in
standing water. Even a small bucket that has stagnant water in it for 7
days can become home to up to 1000 mosquitoes. People can take their normal
summertime precautions to prevent insect bites, such as wearing
long-sleeved shirts and long pants; and consider the use of insect repellent."
Last year, West Nile virus was found in 19 counties: Bucks; Bradford;
Chester; Cumberland; Dauphin; Delaware; Erie; Franklin; Lehigh; Montgomery;
Northampton; Philadelphia; Pike; Schuylkill; Susquehanna; Tioga; Union;
Wyoming; and York. West Nile virus was identified in 32 birds, 45 mosquito
pools and a horse.
