[2] Dengue and dementia

Tory P. Johnson Ph.D., H. Benjamin Larman Ph.D., Myounga Hwa Lee Ph.D. Stephen S. Whitehead Ph.D., Jeffrey Kowalak Ph.D., Camilo Toro M.D., et al. Chronic dengue virus encephalitis in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features.

Abstract
Objective
To determine the underlying etiology in a patient with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal signs and chronic inflammation referred to the National Institutes of Health Undiagnosed Diseases Program.

Methods
Extensive investigations included metabolic profile, autoantibody panel, infectious etiologies, genetic screening, whole exome sequencing and the phage display assay, VirScan, for viral immune responses. An etiological diagnosis was established post-mortem.

Results
Using VirScan, enrichment of dengue viral antibodies was detected in cerebrospinal fluid as compared to serum. No virus was detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid, but post-mortem analysis confirmed dengue virus in the brain by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Dengue virus was also detectable by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing from brain biopsy tissue collected 33 months ante-mortem, confirming a chronic infection despite a robust immune response directed against the virus. Immuno-profiling and whole exome sequencing of the patient did not reveal any immunodeficiency and sequencing of the virus demonstrated wild-type dengue virus in the central nervous system.

Interpretation
Dengue virus is the most common arbovirus worldwide and represents a significant public health concern. Infections with dengue virus are usually self-limiting and chronic dengue infections have not been previously reported. Our findings suggest that dengue virus infections may persist in the central nervous system and should be considered in patients with progressive dementia with extrapyramidal features in endemic regions or with relevant travel history. Further, this work highlights the utility of comprehensive antibody profiling assays to aid in the diagnosis of encephalitis of unknown etiologies.

Ninad Mehta1, Bastien Perrais1, Kimberly Martin1, Anil Kumar2, Tom C. Hobman2,3, Mary Noreen, et al. A Direct from Blood/Plasma Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for Dengue Virus Detection in Point-of-Care Settings.

Abstract
Infection with dengue virus (DENV) is widespread across tropical regions and can result in severe disease. Early diagnosis is important both for patient management and to differentiate infections that present with similar symptoms, such as malaria, chikungunya, and Zika. Rapid diagnostic tests that are used presently for point-of-care detection of DENV antigens lack the sensitivity of molecular diagnostics that detect viral RNA. However, no molecular diagnostic test for DENV is available for use in field settings. In this study, we developed and validated a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of DENV adapted for use in field settings. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed directly from plasma samples without RNA extraction. The assay detected all 4 serotypes of DENV spiked into blood or plasma. Our RT-PCR does not cross-react with pathogens that cause symptoms that overlap with dengue infection. The test performed equally well in a conventional laboratory qPCR instrument and a small, low-cost portable instrument that can be used in a field setting. The lower limit of detection for the assay was 1-104 genome copy equivalents/mL in blood. Finally, we validated our test using 126 archived patient samples. The sensitivity of our RT-PCR was 76.7% (95% CI: 65.8-87.9%) on the conventional instrument, and 78.3% (95% CI: 65.8-87.9%) on the field instrument, when compared with the RealStar Dengue RT-PCR Kit 2.0. The molecular test described here is user-friendly, low-cost, and can be used in regions with limited laboratory capabilities.

[A point of care test that can provide a result in 2 hours with 78% sensitivity and no cross-reactivity would be a valuable diagnostic tool in outbreaks where other virus pathogens in addition to dengue virus are circulating. One hopes that field testing of the system will take place soon in countries where dengue virus is circulating. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
In an attempt to control the mosquito-borne diseases yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya, and Zika fevers, a strain of transgenically modified _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes containing a dominant lethal gene has been developed by a commercial company, Oxitec Ltd. If lethality is complete, releasing this strain should only reduce population size and not affect the genetics of the target populations. Approximately 450 thousand males of this strain were released each week for 27 months in Jacobina, Bahia, Brazil. We genotyped the release strain and the target Jacobina population before releases began for over 21 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genetic sampling from the target population 6, 12, and 27-30 months after releases commenced provides clear evidence that portions of the transgenic strain genome have been incorporated into the target population. Evidently, rare viable hybrid offspring between the release strain and the Jacobina population are sufficiently robust to be able to reproduce in nature. The release strain was developed using a strain originally from Cuba, then outcrossed to a Mexican population. Thus, Jacobina _Ae. aegypti_ are now a mix of 3 populations. It is unclear how this may affect disease transmission or affect other efforts to control these dangerous vectors. These results highlight the importance of having in place a genetic monitoring program during such releases to detect un-anticipated outcomes.

Xin-Ni Lim, Chao Shan, Jan K. Marzinek, Hongping Dong, Thiam Seng Ng, Justin S. G. Ooi, et al. Molecular basis of dengue virus serotype 2 morphological switch from 29 C to 37 C.

Abstract
The ability of DENV2 to display different morphologies (hence different antigenic properties) complicates vaccine and therapeutics development. Previous studies showed most strains of laboratory adapted DENV2 particles changed from smooth to "bumpy" surfaced morphology when the temperature is switched from 29 C at 37 C. Here we identified 5 envelope (E) protein residues different between 2 alternative passage history DENV2 NGC strains exhibiting smooth or bumpy surface morphologies. Several mutations performed on the smooth DENV2 infectious clone destabilized the surface, as observed by cryoEM. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated how chemically subtle substitution at various positions destabilized dimeric interactions between E proteins. In contrast, 3 out of 4 DENV2 clinical isolates showed a smooth surface morphology at 37 C, and only at high fever temperature (40 C) did they become "bumpy." These results imply vaccines should contain particles representing both morphologies. For prophylactic and therapeutic treatments, this study also informs on which types of antibodies should be used at different stages of an infection, i.e., those that bind to monomeric E proteins on the bumpy surface or across multiple E proteins on the smooth surfaced virus.

Author Summary
DENV2 particles have been shown to change their morphologies (compact smooth to loose bumpy surfaced) when temperature is switched from 28 C to 37 C. We used 2 DENV2 viruses both belonging to the same strain designation but with a different passage history, one of which exhibited the smooth surfaced morphology, while the other was bumpy surfaced, observed by cryoEM. We mutated residues in the E protein of the DENV2 infectious clone that has the smooth surfaced morphology to determine if any could result in a bumpy morphology. Results showed several different mutations could lead to this change. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we showed how these mutations likely destabilize the E protein dimeric interactions. We investigated whether the bumpy morphology also occurs in DENV2 clinical isolates, and showed that these viruses can exhibit both morphologies, indicating that vaccine and therapeutics development should target both virus forms.

Abstract
Since the 1st isolation of dengue virus (DENV) in 1943, 4 types have been identified. Global phenomena such as urbanization and international travel are key factors in facilitating the spread of dengue. Documenting the type-specific record of DENV spread has important implications for understanding patterns in dengue hyperendemicity and disease severity as well as vaccine design and deployment strategies. Existing studies have examined the spread of DENV types at regional or local scales or described phylogeographic relationships within a single type. Here we summarize the global distribution of confirmed instances of each DENV type from 1943 to 2013 in a series of global maps. These show the worldwide expansion of the types, the expansion of disease hyperendemicity, and the establishment of an increasingly important infectious disease of global public health significance.

Yibin Zhu, Liangqin Tong, Kaixiao Nie, Itsanun Wiwatanaratanabutr, Peng Sun, Qingqing Li, et al. Host serum iron modulates dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes.

Abstract
A blood meal is the primary route through which mosquitoes acquire an arbovirus infection. Blood components or their metabolites may regulate the susceptibility of mosquitoes to arboviruses. Here we report that serum iron in human blood influences dengue virus acquisition by mosquitoes. Dengue virus acquisition by _Aedes aegypti_ was inversely correlated with the iron concentration in serum from human donors. In a mouse-mosquito acquisition model, iron supplementation reduced dengue virus prevalence and viral load, whereas neutralization of serum iron facilitated dengue virus infection in _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes. Of note, mosquitoes feeding on iron-deficient (sideropenic) mice exhibited a higher prevalence of dengue virus. Reversal of the sideropenic status of hosts largely reduced dengue virus acquisition and infection by mosquitoes. Serum iron, rather than haem-bound iron, was utilized by the mosquito iron metabolism pathway to boost the activity of reactive oxygen species in the gut epithelium, subsequently inhibiting infection by dengue virus. On the basis of these results, a status of iron deficiency in the human population might contribute to the vectorial permissiveness to dengue virus, thereby facilitating its spread by mosquitoes.

Abstract
Background
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, was designated a World Health Organization top 10 threat to global health in 2019.

Methods
We present primary efficacy data from part 1 of an ongoing phase 3 randomized trial of a tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TAK-003) in regions of Asia and Latin America in which the disease is endemic. Healthy children and adolescents 4 to 16 years of age were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio (stratified according to age category and region) to receive 2 doses of vaccine or placebo 3 months apart. Participants presenting with febrile illness were tested for virologically confirmed dengue by serotype-specific reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The primary end point was overall vaccine efficacy in preventing virologically confirmed dengue caused by any dengue virus serotype.

Results
Of the 20 071 participants who were given at least one dose of vaccine or placebo (safety population), 19 021 (94.8%) received both injections and were included in the per-protocol analysis. The overall vaccine efficacy in the safety population was 80.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.2 to 85.3; 78 cases per 13 380 [0.5 per 100 person-years] in the vaccine group vs. 199 cases per 6687 [2.5 per 100 person-years] in the placebo group). In the per-protocol analyses, vaccine efficacy was 80.2% (95% CI, 73.3 to 85.3; 61 cases of virologically confirmed dengue in the vaccine group vs. 149 cases in the placebo group), with 95.4% efficacy against dengue leading to hospitalization (95% CI, 88.4 to 98.2; 5 hospitalizations in the vaccine group vs. 53 hospitalizations in the placebo group). Planned exploratory analyses involving the 27.7% of the per-protocol population that was seronegative at baseline showed vaccine efficacy of 74.9% (95% CI, 57.0 to 85.4; 20 cases of virologically confirmed dengue in the vaccine group vs. 39 cases in the placebo group). Efficacy trends varied according to serotype. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the vaccine group and placebo group (3.1% and 3.8%, respectively).

Conclusions
TAK-003 was efficacious against symptomatic dengue in countries in which the disease is endemic.

[A 6 Nov 2019 overview of the development and testing of this vaccine reported in Science follows (Communicated by Mary Marshall <mjm2020@googlemail.com>):
"In participants who had confirmed dengue infections, the vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization by 95.4%. "The results are very encouraging," says Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust biomedical charity in London, who is a dengue researcher.

"The new vaccine's strong protection against serotype 2 is no surprise, says In-Kyu Yoon, a dengue vaccine specialist in Bethesda, Maryland, who is a senior adviser to the International Vaccine Institute and who served on a neutral advisory board for Takeda. That's because the "backbone" of the vaccine is a harmless version of dengue virus serotype 2. A few genes from the other 3 serotypes have been put into the virus to create the "tetravalent" vaccine.

Farrar stresses that the clinical trial must be evaluated for a longer period to better assess the vaccine's safety and durability. Farrar co-chaired a working group that advised the World Health Organization about its recommendations for the problematic earlier dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, which is made by Sanofi. It took 3 years for clinical trials to reveal convincing evidence of serious problems with Dengvaxia, and Farrar notes that many complex variables make it difficult to sort out vaccine-induced immunity from protection provided by a natural infection with the virus. Takeda's trial plans to follow vaccinees for 4.5 years after their last shots.

Unlike Sanofi's efficacy trials of Dengvaxia, Takeda assessed, prevaccination, whether participants in its study had antibodies from a previous dengue infection. About one in 4 participants were seronegative, and although no obvious signs of vaccine-induced harm occurred, the NEJM paper notes the overall vaccine efficacy in this group dropped to 74.9%. What's more, the vaccine offered no dengue protection against serotype 3 to these people for unknown reasons.

Yoon says regulators and public health officials have the difficult task of weighing the risks and benefits of any dengue vaccine against an increasing global burden of disease. 'What's the likelihood of a perfect vaccine?' Yoon asks. 'Clearly the Takeda vaccine is not going to be perfect. But the question is: Are the data sufficient to favor using it? It's not a straightforward question. And it's influenced by the Sanofi experience.'"

[9] Sexual transmission
Date: Thu 7 Nov 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
< http://outbreaknewstoday.com/dengue-sexual-transmission-reported-in-madrid-45857/amp/?__twitter_impression=true>


A young man in Madrid, Spain has been diagnosed with dengue fever contacted via sexual transmission, one of the 1st cases of sexual transmission of dengue in the world, according to an El Pais report (computer translated).

The Raman y Cajal Hospital in Madrid diagnosed the dengue case in the man who had unprotected sex with another man who had recently been in Cuba and the Caribbean.

The virus was confirmed by the Carlos III Health Institute National Center for Microbiology.

This is one of the 1st sexually confirmed [dengue virus] infections in the world, as there are only references in the scientific literature of another similar case in South Korea.

"The patient arrived with a high fever, cutaneous erythema and intense pain," explains Santiago Moreno, head of the infectious diseases department at Raman y Cajal. The clinical suspicion was confirmed by the microbiology service of the Madrid hospital and opened new questions about the origin of the infection. The absence of trips to endemic areas added the fact that the tiger mosquito -- _Aedes albopictus_ -- is not found in the Madrid municipality, which does live in areas of Spain such as the Mediterranean coast, where it has acted as a vector in other locally acquired cases. The patient had not recently visited these areas. The dengue incubation period is usually between 4-10 days.

The General Directorate of Public Health of the Community of Madrid also participated in the investigation, which carried out entomological inspections that ruled out "the presence of the tiger mosquito either in the residence or in any of the places in the Madrid municipality visited by the 2 cases," according to a spokesman.

Genetic tests have shown that "the virus strain found in the samples taken from the 2 patients is identical and coincides with the one currently circulating in Cuba," according to epidemiologist Susana Jimanez and biologist Andras Irisio.
