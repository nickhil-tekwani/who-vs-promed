Response to Previous Comments
-----------------------------
Dr. Mark Buller's comments have intrigued me enough to systematically
review a decade of vaccinia immunizations (about 1000) that I have given in
my clinic. From the beginning I used an entry form that can specifically
answer the question of durability of immunity to vaccinia vaccine based on
"re-challenging" the individual with the vaccine. The form religiously
recorded the demographic data of the vaccinee, the history (and their age)
of previous immunization, the presence of a validating scar, the number of
sticks given, the type of reaction (primary, vaccinoid, or immune) noted at
7 days, any complications, the lot number, the vaccinator, and all dates to
determine time intervals between the previous immunization and the current
immunization.
It is because of this systematic method used from the beginning in my
clinic that I could confidently state some personal observations with the
other members of ProMED-mail. I will attempt to publish the findings as
soon as possible.

Published Information on Immunity after Smallpox Vaccination
----------------------------------------------------------
In their book "Smallpox Cholera" (Abaccus press, Tunbridge Wells, Kent,
1977 ) Tudor and Strati give the following information, which is relevant
to the issue of the protective effect of vaccination over the years (p.
151): "In terms of the interval elapsing after the primary vaccination the
risk of smallpox is:
(i) 1:1000 after 1 year;
(ii) 1:200 after 3 years;
(iii) 1:8 after 10 years;
(iv) 1:2 after 20 years."
They also mention that: "Although the risk of contracting the disease is
fairly good the mortality rate is very small even after many years ...
Emergency re-vaccination on the outbreak of an epidemic, in a community
vaccinated many years before is far more efficient...". And on p. 154: "
When the danger of infection increases, vaccination must be extended to
groups of the population which are usually exempt from vaccination, and
must be carried out under the protection of specific immunoglobulin or drugs."
In the book "The Eradication of Smallpox from India" of Basu, Jezek & Ward,
WHO Regional Publications South-East Asia Series No.5, New Delhi, 1979, p.
111, [it is stated that: "The rates of Post Vaccination Encephalitis
ranged between 0.16 to 1.47 per 10 000 000 vaccinations."
In Christie's "Infectious Diseases Epidemiology and Clinical Practice,"
Williams & Wilkinson ed., Baltimore, 1969 p.222, [it is stated that: "For
at least 10 years there is complete protection against death, and
substantial protection against attack..."

Smallpox
--------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) for
Fri 2 Nov 2001 contains a detailed resume of current knowledge relating to
smallpox and smallpox vaccination. The subject headings are: Forms of the
Disease, Clinical Features, Infectivity, Transmission, Treatment,
Management of an Outbreak, Infection Control in Health Care Facilities,
Vaccines, Duration of Protection following Vaccination, Complications of
Vaccination, Contraindications, About the Virus, WHO Instructions for
Vaccine Administration using the Bifurcated Needle, More on Complications
of Vaccination.
Under the heading "Duration of protection following vaccination" (p. 341),
there is the following information: "Vaccination usually prevents smallpox
infection for at least 10 years. If symptoms appear, they are milder and
mortality is less in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated persons. Even when
immunity has waned, vaccinated persons shed less virus and are less likely
to transmit the disease."
