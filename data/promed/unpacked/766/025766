Hepatitis A Outbreak Associated with Green Onions at a Restaurant --
Monaca, Pennsylvania, 2003
------------------------
The Pennsylvania Department of Health and CDC are investigating an outbreak
of hepatitis A outbreak among patrons of a restaurant (Restaurant A) in
Monaca, Pennsylvania. As of 20 Nov 2003, approximately 555 persons with
hepatitis A have been identified, including at least 13 Restaurant A food
service workers and 75 residents of 6 other states who dined at Restaurant
A. 3 persons have died. Preliminary sequence analysis of a 340-nucleotide
region of viral RNA obtained from 3 patrons who had hepatitis A indicated
that all 3 virus sequences were identical. Preliminary analysis of a
case-control study implicated green onions as the source of the outbreak.
Among 207 persons with hepatitis A who were interviewed and who ate at
Restaurant A only once during the 2-6 weeks (i.e., the typical incubation
period for hepatitis A) before illness, dates of illness onset were between
14 Oct and 12 Nov. These 207 patrons reported eating food prepared in
Restaurant A during 14 Sep-17 Oct; a total of 181 (87 percent) persons
reported eating at Restaurant A during 3-6 Oct [see Figure at above given
weblink]. All infected Restaurant A food service workers became ill after
26 Oct, suggesting that a food service worker could not have been the
source of the outbreak. However, during late October--early November, these
ill food service workers were working in Restaurant A when they could have
been infectious. For this reason, immune globulin has been provided to
approximately 9000 persons who ate food from Restaurant A during this time
or had exposures to ill persons involved in the outbreak. The restaurant
has been closed.
A case-control study was conducted to identify menu item(s) or
ingredient(s) associated with illness. A case-patient was defined as a
person who had illness onset during 14 Oct-12 Nov, had laboratory
confirmation of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (i.e., positive IgM
anti-HAV), reported eating food prepared at Restaurant A during 3-6 Oct,
and had eaten only once at Restaurant A during the 2-6 weeks before illness
onset.
Controls included persons without hepatitis A who either had dined with
case-patients at Restaurant A or were identified through credit card
receipts as having dined at Restaurant A during 3-6 Oct. Controls with a
previous history of hepatitis A, hepatitis A vaccination, or receipt of
immune globulin within 2 weeks after eating Restaurant A food were
excluded. Enrolled case-patients and controls were asked about Restaurant A
food that they had eaten.
The median age of the 181 case-patients in the study was 34 years (range:
4-73 years), and that of the 83 controls was 28 years (range: 2--81,
p>0.05). Of 133 menu items, only chili con queso and mild salsa were
associated significantly with illness. Mild salsa was eaten by 94 percent
of case-patients, compared with 39 percent of controls (odds ratio [OR] =
24.2; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 11.4--51.4). Chili con queso
was eaten by 15 percent of case-patients, compared with 3 percent of
controls (OR = 5.2, 95 percent CI = 1.5--17.8). Both menu items associated
with illness contained uncooked or minimally heated fresh green onions.
Among 11 case-patients who reported not eating mild salsa, seven ate at
least one of the other 52 menu items that contained green onions. Of 103
ingredients used at the restaurant, 12 were associated with illness in a
univariate analysis. Of these, 10 had been consumed by <50 percent of
case-patients. Eating a menu item containing green onions was reported by
98 percent of case-patients, compared with 69 percent of controls (OR =
20.2, 95 percent CI = 6.8--59.9). Eating a menu item containing white
onions also was associated with illness. However, among the 176
case-patients who reported eating white onions, 174 (99 percent) also ate
green onions. Among the 4 case-patients and 28 controls who reported not
eating green onions, white onions were not associated with illness (OR =
2.5, 95 percent 0.3--20.9).
During interviews conducted at Restaurant A, food service workers described
green onion storage, washing, and preparation practices. Green onions were
shipped in 8.5-lb. boxes containing multiple small bundles (6-8 green
onions per bundle). Each box was unpacked, and bundles were stored upright
(root side down) and refrigerated in a bucket with ice included in the
shipment. Green onions were stored >5 days before processing, which
consisted of rinsing intact onion bundles, cutting the roots off, and
removing the rubber bands. Green onions from each box were chopped by
machine to yield approximately 8 qts. Chopped green onions were
refrigerated for approximately 2 days.
Periodically (i.e., every 1-3 days), salsas were prepared in batches of
40-80 qts. Mild salsa included chopped fresh green onions; hot salsa did
not. Salsas were refrigerated in 8-quart containers with a shelf life of 3
days. Mild and hot salsa were ladled into bowls and provided free with
tortilla chips upon seating at Restaurant A.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), CDC, and the state health
departments are investigating the source of the green onions associated
with this outbreak and how they became contaminated with HAV. Preliminary
traceback information indicates that green onions supplied to Restaurant A
were grown in Mexico.
MMWR Editorial Note:
This report describes a large hepatitis A outbreak associated with eating a
food item containing green onions at a single restaurant. The majority of
ill patrons interviewed as of 21 Nov 2003 were exposed during a 3-day
period in early October. No ill food service worker identified could have
been the source of the outbreak. The green onions likely were contaminated
with HAV in the distribution system or during growing, harvest, packing, or
cooling. Traceback investigations completed to date have determined that
the green onion source is one or more farms in Mexico.
Both green onions and white onions were associated with illness in the
univariate analysis. However, white onions were not associated with illness
among those who did not eat green onions. This association with white
onions observed in the univariate analysis might not remain when
multivariate modeling is completed. Restaurant A purchases previously
chopped white onions and adds them to several menu items, including hot and
mild salsa. Mild salsa, which contains both green onions and white onions,
was associated with illness; however, hot salsa, which contains only white
onions, was not associated with illness.
The genetic sequence of the outbreak strain is very similar to viral
sequences obtained from persons involved in hepatitis A outbreaks in
Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina during September 2003 that were
linked epidemiologically to green onions. These sequences also were
identical or very similar to sequences observed among persons with
hepatitis A living along the United States-Mexico border and travelers
returning from Mexico, consistent with a source in Mexico (CDC, unpublished
data, 2003). Raw green onions from 3 firms in Mexico have been implicated
in the Tennessee and Georgia outbreaks. FDA is still reviewing records to
determine whether additional firms are involved. The Mexican government is
assisting with the traceback investigation in Mexico and the investigation
to determine the source of the contamination.
Previous hepatitis A outbreaks linked to green onions have been reported
and have involved patrons of a single restaurant (1). However, the outbreak
at Restaurant A was unusually large. Several characteristics of the way
food was prepared and served in Restaurant A could have contributed to the
outbreak's size, including 1) multiple opportunities for intermingling of
uncontaminated and contaminated green onions in a common bucket for 5 days
with the ice in which they were shipped and 2) serving contaminated items
with a relatively long shelf life (e.g., mild salsa) to a large proportion
of patrons over several days.
HAV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Green onions require extensive
handling during harvesting and preparation for packing. Contamination of
green onions could occur 1) by contact with HAV-infected workers,
especially children, working in the field during harvesting and preparation
and 2) by contact with HAV-contaminated water during irrigation, rinsing,
processing, cooling, and icing of the product. Green onions and other
selected produce items (e.g., strawberries [2]) might be more vulnerable to
contamination because plant surfaces are particularly complex or adherent
to viral or fecal particles. Outbreaks of other enteric pathogens linked to
green onions have been reported (3).
On November 15, FDA issued an alert to consumers about the recent hepatitis
A outbreaks associated with green onions (available at
<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/ANSWERS/2003/ANS01262.html>). FDA advised
consumers concerned about the possibility of getting hepatitis A from green
onions to cook green onions thoroughly before eating and to ask about use
of green onions in prepared foods. Unless directed otherwise by public
health officials, persons who have recently eaten green onions do not need
postexposure prophylaxis (i.e., immune globulin).
CDC is working with state health departments to identify other hepatitis A
outbreaks associated with green onions. As of 21 Nov 2003, no other
hepatitis A outbreaks have been identified. To identify other cases related
to these outbreaks, state and local health officials should interview
persons with hepatitis A with onset after 1 Oct 2003. Persons without
typical risk factors for hepatitis A (4) should be asked about food and
restaurant exposures during their incubation period. Because molecular
epidemiologic techniques have been useful for identifying related cases of
foodborne hepatitis A in previous outbreaks (2), health departments might
consider obtaining serum specimens for cases of interest.
An increasing proportion of reported foodborne outbreaks have been linked
to fresh produce (3). This increase might be attributed to increased
consumption of fresh produce or better surveillance techniques. HAV
contamination of fresh produce can be reduced by using approaches such as
the application of Good Agricultural Practices/Good Manufacturing Practices
recommended by FDA (5) Recommended control measures include providing
sanitary facilities for field workers, ensuring appropriate water quality,
use of properly treated manure or biosolids, and ensuring worker health.
Reducing HAV transmission in areas where produce is grown and discouraging
the presence of children in areas where food is harvested also will reduce
opportunities for HAV contamination. Further investigation of this and
other hepatitis A outbreaks linked to green onions, including observation
of cultivation and harvesting practices, can guide additional specific
critical control measures.
