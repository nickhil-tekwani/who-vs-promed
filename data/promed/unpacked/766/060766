Varroosis of honey bees, Mauritius
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 3 Dec 2014 from Dr Deodass Meenowa, Principal Agricultural Officer(Veterinary Services), Division of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, Reduit, Mauritius

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 12 Aug 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 12 Aug 2014
Report date: 3 Dec 2014
Date submitted to OIE: 3 Dec 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: _Varroa destructor_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory
This event pertains to whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Pointe aux Sables, Black River, Mauritius
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 Aug 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Bees (hives) / 3000 / 88 / 88 / 52 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Bees (hives) / 2.93 / 2.93 / 100 / 4.67
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals; illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: This is the 1st record of this quarantine pest in honey bees in Mauritius. The adults observed show deformed wings. It is regarded as an external parasite that reproduces in honey bee colonies. Infestation eventually leads to death of colonies. 353 bee colonies found in the buffer zone have been treated with mite control products as of 9 Sep 2014. Treatment of bee colonies in the buffer zone and elimination of all bee colonies in the affected regions are being pursued.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); dipping/spraying; no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (tau-fluvalinate and thymol gel)

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Entomology Laboratory, Reduit (national laboratory) / bees / parasitological examination / 12 Aug 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Varroa mites are parasites of adult bees and their brood. Four species have been recorded: _Varroa jacobsoni_, _V. destructor_, _V. underwoodi_ and _V. rinderi_. Until recently, varroa mites that affect _Apis mellifera_ worldwide were assumed to be _V. jacobsoni_. However it has been shown that these mites are _V. destructor_.

They are responsible for the condition of varroosis or varroatosis. The mite inserts itself between the abdominal sclera in adult bees where it penetrates the intersegmental membranes in order to ingest haemolymph. Sometimes it can also be found between the head and thorax. For reproduction, the female enters the cells with the bee brood shortly before the cells are sealed.

The course of this parasitism is usually lethal, except in some areas, such as tropical Latin America. The life span of mites on larval or adult bees depends on temperature and humidity. Under practical conditions, the life span may vary from days to a few months. In heavily infested bee colonies, clinical signs of varroosis can often 1st be seen in the latter part of the season when the brood is reduced. Heavy infestations are usually reached 3-4 years after the primary invasion, but can occur within weeks if infested by bees from nearby colonies that are collapsing.

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.2.7 "Varroosis of honey bees" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.07_VARROOSIS.pdf.

According to a recent OIE press release on bee issues, the OIE launched a new OIE thematic publication entitled "Bee health and veterinarians:"

"Preserving the health of bees, both in the wild and in apiaries, is now a crucial health issue and one that the OIE includes among its priorities. Any loss of these key pollinators, which help to ensure plentiful crops throughout the world, would be a biological, agricultural, environmental and economic disaster.

"Increasing bee mortality is a growing concern worldwide. It has multiple causes, including factors such as environmental influences, irresponsible use of pesticides, emergence of new pathogens and harmful practices in world trade in bees and bee products.

"Public and private sector veterinarians have a growing role to play in protecting the health of bees, whatever the reasons for their deteriorating health status. Veterinarians, along with the other stakeholders in the beekeeping sector, are responsible for supporting and helping to implement measures and activities aimed at improving bee health. This new OIE publication provides the key to understanding the distribution of responsibilities within the beekeeping sector and gives veterinarians and all the other stakeholders in the sector an update on essential information for the prevention and control of bee diseases."
