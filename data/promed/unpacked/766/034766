----------------------------------------------------------------------
We all know what we need to do to control rabies, but it is not straightforward to vaccinate all the dogs in a region in the Himalayas. The Sikkim (an Indian state adjacent to Nepal) AntiRabies and Animal Health Program is a successful ABC-AR [Animal Birth Control and Anti-Rabies] program but it has taken a lot of work by a dedicated local team with financial support from Fondation Brigitte Bardot and veterinary support from Australian NGO Vets Beyond Borders.

Remote villages may be only accessible on foot; there is often initial community resistance; dog culling is still sometimes proposed as an alternate solution. A rapid veterinary response to suspect rabies cases is needed, which means that there must be good communication between medical/forestry/police and veterinary units and there must be commitment from the Department of Animal Health.

Fortunately the Sikkim Government has shown the vision to support an anti-rabies program but not all governments will do so or have the local staff able to drive such a program. It is very unfortunate that a young boy died from rabies in Nepal especially given that it is a 100 percent preventable disease, but eradicating rabies is not as simple as it should be.

[Helen has a sound point, though I would disagree with her over dog culling -- we have posted a number of commentaries by Merritt Clifton that dog culling is counter-productive and alienates village dog-owners. Dog anti-rabies vaccination takes dedication, planning, and sound record keeping. And just because we veterinarians know what we should be doing does not necessarily mean that our target population is equally well informed. Effective public communication and suitable alerting is needed to get their participation, that is, have the dogs ready to be vaccinated and minimise the numbers of loose dogs needing to be caught. Yes, it can be a challenge but each year more countries report success. - Mod.MHJ
