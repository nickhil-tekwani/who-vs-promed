With regards to the testing of alpacas, there is no test for bovine TB that has been validated in this species, and thus any test performed is subject to issues with false results.

[According to the recommendations of OIE's ad-hoc group on diseases of camelids (May 2010), bovine tuberculosis in New World camelids has been listed in Group II ("diseases for which camelids are potential pathogen carriers") of the bacterial camel diseases. The report included the following comments regarding diagnosis: "Tuberculin testing does not work; serological tests should be developed."

According to OIE's Manual (chapter 2.4.7 "Bovine tuberculosis," B. Diagnostic techniques, 3. Blood-based laboratory tests, c. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), "a lateral flow-based rapid test (TB StatPak) has been shown to be useful for detecting tuberculous animals, particularly in some domestic animals, wildlife, and zoo animals, such as South American camelids, badgers, nonhuman primates, or elephants where no cellular immunity tests like the gamma-interferon tests are available and where skin testing has been proven unreliable. This test is now licensed in the USA by the USDA for species such as elephants and nonhuman primates and is approved for use in the United Kingdom for badgers."

In February 2015, OIE's Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases held its periodic semi-annual meeting in Paris. Discussing the report of the Working Group on Wildlife dated 4-6 Nov 2014, the commission "reviewed and endorsed the report of the Working Group and took with appreciation note of the recommendations made by the group in respect of the tuberculosis diagnostic test for New World camelids."

Information on the said recommendations will be useful.

Subscribers may consider reading the following 2012 paper on the validation of a serological test for tuberculosis in alpacas: Rhodes Sh, Holder T, Cliford D, Dexter I et al. Evaluation of Gamma Interferon and Antibody Tuberculosis Tests in Alpacas. Clinical and Vaccine Immunology Vol 19 No 10 p. 1677-1683; available on line at http://cvi.asm.org/content/19/10/1677.full.pdf+html.

OIE added in its International Code a specific Chapter 11.6. "Bovine tuberculosis of farmed cervidae." Would a similar approach vis-a-vis tuberculosis in camelids be considered in view of the increased international trade in these animals and situations such as the one demonstrated in the current event? - Mod.AS
