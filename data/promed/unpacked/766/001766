First Report of Raspberry bushy dwarf virus on Red Raspberry and Grapevine
in Slovenia.

Slovenia, Hacquetova 17, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia; and I. Zezlina, KGZ

87:1148, 2003; published on-line as D-2003- 0701-01N, 2003. Accepted for
publication 9 Jun 2003.
In 2002, severe vein yellowing and partial or complete yellowing of leaves
was observed on some shoots of red raspberry (_Rubus idaeus_) cvs. Golden
Bliss and Autumn Bliss. Sap of infected plants of cv. Golden Bliss was
inoculated onto _Chenopodium quinoa_ and _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Faint
chlorotic spots were observed on inoculated leaves of _C. quinoa_
approximately 14 days after inoculation but no systemic symptoms appeared.
No symptoms were observed on _N. benthamiana_.
Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) was detected in the original raspberry
plant using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(DAS-ELISA) with polyclonal antiserum (Loewe Biochemica, Sauerlach,
Germany). Systemic infections of inoculated _C. quinoa_ and _N.
benthaminana_ were confirmed using DAS-ELISA. In 2001 and 2002, unusual
virus symptoms were observed on grapevine grafts (_Vitis vinifera_) of cv.
Laski Rizling. Symptoms appeared as curved line patterns and yellowing of
the leaves. No nepoviruses were found in symptomatic plants, but RBDV was
confirmed using DAS-ELISA.
RBDV infection was later confirmed in grapevine cv. Stajerska Belina with
similar symptoms. RBDV was transmitted mechanically from grapevine to _C.
quinoa_, where it was detected by immunocapture-reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR). IC-RT-PCR was used to
amplify a part of the coat protein gene of the virus from raspberry and
grapevine, and the amplification products were sequenced (1).
The obtained sequence shared at least 93 percent nucleotide sequence
identity with other known RBDV sequences, which confirmed the serological
results.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the natural occurrence of
RBDV in grapevine and also of RBDV infection of red raspberry in Slovenia.

[This is the first report of RBDV in grapevine. At the recent tree
fruit/small fruit virus meetings in Valencia, Spain, Irena Mavric apprised
Bob Martin (USDA-ARS-HCRL, Corvallis, OR) that RBDV RNA was sequenced
directly from extracts of infected grapevines. Moreover, use of RBDV
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) provided by Martin showed that the grapevines
tested positive with each of 3 RBDV MAbs. RBDV-inoculated _C. quinoa_
expressed symptoms similar to those of RBDV in grapevine, and a correlation
was obtained between disease symptoms and a positive test result for the
presence of RBDV in one cultivar. The known means of RBDV transmission are
by mechanical inoculation, grafting, infected seed (up to 77 percent),
possibly by pollen to the pollinated plant, or by pollen to the seed.
I sincerely thank Irena Mavric and Bob Martin for sharing their research
results. - Mod.DH]
