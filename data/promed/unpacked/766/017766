Have antimicrobial-resistance profiles been determined for any of these
_Salmonella_ isolates from wild birds?

[I have heard back from the bacteriologist. Although not performed on all
the avian isolates, they were performed on some and on the feline isolates
also. Antimicrobial-resistance profiles were identical for all isolates
(susceptible to all, including ampicillin, cetiofur, chloramphenicol,
enrofloxacin, gentamycin, neomycin, spectinomycin, tetracycline and TMS)
except for one avian isolate which had limited susceptibility to
spectinomycin.
