Vets are reminding Canterbury dog owners to get their pets vaccinated against parvovirus as the Selwyn district records its 1st case in a nationwide outbreak.

The Selwyn Veterinary Centre at Rolleston has reported a confirmed case of the potentially fatal disease in 1 of its canine patients. Veterinarian YH said the dog was "not doing well at present."

The SPCA recently reported Auckland was experiencing its worst outbreak in 20 years.

Some vet clinics were seeing up to 20 cases a day, while cases had also popped up in Christchurch, Wellington and Northland.

Howell urged pet owners to check with their vets if their dogs were fully vaccinated. "Puppies should not be taken for walks until fully vaccinated," Howell said. "Unfortunately with parvo, the mortality rate is really high."

On its Facebook page, the centre issued locations of interest the sick dog had visited. These were the Rolleston Dog Park on (8 Feb 2022), and around the Burnham Military Camp.

An SPCA spokesperson said last week its inspectorate was aware of just 1 case in Selwyn.

BARK Kennels and Cattery manager Kristy Wood said it was concerning to have a case in the district.

The facility at Rolleston, registered for 240 dogs, would be extra vigilant to ensure clients' pets were up to date with vaccinations.

The New Zealand Veterinary Association said the highly transmissible viral disease affects the gastrointestinal tract. Dogs caught it directly by contacting faeces containing the virus, as well as indirectly by coming into contact with contaminated objects such as food and water bowls or footwear.

Early signs of lethargy, lack of appetite and fever typically occurred within 5-to-7 days of being exposed, usually progressing quickly to vomiting, diarrhoea and dehydration.

Six-week to 6-month-old puppies unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated were most at risk.

[Parvovirus ("parvo") is a serious canine disease. Clinical signs of the virus in dogs, especially puppies, include severe, bloody diarrhea, lethargy (laying around, no apparent energy, or interest in activities), anorexia (not eating), fever, vomiting, weight loss, weakness, depression, and dehydration.

In the majority of cases, untreated dogs contracting parvovirus will die. Treatment relies on replacing lost body fluids and correcting disturbed electrolyte balance. Both the severity of the challenge and the timing of when treatment is started will affect the outcome. Treatment usually involves intensive care for several days in the veterinary hospital and can be very expensive.

Vaccinating your dog is the best way to prevent canine parvovirus infection.

Parvovirus is a preventable disease. It is prevented with a series of vaccines against the virus. For puppies, the vaccines should begin close to 6 weeks of age and be repeated approximately every 3 weeks until a series of 3 or 4 vaccines has been given. Thereafter, a vaccine should be given annually, as the virus can circulate in populations and your adult dog may be re-exposed through sniffing or licking in public places where other dogs have been or you may track the virus back to your dog on your shoes. Consequently, keeping up with vaccination schedules is critical for the health of your animals. Once the complete puppy series is given, some locations may choose to vaccinate only every 3 years. Please consult with your veterinarian regarding the frequency of adult animal vaccinations in your area.

Most deaths from parvovirus occur within 48 to 72 hours following the onset of clinical signs. If your puppy or dog shows any of these signs, you should contact your veterinarian immediately (https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/canine-parvovirus.aspx).

Intestinal parasites, especially in puppies, may also cause diarrhea or bloody diarrhea. Do not take a chance the diarrhea or bloody diarrhea may be from parasites, which can also kill your pet. Take the pet to the veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and medical treatment.

If you adopt or rescue an animal, get the animal vaccinated immediately because you have no way of knowing where the animal has been or what it has been exposed to. While parvovirus is often associated with puppies, adult dogs can succumb to this virus as well. Their immunity can wane if not vaccinated regularly or the animal may come into contact with a large load of the virus while at public locations or even tracked back to them by their pet parents who may have visited a public location or a friend's animal.

Puppies or dogs diagnosed with the virus need treatment. Antiemetics (to prevent vomiting) and copious fluids to restore body fluids and electrolytes are important. Keeping the animal hydrated and helping the pet to maintain body temperature is important. Veterinarians may also administer medication to help reduce the fever, especially if it is dangerously high.

Your veterinarian should be your best friend and partner in keeping your pet healthy and in helping to restore a healthy balance when your pet is ill. - Mod.TG
