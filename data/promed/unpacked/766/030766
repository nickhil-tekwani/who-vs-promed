The epidemiological status of the Ebola virus disease dated 25 May 2018:
- A total of 54 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 35 confirmed, 13 probable and 6 suspected.
- 4 new suspected cases (1 Ntondo, 1 Wangata, 2 Bikoro).
- 1 death of a confirmed case from Iboko.
- 4 negatives: 3 in Bikoro, 1 in Wangat.
- Epidemiological analyses have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
-------
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News about the Ebola response
-----------------------------
Visit by the Minister of Health to Bikoro and Iboko
- Accompanied by a strong delegation composed of partners such as the representatives of WHO, UNICEF, and IOM, the Minister of Health travelled this [Sat 26 May 2018] in the territories of Bikoro and Iboko aboard a helicopter to be aware of the on-the-ground deployment of the entire Ebola response.
- The Minister of Health also chaired a meeting with the local committee fighting Ebola virus and was able to meet one of 3 former confirmed cases of Ebola who recovered after treatment.
- From [Mon 28 May 2018], vaccination in Bikoro will begin. The next steps will be to launch immunization activities in Iboko after establishing all the logistics, but also to carry out the precise targeting of the beneficiaries of the vaccine, namely the front-line health personnel, the people who have been in contact with the confirmed cases of Ebola and the contacts of these contacts.
- Outreach officers continue their field work and remind the public that vaccination is effective only if the other hygiene measures, all monitoring components, and follow-up of contacts are well respected.

[These official updates from the DRC Ministry of Health do not simply report case counts, but also contain substantive information about government efforts to control the epidemic - including the important reminder that all the traditional methods of outbreak control need to be respected and followed, for the vaccination campaign to be effective.

- 24 May 2018. Ebola situation reports: DRC, WHO
http://www.who.int/ebola/situation-reports/drc-2018/en/

Case numbers can fluctuate on a daily basis due to many factors including enhanced surveillance, local laboratory capacity, possible communication delays caused by the challenge of accessing remote locations and constant reclassification of cases.

Latest numbers as of 24 May 2018
Confirmed cases: 35
Probable cases: 13
Suspect cases: 6
Total cases: 54 (including 23 deaths)*

* Surveillance/investigation is getting stronger. After in-depth review, the Ministry of Health has discarded from case count 7 individuals who died from other causes, therefore decreasing the number of deaths.

[I have included this recapitulation of the case counts from WHO because it highlights the many reasons for day-to-day fluctuation in the case numbers. Obviously, the detection of new cases is more important than retrospective revisions and corrections. Particularly important are new cases that are NOT known contacts of previous cases. The proportion of new cases that are known contacts of previous cases is a good measure of the effectiveness of surveillance and monitoring programs. If every possible contact comes under surveillance, this ratio should approach 100 percent (which is almost never achieved in the real world). - Mod.LXL]

[2] No Ebola outbreak in Uganda - CCHF
- 27 May 2018. No Ebola Outbreak in Uganda - Minister Opendi
Kampala Post [excerpted] https://kampalapost.com/content/health/no-ebola-outbreak-uganda-minister-opendi

The minister of health in charge of general duties has quashed rumours that there is an outbreak of Ebola in the Uganda.

There has been a social media message alleging that there is an outbreak of the Ebola pandemic in Mubende district. This follows an outbreak of the disease in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] where over 20 people have lost lives.

"We would like to inform the public that there is no Ebola outbreak in Mubende or any other part of the country. What was quoted in the media is rather a case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)," said Opendi.

[This case of CCHF is the subject of a separate ProMED post today by Mod.UBA. I am including this brief excerpt here simply to make the point that rumor mills - which expand so rapidly in today's internet chat age - should not jump to invoke Ebola when there are many other causes of hemorrhagic fever in sub-Saharan Africa. A similar rumor quickly emerged after a patient with suspected hemorrhagic fever was admitted to Kinshasa General Hospital last week (see Ebola Update (16), 20180525.5817907; part 4: Case terminology). These various hemorrhagic fevers are of course serious diseases in their own right, requiring their own treatment and containment protocols, as detailed in the rest of the above article.

Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that a new case of classic hemorrhagic fever is LESS likely to be caused by the Ebola virus. One of the lessons from the 2014-2015 West African epidemic is that hemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are NOT common features of Ebola infection, compared to symptoms and signs like intense fatigue, conjunctivitis, nausea and vomiting. This realization led WHO and other authorities to adopt Ebola Virus Disease as the name of this disease, as opposed to the former name of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, which should really be considered a misnomer. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Vaccination campaign underway
- 26 May 2018. Vaccinations set to begin in Ebola outbreak epicenter
STAT [edited] https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/26/341517/ [Byline: Helen Branswell]

Ebola vaccination efforts will begin [Mon 28 May 2018] in Bikoro, the epicenter of the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the country's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga, said [Sat 26 May 2018].

The equipment required to keep the vaccine at the appropriate temperature -- the so-called cold chain -- has been set up at Bikoro, said Ilunga, who was vaccinated himself on [Fri 25 May 2018]. The World Health Organization said that as of [Thu 24 May 2018], 154 people had received the vaccine, made by Merck. Ilunga told STAT that people are eager to be vaccinated.

"Now that people realize that this is really a threat and people are dying, I think that everybody wants to be protected," he said. "So wherever we have been, people are asking to get vaccinated. The health care workers, even some community leaders, they all want to be vaccinated."

Vaccination started earlier this week in Mbandaka, the regional capital, where 4 confirmed cases and one suspect case have been identified. Ilunga traveled to Bikoro on [Sat 26 May 2018] with a team that will prepare for the start of the vaccination effort. He also traveled to Iboko, a 3rd location with cases. A vaccination campaign will have to happen there as well, but the location is challenging. To reach the village, Ilunga and his party flew from Bikoro by helicopter, but then had a 3-mi trek [approx 5 km] through the forest to the village.

"It is a very remote area. So before bringing vaccine there you must be sure that the cold chain is ready," he said.

Earlier reports said that people in Iboka were not cooperating with Ebola response teams, refusing to allow samples to be taken for testing from a person who had died of what was suspected to be Ebola. But Ilunga said the villagers are no longer resisting and are even agreeing to safe burial practices for the dead. Traditional funeral customs that involve washing and touching a corpse are dangerous practices during an Ebola outbreak.

To date there have been 54 cases reported in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Iboko, and Ntondo; and 25 have died.

Ilunga said newly identified suspect cases are coming from lists of people who have been in contact with existing cases, a sign that contact tracing efforts are working. "So that means that somehow we are at the point where we are surrounding the transmission chain," he said.

When cases are discovered who have no known links to previously identified patients, it suggests that all chains of transmission haven't been found.

[There are 2 very encouraging developments reported here as the rural Ebola vaccination campaign gets underway. First, the village community is not only eager to be vaccinated, but is also cooperating with contact tracing and safe burial practices that are essential for containing the epidemic. Second, newly identified suspect cases are coming from the cohort of known contacts, which is a measure of the effectiveness of contact tracing, as discussed in part [1] above. - Mod.LXL]
