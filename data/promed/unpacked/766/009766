Rabies, human - Argentina 20010520.0982

The 3rd Argentine and the 2nd Latin-American Congresses on Zoonoses took
place in Buenos Aires, between 7-10 Aug 2001. A round table on "Advances
for rabies control in Argentina" was included in their programs;
researchers from the host country and the USA constituted its panel. One of
its members, who had diagnosed the human rabies case reported in
ProMED-mail post of Fri 18 May 2001, informed [us that an error had
occurred in this diagnosis. The virus isolated from the child was an
antigenic variant 3 (vampire bat origin) and not 4 (non-hematofagous bat)
as originally reported -- a result that agrees more closely with
epidemiological findings related to the case.
The error would have occurred due to the instability of monoclonal antibody
C19, one of the components of a set of 8 McAb distributed in the Americas
for rabies virus typing; it reacts with vampire bat strains but not with
non-hematofagous bat strains and to lack of appropriate controls. The
variant 3 diagnosis was confirmed by molecular techniques at the Malbran
Institute, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

[The relevant information at the time was: "Retrospective information
demonstrated [that the boy, who lived in a rural area near San Luis del
Palmar (located 100 km from the state capital city, Corrientes, in
northeastern Argentina), had contact in February 2001 (nature of contact
unknown) with a bat in an endemic rabies zone (where a significant number
of horses and cows have died with rabies-compatible symptoms)." - Mod.MHJ
