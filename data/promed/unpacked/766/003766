Five new Newcastle disease [NCD] outbreaks found in Israel.

The 5 outbreaks were found in 3 different provinces of Israel -- Hazafon [North], Haifa and Yerushalayim.

The outbreaks affected 4 broiler farms and one egg layer farm.

Over 16 000 birds died and another 363 870 were destroyed to prevent the outbreak from spreading.

The country will use vaccination in response to the outbreak.

[NCD has a characteristic seasonal pattern in Israel, peaking during the winter months. During the years 1972-2010, the lowest number of outbreaks was recorded in September. The disease is regarded as endemic in all neighbouring countries.

On 12 Dec 2013, following the absence of cases since September 2013, Israel notified the previous epizootic "resolved since 30 Sep 2013". The disease recurred on 22 Dec 2013 and has been continuing since, so far causing 135 new reported outbreaks, covered in an immediate notification and 28 follow-up reports, the most recent of which (No. 28) was submitted to the OIE on 16 Jun 2016 (the one from which The Poultry Site derived its above data). This report is available, with interactive map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20233.

The accumulated data of the event since its start in December 2013, as of 16 Jun 2016, are available from OIE's archives, as follows.

Outbreak summary
Total outbreaks = 135 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered

[*Lesser kestrel = Falconidae (_Falco naumanni_) found infected in the Biblical Zoo of Jerusalem on 5 Mar 2014. The kestrels were put under quarantine within the zoo. No further sick birds have been observed.]

The above and all accumulated reports, as well as a map showing the 135 foci, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000020233_20160616_170419.pdf.

The NCD control policy applied in Israel is in line with EC's requirements: strict stamping out (owners compensated), surveillance and application of infected zones/severe quarantine measures. Vaccination is routinely applied, accompanied by scheduled antibody follow-up.

For the NCD chapter (including the 2013 map), see pages 216-218. For the pattern of NCD outbreaks in Israel between 1998-2013, see the graph on page 244 (top left, in blue; "2012" should read "2013"). The annual reports for 2014 and 2015 are not yet available. - Mod.AS
