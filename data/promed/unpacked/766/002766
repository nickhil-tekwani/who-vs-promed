Death of poultry caused by septicemic pasteurellosis, not bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
The number of dead poultry in the Rostov Region approaches 700. As Regnum
was told by the Head of the South Regional Emergency Service Center Press
Office, Oleg Grekov, according to recent information, the number of dead
birds found over the weekend in the village of Shabliyevka (south of the
Rostov Region) totaled 229. Earlier, it was said that 120 birds died in the
local households. The doctors say the diagnosis is not bird flu, but
septicemic pasteurellosis.
In the village of Kolundayevsky (north of the region), where earlier 150
had died, 450 more birds died over the weekend.
The poultry is being destroyed. The region has not been put in quarantine yet.

[The clinical and PM findings of acute Fowl cholera might be confused with
avian influenza and Newcastle disease; contrary to avian influenza, fowl
cholera, a contagious bacterial disease, will generally remain restricted
to the affected flocks and will not spread. Ruling out avian influenza by
laboratory investigation is an essential requirement. - Mod.AS]
