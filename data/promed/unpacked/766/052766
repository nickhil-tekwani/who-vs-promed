According to the initial report of samples sent last week [30 Jul - 3 Aug
2007] to NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases] Delhi by the
health department under the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, the
fever in Deol village of Baijnath Tehsil in the hilly state of Himachal
Pradesh in North India turned out to be _Rickettsia _conerii_ spread by the
ticks present on animals.
This is for the 1st time that this disease has been reported in the state.
Dr Sood, FETP scholar of National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai has
been investigating the outbreak over the last few weeks with the state
health department since 9 Jul 2007. A high index of suspicion in the
absence of typical features enabled the testing sending samples for
advanced tests and diagnosis of the disease.
Dr Mehta, senior epidemiologist and zonal leprosy officer, said that the
disease was initially mistaken for typhoid as WIDAL gives a false positive
reaction in the disease. Dr Raj Kumar MO, Dr Neeraj Gupta MO, Dr Babita
AMO, Dr B Phralad BMO and their team camped in the village for 3 weeks to
manage the cases. Chief medical officer Dr Chandel said that the cases
responded to doxycycline. No deaths occurred.
No new cases are being reported now in the village but some cases are
relapsing, possibly due to not taking the complete medicine advised. The
disease may be present in much more areas as ticks are common in cattle and
surveillance programme needs to be strengthened by training all health staff.
Public health expert Dr Mazta in his report to the health department
suggested that laboratory capability at the local RP Govt Medical College
Kangra needs to be further strengthened to increase preparedness to deal
with emerging health problems, and early diagnosis for timely action.
Urgent attention is needed for their control to safeguard the health of
human populations as the disease may occur again as favorable conditions
for transmission exist. As it is zoonotic disease, a team from the College
of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (Palampur) consisting of Dr Chohota
(microbiologist), Dr Siddharth (public health), and Dr Mitra
(parasitologist) visited the site on request from health authorities and
examined the animals for vectors.
The report of the tests on the ticks samples is awaited and will shed
further light on the rickettsioes in the hill state and prevention of
further spread. Dr Jain from the NICD Delhi added that till then, personal
hygiene, treatment of animals and observing body for ticks/mites are
advised for preventing the disease.

[This outbreak was initially reported as typhus (Epidemic typhus - India
(Himachal Pradesh) 20070723.2362); ProMED-mail thanks Dr Sood for informing
us that the outbreak was due to Indian tick typhus caused by a variant of
_Rickettsia conorii_. A discussion about this disease was extracted from:
Parola P, Fenollar F, Badiaga S, et al. The 1st documentation of Rickettsia
conorii infection (Strain Indian Tick Typhus) in a traveler. Emerg Infect
Dis 2001; 7: <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no5/parola_letter.htm>:
"Although Indian tick typhus (ITT) was clinically described at the
beginning of the century, the etiologic agent has never been isolated from
patients in India, nor has a case been diagnosed by strain-specific
serologic testing. A spotted fever group rickettsia was isolated in 1950
from a brown dog tick, _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, collected in India (2)
and assumed to be the agent causing ITT. It was designated as _Rickettsia
conorii_, the agent of Mediterranean spotted fever, which occurs all around
the Mediterranean and is transmitted by the same tick species. However, the
disease as it appears in India differs from the common description of
Mediterranean spotted fever. The rash is frequently purpuric, and an
inoculation eschar at the bite site is rarely found, as in this case. The
disease as known in India is mild to moderately severe (1,3,4).
"Strain differences within the species _R. conorii_ may account for
differences in clinical presentation. Although different isolates of _R.
conorii_ can be distinguished antigenically (5-7), molecular taxonomic
methods demonstrated recently that these rickettsiae are closely related
and cluster together (8-10). Thus, the species is considered by many as _R.
conorii_, including 4 serovars: _R. conorii_ with 3 type strains, 7 being
the one most commonly identified in our laboratory in isolates from France,
Portugal, North Africa, Kenya, and Morocco (apparently a unique isolate);
-R. conorii_ Indian tick typhus; _R. conorii_ Astrakhan, and _R. conorii_
Israel.
