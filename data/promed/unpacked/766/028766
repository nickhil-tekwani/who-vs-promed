[1] USA: massive military medical aid
Date: Tue 16 Sep 2014

http://blackamericaweb.com/2014/09/16/us-to-assign-3000-from-us-military-to-fight-ebola


The Obama administration is ramping up its response to West Africa's EVD [Ebola virus disease] crisis, preparing to assign 3000 US military personnel to the afflicted region to supply medical and logistical support to overwhelmed local health care systems and to boost the number of beds needed to isolate and treat victims of the epidemic.

President Barack Obama planned to announce the stepped-up effort Tue [16 Sep 2014] during a visit to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta amid alarm that the outbreak could spread and that the deadly virus could mutate into a more easily transmitted disease.

The new US muscle comes after appeals from the region and from aid organizations for a heightened US role in combatting the outbreak blamed for more than 2200 deaths.

Administration officials said Mon [15 Sep 2014] that the new initiatives aim to:
- train as many as 500 health care workers a week;
- erect 17 heath care facilities in the region with 100 beds each;
- set up a joint command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia, to coordinate between US and international relief efforts;
- provide home health care kits to hundreds of thousands of households, including 50 000 that the US Agency for International Development [USAID] will deliver to Liberia this week;
- carry out a home- and community-based campaign to train local populations on how to handle exposed patients.

The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans ahead of Obama's announcement, said the cost of the effort would come from USD 500 million in overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan, that the Pentagon already has asked Congress to redirect to carry out humanitarian efforts in Iraq and in West Africa. The officials said it would take about 2 weeks to get US forces on the ground. -- more

[2] USA: detailed hospital EVD checklist for USA
Date: Mon 15 Sep 2014
Source: CDC, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Ebola virus disease [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/hospital-checklisk-ebola-preparedness.pdf


The US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), in addition to other federal, state, and local partners, aim to increase understanding of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and encourage US hospitals to prepare for managing patients with EVD and other infectious diseases. Every hospital should ensure that it can detect a patient with EVD, protect healthcare workers so they can safely care for the patient, and respond in a coordinated fashion. Many of the signs and symptoms of EVD are non-specific and similar to those of many common infectious diseases, as well as other infectious diseases with high mortality rates. Transmission can be prevented with appropriate infection control measures... -- more [6 pages in all, undated]

[3] Hospitals: are they part of the EVD problem?
Date: Sun 14 Sep 2014
Source: NBC News [edited]
http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/are-hospitals-part-ebola-problem-charity-wants-new-strategy-n202486


It may be time to take a whole new approach to fighting EVD -- one that looks outside hospitals, the head of the Christian mission group that's been helping lead the fight against EVD says. Hospitals have been helping to spread the virus -- 240-plus health workers have been infected, including some of Sierra Leone's top doctors and 4 US workers. And EVD patients are overwhelming hospitals in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, driving away patients with other conditions.

President Barack Obama is poised to make an announcement about new US aid to fight the epidemic on Tue [16 Sep 2014]. But aid workers in West Africa complain that so far, help being offered is too little, too late. Franklin Graham, head of Samaritan's Purse, suggests ditching hospitals and pivoting to a completely different strategy. He says his teams are starting to set up stand-alone isolation units, and he calls for protective gear to be distributed directly to families caring for victims. After all, they are being turned away from hospitals anyway. "It is very difficult to fight EVD with a hospital," Graham ... told NBC News. "The reason is that the EVD got into the hospital and infected the hospital."

In Monrovia, Liberia, St Joseph's Catholic hospital closed because so many staffers got infected. Phebe Hospital in central Liberia virtually closed after 5 nurses died of EVD. 4 government hospitals closed in Sierra Leone in a single week last month [August 2014]. It's clear to Graham that large, centralized hospitals, where sick patients may expose many others before they are even seen, are not the answer to fighting EVD. "My recommendation is the hospital has to be removed and separated quite a bit from EVD," he said. "There has to be better triage before you even let a person get into the [EVD] hospital." [Easier said than done when the symptoms mimic those of severe malaria and other tropical diseases. - Mod.JW]

Doctors believe Dr Kent Brantly became infected with EVD while seeing patients he did not realize were infected. He wasn't always wearing protective gear when seeing general patients at the ELWA [Eternal Love Winning Africa] Hospital outside Monrovia. Brantly thinks so himself. "We think that Dr Brantly was infected in the hospital. It wasn't in our EVD treatment center," Graham said. Samaritan's Purse, a Christian aid organization that helps other groups build hospitals, among other things, is already modifying its EVD strategy. "You have to have a containment center where someone who has EVD comes in and you are able to contain them," he said. And these centers shouldn't be anywhere near hospitals, where vulnerable children, pregnant women, and sick people can be exposed.

"Containment centers are where you can have very strict procedures -- a gown, double and sometimes triple layers of protection," Graham said. "But in a hospital your staff are not gowned like that." Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF -- Doctors Without Borders) is beginning to take a similar approach. "Already we are running a number of isolation units," says Sophie Delaunay, executive director of MSF New York. "It is very simple. You need an empty field and you set up an isolation ward."

There's no good way to treat EVD, which the World Health Organization says has infected more than 4700 people and killed 2400 of them since the outbreak started in February [2014] in West Africa. Patients like Brantly lucky enough to be treated in more modern facilities have done well with balanced rehydration salts. But even a little saline and careful care has saved the lives of half the patients -- a good sign for a virus that has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims.

What's most important now is to stop the spread, and to do that, patients must be kept away from the uninfected, Delaunay says. "It is clear that what is needed at this moment is isolation," she said. "To cut the transmission chain, the only way is to isolate the sick patients. This is why we need more beds." It's not hard to understand and it's not hard to carry out, says Delaunay, who is perplexed by the negligible international response to the epidemic, despite constant pleas from MSF, WHO and other organizations. "If an NGO (non-governmental organization) like MSF does what we are doing, states can do it and even at a larger scale," Delaunay said. "This is all we are asking. If a few states get their acts together, their means are much bigger than MSF's means."

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies is taking a similar tack in an emergency appeal for money to build a 60-person EVD treatment facility in Sierra Leone. And Graham wants to take the decentralization even further. "The most important thing, I believe as we move forward, is to give people a way to protect themselves -- giving people gloves, giving them gowns, giving them masks," he said. "Let's say you had EVD. Your family could come and they would be given protective equipment so they could take care of you." Ebola is spread via bodily fluids, and hundreds of people have been infected as they cared for infected loved ones, cleaning up vomit and diarrhea and wiping feverish brows. "What we are wanting to do is give Liberians the same knowledge, the same gloves and gowns (that our staff have) so that they can protect themselves," Graham said.

[This appears to imply families caring for their sick in the hospital, just as they do in the case of patients with other conditions. - Mod.JW]

Liberia: British charity donates treatment center in Bong
---------------------------------------------------------
15 Sep 2014: (AllAfrica) The British charity "Save the Children-UK" has turned over a USD 170 000, 50-bed treatment center to the [Liberia] Ministry of Health, through the Bong County Health and Social Welfare Team. The EVD treatment center is the first to be established in Bong County since the outbreak hit Liberia in March [2014]. Speaking during the handover ceremony, the Acting Country Director of Save the Children, Mercy Gichuhi, reaffirmed her organization's support to the government in the fight against the killer disease. Madam Gichuhi said Save the Children-UK remains committed to supporting government's efforts in infusing more resources until EVD is eradicated from the country. The Save the Children-UK Acting Country Director urged the government and partners to focus their attentions on catering to children, noting that in any emergency, children were more vulnerable.

[5] Brazil: African immigrants problem
Date: Mon 15 Sep 2014
Source: Folha de Sao Paulo [edited]
http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/internacional/en/brazil/2014/09/1516118-with-fear-of-ebola-senegalese-lie-to-avoid-being-barred-at-brazil-border.shtml


With fear of EVD, Senegalese lie to avoid being barred at Brazil border
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Faced with the fear of having their entry into Brazil refused due to concerns about the Ebola virus [disease], Senegalese immigrants have identified themselves as Haitians at the border of Acre with Bolivia and Peru, the Senegalese told Folha de Sao Paulo. In Senegal, only one case has been confirmed. But immigrants from the country housed in a shelter in Rio Branco maintained by the Acre government confirmed that [Brazilian] Federal Police officers have made it difficult for all Africans to enter Brazil... [They] said in a statement that there is no guideline to restrict access to immigrants from the continent to Brazil.

"We said that we are Haitians. If we say we are from Senegal, everyone would go back," a 29-year-old, who asked not to be identified, told Folha... According to him, black skin and a French accent -- similar to the Creole spoken by Haitians -- helps to confuse nationalities. The young man says he intends to go to Passo Fundo (Rio Grande do Sul) to work in the textile industry. He said that when he had to pass through the Federal Police [post] at the Assis Brasil border (340 km [211 mi] from Rio Branco) with Bolivia and Peru, the Senegalese said they were Haitians who lost their documents while traveling. This way, they were able to enter the country and head to the shelter in Acre's capital city... "They are instructed to say they lost their documents. As many are extorted during the trip, the Federal Police allow them to head to the shelter. Once there, the documents 'appear' and they complete the process of requesting a visa normally," said the coordinator...

Acre asked the federal government to strengthen staff prepared to prevent the entry of Ebola into the country, but up until Thursday (11 Sep 2014), the routine at the immigrant shelter in Rio Branco had not changed. There are no medical assessments for newcomers.

The Senegalese arrive in Brazil by the same route used by Haitians, passing through Ecuador and Peru, on trips brokered by 'coyotes'. To get to Ecuador, the trip is made by plane from Dakar, the capital of Senegal, with layover in Madrid, Spain. For infectologist Esper Kallas, from USP's [University of Sao Paulo] Faculty of Medicine, it is very unlikely that Ebola is being transmitted in Senegal. "It is early to think of barring the Senegalese. One case in a population of millions is much too little for a sanitation barrier," he said.

"You comment on Bjorg Marit Andersen's post of 14 Sep 2014 (see archive no 20140914.2773490):
"[The above directions are perfectly correct. Unfortunately, investigators are concluding that health worker infections are occurring outside the hospitals. - Mod.JW]"
It seems like you were endorsing that there are respiratory symptoms associated with this EVD outbreak. Is that true?"

No, it isn't. I should have added "where they are not wearing PPE", meaning when seeing general patients at another hospital (see Dr Brantly's statement in item [3] above).

There is no evidence of aerosol transmission of ebolavirus and transmission to healthcare workers is probably resulting from breaches in PPE or failure to use adequate PPE (or to remove it safely after use) in the very intensive setting of hospitals in West Africa.
