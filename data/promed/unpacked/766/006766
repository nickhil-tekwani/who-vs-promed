Bovine tuberculosis, Israel
---------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 11 Jan 2018 from Dr Shlomo Garazi, Chief Officer for Import and Export of the Veterinary Services, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Bet Dagan, Israel

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 11 Sep 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 10 Jan 2018
Report date: 11 Jan 2018
Date submitted to OIE: 11 Jan 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: September 1999
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: not known yet (_Mycobacterium bovis_ or _M. tuberculosis_)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Gal'On, Ashkelon, HaDarom [Southern]
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Sep 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 584 / 19 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a foreign worker began to work in the farm and was diagnosed as sick with tuberculosis. It is not known yet if it is _M. bovis_ or _M. tuberculosis_. Following this information, the Veterinary Services made a skin tuberculin test in the herd. 19 of the cows were found positive.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 3.25 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: foreign sick worker
Epidemiological comments: The positive cows will be culled and samples will be taken to try to isolate the bacteria.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official destruction of animals products; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: selective killing and disposal

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Field test (local laboratory) / Cattle / tuberculin test / 10 Jan 2018 / Positive
Abu Kabir, Ministry of Health (National laboratory) / Cattle / bacteriological examination / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the immediate notification above, the suspected source of infection in the Gal'On dairy operation is a foreign worker found infected by a mycobacterium which has not yet been finally defined ("_Mycobacterium bovis_ or _M. tuberculosis_"). Most likely, the causal agent will be eventually identified as _M. tuberculosis_. In such scenario, the event becomes a case of "anthropozoonosis" (old term for a reverse case of zoonosis, namely from man to animal). Such cases, often reported from African and Asian countries with high prevalence of human tuberculosis, have also been observed elsewhere (refs 1-4).

In case the involved species is _M. bovis_ (less likely), which is regarded the classical cause of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), the Gal'On farm becomes Israel's 1st infected dairy operation since the official announcement, in 1973, of bTB nationally eradicated. The declaration followed the termination of a 3-phase eradication scheme, which had commenced in 1950. The scheme was based upon periodic tuberculin testing, slaughter of positive reactors, combined with compulsory, government controlled veterinary meat inspection in the municipal slaughterhouses (ref 5). Sporadic cases in grazing beef cattle were identified during veterinary meat-inspection examinations in slaughterhouses in 1976 and 1996 and were followed by repeated tuberculin testing and culling of positive responders.

The current reported event involves an industrial dairy operation in kibbutz Gal'On, south-central Israel (map at https://goo.gl/maps/d1uJ341BArj). Since _M. tuberculosis_ is known generally to sensitise cattle to bovine tuberculin tests without causing typical lesions, in case the involvement of this species is verified, further dissemination of infection within the herd is not likely to occur.

Final results of the bacteriological tests of the human case, including the bacterium strain's identity and its sensitivity to antibiotics, and of the PM gross-pathology examinations and subsequent lab tests of the 19 culled animals, are anticipated soon. We are unofficially informed that the patient came from Uganda.

The culling and the subsequent examinations are to be applied under stringent biosecurity conditions.

According to most recent available data (2016), the Gal'On herd's 295 milking cows produced annually 12 751 kg milk per cow. Milk pasteurization is compulsory in Israel.
