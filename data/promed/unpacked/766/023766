STAPHYLOCOCCAL SCALDED SKIN SYNDROME IN A NEONATE - SINGAPORE
=============================================================
Date: Sat, 15 Jun 1996 10:25:52 +0800
From: raymond@pacific.net.sg (Raymond Lin)

We just had a neonate with eye discharge and scalded skin syndrome. I
understand this is quite uncommon in neonates. We have instituted contact
precautions to prevent further spread.
1. has anyone else encountered neonatal staph SSS?
2. is anyone interested in further studies on the strain - e.g. phage-typing?
