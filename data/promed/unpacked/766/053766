Salivating cow spurs Miyazaki to kill 16 more
---------------------------------------------
Another cow in the city of Miyazaki was found to have symptoms of
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], including excessive salivation, the
prefecture said, prompting officials to kill and bury 16 cows at the
farm as of Monday [5 Jul 2010] morning.

With the 1st suspected case since 18 Jun 2010, the prefecture will
have to delay its plan to declare an end to the outbreak of the
disease among livestock in Miyazaki to 27 Jul 2010 at the earliest,
instead of 16 Jul 2010.

"It's extremely regrettable," Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru said at a
meeting called to consider countermeasures. "We will all work on the
matter once again by thoroughly investigating the suspected infection
route."

The case was found on a farm about 800 meters [0.5 mi] from the
facility hit by the last suspected case on 18 Jun 2010, prefectural
officials said. The cow in question was determined through
photographs as possibly being infected with the disease [see also
item 2 below].

The prefecture lifted some restrictions last Thursday [1 Jul 2010],
including a directive to postpone public events, in areas other than
those under livestock movement restrictions, after completing the
destruction of about 276 000 pigs and cows.

The decision remains unaffected by the new case, the governor said,
because the farm is located inside the area where livestock movement
is already restricted.

The prefecture was testing livestock with a view to lifting
restrictions on city traffic on 11 Jul 2010, with plans to declare on
16 Jul 2010 an end to the outbreak that began in April [2010].

Health officials have culled livestock within a 10-km [6.2 mi] radius
of farms in the town of Kawaminami and other municipalities where
many pigs and cows were found to be infected. The farm hit by the
latest case is not in the area covered by the measure.

Under farm ministry rules, 21 days must pass in principle after the
last destruction of livestock suspected of FMD before curbs are lifted

New suspected foot-and-mouth case found in Miyazaki, lift on
restrictions delayed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A new suspected case of FMD has been found at a farm here, causing a
delay in the much-awaited lifting of restrictions on livestock
movement and transport in the prefecture.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and the Miyazaki
Prefectural Government announced the suspected case on 5 Jul 2010.
All of the farm's 16 cows have already been slaughtered and buried.

This is the 292nd case of FMD in the prefecture, following a case
confirmed at another farm in Miyazaki on 18 Jun 2010. As no outbreaks
of the disease had been confirmed in the prefecture since then, the
prefectural government had been planning to lift livestock movement
and transport restrictions across the prefecture on 16 Jul 2010. Due
to the newly confirmed case, however, the restrictions are expected
to stay in place until at least 27 Jul 2010.

At the newly affected farm on 30 Jun 2010, blood samples were taken
from 9 cows to test whether they had been infected by the virus.
Because 3 of them failed an antibody test, prefectural government
officials visited the farm for a re-examination and found another cow
that had tested negative earlier drooling and having other FMD
symptoms. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries then
determined from photographs that the cow could be infected. [See
commentary below].

"It's extremely unfortunate and we take it seriously," Miyazaki Gov.
Hideo Higashikokubaru said during a task force meeting of his
government on 5 Jul 2010.

The prefectural government had on 1 Jul 2010 just lifted a suspension
on the holding of public events in the prefecture, except in areas
where the livestock movement and transport was restricted, since it
was thought the risk of infections was nearly gone.

A cow in the city of Miyazaki has tested positive for FMD in gene
tests after showing symptoms of the livestock disease, including
excessive salivation, the farm ministry said Monday [5 Jul 2010].

The Miyazaki prefectural government had slaughtered and buried all 16
cows bred at the same farm by Monday morning [5 Jul 2010] before the
results of the gene tests were known, local government officials said.

With the new case, the prefectural government will have to postpone
its plan to declare an end to the outbreak in the southwestern
Japanese prefecture from 16 Jul 2010 to 27 Jul 2010, at the earliest.

[An official follow-up OIE report, with data on the tests performed
and their results, is expected. Interestingly, according to the media
reports, clinical diagnosis of FMD in Japan includes application of
photography (in view of possible legal interventions?! -- explanation
will help). - Mod.AS]
