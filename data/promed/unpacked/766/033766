The Gawler South Bakery salmonella outbreak has risen to 49 victims including 11 who have been admitted to hospital. The food poisoning has hit people ranging in age from 2 years old to 70 and is linked to chicken sandwich-type products sold at the Gawler South Bakery.

Bakery management has apologised to customers and is co-operating with authorities to improve food handling practices, including preparing chicken sandwiches for testing but not for sale to the public.

SA Health is reminding people of the importance of safe foodhandling procedures in light of the incident, including washing hands and ensuring food preparation areas are kept clean. Last year, 2017, was one of the worst in recent times for salmonella incidents, with 1375 confirmed cases tallied up to 23 Dec 2017.

SA Health director of public health Dr Kevin Buckett said food safety inspectors, along with the local council, returned to the business on Tue 2 Jan 2018 to inspect equipment and check procedures. The bakery's management is co-operating with authorities and has made improvements to food safety practices. Sandwich-type products using chicken are believed to be behind the outbreak, and the bakery will make test sandwiches on Wednesday [3 Jan 2018] using chicken cooked elsewhere for officials to examine, but these will not be sold to the public.

"We've now seen cases in people aged 2 years old up to 70 years old, and we are anticipating more cases as further test results come through," Dr Buckett said. "The source of the contamination has been linked to filled sandwiches, wraps, rolls, and focaccias made and sold at Gawler South Bakery. "While salmonella wasn't detected in the food and environmental samples taken from the bakery last week, this isn't unusual, as the source of the contamination has often passed by the time we identify a common link between the cases. We again urge food handlers to follow these 4 basic food safety tips: cook food thoroughly; clean hands and surfaces that come into contact with food; chill cooked food quickly and keep it cool until eaten; and separate raw and uncooked food from cooked and ready-to-eat products."

[As more cases are reported from the exposure period, it appears that this growing outbreak is related to undercooked chicken in some of the products sold at the bakery. The combination of adequate cooking of the poultry along with appropriate kitchen hygiene to prevent cross-contamination should minimize the risk of transmission. - Mod.LL
