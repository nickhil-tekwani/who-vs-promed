Rhode Island public health officials on Monday [6 Dec 2021] confirmed the state's 1st human case of the Jamestown Canyon virus [JCV] since 2013.

The person who tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus is a resident of Kent County in their 50s, the state Department of Health said in a statement. The person started experiencing symptoms in mid-September [2021] and was hospitalized. Tests were submitted to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in mid-October [2021] and Jamestown Canyon virus was confirmed.

The person has been discharged from the hospital and is recovering, the department said.

People infected with the virus may not develop any symptoms, or only develop mild symptoms, the agency said. Early symptoms can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue that can progress to more serious central nervous system disease, including meningitis or encephalitis, the agency said.

"Although we are no longer in mosquito season in Rhode Island, this recently confirmed case of JCV is a reminder that a few simple precautions can help you stay healthy and safe when you are outdoors spending quality time with family and friends," department Director Dr Nicole Alexander-Scott said in a statement.

[Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) clinical infections in humans occur sporadically in the northeastern USA. Cases in Rhode Island are rare. Fortunately, this patient is recovering at home after hospital discharge. CDC states, "cases occur from late spring through mid-fall. Fever, headache, and fatigue are common symptoms of Jamestown Canyon virus disease. Jamestown Canyon virus can cause severe disease, including encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). There are no vaccines to prevent or medicines to treat Jamestown Canyon virus infection. Reduce your risk of infection by preventing mosquito bites."

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus)_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED post Jamestown Canyon virus, mosquitoes - USA (NY) (03) 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. That post provides related references. - Mod.TY
