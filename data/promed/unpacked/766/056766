WHO: Influenza Pandemic Threat May Be Increasing
---------------------------------------------
The H5N1 avian influenza virus is evolving and poses "a continuing and
potentially growing pandemic threat," say experts who were convened
recently by the World Health Organization (WHO) to study the pathogen.
Changing patterns of cases, particularly in northern Vietnam, may indicate
the virus is becoming more infectious for humans, the WHO said in a report
on an international meeting of experts held 6 and 7 May 2995 in Manila.
[For additional details, see: ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza, human -
East Asia (77): Viet Nam 20050518.1362", and "WHO Inter-country
Consultation: Influenza A/H5N1 in Humans in Asia, Manila, May 6th-7th,
2005" which can be accessed via:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/H5N1%20Intercountry%20Assessment%20final.pdf>
- Mod.CP].
In addition, genetic analysis indicates that H5N1 viruses are becoming more
antigenically diverse.
The report cites several differences between epidemiologic features of
human cases this year [2005] in northern Vietnam and those in southern
Vietnam this year and overall last year [2004]: (1) Northern Vietnam has
had 8 case clusters this year, versus only 2 in the south. (2) Case
clusters in northern Vietnam this year have lasted longer than did clusters
last year. (3) The average age of infected people in northern Vietnam rose
from 17 to about 31 years between 2004 and 2005, but it stayed about the
same in southern Vietnam (15 to 18 years). (4) The case-fatality rate has
dropped to 34 percent this year in the north but is 83 percent in the south.
In addition, the report says the recent discovery of 3 asymptomatic cases
in Vietnam suggests that milder infections are occurring. A few
asymptomatic cases also were found in Japan and Thailand in the past year,
and others were discovered in Hong Kong after the H5N1 outbreak in 1997.
The report says the longer duration of recent clusters may signal a growing
number of ways in which people contract the virus, including exposure to
sick birds, environmental infection, lengthy exposure to asymptomatic birds
that are shedding virus, and person-to-person transmission.
The avian virus had already vaulted to the top of the pandemic threat list
because it had developed the ability to sicken and kill humans. The virus's
inability to cause efficient, ongoing human-to-human transmission is the
last barrier to a pandemic. Now experts appear worried that the barrier is
crumbling. "Investigators were not able to prove that human-to-human
transmission had occurred. However, they expressed concerns, which were
shared by local clinicians, that the pattern of disease appeared to have
changed in a manner consistent with this possibility," the assessment
states. At the same time, it says that in places where the disease in
poultry has been controlled or eliminated, human cases have stopped. And
thus far, the 1st case in most of the human clusters in Vietnam followed
the person's exposure to infected poultry.
For now, "Prevention of H5N1 avian influenza in humans is best achieved by
controlling infection in poultry," the document states. "As already
recommended by FAO and OIE [the United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health], control
strategies for this disease should consider vaccination of poultry, which
has been used successfully before."
A team of WHO expert consultants studied Vietnam's outbreak at that
country's request from Apr 15 through 25, the report says. That study
showed H5N1 could be changing more in the northern region, which prompted a
2nd expert consultation. This 2nd meeting was held May 6 and 7 at the WHO
regional office in Manila. Representatives from Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Thailand presented details about the epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic
findings regarding H5N1 in people and poultry. Other data were included
from the WHO Global Influenza Network and other countries. The experts make
a number of recommendations, including increasing efforts to improve risk
assessment, to boost the ability of affected countries to address
outbreaks, and to speed the pace of pandemic planning.
The 14 recommendations include the following: (1) WHO should convene its
Pandemic Task Force to meet regularly, assess the data, and determine the
risk for pandemic flu. (2) All nations should move as quickly as possible
to complete "practical operational pandemic preparedness plans." (3) WHO
should explore "all possible mechanisms" to make H5N1 vaccine available to
the Asian countries affected before a pandemic. It should bring together
technical experts, countries, manufacturers and possible donors to find
ways to boost global H5N1 vaccine production. (4) Coordination of animal
and human surveillance and viral information must be improved from the
ground level to the national and international level, and data must be
exchanged quickly. (5) The WHO should complete a handbook on how to
investigate possible H5N1 clusters. (6) The WHO should explore building a
stockpile of antiviral drugs that could be used to respond to early signs
of a potential pandemic. (7) Countries needing funding and agencies that
may provide funding must coordinate their efforts to avoid redundancy and
eliminate gaps.
As the experts call for greater international effort to address the
escalating threat, they also acknowledge the difficulties of preparing for
a possible pandemic: "Evolution of a pandemic strain of virus may be
preceded by numerous small steps, none of which is sufficient to signal
clearly that a pandemic is about to start. This poses a difficult public
health dilemma. If public health authorities move too soon, then
unnecessary and costly actions may be taken. However, if action is delayed
until there is unmistakable evidence that the virus has become sufficiently
transmissible among people to allow a pandemic to develop, then it most
likely will be too late to implement effective . . . responses."

[As commented previously, the assessment that human-to-human transmission
may be occurring in northern Viet Nam is far from conclusive, and although
the virus is undoubtedly showing increasing sequence diversity, its
biological relevance is debatable. The observations "In places where the
disease in poultry has been controlled or eliminated, human cases have
stopped," and that "Thus far, the first case in most of the human clusters
in Vietnam followed the person's exposure to infected poultry" run counter
to the other arguments. - Mod.CP/MPP]
