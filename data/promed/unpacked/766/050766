Neurologic Complications Associated with Novel Influenza A (H1N1)
Virus Infection in Children --- Dallas, Texas, May 2009
-----------------------------------
Neurologic complications, including seizures, encephalitis,
encephalopathy, Reye syndrome, and other neurologic disorders, have
been described previously in association with respiratory tract
infection with seasonal influenza A or B viruses (1--2), but not with
the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. On 29 May 2009, the Dallas
County Department of Health and Human Services (DCHHS) notified CDC
of 4 children with neurologic complications associated with the
influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus [called novel influenza A (H1N1)
virus throughout this report] infection admitted to hospitals in
Dallas County, Texas during 18-28 May 2009. This report summarizes
the clinical characteristics of those 4 cases. Patients were aged
7-17 years and were admitted with signs of influenza-like illness
(ILI) and seizures or altered mental status. Three of the 4 patients
had abnormal electroencephalograms (EEGs). In all 4 patients, novel
influenza A (H1N1) viral RNA was detected in nasopharynge!
al specimens but not in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Antiviral therapy
included oseltamivir (4 patients) and rimantadine (3 patients). All 4
patients recovered fully and had no neurologic sequelae at discharge.
These findings indicate that, as with seasonal influenza, neurologic
complications can occur after respiratory tract infection with novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus. For children who have ILI accompanied by
unexplained seizures or mental status changes, clinicians should
consider acute seasonal influenza or novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection in the differential diagnosis, send respiratory specimens
for appropriate diagnostic testing, and promptly initiate empirical
antiviral treatment, especially in hospitalized patients.

Case Identification
Since 22 Apr 2009, DCHHS has requested all hospitals in Dallas County
to report details concerning patients admitted with novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus infection. As of 20 Jul 2009, DCHHS had identified 405
persons with laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection in the greater Dallas area, including 44 hospitalized
patients. No deaths had been reported. Of confirmed novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus infections, 83 percent were in patients aged less than
18 years. Among these pediatric cases, 145 children, including 26 who
were hospitalized, were identified through the Children's Medical
Center of Dallas (CMCD) laboratory-based surveillance program.
Medical records from admission and discharge for all hospitalized
H1N1 patients are routinely screened by DCHHS epidemiology staff.
Characteristics of hospitalized patients are compiled on an ongoing
basis, with further investigation of cases noted to have unusual
features and severe illness.

A patient with acute neurologic complications associated with novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was defined as having
laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection of the
respiratory tract associated with seizures, encephalopathy, or
encephalitis within 5 days of ILI symptom onset, without evidence of
an alternative etiology. Encephalopathy was defined as altered mental
status lasting greater than or equal to 24 hours. Encephalitis was
defined as encephalopathy plus 2 or more of the following: fever
greater than or equal to 100.4 F (38.0 C), focal neurologic signs,
CSF pleocytosis, EEG indicative of encephalitis, or abnormal
neuroimaging indicative of infection or inflammation (1-2).

During 22 Apr-20 Jul 2009, 7 possible cases of neurologic
complications associated with novel A (H1N1) virus infection were
identified. Three cases were excluded because the neurologic
complications were determined to have alternative etiologies (e.g.,
hypocalcemia and apnea related to prematurity) or did not meet the
case definition (e.g., altered mental status for less than 24 hours).
Of the remaining 4 cases described in this report, one patient
(patient A) was initially reported by a community hospital in Dallas
on 18 May 2009. The 3 other cases were reported by CMCD to DCHHS
during 23-27 May 2009. No additional cases had been reported in
Dallas County through 20 Jul 2009.

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected from all 3 patients admitted
to CMCD were tested for influenza A and B antigens by either
Directigen EZ Flu A+B rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (BD [Becton,
Dickinson, and Company], Sparks, Maryland), QuickVue Influenza A+B
test (EIA) (Quidel, San Diego, California), or D3 Ultra direct
fluorescent assay (Diagnostic Hybrids, Athens, Ohio). All positive
specimens were sent to DCHHS, and novel influenza A (H1N1) virus was
identified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (rRT-PCR) using CDC-approved primers and probe sets. All CSF
samples were tested at CDC using rRT-PCR for influenza,
enteroviruses, parechovirus, adenovirus, and human parainfluenza
virus serotype 3. CSF for patients B and D were tested for additional
viruses by a commercial laboratory (Viracor).*

Case Reports
Patient A. On 17 May 2009, a previously healthy black male aged 17
years visited a community hospital emergency department after one day
of fever reaching 102.6 F (39.2 C), cough, headache, dizziness, and
weakness. Influenza A was diagnosed by EIA, and the patient was
discharged home with a prescription for oseltamivir. The patient was
admitted the next day to another community hospital because of
increased generalized weakness, disorientation to place, and markedly
slow and intermittent responsiveness to questions. On physical
examination, the patient was noted to be confused and unable to
provide history of his own illness. He also was unable to lift his
arms above his shoulders or stand. He had taken one dose of
oseltamivir the morning of admission. A computed tomography (CT) head
scan revealed pan-sinusitis, and CSF was normal. The patient received
ceftriaxone for 2 days, which was discontinued when CSF bacterial
cultures indicated no growth. He received oseltamivir throughout his
hospital admission. His mental status returned to normal on day 3. He
was discharged on day 4 with no apparent sequelae and completed a
5-day total course of oseltamivir.

Patient B. On 23 May 2009, a previously healthy Hispanic male aged 10
years was taken to a Dallas community hospital via emergency medical
services after a 3-minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure and
subsequent postictal mental state. The seizure occurred after 4 days
of fever reaching 104.0 F (40.0 C), cough, decreased appetite, and
fatigue. His family reported that the patient had contact with
another child with ILI symptoms before the patient's illness onset.
Upon initial evaluation in the emergency department, the patient was
afebrile. A chest radiograph revealed a left lower lobe infiltrate,
and a CT head scan was normal except for an incidentally noted single
punctuate calcification in the left frontal cortex. Influenza A was
detected in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by EIA. Three hours later,
the patient had a 2nd 3-minute generalized seizure. Intravenous (IV)
lorazepam and ceftriaxone were administered, and the patient was
transferred to a CMCD intensive-care unit.

On admission to CMCD, the patient was febrile, confused, and drowsy.
He had difficulty answering questions and made frequent inappropriate
attempts to get out of bed. CSF analysis was normal. He was
administered IV fosphenytoin to prevent additional seizures,
vancomycin and ceftriaxone for empirical treatment of bacterial
pneumonia, supplemental oxygen via bilevel positive airway pressure
for oxygen saturations less than 92 percent, and anticonvulsants.
Over the ensuing 2 days, he had intermittent fevers reaching 102.0 F
(38.9 C). On hospital day 4, he had a prolonged partial complex
seizure with focal onset (eye deviation to the right) and secondary
generalization, lasting 30-40 minutes, which eventually was
controlled by 4 doses of IV lorazepam and a bolus of IV fosphenytoin.
Oseltamivir and rimantadine were initiated. Brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography was normal, and an
EEG was consistent with encephalopathy (Table). His mental statu!
s returned slowly to baseline by hospital day 7, when he was
discharged without apparent sequelae to continue levetiracetam,
amoxicillin, and clindamycin, and complete a 5-day course of
oseltamivir.

Patient C. On 26 May 2009, a white male aged 7 years with a history
of a simple febrile seizure one year previously was taken to a Dallas
community hospital via emergency medical services after a seizure and
2 days of cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue. On the day of
admission, he had been found at home on the floor, with tonic
movements of his upper and lower extremities lasting at least 2
minutes. On admission to the community hospital, he was noted to have
postictal drowsiness and a temperature of 100.8 F (38.2 C). A
diagnosis of influenza A was made by EIA. Blood tests, CSF, and a CT
head scan were normal.

The patient was transferred the same day to CMCD, where he exhibited
normal mental status and no fever or seizures. A brain MRI showed
nonspecific white matter abnormalities not characteristic of
infection or inflammation. Localized cerebral dysfunction was evident
on EEG. Oseltamivir and rimantadine were started on hospital day one,
and the patient was discharged on hospital day 3 without any
neurologic sequelae, to complete a 5-day course of both antivirals
and to continue levetiracetam until reassessment by neurologists in 3
months.

Patient D. On 27 May 2009, a black male aged 11 years with a history
of asthma was taken to CMCD because of one day of fever and vomiting.
A household contact, his grandmother, had an upper respiratory
infection 3 days before his illness. One day before admission, he had
a fever of 102.0 F (38.9 C), fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, and
vomiting, and was given bismuth subsalicylate twice and one 81 mg
aspirin. At CMCD, he was febrile. Neurologic examination revealed
ataxia. Soon after admission, the patient had a seizure consisting of
episodic eye rolling and tongue thrusting. An EIA test for influenza
A was positive, and oseltamivir, rimantadine, cefotaxime, and
acyclovir were initiated.

During the 1st 2 hospital days, the patient was disoriented, had
visual hallucinations, had difficulty responding to questions and
following commands, had slow speech, and required supplemental oxygen
via facemask for mild hypoxia and hypopnea attributed to decreased
respiratory drive associated with encephalopathy. Chest radiograph
was normal. An EEG was consistent with encephalopathy, and a CT head
scan was normal. The patient's mental status returned to normal by
hospital day 4. He completed a 5-day course of oseltamivir.

MMWR Editorial Note
Infection with seasonal influenza virus can be associated with
neurologic complications (1-2), but the frequency with which these
occur with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is unknown. This
is the 1st report describing patients with neurologic complications
associated with novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. The
severity of the neurologic disease in the 4 patients described in
this report was less than the typical disease described in 2 studies
of neurologic complications associated with seasonal influenza (1-2),
which included reports of severe static encephalopathy and death.
Only 2 of the 4 patients described in this report had seizures, and
none died or had neurologic sequelae at discharge. Considering that
clusters of influenza-associated encephalopathy in children have been
reported during previous community outbreaks of seasonal influenza
(1-2) and that children appear to be infected with novel influenza A
(H1N1) virus more frequently than adults (3), additional neurologic
complications in children are likely to be reported as the pandemic
continues. Clinicians should consider influenza associated
encephalopathy in the differential diagnosis of children with ILI and
seizures or mental status changes, and remain aware of the potential
for severe neurologic sequelae associated with seasonal or novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection.

Neurologic complications in children associated with seasonal
influenza have included acute cognitive and behavioral problems,
focal neurologic deficits, and death from neurologic complications
(4). Influenza-associated neurologic complications are estimated to
account for up to 5 percent of cases of acute childhood encephalitis
or encephalopathy (4) and were reported in 6 percent of
influenza-associated deaths among children during one influenza
season (2003-04) in the United States (5). The epidemiology of
influenza-associated encephalopathy has been described extensively in
Japan, where incidence has appeared to be higher than in other
countries (1). In Japan, approximately 80 percent of
influenza-associated encephalopathy cases occur in children aged less
than 5 years (1,6), and neurologic signs typically develop within 1-2
days of influenza symptom onset (1,6). Manifestations have included
seizures, altered consciousness, incoherence, irritability, and
psychotic behaviors!
(1,6). Outcomes reported in one case-series from Japan ranged from
complete resolution (in nearly 50 percent of cases), to mild (20
percent) or severe neurologic sequelae (10 percent), to death (20
percent) (6).

Neuroimaging results in influenza-associated encephalopathy might be
normal, but in severe cases, abnormalities can include diffuse
cerebral edema and bilateral thalamic lesions. EEG might show diffuse
abnormalities (1,2,4). Only rarely is influenza virus detected in
CSF, suggesting that neurologic manifestations might be an indirect
effect of influenza respiratory tract infection (2,7).

For patients with respiratory illness and neurologic signs,
diagnostic testing for possible etiologic pathogens associated with
neurologic disease, including influenza viruses, is recommended (8).
Health-care providers also should consider a diagnosis of Reye
syndrome in patients with viral illness and altered mental status.
Although one of the patients described in this report, patient D,
received a salicylate-containing product and aspirin, no evidence of
Reye syndrome was observed. Salicylates and salicylate-containing
products should not be administered to children with influenza or
other viral infections because of the increased risk for developing
Reye syndrome (9).

Antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible for any
hospitalized patient with neurologic symptoms and suspected seasonal
influenza or novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection (2). Although
respiratory specimens should be obtained for appropriate diagnostic
testing before administering antiviral agents, clinicians should not
wait for the results before beginning treatment. Antiviral
medications have been shown to decrease the risk for complications
from influenza (10); however, the effectiveness of antiviral
treatment to prevent influenza-associated encephalopathy sequelae is
unknown. Clinicians also should send respiratory specimens for
appropriate diagnostic testing. Although no vaccination against novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus is available currently, CDC recommends that
all children aged greater than 6 months receive annual seasonal
influenza vaccination to prevent illness and complications from
infection with seasonal influenza virus strains.
