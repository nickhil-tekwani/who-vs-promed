A bacterium spreading a lethal yellowing disease on coconut palms has
entered Sri Lanka threatening more than 200 000 trees on the southern coast
of the island, coconut experts say. The bacteria known as "phytoplasma"
came through a shipment of ornamental palms that were not quarantined
before entering the island, Salinda Dissanayake, minister of coconut
development and nation building says. The disease turns the leaves yellow
and causes most of the fruits to drop prematurely. The whole crown of the
palm also falls, leaving a bare trunk, experts from the coconut research
institute said.

As a preventive measure, the institute has declared a 3 km (2 mi) wide
buffer zone along the coastal line in the south, ranging from Weligama, 140
km (87 mi) south of Colombo, to Matara, which is situated a further 20 km
(12 mi) away. "We hope the bacteria will not be able to cross over 3
kilometers," C Jayasekara, director, coconut research institute, told
reporters. The coconut trees that were infected within the buffer zone had
been burnt to prevent the spreading of the bacteria.

The research institute has started conducting experiments to find a
solution and ensure the disease does not spread to other crops. It has
restricted items made from coconut and coconut plants being transported out
of the infected southern region, in a bid to contain the disease.
Meanwhile, Dissanayake says a Non Governmental Organization has transported
around 10 000 coconut plants to the eastern region for cultivation. "We
cannot order the police to seize such plant loads since there are no legal
provisions for that." The disease can affect the industry if it spreads all
over the island, he said.

Sri Lanka's coconut cultivations are mainly in the north western province
of Kurunegala and Puttalam. This area is called the 'coconut triangle'. In
2002, around 443 000 acres (179 300 hectares) or 45 per cent of the total
coconut acreage, were found in the north western districts. In the southern
region, coconut acreage was around 117 000 acres (47 350 hectares) which
was around 12 per cent of the total.

[The following additional information was kindly provided by Dr L Perera of
the Sri Lankan Coconut Research Institute (CRI):

"Few years ago we recognized a disease causing leaf rot in coconut in the
southern part of the country. It seemed to be spreading, and later we found
that it is caused by a complex of fungi. Later it was revealed that this
disease is similar to Kerala wilt disease in India, which is a phytoplasma
disease. According to Indian scientists, wilt is the real disease, which
has yellowing symptoms and necrosis, and it is the predisposing factor for
leaf rot disease. We identified about 200 000 palms with yellowing and
necrosis or one of them in the southern part of the country. They have not
died yet. It seems that it is the leaf rot that causes the palm death. We
are studying now what is the time taken from the wilt to leaf rot and then
from leaf rot to death of the palm. Leaf rot to death of palms seems fast
but it appears that wilt to leaf rot takes a long time. We obtained
phytoplasma products from diseased palms and sequence homology information
revealed that it is 98 per cent homologous to sugarcane white leaf disease
and about 80 per cent to lethal yellowing (LY). Further studies to confirm
the results are ongoing. CRI is thinking to remove all wilt affected trees
in order to prevent further spreading."

Coconut palm is a vitally important subsistence and cash crop in many poor
regions, so much so that it is often called the "Tree of Life". A number of
phytoplasma diseases are known to affect this crop.

1. Lethal yellowing (LY) is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae and
is spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa. It has seriously
jeopardised coconut industries in affected areas and can infect a large
number of palm species killing trees usually within 4 to 6 months.
Planthopper vectors, possible seed transmission, and weed reservoirs are
thought to be involved in LY epidemiology. For more information on LY see
previous ProMED-mail post no. 20080125.0313.

2. Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease in Ghana is caused by a related
phytoplasma of the palm lethal yellowing (16SrIV) taxonomic group. A number
of other LY group strains have been described from different regions. The
vectors for CSPW and some of the other LY phytoplasmas are not known yet,
but seed-transmission has been reported. For more information on CSPW see
previous ProMED-mail post no. 20071224.4129.

3. In Asia, a number of coconut diseases caused by phytoplasmas are known,
for example Natuna and Kalimantan wilts in Indonesia, and Kerala wilt (KW;
also called coconut root wilt) in India. The KW phytoplasma is at present
considered as a separate taxonomic group, but there is still some dispute
over its taxonomy. It is spread by insect vectors but there is no evidence
of seed transmission. The disease is not lethal, but significantly reduces
production. For more information on KW see previous ProMED-mail post no.
20080105.0063. Fungal leaf rot disease is found as a secondary infection in
many KW affected palms.

Symptoms of these phytoplasmas may be suppressed by regular tetracycline
applications, but commercial control is primarily being achieved by
replanting with resistant varieties. Recent observations of breakdown of
resistance to the LY phytoplasma of some widely used hybrids are causing
great concern for coconut replanting programmes worldwide.

It appears that the identity of the phytoplasma in Sri Lankan coconuts
remains to be clarified, but that it is not the LY pathogen. If in fact
imported ornamental palms, as reported above, were the source of the
phytoplasma, their origin may give an indication regarding the pathogen.
The 3 km (2 mi) exclusion zone set up around the affected area may not be
sufficient to limit the spread of this phytoplasma if insect vectors are
involved that may be carried on air currents. There also appears to be a
problem with implementing quarantine measures to prevent spread by humans
within the country. The accompanying coconut leaf rot problem in the same
area has been reported in ProMED-mail post no. 20071118.3734.
