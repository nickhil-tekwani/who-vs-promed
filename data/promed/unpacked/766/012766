Officials at Hajin Hospital are reporting a widespread surge of cutaneous leishmaniasis, aka Aleppo boil, among children in Hajin and its villages east of Deir ez-Zor, according a Radio Al-kul report. It is reported that 1750 cases among children have been seen this year [2020] in the area and demonstrates the need for urgent medical intervention.

Leishmaniasis lesions require lengthy and expensive treatment because the medication is imported. It is difficult for the people to treat leishmaniasis in light of the deteriorating financial and living conditions.

Suheir Al-Atta, a specialist and head of the leishmaniasis treatment committee in Deir ez-Zor said that most of the cases are concentrated in the regions of eastern Deir ez-Zor and among children within schools, especially between the age group of 7 to 15 years. She indicated that it is expected that the number of cases will exceed 3000 in the coming days.

Leishmaniasis is caused by infection with leishmania parasites, which are spread by the bite of infected sand flies. There are several different forms of leishmaniasis in people. Cutaneous leishmaniasis causes skin sores, and visceral leishmaniasis, which affects several internal organs (usually spleen, liver, and bone marrow).

[Leishmaniasis, primarily cutaneous leishmaniasis, has surged throughout Syria during the civil war on all sides in the conflict. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Syria with its reservoir in rodents. It has been a problem throughout the Syrian civil war and in ISIS-controlled areas during the war due to a breakdown in rodent and vector control.
