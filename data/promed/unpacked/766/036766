Third case of novel coronavirus infection identified in family cluster
[15 Feb 2013]
------------------
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) can confirm a 3rd case of novel coronavirus infection in a family cluster, following the confirmed diagnosis of 2 cases announced earlier this week. The patient, who is a UK resident and does not have any recent travel history, is recovering from a mild respiratory illness and is currently well. This latest case brings the total number of confirmed cases globally to 12, of which 4 have been diagnosed in the UK.

Professor John Watson, head of the respiratory diseases department at the HPA, said: "Although this patient had a mild form of respiratory illness, as a precaution the HPA is advising that the patient self-isolate and limit contact with non-household members. Follow up of other household members and contacts of this case is currently underway.

"Although this case appears to be due to person-to-person transmission, the risk of infection in contacts in most circumstances is still considered to be low. If novel coronavirus were more infectious, we would have expected to have seen a larger number of cases than we have seen since the 1st case was reported 3 months ago. However, this new development does justify the measures that were immediately put into place to prevent any further spread of infection and to identify and follow up contacts of known cases.

"We would like to emphasise that the risk associated with novel coronavirus to the general UK population remains very low. The HPA will continue to work closely with national and international health authorities and will share any further advice with health professionals and the public if and when more information becomes available."

Notes to editors:

1. Laboratory confirmed cases to date: 12

Saudi Arabia: 5 (3 deaths)
Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
UK: 4 (1 patient from Qatar - receiving treatment, 3 patients from UK, 2 receiving treatment, 1 recovered)
Germany: 1 (patient from Qatar - discharged)
2. Coronaviruses are causes of the common cold but can also include more severe illness, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). This new coronavirus was first identified in September 2012 in a patient who died from a severe respiratory infection in June 2012. The virus has so far only been identified in a small number of cases of acute, serious respiratory illness who presented with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties.

3. For further information, see the HPA's coronavirus webpages [http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NovelCoronavirus2012/] which includes a Q&A [http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NovelCoronavirus2012/GeneralInformation/respqandanovelcoronavirus2012/] on this topic.

[This case represents the 12th confirmed case of respiratory illness associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) and the 3rd case in a family cluster in the UK (see prior ProMED-mail posts listed below). There have been 2 prior clusters of respiratory illness associated with the nCoV - one cluster with 2 fatalities confirmed involving ICU (Intensive care unit) staff in a hospital in Jordan in May 2012 and the 2nd family cluster in Saudi Arabia in November 2012. In the latter case, information was not available to determine if the cluster was due to common exposures or person-to-person transmission. In this cluster in the UK, the dates of onset of the cases are sequential and only the 1st case had the known risk factor of travel to Saudi Arabia where earlier cases have been identified. Hence it is fairly certain that there has been thus far limited person-to-person transmission.
