CAT SCRATCH FEVER, SEQUELAE - USA (FLORIDA)

I would like information on cat scratch fever. My grandson had cat scratch
when he was 3 y/o and was left with severe brain damage. That was 5 years
ago. I was interested to know if there are any more cases documented where a
child was left severely brain damaged. A biopsy was done and confirmed the
cat scratch. He lives in Florida. He lost the ability to talk. His lost his
eye
sight for a while, but it returned. He has seizures still. I would
appreciate any information you might have and can share with me.

Cat scratch disease (CSD) is a bacterial infection caused by _Bartonella
henselae_. The organism is carried by cats, in which it causes a persistent
bacteremia. Clinical signs in cats appear to be few, mild, and transient,
although the infection may be present for years.
In the United States, about 22,000 cases of CSD are reported each year,
although this is not indicative of actual incidence because most cases are
asymptomatic. In immunocompetent people, the disease is usually mild and
self-limiting, resolving without specific treatment within a few weeks to a
few months. The most common symptoms (>90% of cases) are regional
lymphadenopathy, low-grade fever, and malaise. Complications of various
sorts occur in about 9% of symptomatic patients; encephalopathy or
encephalitis is one of the better-recognized complications and has been
reported in 1-7% of patients.
Permanent sequelae of any kind, however, are not usually associated with CSD
infection. There are many reports in the literature of CSD encephalitis and
encephalopathy; seizures, status epilepticus, coma, combative behavior,
delirium, stupor, etc. are all part of the picture. But the recurring theme
is "and the patient recovered completely in x days and has remained well for
y months/years." I have not been able to find any references that report
permanent brain damage in a previously healthy person.
CSD neuroretinitis with loss of vision has been reported but is very rare.
I might note that the above statements do not apply to AIDS patients/HIV+
individuals. Not only does the infection have the potential for much more
serious symptoms, _B. henselae_- associated dementia has been documented in
immunocompromised persons.
An interesting side note: In August and September of 1994, 5 children living
within 7 miles of each other in south Florida developed CSD encephalopathy.
"All recovered fully."
In the south Florida area where the cluster of cases occurred,
seroprevelance of _B. henselae_ infection was 62% among local cats.
Prevalence tends to be highest in areas with warm, humid climates, i.e.,
where flea populations are high. It appears that the infection is
transmitted cat-to-cat via the cat flea; transmission to people probably
occurs when "flea dirt" (flea feces) contaminate a scratch or other breaks
in the skin. Thus, probably the best means of preventing CSD in humans are
to institute aggressive flea control for one's pet cats, avoid playing with
stray cats, and immediately and thoroughly cleanse any cat scratches or bites.
