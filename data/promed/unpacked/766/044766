A teenager was sickened by a strain of salmonella that originated inside a Clark College microbiology lab earlier this month [June 2012]. The teen is a roommate of a student who was in a class studying live salmonella cultures, confirmed Catherine Kroll, an epidemiologist with the Clark County Public Health Department (CCPH).

"We believe the child could have been infected in one of 2 ways," Kroll said. "The 1st could be that the person working in the lab became ill and brought that home ... Or that person brought home items that were used in the lab, such as pens and pencils, and those were then used by the child."

It is the 1st case of salmonella to come out of a teaching lab in Clark County, CCPH said.

Clark College spokeswoman Barbara Kerr released a written statement Friday morning, 17 Jun 2012: "This type of incident has never happened before in our nearly 79-year history, but one time is one too many. We appreciate the opportunity to work closely with Clark County Public Health to ensure that we are implementing best practices in our classrooms. The safety of our students always comes 1st."

CCPH did a review of Clark College lab procedures after the case of salmonella was reported. "One of the big recommendations we made involved taking personal items in and out of the lab," Kroll said. ... "Often, students will bring pens and pencils from home and use them in the laboratory, and what we've recommended is that Clark College actually purchase pens and pencils and keep them in the lab and not have students take them back and forth."

[Fomites such as pens and pencils are unlikely vehicles for salmonellosis since the infection generally requires a high inoculum. However, high inocula of the organism might directly contaminate the writing instrument, making transmission perhaps possible. - Mod.LL
