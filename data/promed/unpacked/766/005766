Recall of Pet Foods Manufactured by Menu Foods, Inc.
--------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been
informed that Menu Foods, Inc., a private-label
pet food manufacturer based in Statesville,
Ontario, Canada, is recalling all its "cuts and
gravy" style dog and cat food produced at its
facility in Emporia, Kansas between December 3,
2006 and March 6, 2007. The products are sold in
the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The recall was prompted by consumer complaints
received by the manufacturer and by tasting
trials conducted by the manufacturer. There has
been a small number of reported instances of cats
and dogs in the United States that developed
kidney failure after eating the affected product.
Ten deaths, one dog and 9 cats, have reported at
this time. The firm has undertaken extensive
testing of the pet food products in question, but
to date has been unable to find the source of the problem.
The products are packaged in cans and pouches
under numerous brand names and are marketed
nationwide by many pet food retailers including
Ahold USA Inc., Kroger Company, Safeway, Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., PetSmart, Inc., and Pet Valu, Inc.
Menu Foods, Inc. has identified the potentially
contaminated products on the Internet at
www.menufoods.com/recall. Consumers who have any
of these products should immediately stop feeding
them to their pets. Dogs or cats who have
consumed the suspect feed and show signs of
kidney failure (such as loss of appetite,
lethargy and vomiting) should consult with their
veterinarian. Menu Foods, Inc. is notifying
retailers by telephone and mail and is arranging
for the return of all recalled products.
FDA is conducting an investigation and working
with Menu Foods, Inc. to ensure the effectiveness
of the recall. Consumers with questions may
contact the company at 1-866-895-2708. Consumers
who wish to report adverse actions or other
problems can go to
http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/complain.html
to contact the FDA complaint coordinator in their state.
