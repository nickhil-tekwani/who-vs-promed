U.K. researchers cure man who had coronavirus infection for over 400 days
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers in Britain say they have used genetic sequencing to help cure a man who was infected with the coronavirus for more than 411 days.

The 59-year-old patient, who had a weakened immune system due to a kidney transplant and the use of an immunosuppressant drug, initially tested positive in December 2020.

After further tests in February 2021 and January 2022 came back positive, the team in London carried out a genetic analysis of the virus, which showed that the same strain was present at each stage, with only minor variations -- meaning that the patient was suffering from a chronic coronavirus infection, rather than multiple new infections.

Chronic coronavirus infection is distinct from long COVID, in which people suffer from persistent symptoms and long-term effects after being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

"Nowadays, everyone is infected with omicron, but when we looked at his virus, it was something that existed a long time ago -- way before omicron, way before delta and even before alpha. So it was one of those older, early variants from the beginning of the pandemic," Luke Blagdon Snell, a specialist in infectious diseases and a researcher on the case, told The Washington Post on Friday [4 Nov 2022].

Because the patient was experiencing only mild or intermittent symptoms, he had been ineligible for treatments used to prevent or treat severe COVID.

The results of the genetic sequencing showed that the man had been infected with the B.1.177.18 coronavirus variant, which was present in Britain in late 2020. The team was therefore able to give the patient a combined antibody treatment shown to be effective against that strain.

The case was among several highlighted by Snell and the team of researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and the Department of Infectious Diseases at King's College London in a preprint article published in the peer-reviewed Clinical Infectious Diseases journal on Thursday [3 Nov 2022]. [Luke B Snell, Adela Medina-Alcolea, Themoula Charalampous, et al., Real-time whole genome sequencing to guide patient-tailored therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2022, ciac864, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac864]

Although the more-recent variants now dominant in Britain do not respond to the antibodies used in this case, the findings show the potential for individualized therapies in patients with chronic coronavirus infections. The process of genome sequencing outlined in the paper offers results within 24 hours, allowing medical teams to respond quickly to patients' needs.

In 2 other cases highlighted in the report, genetic sequencing showed that patients suspected to be suffering from prolonged infection had in fact been reinfected with a newer strain of the virus. Their doctors were therefore able to alter their treatment plans accordingly.

Genome sequencing has been used throughout the pandemic to identify new variants and sub-strains, such as omicron, which was 1st detected by scientists in southern Africa in November 2021.

It is unclear how prevalent chronic coronavirus infections are. The longest case known to date was in a patient who tested positive for 505 days before dying and was treated by the same teams.

"But there's definitely a difference between a normal community infection which resolves within 2 weeks," as happens in most cases, and the small proportion of immunocompromised patients who are at risk of a chronic infection lasting more than 6 weeks, said Snell.

Among persistent infections, he said, there are 2 groups: those, like the man who was cured, who are relatively asymptomatic, and others who face more-serious outcomes.

Any long-term infection will affect the body, but even asymptomatic cases can prove dangerous: "We do know that some people, even after several months, if they have this persistent infection, can deteriorate at a later date."

And even though cases of chronic infection are rare, high levels of infection mean that vulnerable patients are more likely to be infected and potentially develop chronic infections, he added.

The aim of future research in this area is to collect enough data on persistent infections to identify new treatment options -- an issue that has become all the more important given new variants' increasing resistance to antiviral treatments, Snell said.

COVID-19 tied to higher risk for new, worsening bladder symptoms
----------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 infection is associated with an increased risk for developing new or worsening overactive bladder symptoms, according to a study published in the December [2022] issue of European Urology Open Science.

Ly Hoang Roberts, from the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan, and colleagues assessed the incidence of COVID-19-associated cystitis (CAC) and its association with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody levels. The analysis included 1895 health care employees participating in the BLAST COVID study group.

The researchers found that 27.4% of those with positive serology only (asymptomatic COVID-19) and 37.8% of those with polymerase chain reaction positivity (symptomatic COVID-19) had an increase of 1 or more point on the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-overactive bladder since baseline, versus 15.8% of uninfected patients (odds ratios, 2.0 and 3.2, respectively).

"The exact pathophysiology of CAC is yet to be discovered, although others have hypothesized that the increase in systemic inflammation on COVID-19 infection can lead to bladder inflammation and thus bothersome urinary symptoms," the authors write.

Abstract
--------
Background
Literature is sparse on COVID-19-associated cystitis (CAC), a novel condition comprising frequency, urgency, and nocturia after COVID-19 infection.

Objective
To determine the incidence of CAC and correlation with SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels.

Design, setting, and participants
This was a retrospective study in which urinary symptoms were scored using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-overactive bladder (ICIQ-OAB) at 3 time points: before the pandemic (January 2020), 2 mo after COVID-19 infection (if applicable), and at the time of the study (May 2021). The setting was a regional health care system. The 18 785 healthcare employees who took part in the BLAST COVID study group were invited to participate, of whom 1895 responded.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
The outcome measured was the percentage of COVID-positive patients with a significant change on ICIQ-OAB over time. Pearson's χ2 test was used for comparison of categorical data, and one-way analysis of variance for continuous data and multivariate analysis. A sample size of 618 was calculated for power of 80% and α = 0.05.

Results and limitations
Of the 1895 participants, 31.9% (n = 605) were positive for COVID-19 according to positive serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Of these, 492 were PCR-positive and had 2-mo postinfection data, with 36.4% (179/492) reporting an increase of ≥ 1 point on the ICIQ-OAB compared to baseline (before the pandemic), with de novo OAB in 22% of these cases (40/179). Comparison of symptoms between baseline and the study time revealed that 27.4% (31/113) of those with positive serology only (asymptomatic COVID) and 37.8% (186/492) of those with PCR positivity (symptomatic COVID) had an increase of ≥ 1 point on the ICIQ-OAB, compared to 15.8% (n = 204) of uninfected patients, with odds ratios of 2.013 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.294-3.138; p = 0.0015) and 3.236 (95% CI 2.548-4.080; p < 0.0001), respectively. The retrospective nature of the study and the volunteer sample are limitations.

Conclusions
COVID-19 infection increases the risk of developing new or worsening OAB symptoms.

Patient summary
We compared overactive bladder symptoms in a large group of participants between individuals with and without a previous COVID-19 infection. We found that symptomatic infection was associated with a 3 times greater risk of developing new or worsening overactive bladder symptoms among COVID-19 patients. - Mod.LK]

COVID patients coming off ventilators can take weeks to regain consciousness
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new paper suggests that the combination of the virus and anesthesia plunges the brain into a prolonged state of quiet -- like a freshwater turtle in winter.

In March 2020, New York City's hospitals filled up with patients desperately ill with COVID-19. In many cases, when their fluid-filled lungs could no longer give them oxygen, doctors sedated them and put them on ventilators.

The patients who recovered were taken off the machines and anesthesia. Within a day or so, their doctors expected them to wake up.

But that's when the phone of Dr. Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, started lighting up.

"We're starting to get all these weird consults," Dr. Schiff recalled. "People have been liberated from anesthesia after surviving COVID, and they're not waking up."

Dr. Schiff, who had spent 25 years treating disorders of consciousness, was perplexed by the influx of unconscious COVID patients. They took weeks, and sometimes months, to wake up. But then they usually regained full consciousness, with no sign of brain damage.

Dr. Schiff and his colleagues have been trying to make sense of this strange phenomenon ever since. On Monday [7 Nov 2022], he published a paper that proposes an answer. And the answer involves turtles. [Nicholas D. Schiff and Emery N. Brown. Protective down-regulated states in the human brain: A possible lesson from COVID-19. PNAS 119 (46) e2120221119. 7 Nov 2022. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2120221119]

The brains of unconscious COVID patients bear a striking resemblance to those of turtles that spend the winter encased in ice, argued Dr. Schiff and his collaborator, Dr. Emery Brown, a computational neuroscientist at M.I.T. The turtles survive by putting their neurons into an unusual quiet state that lasts for months. Dr. Schiff and Dr. Brown believe that the combination of COVID and sedatives prompts a similar response in people.

If the theory holds up, it might point to new ways to save people from brain damage: by intentionally putting people into this state, rather than doing so by accident.

"If it's right, it can teach us how to protect and preserve the brain better," Dr. Schiff said.

Dr. Schiff discovered that his experience was not unusual. Many other neurologists were seeing COVID patients taking a very long time to wake up. In March of this year [2022], Dr. Schiff, Dr. Brown and their colleagues published a study of 795 severe COVID patients with delayed recovery in 3 hospitals in New York City and Boston. One-quarter of the patients took 10 days or more after coming off a ventilator to follow simple commands like squeezing a doctor's finger. After 23 days, 10% were still not conscious. [Greer Waldrop MD, ScM, Seyed A. Safavynia MD, PhD, Megan E. Barra et al. Prolonged Unconsciousness is Common in COVID-19 and Associated with Hypoxemia. Annals of Neurology Volume 91, Issue 6 p. 740-755. First published: 7 Mar 2022. https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26342]

But the analysis did not offer any easy answers about why they were experiencing such a long delay. The anesthetic drugs could not alone account for the long journey back to consciousness. "The time courses were absurd," Dr. Schiff said.

Brain damage can lead to months of minimal consciousness, but many of the COVID patients had healthy brains. "There was no expectation that there should be a problem," Dr. Schiff said.

For years, Dr. Schiff and Dr. Brown have been developing theories about what happens in the brain during comas, sleep and anesthesia. Now they turned their efforts to COVID. Their search for clues brought them unexpectedly to studies of turtles.

Across the northern world, coldblooded turtles that live in freshwater have to survive chilly winters. They do so by spending months buried in frozen mud, barely breathing. Researchers who study turtles in laboratories have found that the animal prepares its brain for winter by flooding it with a chemical called GABA. The compound quiets the activity of neurons so that they don't waste energy producing electrical pulses.

"It's like they auto-anesthetize themselves," Dr. Brown said.

Over the winter, the turtles produce distinctive brain-wave patterns, with isolated bursts of electricity separated by long stretches of silence. Just like the turtles, unconscious COVID patients produce brief bursts of electrical activity between long silences. And these patients typically received anesthetic drugs that mimic GABA.

Dr. Schiff and Dr. Brown proposed that in response to GABA-like sedatives and the stress of COVID, human neurons shift to a quiet mode in which they don't need much oxygen to survive. Even after the sedatives wear off, the brain can keep itself in this state for months.

"I think it's an intriguing analogy, definitely," said Amanda Bundgaard, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cologne in Germany who studies turtle brains. But she cautioned against pushing the analogy too far at this point, because there's so much left to understand about turtles.

"One thing that maybe is a little bit problematic is that we don't know how turtles wake up again from this," she said.

After months in a state of suspended animation, turtles jump back to normal by flooding their brains with oxygen. That's astonishing, because the surge of oxygen ought to kill their neurons by triggering toxic chemical reactions.

Some studies suggest that turtles soak up the extra oxygen with a chemical called neuroglobin. But it's possible they use a number of other chemicals to create many lines of defense. [Milton, S.L., Nayak, G., Lutz, P.L. et al. Gene transcription of neuroglobin is upregulated by hypoxia and anoxia in the brain of the anoxia-tolerant turtle _Trachemys scripta_. J Biomed Sci 13, 509-514 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11373-006-9084-8]

"It's exciting to have a new hypothesis to think about if it helps us create better outcomes for patients," said Martin Monti, a neuroscientist at U.C.L.A. who was not involved in the study.

In their paper, Dr. Schiff and Dr. Brown suggest that neurologists should check samples of cerebrospinal fluid taken from COVID patients as they returned to consciousness. Like turtles, they might release a surge of neuroglobin to protect their brains.

"That would be a pretty good test of the hypothesis," Dr. Monti said.

He added that the hypothesis might also lead to new ways to prevent brain tissue from dying after strokes, heart attacks or even traumatic brain injuries. A combination of sedatives and other treatments might induce neurons to give themselves a turtlelike protection.

"This could ultimately turn into a new tool in the toolbox to make patients not only survive, but recover as well as possible," Dr. Monti said.

COVID-linked kidney injury tied to higher risk of death in hospital patients
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An observational study published this week in eClinicalMedicine suggests that COVID-19-related acute kidney injury (AKI) is tied to a greater risk of death, and that severe AKI may lead to poor recovery of kidney function.

Researchers with the Consortium for Clinical Characterization of COVID-19 by EHR (electronic health record) assessed AKI and subsequent recovery among 12 891 adult patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from 1 Jan to 10 Sep 2020, and were admitted to 15 hospitals in 11 healthcare systems in 5 countries.

Participants had at least one recorded serum creatinine value in the year before hospitalization up to 10 Sep 2021. The study took place during wild-type virus dominance before the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Of the 12 891 COVID-19 patients, 50.5% had at least one episode of AKI. Relative to non-AKI patients, those with an AKI diagnosis had a higher death rate (32.5% vs 10.4%), and 39.2% didn't recover total kidney function within 90 days or end of follow-up.

Risk factors for death were severe AKI (hazard ratio [HR], 4.22) and ischemic heart disease (HR, 1.26). Severe AKI was tied to worse kidney recovery, while the use of the antiviral remdesivir (HR, 1.34) was associated with better recovery.

AKI patients were more likely than those without the diagnosis to be men (77.8% vs 71.2%), aged 70 years and older (55.0% vs 35.9%; HR, 2.77), and to have severe COVID-19 (58.6% vs 27.8%; HR, 2.91).

Participants diagnosed as having COVID-19-linked AKI were more likely to have chronic kidney disease (CKD; 47.8% vs 28.6%), cirrhosis (3.2% vs 2.4%), high blood pressure (59.8% vs 42.4%), ischemic heart disease (22.4% vs 12.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 14.8% vs. 9.6%), and previous venous thromboembolism (blood clot in a vein; 20.3% vs 13.4%).

Elevated baseline serum creatinine (indicating poor kidney function) was noted in AKI patients at 6 months (risk ratio [RR], 1.49) and 1 year (RR, 1.54).

"Further studies are warranted to identify therapeutic strategies to delay the onset and/or progression into chronic kidney disease after an inciting AKI event," the authors wrote.

UK study shows few COVID-19 deaths in children, young adults
------------------------------------------------------------
A study yesterday [8 Nov 2022] in PLOS Medicine conducted in England shows that the risk of death due to COVID-19 remains very low for children and young adults, with most deaths occurring in those with underlying health conditions.

Researchers from the UK Health Security Agency analyzed data on anyone in England under the age of 20 who died within 100 days of a confirmed COVID-19 infection between March 2020 and December 2021.

Of 185 total deaths that occurred, 81 were due to COVID-19. Of those 81, 75% of patients had significant underlying health issues, including severe disability (27 case-patients) or compromised immune systems (12 case-patients).

Half the COVID-19 deaths (41/81, 50.6%) occurred within 7 days of confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 91% (74/81) within 30 days, the authors said.

For the 22 months of the study, COVID-19 was responsible for 1.2% (81/6790) of all deaths in people aged less than 20 years, with an infection fatality rate of 0.70 per 100 000 SARS-CoV-2 infections.

In a PLOS press release on the study, co-author Shamez Ladhani, PhD, said, "Our national surveillance in England continues to show a very very low risk of death due to COVID-19 in children and teenagers, with most fatalities occurring in those with multiple and life-limiting underlying conditions."

[5] Long COVID

Long COVID clinics 'inundated' with patients, and doctors can't cope
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia's long COVID clinics are so under-resourced patients are waiting almost a year for treatment, as the Victorian government warns it will struggle to care for the growing number of patients without extra federal funding.

In a submission to a federal inquiry, the Victorian government revealed the 1st official modelling of long COVID, and said the disease affected 218 000 Victorians, of whom 41 000 had a severe form.

Doctors at long COVID clinics across Australia told The Age and the Herald they were unable to cope with the caseload.

"We have been inundated -- because of limited resources," said Professor Steven Faux, co-lead of the long COVID clinic at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney. "We've only got capacity to open one day a week. We've not got the staff, we can't get them. I can't find physios, I can't find psychologists."

St Vincent's has an 11-month waitlist, as does the clinic at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The Age and the Herald have learnt the Austin Hospital in Heidelberg is closing its clinic later this year [2022] after it ran out of funding.

"There are very limited resources and large demand," said Associate Professor Lou Irving, head of the Royal Melbourne Hospital's long COVID clinic. "[The resources available] is less support than they need."

The situation is far worse in regional Australia. After seeing hundreds of patients, including many Indigenous Australians, left sickened for months by the virus, Dr Sumitha Gounden established a long COVID clinic in Orange. "There are no resources at all," she said. "There's no one, it's only me."

She is the only doctor consistently treating long COVID in her entire district of 276 000 people.

"I should not be covering the district," she said. "These patients are CEOs, triathlon runners, business people -- at the peak of their life, having long COVID, they are not able to function. I can't dismiss them."

Children seem at lower risk -- but even with lower numbers the system is struggling.

"We don't have ongoing funding for our clinic," said Dr Shidan Tosif, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children's Hospital's long COVID clinic. "It impairs our capacity to support children -- which is not how it should be."

The barriers have left many with long COVID frustrated and desperate.

Karen Felder spent 3 months seeing doctors, none of whom could help. One hospital offered her exercise therapy, which she said she couldn't do because she was bed-bound.

"There is no interest, no motivation, no focus from the government, no direction and no funding," she said.

"I got to the point where I stopped seeing doctors. The gaslighting is incredible. It's making me sicker, to get this pushback and to not be believed."

Eventually, she was forced to seek treatment overseas at a private long COVID clinic in Britain. That country has spent almost USD 170 million on 89 national long COVID clinics.

The Australian government commissioned the parliamentary inquiry into long COVID in September [2022] and its findings will inform a national response.

"State and territory health departments have primary responsibility for the public health system," the federal Health Department said in a statement. "Accordingly, the establishment of long COVID clinics are funded by state and territory governments."

In its submission to the federal inquiry, the Victorian government called for increased federal health funding to "ensure adequate care for long COVID without negatively impacting other hospitalisation care needs".

Victoria also called for a national commitment to prevent long COVID by reducing viral transmission.

If Victoria's modelling is accurate -- and there remains great uncertainty about the true rate of long COVID -- the state faces huge pressures to its health budget. "If only 1/3 of those people are restricted from going back to work, it's going to have an enormous drain on Victoria," Irving said.

When many long COVID patients fall sick, don't get better, and are unable to work, they discover they fall between cracks in Australia's social safety net.

The National Disability Insurance Scheme only covers permanent disabilities -- and to qualify for Jobseeker people need to be actively searching for a job. To qualify for chronic disease care, symptoms need to linger for at least 6 months.

Kirsty Yeates's long COVID means she can't work; she has run out of sick leave. To survive, she is taking money out of her mortgage. Her GP has told her she cannot get a referral to a long COVID clinic until she'd had symptoms for 6 months.

Other patients with the disease in regional areas told The Age and the Herald there simply were no services at all.

"It is a national disgrace that people who are seriously ill and disabled by long COVID -- especially those in rural and regional areas, and Indigenous communities -- can't get the health care they desperately need," said journalist Tracey Spicer, who has long COVID after catching the virus in January [2022].

[Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, has warned against prematurely declaring victory over the pandemic, not only due to short-term needs but because long COVID represents an "insidious" public health emergency for millions of people.

In an interview with the Guardian, Fauci urged US Congress to avoid complacency and resume funding to combat the virus as well as long COVID, a chronic and prolonged illness that continues to elude scientists and healthcare providers.

"It's a very insidious beneath-the-radar-screen public health emergency," Fauci said via Zoom. "It isn't that you have people who are hospitalized or dying, but their function is being considerably impaired. For reasons that are obvious, that doesn't attract as much attention as a death rate."

The cold fact that COVID-19 still kills 400 people a day in the US catches public attention more acutely than estimates of the millions suffering from long COVID, Fauci added. "People say, well, what does that mean? It's not very concrete. And yet for the individual patient, it could be debilitating."

The World Health Organization believes that between 10% and 20% of COVID-19 survivors have been left with lasting symptoms including breathlessness, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction that can persist long after the acute infection has resolved.

Between 7.5 million and 23 million Americans are estimated to have developed long COVID. More than 1 million people could be out of the workforce at any given time, resulting in a loss of more than USD 50 billion in income.

There is no test for long COVID -- its precise causes remain mysterious and little is known about how it interacts with other medical and physical conditions. This poses particular challenges for scientists, public health providers, and politicians seeking to engage an American public eager to move on.

"One of the unfortunate, challenging and frustrating parts about it is that there are so many elements of it that don't fit into a known or recognizable pathogenic process," Fauci said. If a person is severely fatigued and unable to work, for example, there is no laboratory test, X-ray, CT scan or MRI that points to something and says: "There's inflammation here and that's the reason for the fatigue."

Fauci continued: "We don't know what the mechanisms of brain fog are. How come someone who is very sharp intellectually and very energetic all of a sudden can't concentrate for more than half an hour on anything? And how come people who are polished athletes no longer have any exercise tolerance?

He added: "These are all mysteries that we hope will unfold and uncover some time in the reasonably near future, but there are more unanswered questions than there are answered questions. You don't really know what to do about something until you know what the lesion is, and we don't know what the lesion is yet. That's the problem."

In this context, trying to treat or cure long COVID "becomes a crapshoot", Fauci admitted, because "we don't even know what the target of the treatment is -- and that's swimming in the dark".

Science is trying to light the way. Researchers are working to identify particular biological factors, or biomarkers, that correlate with symptoms of the condition and might be detectable in blood tests. Such markers might include molecules produced by the immune system or evidence of inflammation.

Last year (2021) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -- where Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases until he steps down in December (2022) -- launched a USD 1.15 billion initiative to advance understanding of and the ability to predict, treat and prevent long COVID. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is also carrying out a major study.

What is becoming clear is that some groups are more vulnerable than others: elderly people (Fauci, 81, became infected with COVID in June 2022 and worried that he might suffer long COVID but was spared) and anyone whose COVID case was severe (though mild to moderate cases can also lead to the condition).

Fauci added: "The other interesting thing is that it also is more prominent in people who have underlying psychological issues: depression and things like that. The one thing you don't want to fall into the trap of saying is well, it's all psychological, because it's not, it's real."

Less predictably, several studies indicate that long COVID is more common among women than men. Noting that diseases such as lupus have a similar gender bias, Fauci speculates that some aspects of dysregulation of the immune system are more common in women than in men. ...
