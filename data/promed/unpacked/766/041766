A virus spread by mosquitoes has infected several people in Haywood County this year [2018], and some residents believe one area could be to blame for several cases.

ARA can't remember much of the night she was bit. Her short-term memory loss is just one unfortunate side effect of La Crosse encephalitis.

Her daughter, AH, remembers getting bit several times while watching a football game near Central Haywood High School in mid-September and her mother developing severe headaches about a week later. "She was puking really bad, her head was pounding, like, she couldn't stand the pain," AH said. "She was just really bad sick looking. So, that's when they called the ambulance and rushed her out there to Mission."

ARA spent several days in the ICU before she began to feel well enough to go home. Nearly a month later, she still is suffering from intense headaches, nausea, and memory loss, among other symptoms. "My kids tell me constantly, 'Mom, you just said that,' and they have to remind me of my daily chores that I should already remember," ARA said.

Now, she's wondering why the Haywood County Health Department isn't doing more to warn people about the virus. "I think they need to put the word out more because there's numerous young kids that go down to that field and, you know, their grandparents."

The Haywood County Health Department confirmed there have been several cases of the virus in the county this year [2018], but, so far, cases haven't exceeded the yearly average. "We usually have 3-4 cases of La Crosse encephalitis throughout the county each year, and we're on track with that same number of cases this year," said Garron Bradish, environmental health supervisor for the county. Bradish said the county has carried out its typical educational outreach about the virus, but efforts haven't been more than what the department normally carries out. "We would encourage people to treat their own properties. That means get rid of any containers that hold water: dump out tires, tip over dog water bowls, clean out gutters and the corrugated pipes that empty out the gutters; mosquitoes will breed in them. It takes only an amount of water as small as a bottle cap to breed mosquitoes."

Bradish said there haven't been any hot spots they've found while trapping and testing mosquitoes, either. "We see a variety of mosquitoes. We do capture the [_Ochlerotatus (Aedes)] triseriatus_ mosquito, but we have not captured at any public sites or things of that nature," Bradish said.

Bradish said most of the [adult] mosquitos that carry the virus are wiped out by [the 1st killing frosts] in early to mid-November.

[Haywood County is within the endemic La Crosse virus area, and cases occur there sporadically. The elimination of potential _O. (Ae.) triseriatus_ breeding sites is well advised, especially elimination of used-tire dumps. However, these mosquitoes also breed in the water that accumulates in basal tree holes. These sites are often difficult to detect and then eliminate. These mosquitoes bite during daylight hours. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure.

As noted earlier, La Crosse encephalitis virus (LACV) is a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses. A map of the distribution of California virus serogroup neuroinvasive disease cases (mainly LACV cases) shows 3 major focal geographic areas: (1) in the unglaciated areas of southeastern Minnesota/southwestern Wisconsin/northwestern Illinois, (2) Ohio, where a previous case occurred this year (2018), and (3) the central Appalachian Mountain areas of Virginia/West Virginia and North Carolina/Tennessee (see the CDC map at http://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html). Severe neurological cases occur, mainly in preschool-age children, although adults may also develop encephalitis, as in this case. Encephalitis is seldom fatal, but prolonged hospitalization and sequelae, including personality changes, may occur.

Cases may occur earlier in the summer season than other arthropod-borne viruses, because the virus can be transovarially transmitted by the infected female to her eggs, so emerging adults may already be infected and ready to transmit the virus without the need to take an infectious blood meal from an infected forest mammal. The Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ can also transmit the virus.

The CDC has a good summary of LACV and its epidemiology, geographic distribution, and clinical characteristics at https://www.cdc.gov/lac/tech/epi.html.
