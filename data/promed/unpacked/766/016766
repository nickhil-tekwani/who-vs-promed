Source: The following background information on rabies in these three
countries was abstracted from the GIDEON software program. Note that the
GIDEON reference base does not include press reports.

France:
Most enzootic disease is reported in foxes.
14 of the 15 human cases reported during 1968 to 1994 were imported. Three
cases were reported during 1977 to 1982 (from Tunisia, Egypt and Senegal);
1 in 1992; 0 in 1993; 1 in 1994 (acquired from a dog in Val-deMarne); 0 in
1995; 3 imported in 1996 (1 from Madagascar, 2 from Algeria); 1 imported
(acquired from a dog in Nepal) in 1997.
3,341 rabid foxes and 53 rabid dogs were identified in 1989. 2,984 rabid
animals were identified in 1990 (81.1% of these foxes); 261 in 1993; 99 in
1994 (including 74 foxes and 2 dogs); 28 wild and 12 domestic animals in
1995. Three rabid bats were identified during 1977 to 1995.
Prophylaxis was given to 8,605 individuals in 1992; 7,346 in 1993; 6,499 in
1994; 6,243 in 1995.

Indonesia:
Recent annual rates of approximately 0.03/100,000 have been recorded.
20,000 are given post-exposure prophylaxis yearly. 76 cases of human, and
1,339 of animal (including 1,317 dogs) were reported in 1994.

United States:
Hawaii is the only rabies-free state.
265 cases of human rabies were registered nationwide during 1944 to 1953;
52 during 1954 to 1963; 16 during 1964 to 1973; 17 during 1974 to 1983; 14
during 1984 to 1993.
Ten of the 18 human cases reported during 1980 to 1993 were imported. One
case was reported (California) in 1992; 3 in 1993; 6 in 1994: 1
(bat-strain) in California - no exposure history; 1 in Florida - acquired
in Haiti; 5 in 1995 (2 of these in California, from bats). Four cases were
reported in 1996 (including two from silver-haired bats, and an imported
case to New Hampshire - from a dog in Nepal). Two cases reported in 1997
were acquired from a silver-haired bat (_Lasionycteris noctivigans_) in
Montana, and a big brown bat (_Eptesicus fuscus_) in Washington State.
4,828 rabid animals were identified in 1990; 6,910 in 1991; 8,589 in 1992;
9,377 in 1993; 8,224 in 1994; 7,881 in 1995 (92% of these wild animals);
6,600 in 1996; 3,620 first half of 1997.
Raccoons accounted for over 60% of animal rabies (5,912 rabid raccoons) in
1993; and 50. 3% in 1995. Raccoon rabies originated in the Southeast
during the 1950's, with subsequent spread as far south as North Carolina
and as far north as New Hampshire. As of 1996, cases are reported in West
Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, District of Colombia, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, North Carolina, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont and Ohio (the latter first reported in
1996).
The skunk predominates in the central states and California; the grey fox
(_Urocyon cinereoargenteus_) and coyote (_Canis latrans_) in parts of
West-Central and Southern Texas. In 1996, bats accounted for 34% of rabies
in Texas, and skunks for 22%.
15 of 17 indigenously-acquired cases during 1990 to 1996 were from bats -
only one of these from a bite. 647 rabid bats were reported from 46 states
during 1992 the silver-haired bat (_Lasionycteris noctivagans_) is often
implicated. The bat is the only rabies reservoir in Washington State.
