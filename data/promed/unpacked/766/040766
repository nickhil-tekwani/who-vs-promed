[It has now been 28 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 2 incubation periods since the last locally acquired case was confirmed in Wuhan (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). Can we cautiously say that transmission has been interrupted in Wuhan? It has now been 38 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission was established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 24 days or so, albeit the numbers of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing and no newly confirmed cases were reported in the past 24 hours. The appearance of an occasional locally transmitted case in Inner Mongolia is also of concern for possible low level local transmission having been established there as well. While Inner Mongolia has a large border with Mongolia, there is also a smaller border shared with the Russian Federation where there is extensive transmission ongoing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 875 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 1 case in the 24 hours since yesterday's (30 Apr 2020) report. The newly reported cases is imported. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 2 newly confirmed cases reported after 4 days with no cases reported. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1671 imported cases identified (on 30 Apr 2020 there were 1680 imported cases mentioned).

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 20 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours. None were imported cases. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 989, and 112 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

- KCDC asked people to be especially careful this weekend regarding religious facilities and nightlife facilities:
-- KCDC recommends people to participate in religious functions via non-face-to-face methods such as online worship/meetings. Religious facilities that host on-site events must check people for fever, keep distance between people, require everyone to wear facemasks, and refrain from activities that may cause respiratory droplets to travel such as choir, shouting, or chanting;
-- people in high-risk groups (such as pregnant women, elderly aged 65 or older, people with chronic illness) should especially stay away from visiting enclosed spaces with a lot of people;
-- nightlife entertainment venues are also recommended to refrain from operating as much as possible. Such venues that remain operating must comply with infection prevention/control measures including checking people for fever or respiratory symptoms and disinfecting/ventilating thoroughly;
-- people are recommended to refrain from visiting any enclosed space with poor ventilation or any place that are frequented by a lot of people. People who cannot avoid visiting such enclosed/crowded places should keep at least 2 meters [6 ft] away from other people and keep their personal hygiene by wearing a facemask, avoiding handshakes, washing hands, and not touching their eyes/nose/mouth.

- KCDC also asked people to keep precautions for travel, outdoor activities with recent increase of travels, and outdoor activities.
[Before traveling]
-- do not travel or do outdoor activities if you have fever or respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, nasal congestion;
-- traveling should be done in small family units. Avoid group travel;
-- buy tickets online in advance rather than buying tickets on-site;
-- crowded destinations or crowded hours of destinations should be avoided.
[While traveling]
-- wash hands often. If there is no soap and water, use hand sanitizers;
-- cover your nose and mouth with your sleeve, tissue, or handkerchief, when you sneeze/cough.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 207 428 cases, including 28 236 deaths, up from 205 463 cases and 27 967 deaths reported on 30 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 30 Apr 2020 and 1 May 2020 was 1965 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1872 newly confirmed cases between 29 Apr 2020 and 30 Apr 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline.

Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 75.2% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 37.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont, 1 other province (Liguria) has reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 4 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 10 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes will be on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 95 646 total cases, 6091 deaths

https://menafn.com/1100102512/Iran-reports-63-virus-deaths-as-daily-death-rate-drops


Iran on Friday [1 May 2020] announced 63 new deaths from the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2], saying the rate of fatalities and infections were dropping while calling on the public to remain vigilant. The deaths recorded in the past 24 hours brought to 6091 the overall toll from the illness in the Middle East's hardest-hit country.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 1006 people tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. "We have seen drops in the numbers of infections and deaths in recent days,"

Jahanpour said on state television. "The process of managing the disease is continuing," he added. Jahanpour expressed hope that Iran would get close to "controlling" the outbreak with people observing health protocols.

The new infections brought to 95 646 the number recorded in the Islamic republic since it announced its 1st cases in mid-February [2020]. More than 76 300 of those had already been released from hospital after recovering. Of those still being treated, 2899 were in critical condition.

Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi said 116 of Iran's 434 counties have been given the all clear which might lead to the reopening of religious, cultural and sport centres, state news agency IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency] reported. But the outbreak had worsened in some provinces, including Mazandaran on the Caspian Sea coast. IRNA said the number of infections in the popular tourist spot had spiked in the past day after 2 weeks of downward trajectory.

Iran has shut schools, universities, cinemas, and stadiums among other public spaces since March [2019] to contain the spread of the virus. But it has allowed a phased reopening of its economy and lifted restrictions on intercity travel since [11 Apr 2020].

Mosques remain closed even as Muslims observe the fasting month of Ramadan [23 Apr 2020-23 May 2020]

[In the 24 hours from 30 Apr to 1 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 94 640 to 95 646, an increase of 1006 compared with 983 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (30 Apr 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6028 to 6091, an increase of 63 deaths in the 24-hour period (as of 1 May 2020). In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran now ranks 9th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, and Russia, having surpassed China. As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 131 280, including 65 766 deaths, an increase from 1 095 210 cases and 63 861 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 315 222 (27.9%) cumulative case reports and 4383 (12.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City had a cumulative total of 164 505 as of 1:00 PM on 1 May 2020, including 13 000 confirmed deaths and an additional 5231 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (3137 -- 8.7% of total), New Jersey (2538 -- 7.0%), Massachusetts (2106 -- 5.8%), Massachusetts (2106 -- 5.8%), Pennsylvania (1643 -- 4.6%), and Texas (1438 -- 4.0%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Texas, and Connecticut.

Repeating from yesterday (1 May 2020), more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, New Jersey, Russia, and Iran as number 10. Number 11 would be Brazil, 12 China, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Canada, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Illinois, 15 Canada, 16 California, 17 Pennsylvania, 18 Belgium, 19 Peru, and 20 Netherlands. 7 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City would be between Germany and France.

The US military has confirmed 7145 cumulative cases, with 183 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 9015 cumulative cases and 404 new cases today (1 May 2020). There have been 2185 cases reported from federal prisons (144 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 2141 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (164 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1575 cases (36 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available. That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 1175 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 215 216 [242 988] as compared with 213 435 PCR [239 639] confirmed cases yesterday (30 Apr 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 63.78, a continual slow decrease over the past 24 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 63.78 today (30 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 215 216 [242 988] cases, approximately 117 393 (54.5%) [48.3%] -- an additional 732 cases have been hospitalized and 10 860 (5.0%) [4.5%] an additional 84 cases were admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7290672,43. Catalonia, Castile and Leon, and La Rioja are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon and neighboring La Rioja are located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. - Mod.MPP]

[The Congo DR is in the midst of an escalating epidemic. As of 1 May 2020, there have been a total of 604 cases including 32 deaths and 7 recoveries. As cases outside of Kinshasa have been reported a while ago, one suspects there may be more transmission ongoing in those areas than is captured by the surveillance activities. North Kivu and Ituri are areas with ongoing Ebola transmission and areas of civil unrest with armed conflicts further complicating prevention and case finding activities. This surveillance bulletin is distributed daily by the MOH.

For a map of the Congo DR showing provinces, see https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Administrative-map-of-the-DRC-including-26-new-provinces-and-bordering-countries_fig1_333302653. 3 of the 4 "corners" of the country have reported cases., with the major outbreaks occurring within the capital city and region (Kinshasa).
