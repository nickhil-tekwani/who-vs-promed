Kenya's health ministry will launch a 2-week vaccination campaign against measles targeting 1.2 million children aged between 9 months and 5 years.

It follows an outbreak in 7 counties where 90% of children below 5 years have missed out on the 2-dose vaccine.

The ongoing drought has made it difficult for health workers to give children this life-saving vaccine, due to the movement of people from one place to another in search of food and water.

The ministry has not disclosed how many cases and deaths have been reported, but is urging parents and guardians to ensure their children get vaccinated to contain the outbreak.

Measles is a highly contagious disease characterised by a high fever and a rash. The vaccination coverage has steadily declined globally since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The campaign will begin on Friday [9 Dec 2022] and end on 18 Dec 2022.

Limpopo province reports more measles cases
-------------------------------------------
The MEC for Health in Limpopo, Dr. Phophi Ramathuba, has advised parents, guardians, and caregivers to remain vigilant as more positive laboratory-confirmed measles are confirmed in the province.

According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, between 1 Sep 2022 and 30 Nov 2022, 77 laboratory-confirmed measles cases were reported in the province. The most affected districts are Greater Sekhukhune district with 27 cases, Mopani district with 30 cases, and Waterberg district with 14 cases. The other 2 districts, Capricorn and Vhembe, reported 4 and 2 positive cases, respectively.

The ages of people with measles ranged from 3 months to 42 years. The most affected age group is school-going children between the ages of 5 and 9 years. Three laboratory-confirmed measles cases were hospitalised and no measles deaths have been reported yet. Of the laboratory-confirmed measles cases, 53 had unknown vaccination histories, 12 did not receive any measles vaccine doses, 10 were fully immunised with 2 doses, and 2 were partially immunised with 1 dose.

Ramathuba said they have embarked on a vaccination campaign throughout the districts and next year [2023] when the schools reopen, they will visit schools to vaccinate learners. She further encouraged parents to be alert during the festive season as they will be moving around to different areas. She said those that have already been vaccinated are also advised to get boosters as a safety measure. Measles patients present with fever, rash, and one or more symptoms such as a cough, red eyes, and runny nose.

Complications of measles include pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, encephalitis, blindness, and death. Measles complications are especially severe in malnourished children and infants under 2 years of age. Persons of any age who are not vaccinated can contract measles and develop the disease.

[3] Global threat of measles

Ancient Pathogen Is 'Imminent Threat' in Every Part of The World, WHO Warns
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
One consequence of the pandemic was reduced access to routine healthcare and lower uptake of immunisations. As a result, in November 2022, the World Health Organization declared measles to be an "imminent threat in every region of the world".

They described how a record number of nearly 40 million children had missed at least one measles vaccine dose in 2021.

Measles is a viral respiratory illness. Transmission is similar to COVID, with the spread between people being driven by respiratory droplets and aerosols (airborne transmission). The infection produces a rash and fever in mild cases.

But severe cases can include encephalitis (brain swelling), blindness, and pneumonia. There are approximately 9 million cases a year and 128 000 deaths.

The measles vaccine, which can be administered by itself or in combination with other vaccinations such as mumps and rubella to make up the MMR immunisation, is very effective.

Most countries have a 2-dose schedule, with the 1st jab usually given at 12 months of age, and the 2nd dose when the child is 4 years old.

The vaccine provides very high and long-lasting protection, and really is a model example of the term "vaccine-preventable disease". The 2-dose schedule gives about 99% protection against measles infection.

In developing countries where vaccine uptake is low, as many as 1 in 10 who get measles, die from it. In developed countries, deaths are overwhelmingly in unvaccinated people at a rate of around one in 1000 to 5000 measles cases.

The potential for new outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in areas such as conflict zones and among refugee populations is high.

Problems such as malnutrition greatly raise the risks of severe illness, and respiratory infectious diseases are a huge concern for humanitarian groups supporting vulnerable groups such as Ukrainian refugees.

Measles is incredibly infectious. Its basic reproduction number (R0) -- that is, how many people on average an infected person will go on to infect in a susceptible population -- is estimated to be between 12 and 18. For comparison, the R0 of the omicron COVID variant is thought to be around 8.2.

The proportion of a population that needs to be vaccinated to keep outbreaks under control and to minimise onward transmission around a community is known as the herd immunity threshold (HIT).

For measles, vaccine coverage of 95% is typically considered to be the HIT magic number.

Most of the world is some way below that threshold, with global coverage of around 71% for 2 doses, and 81% for one dose coverage. In the UK, 2021-22 data shows that 89% of children had received 1 measles vaccine dose.

Globally, there has been significant progress in reducing deaths from all causes in children under the age of 5. Annual deaths declined from 12.5 million in 1990 to 5.2 million in 2019. However, low vaccine coverage could reverse those gains.

Even if children survive measles, there is a possibility of long-term damage to their immune system, described as a "form of immune amnesia". In unvaccinated populations, a severe case of measles resulted in an average loss of 40% of antibodies that would normally recognise germs.

After a mild case of measles, unvaccinated children lost 33% of those antibodies. By comparison, measurements in healthy control populations indicated an antibody loss of 10% over similar or longer durations.

Misinformation is rife
----------------------
Anti-vaccine advocacy has driven false rumours and scare stories, such as the fake claims by former physician and anti-vaccine activist Andrew Wakefield that the MMR vaccine causes autism.

This belief persists. For example, a US population survey in 2020 found: "18% of our respondents mistakenly state that it is very or somewhat accurate to say that vaccines cause autism."

Misinformation since the start of the COVID pandemic has been extensive. And there is a risk of this misinformation further translating into greater levels of hesitancy and vaccine refusal for routine immunisation.

Measles spreads easily and is a severe infection in the short- and long-term in unvaccinated populations. There is a great need for immunisation campaigns to increasingly protect against vaccine-preventable diseases, across the globe.

The need is particularly urgent in developing countries and among other vulnerable populations such as refugees and areas of conflict.

[Misinformation is rampant and growing for all vaccines. The advice below was given by CDC for addressing COVID misinformation but equally applies to measles. Developing an effective vaccine is only the 1st step in protecting the population from infectious diseases. Without successful distribution and uptake of the vaccine, herd immunity is difficult to obtain.

"Strategies for addressing ... vaccine misinformation in your community:

"Listen to and analyze misinformation circulating in your community through social and traditional media monitoring. This can include monitoring social media channels and traditional media outlets for misinformation and creating a log of that misinformation to identify trends in your area. This can help you understand where, when, why, and how misinformation is spreading in your community.

"Engage with and listen to your community to identify and analyze perceptions, content gaps, information voids, and misinformation.

"Share accurate, clear, and easy-to-find information that addresses common questions. This can be done through your website, social media, and other places your audience looks for health information. Also use methods to reach those with limited or no internet access, such as radio or community events. Share details, including addresses and hours, about local vaccination sites and events with community-based organizations and local media.

"Use trusted messengers to boost credibility and the likelihood of being seen and believed over misinformation. Some people may not trust public health professionals or visit the health department website, so it's more effective to reach them through the channels and sources they look to and trust for health information, such as religious leaders or community organizations."
