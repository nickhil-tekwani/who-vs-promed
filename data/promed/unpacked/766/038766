The potential risks or benefit of vaccinia immunization, like any vaccine,
should be weighed against a traveller's relative risk of exposure to
monkeypox. The recent outbreak indicates that the rate of person-to-person
transmission of monkeypox (constituting 70% of cases) is significantly
greater than previous reports, probably attributable to a population with
declining vaccinia immunity. Successful vaccinia virus immunization, as
judged by the presence of a preexisting vaccination scar, affords
approximately 85% protection against monkeypox.
If a traveller to Zaire remains in Kinshasa, I suspect that he/she will be
more at risk from stray bullets from the civil war than from poxviruses.
However, if he/she will be involved in the trapping of squirrels (the
principal animal reservoir of the virus) or medical care in the Kasai
Oriental region, I would suggest that vaccination should be given strong
consideration. It is correct to point out that vaccination does carry the
risk of adverse reactions, as documented by the Centers for Disease Control
in 1968. However, some of these adverse reactions (e.g., secondary
inoculation) would be less common among adults who have a measure of residual
vaccinia immunity and would have a "secondary or accelerated take"
(vaccination of infants/toddlers gradually ceased in the U.S. circa 1971-72),
and who could practice better contact precautions than the toddlers who
constituted the majority of primary vaccinees during the 1960's. The
contraindications to vaccination should be carefully noted: pregnancy;
altered immunocompetence, HIV infection, history of eczema or presence of
other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin disease. Furthermore, vaccinia
should not be administered to persons who have household contacts with any of
the aforementioned conditions.
In the U.S., requests for Wyeth Dryvax (the remaining licensed vaccinia
vaccine in this country) should be addressed to the CDC Drug Service D-09,
1600 Clifton Rd, Atlanta, GA 30333, (404) 639-3670.
This experience with Wyeth (Dryvax) and other vaccinia vaccines of similar
nature indicates that reactions for persons receiving their first smallpox
vaccination notably included accidental secondary inoculation (of the virus
to other sites on oneself or to other persons, occurring ~6/10,000
vaccinations), and generalized vaccinia (viremic dissemination to produce
skin and mucous membrane lesions away from the primary vaccination site,
~3/10,000 vaccinations). Serious and life-threatening complications
included: eczema vaccinatum (spread of virus from the vaccination site to
skin previously affected by eczema or other chronic skin disorder, resulting
in severe skin inflammation, with a rate of ~30/1 million vaccinations);
postvaccinial encephalitis (< 9/1 million vaccinations); and vaccinia necrosum
(progressive tissue necrosis at the inoculation site with spread of the virus
throughout the skin and internal organs, occurring < 2/1 million
vaccinations). The latter complication occurred almost exclusively in
persons with underlying defects in their immune system.
