Since mid-November 2014, congenital malformations in newborn lambs have been observed in a flock of Mutton Merino sheep in northern Israel. The flock, which counts about 1800 ewes, is kept in pasture year round, except 2 autumn months when the sheep are kept indoors, fed with commercial feed mixture. During the later summer months of 2014, several clinical bluetongue (BT) cases were seen in the flock. This disease had been seen every year in the said flock with varying morbidity rates. The (synchronized) reproduction program of the flock comprises 2 seasons: spring lambing season and autumn lambing season.

The malformed lambs were born dead with arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly (AH) changes. As of 11 Dec 2014, 437 out of nearly 650 ewes currently in pregnancy have already lambed. Malformations have been seen in the offspring of 48 (11 percent) of them, affecting one or more of a ewe's progeny. In total, 602 lambs have been born so far, of which 58 (8.7 percent) were born dead and malformed.

The following materials from the affected flock have been sent to the laboratory: affected dead lambs, placentae and blood samples collected from the respective affected ewes.

In residual brain tissue of one lamb, the Shuni virus was identified.

[The above data were reported to "Hachaklait" by the flock's attending practitioner, Motti Valdman, DVM].

[Though the above is preliminary and very partial information, the issue seems to justify posting in view of the possibility that another member of the Simbu serogroup, Orthobunyavirus genus, Bunyaviridae family may join viruses such as Akabane and Schmallenberg as having veterinary and (potentially) public health implications, while its spatial dimensions, vectors and hosts are, in broad terms, yet to be identified. The identity of the laboratory/ies and researchers involved, the diagnostic methods applied and details on the exclusion of other possible etiological agents of AH in sheep (e.g., Akabane virus) are requested.

The following introduction to a 2013 paper (Ref 1) conveniently serves as a concise review on Shuni virus:

"Shuni virus (SHUV) was 1st isolated in 1966 from a cow in Sokoto, Nigeria during a surveillance program for the study of viral infections that was instituted by the University of Ibadan between 1964 and 1969. During the course of the survey SHUV was also isolated twice again from cattle and once from a sheep and neutralizing antibodies being found in dairy, trade cattle as well as sheep. SHUV was also twice
isolated from _Culicoides_ ssp. during field surveillance. A single human isolation of SHUV was reported from a one and a half year old child at the General Outpatients Clinic at the University College Hospital (UCHGOP) in August 1966, as part of the arbovirus surveillance initiative in Nigeria.

"In South Africa, SHUV was recovered twice from pools of _Culex theileri_ mosquitoes caught near Johannesburg and from 7 apparently healthy cattle and a goat in Natal between the years 1970 and 1979. In 1977, the virus was isolated from the brains of 2 horses with nervous disease submitted for rabies virus examination; one from South Africa and one from Zimbabwe. Considering the public and veterinary health importance of other members of the Orthobunyavirus genus, surprisingly little attention was placed on uncovering the role SHUV may play in encephalitic disease in humans and animals. The identification of SHUV in 7 horses with neurological symptoms between June 2009 and December 2010, led us to believe that this virus may play a noteworthy role in neurological disease in South Africa" (the references have been omitted; to retrieve them, please go to the original).

We wish to express gratefulness and pay tribute to "Hachaklait" personnel for the transparency characterising their work. Background on this unique organisation is available at http://www.hachaklait.org.il/english/Hachaklait%20Veterinary%20Services%20LTD-%20Promo.pdf.
