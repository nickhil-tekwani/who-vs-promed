Even as West Bengal is combatting an outbreak of dengue, the state also has another bacterial disease on its plate to battle: scrub typhus. Over 30 people in Bankura have been affected by scrub typhus in the past month.

A type of mite-borne infectious disease, it has symptoms which are similar to chikungunya and dengue -- fever, headache and muscle pain -- which make it all the harder for doctors to diagnose.

This mite-borne disease is transmitted to humans from the bite of an infected chigger (pest or bug) and can lead to death if untreated.

Generally, the bugs that are responsible for transmitting the disease in humans are found in grassy fields, bushes, gardens, parks or lakes and streams. According to experts, these bugs are so small (0.3 millimeters) that they are actually invisible. These baby chiggers [actually larvae], part of the Trombiculidae family, are red, orange, yellow or straw coloured. Their bites leave a black mark [called an eschar] on patients.

"In the past 2 months, many patients suffering from scrub typhus have been admitted to the hospital as they are suffering from this disease. If proper intervention is not taken at an early stage, it may lead to death. We have conducted blood tests on around 70 suspected scrub typhus cases," says Dr Partha Pratim Pradhan, the medical superintendent of Bankura Sammilani Medical College.

Senior doctors at SSKM Hospital in Kolkata say that a blood test is the 1st thing to be administered if patients are suffering from high fever coupled with muscle pain for over 2 days. After that, antibiotics need to be prescribed, as in an acute case, the patient may be afflicted by respiratory issues. If untreated, scrub typhus can lead to multi-organ failure.

Dr Manotosh Guin, a senior doctor of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), said: "The commonest symptom of scrub [typhus] is fever with headache. On Monday [30 Oct 2017], we admitted 2 patients from Deganga in North 24 Parganas suffering from similar symptoms."
