A new and deadly brain fever is stalking eastern Uttar Pradesh. Since
January [2007], it has affected more than 1450 people of which 320
have died. The outbreak refuses to recede since peaking in the
monsoon season, with 250 deaths having taken place since August [2007].

Unlike Japanese encephalitis (JE) which has ravaged the region in
recent years, this form of encephalitis is caused by an entero virus
[meaning a specific enterovirus or an enteric virus? - Mod.CP]
transmitted through water and food contaminated with faeces rather
than through mosquitoes. And while JE just attacks the brain, this
virus -- being referred to as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) --
can affect any system. "AES can hit the heart, kidney, liver, lungs,
the GI [gastrointestinal] tract, or the brain. The system that is
affected differs from case to case," Dr A K Rathi, head of the
department of paediatrics at Gorakhpur's Baba Raghav Das Medical
College, told the Times of India. Children have been the worst
victims accounting for 237 of the deaths so far. "The new entero
virus is like a sister virus of polio with the same route of
transmission. Water supply and sanitation will be the key in
controlling this disease," he added.

And that's where the problem lies. While JE, which claimed 1000 lives
in 2005, could be contained by controlling mosquitoes, AES demands
good personal and community hygiene -- something that's difficult in
these parts. The virus lives in the digestive tract and spreads when
faecal matter of an infected person gets mixed with water and food.
There's no vaccine against AES.

"It's similar to a virus found in Bangladesh in 1976. Though the
death rate is slightly less than that of JE, it causes longer
hospitalisation and can lead to multi-organ failure. It is a huge
drain on resources," explained Dr K P Kushwaha, senior paediatrician
in BDR Medical College, Gorakhpur. The worst affected are areas
surrounding Gorakhpur, including the districts of Maharajganj,
Kushinagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Siddarth Nagar, and Azamgarh. Patients
are also pouring in from adjoining districts of Bihar -- West
Champaran, Siwan, and Gopalganj.

Dr Rathi said children's low immunity made them very susceptible to
the disease. "Most patients are between 6 months to 10 years of age,
though some older children too have been infected." And, there are no
signs of the cases dropping off after peaking in August and September
[2007]. "Though its getting cooler, October has already seen 87
deaths. Unless things improve soon, it could turn out to be worse
than September when 111 died of AES," explained Dr Rathi. The October
toll has since risen to 102, with 15 more deaths -- all children --
being reported in the past 4 days alone, Dr Kushwaha added. He said
that there is no specific treatment for AES: "If a child's kidneys
are affected we treat it like a case of renal failure; if it's the
liver, it is treated like a hepatic failure case, and so on."

The disease seems to be on the rise. "We saw just a few cases in
2004, then a few hundreds in 2005, about 1000 in 2006, and this year
[2007] we have seen more than 1400 cases. And these are just the
cases coming to the medical college," Dr Kushwaha said.

[The identity of the viral agent designated AES (acute encephalitis
syndrome) is obscure. The term AES defines a heterogeneous medical
condition and does not identify a specific infectious agent.

Japanese encephalitis virus infection, which has been prevalent in
the state for several years, seems to have been discounted in favour
of an unidentified agent transmitted by an enteric route, although on
what basis is not revealed. There has been no positive identification
or exclusion of any one of the many common enteric viruses that might
be responsible for AES (hepatitis A, hepatitis E, various
coxsackieviruses, human enteroviruses, and others) either singly or
in combination. It is implied obliquely (by reference to an
unspecified outbreak in Bangladesh) that a more exotic agent
(perhaps a henipavirus) might be involved. The outbreak of AES in
Uttar Pradesh appears to be a very serious event and an increasing
problem, which deserves proper virological investigation. It is to be
hoped that this will be undertaken promptly and the outcome
communicated widely.
