More dead fish were netted yesterday from the Pocomoke River, apparently
killed by the organism was implicated in two major fish kills in the
Eastern Shore river last month, officials said.
It was unclear whether yesterday's fish kill was due to Pfiesteria
piscicida or a continuation of last week's fish kill from the microbe that
left 2,000 or more fish dead from Aug. 26 to Aug. 29, said DNR spokesman
John Surrick. The Pocomoke's first major fish kill was Aug. 6 to 9, when
10,000 or more fish died. "It appears we have a continuing low-level
problem," Surrick said. He said Natural Resources officials would continue
monitoring the river and would consult with health officials.
It appeared yesterday's fish deaths were confined to the part of the river
closed by Glendening's order Friday, Surrick said.
