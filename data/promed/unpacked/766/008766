Through a collaborative investigation with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), a total of 5 ill persons infected with a strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Hartford matching an outbreak strain in Canada have been identified through PulseNet in 5 USA states. This strain of _S._ Hartford has never been seen before in PulseNet. Initial interviews with ill persons suggested a link to the ongoing _S._ Newport outbreak investigation in the USA. These illnesses have been combined with the existing _S._ Newport infections previously identified as part of this investigation.

As of 2 Jun 2014, a total of 17 ill persons infected with the outbreak strains of _S._ Newport (12 persons) or _S._ Hartford (5 persons) have been reported from 10 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (1), California (2), Connecticut (2), Ohio (1), Florida (1), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (1), New York (4), Utah (1), and Wisconsin (3).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 21 Jan 2014 to 5 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 4 years to 81 years, with a median age of 51 years. 65 percent of ill persons are female. Among 13 ill persons with available information, 2 (15 percent) report being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation update
--------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback findings have linked this outbreak of salmonellosis to various brands of organic sprouted chia powder. In interviews, ill persons are answering questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before becoming ill. To date, 12 (100 percent) of 12 persons interviewed reported eating chia seeds or powder, and 9 (75 percent) of 12 persons reported eating chia powder specifically.

On 28 May 2014, Navitas Naturals recalled products that contain organic sprouted chia powder due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination. The recalled products include Navitas Naturals Organic Sprouted Chia Powder, Navitas Naturals Omega Blend Sprouted Smoothie Mix, and Williams-Sonoma Omega 3 Smoothie Mixer. The recalled products are available for purchase in many retail stores and online.

On 30 May 2014, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) notified consumers that Advantage Health Matters and Back 2 the Garden recalled various products containing sprouted chia seed powder due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination. These products are sold under the brand names Organic Traditions and Back 2 the Garden and are available for purchase online by consumers in the USA.

Several samples of leftover organic sprouted chia powder from ill persons' homes and unopened packages from retail locations are being tested for the presence of _Salmonella_ bacteria. Results of this testing are pending and will be released when they become available.

CDC, state, local, and Canadian public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. The FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and other partners in this investigation.

[Chia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica) -- plant name _Salvia hispanica_ -- is grown commercially for its seed, a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, since the seeds yield 25-30 percent extractable oil, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Of total fat, the composition of the oil can be 55 percent omega-3, 18 percent omega-6, 6 percent omega-9, and 10 percent saturated fat. Chia seeds are typically small ovals with a diameter of about 1 mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored with brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous gel-like coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive texture.
