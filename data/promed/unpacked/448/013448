A total of 20 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium have been reported from 8 states. Since the last update, 4 cases have been reported from Illinois (1), Ohio (1), Minnesota (1), and Washington (1).

Among those who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between 26 Dec 2011 and 31 Dec 2012. Cases range in age from less than 1 year to 91 years [median 13 years]. 45 per cent of cases are 10 years of age or younger and 55 per cent are female. Four of the 13 cases with available information (31 per cent) have been hospitalized. 1 death associated has been reported in Washington State.

Illnesses that occurred after 4 Jan 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

In interviews, cases answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. 14 of 15 (93 per cent) interviewed reported contact with hedgehogs or their environments before becoming ill. Some specifically mentioned contact with African Pygmy hedgehogs. Investigations are ongoing to determine the type and source of hedgehogs that might be linked with illness. Cases with available purchase information reported buying pet hedgehogs from multiple breeders in several states.

The United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) Animal Care is currently conducting traceback investigations of hedgehogs purchased from USDA-licensed breeders linked to cases. In addition, state health departments have tested environmental and hedgehog samples collected from the homes of cases. The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was isolated from a Minnesota environmental sample of a container and sink in which a pet hedgehog was bathed. The outbreak strain was also isolated from a 2nd hedgehog purchased after the 1st hedgehog and case-patient in Minnesota became ill.

[Since ProMED-mail's last posting regarding this outbreak, there have been 6 more cases in 2 more states and 1 death has been reported.

A hedgehog (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog) is any of the spiny mammals of the subfamily Erinaceinae and the order Erinaceomorpha. There are 17 species of hedgehog in 5 genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand (by introduction). There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with shrews (order Soricidae), with gymnures possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years. Hedgehogs' spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent porcupines and monotreme echidnas.

The name hedgehog came into use around the year 1450, derived from the Middle English heyghoge, from heyg, hegge ("hedge"), because it frequents hedgerows, and hoge, hogge ("hog"), from its piglike snout. Other names include urchin, hedgepig, and furze-pig.
