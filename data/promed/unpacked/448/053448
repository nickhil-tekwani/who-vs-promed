A new strain of potato blight, which could have reduced sensitivity to a popular fungicide, has been identified in the UK for the 1st time. The strain "Green 33" was previously found in the Netherlands.

"How it has arrived is open to debate, but its most likely source was from seed [tubers], or it travelled via wind across the channel," said David Cooke of the James Hutton Institute. "It was found in volunteer [self-sown] potato plants in Norfolk quite late in the season, so we don't yet know how widespread it may be."

"Green 33" had shown reduced sensitivity to fluazinam in field trials and increased aggressiveness, although the cause of this was not yet known, said Dr Cooke. "Fluazinam was less effective against Green 33 when compared with [strain] 'Blue 13,' although that was in a very high disease pressure environment with long spray intervals," explained Dr Cooke. "It [Green 33] is not yet established and is still under investigation."

"Blue 13," an A2-mating type, was less prevalent in 2011, being found in less than 10 percent of the UK population, compared with over 50 percent in 2010. Instead, an A1 strain known as "Pink 6" was dominant. It represented over 75 percent of the 426 isolates tested.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers, and in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material (potato seed tubers, tomato transplants), and fungicide sprays of crops. Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide, and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries as an important part of PLB management.

Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, increasing the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses developing.

In the UK and Ireland, the new, particularly aggressive A2 strain Blue 13, with resistances to some widely used fungicides, is spreading (ProMED-mail posts 20090406.1332 and 20100212.0505). The A1 strain Pink 6 seems to have emerged in the UK in 2009 and has also spread to Ireland (ProMED-mail post 20100604.1851).

It has been reported that regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist in Europe, where strains like Blue 13 and Pink 6 are now dominating. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB outbreaks in the future. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Fluazinam is a preventative fungicide from the pyridinamine group that was introduced in the 1990s and established itself for the control of PLB. It has a multi-site mode of action and has strong persistence of effect against the pathogen. It can suppress secondary infection in the field through inhibition of sporulation. Until the emergence of the new strain Green 33, no fluazinam resistance was known in blight populations.
